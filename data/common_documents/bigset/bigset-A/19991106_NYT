GUNMAN MAY HAVE MISSED TARGET

<P>
   SEATTLE _ The shipyard gunman never saw the face of the man
seated in the swivel chair. He pulled out a pistol and fired five
quick shots. Peter John Giles died in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   The shooter pivoted to his left and fired twice through the
corner of a tall metal filing cabinet. The force threw Russell
Brisendine into a window, where the mortally wounded electrician
sagged over the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the gunman pointed his weapon toward the far corner of the
small office, where a fisherman leaned back in a chair. One bullet
hit the 58-year-old man in the torso. He feigned death, falling to
his face on the gritty tile floor.
</P>
<P>
   A second later, as if an afterthought, the gunman fired a final
round at the 19-year-old clerk seated just to his right. The bullet
shattered the man's arm.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen seconds later, the gunman vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, for the first time since Wednesday's shooting,
detectives described in detail how the incident unfolded. They
based their account on interviews and forensic evidence taken from
the crime scene, including powder burns and dropped shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   And they revealed that the elusive shooter may have missed his
intended target: The man, they said, may have been gunning for the
person who usually sat at in the swivel chair centered in the tiny
bookkeeping office of Northlake Shipyards.
</P>
<P>
   As the search for the gunman enters its fourth day, police plan
to interview Giles' uncles, Peter and Richard Kelly Jr., who own
the shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were vacationing at the time of the shootings.
Police talked to them over the telephone, but will interview them
more extensively on their return home, Officer Carmen Best said.
</P>
<P>
   Did the gunman mean to kill one of the owners, who usually
occupied the center desk where Giles was sitting at 10:30 a.m.
Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a theory we're checking out,'' Homicide Det. Dick Gagnon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman walked through the front door of the Northlake
Shipyard building, at 1441 N. Northlake Way, then passed several
offices on his way to a tiny bookkeeping office.
</P>
<P>
   Two steps inside he stopped and aimed a 9mm semi-automatic
handgun toward the back of a big swivel chair about 5 feet ahead of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Giles, 27, sat in the chair, talking.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the carnage began, the shipyard shooter placidly
retraced his steps down the labrynthine hallway to the main
entrance of the nondescript, two-story shipyard building, and
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you this whole thing took 15 seconds,'' said Gagnon, one
of two veteran investigators heading the manhunt for the killer.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, investigators are continuing to wade through
hundreds of tips and more than a dozen of eyewitness accounts of
the shooting. As of last night, police had interviewed and cleared
a handful of ``persons of interest'' during their search for the
killer.
</P>
<P>
   The leads have been daunting, said Ed Joiner, Assistant Chief of
Operations, as have media requests for information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the national interest that this is getting, we're
getting just deluged by calls, and quite frankly it is having an
impact the ability of the detectives to follow up people and get
the work done,'' Joiner said at a hastily called afternoon news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   During the press conference, Joiner defended the police
department from ``rumors'' about how it handled the shooting
incident in the crucial hours before the manhunt trail cooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the information that I'm aware of, I think the
response to the scene was outstanding,'' Joiner said. ``We had 14
officers from the first watch that were on the scene in a matter of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had traffic units respond, we had SPU, Guardian One was in
the air in a very short period of time. So we had an awful lot of
officers flood that area very quickly. By early that afternoon, we
had somewhere between 90 and 100 officers in the area looking for
the suspect,'' Joiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified gunman, who vanished into the Wallingford
neighborhood after the shootings, remained at large last night.
</P>
<P>
   Police expected to complete a composite sketch over the weekend,
Joiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old fisherman from Seattle and the 19-year-old man
who started working at Northlake two days before the attack were
recuperating from gunshot wounds at Harborview Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokesman Larry Zalin said the shipyard employee might
be released by this morning after being treated for an arm wound.
</P>
<P>
   The fisherman, shot in the chest with a 9 mm bullet, remained at
Harborview in satisfactory condition last night after a close brush
with death.

ON A BIG NIGHT FOR HOUSTON, SPREWELL GETS A SAVE AS KNICKS TOP
PISTONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ It was late in the fourth quarter when
Latrell Sprewell ducked his head into the tense moments of Allan
Houston's revival at the Palace and made sure the night ended with
a firm ``Hallelujah!''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' victory and Houston's successful return to the
birthplace of his pro career were saved as quickly as Sprewell
could dart in front of Detroit's Grant Hill, steal a pass and fly
to the other end of the court for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, with the Knicks once-gaudy 22-point lead down to
seven, Sprewell broke the tension with 2 minutes 40 seconds left in
the game. While Houston gathered all of his 29 points through three
quarters of seamless release that unfurled one arcing jumper after
another, Sprewell spent most of his time looking to feed him the
ball. But then someone _ anyone _ had to step forward in the fourth
quarter to stop the Pistons' surge.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell scored six of his 13 points in the final three minutes
of the game to leave the Knicks with a 103-91 victory Friday night.
Sprewell displayed the kind of team concept _ stepping in when
another teammate was falling off _ that has lifted the Knicks'
record to 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really a big play Latrell made,'' coach Jeff Van
Gundy said, referring to Sprewell's steal. ``At that time, they
were scrambling. Latrell just showed very good anticipation. It was
a seven-point game, and then it was nine, so that was big.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and company needed to come through. Houston spent most
of the fourth quarter in foul trouble and on the bench. That meant
Marcus Camby (19 points and 13 rebounds) and Larry Johnson (13
points) needed to help finish off a game that the Knicks, and
especially Houston, started with dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got more enjoyment out of us coming through with a win than
by silencing the crowd,'' said Houston, who finished the game with
10-of-13 shooting from the floor. Houston's former teammate, Hill,
ended the night with a burst, scoring 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks came onto the floor with the enthusiasm of a high
school football team bursting through a banner. They were running
the floor as if it were recess, rebounding with intensity and
moving the ball to the design of a crisp plan that left the Pistons
looking lost in their own home.
</P>
<P>
   It was Houston who was right at home. This used to be his
playground, his team, his floor to share with Grant Hill. As the
game progressed, Houston looked more familiar with the Palace's
layout than anyone else. He knew his favorite spots and let his
game fly.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ghosts haunted him here in the first three years after
his decision to leave the Pistons for New York, they left the
building and gave their space to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter who was guarding him, Hill or Jud Buechler.
Houston was driving, leaning and lifting jumpers into the air as he
scored 20 first-half points to lead the Knicks to a 56-40 lead. His
touch remained nearly flawless, and he had 29 points by the end of
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's assertiveness was just a slice of the Knicks'
relentless approach. This was the intensity Van Gundy had been
begging for just eight hours earlier as he stalked off the court,
his bottom lip pouting and his raccoon eyes boring a hole in the
wall ahead.
</P>
<P>
   He was done. No more nonsense, no more shoot-around. He had
walked out on his team's morning practice 30 minutes early.
Exasperated by the players' casual demeanor, fed up with their
complacent behavior, Van Gundy left the Knicks on their own.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain how many Knicks took Van Gundy seriously. Once
he left the court, several Knicks were spotted laughing and joking
as they took free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have often mishandled prosperity, saving their
intensity for desperate situations. Even if they rolled their eyes
at Van Gundy, they understood his concern, and it showed from
tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   There was not an ounce of complacency in the Knicks during their
frenetic start. They were working together, while the Pistons were
falling apart. Although Sprewell had just five first-half points,
he had four assists. Often, he was searching out his partner,
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Houston deadly on offense, he was part of the
Knicks' musical chairs defensive effort that held Hill to 3 for 10
in the first half. Without Hill's touch, the Pistons were stuck in
a futile game of one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks refused to relax in the third quarter. Before the
Pistons could turn around, they were down by 70-49 with six minutes
to go in the third quarter, and by 80-61 to start the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of this was Houston's doing. He used to be one of the
Pistons; now, after three years, he was showing just how much he
had developed without them.

HORSE OF THE YEAR MIGHT NOT BE APPARENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ However Bob Baffert's record chase and other
Breeders' Cup themes play out today, the sport might have a mess to
clean up when the eight races are over. And not just the piles of
losing parimutuel tickets on the floors of Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   If Behrens, the leading Horse of the Year contender, is beaten
in the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic, there might be no clear
choice for thoroughbred racing's top award, and the arguments could
stretch until racing writers' and executives' ballots are counted
in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very muddled,'' said D. Wayne Lukas, trainer of a record
13 Breeders' Cup winners and two Horses of the Year. ``I don't
think there'll be any way to sum it up until they run these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   If then.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends not only on how Behrens does but on the
performances of other Breeders' Cup entrants mentioned as Horse of
the Year candidates: Dubai World Cup winner Almutawakel,
claimer-turned Grade I-winner River Keen, Santa Anita Derby winner
General Challenge and Belmont Stakes winner Lemon Drop Kid (all in
the Classic), dominant 3-year-old filly Silverbulletday (Distaff)
and unbeaten 2-year-old filly Chilukki (Juvenile Fillies).
</P>
<P>
   Four of those _ River Keen, General Challenge, Silverbulletday
and Chilukki _ are among the eight horses Baffert will send out
today in quest of a record for victories by a trainer at a single
Breeders' Cup. Lukas set the record with three in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert avoided the Horse of the Year debate Friday morning as
he sat in a director's chair at his Gulfstream barn and pronounced
his horses ready for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't vote, so I'm not even worried about that,'' he said.
Perhaps he was being diplomatic, since his Breeders' Cup horses
have five different owners. But others had trouble putting the
matter into words, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse that wins (the Classic), more than likely could
easily be Horse of the Year,'' said Scotty Schulhofer, trainer of
Lemon Drop Kid, hedging just a little. ``It's a crapshoot right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates list reflects the fact that injuries and
retirements have robbed the sport and the Breeders' Cup of some of
1999's leading handicap runners (Victory Gallop, Free House, Silver
Charm, Real Quiet) and top 3-year-old (Kentucky Derby and Preakness
winner Charismatic, the only horse not competing today who still
has a shot at Horse of the Year).
</P>
<P>
   ++ Behrens (ridden by Jorge Chavez): If this 5-year-old wins the
title, he'll have mounted the least ambitious Horse of the Year
campaign by a member of the handicap division perhaps since
Ferdinand (1987) failed to win a stakes outside California.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens has won four of eight starts and finished second in the
other four. But he hasn't won a Grade I race since April and has
ventured no farther from his Saratoga base than Arkansas in order
to save energy for the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a model of consistency,'' said Jim Bond, who has been
training the son of Pleasant Colony at idyllic Payson Park, about
90 minutes away, and will van him to Gulfstream this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a dullard,'' said a Horse of the Year voter.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Almutawakel (Jerry Bailey): The Arab-owned 4-year-old won the
$5 million Dubai World Cup in March against some of America's best,
and although that's his only win in 1999 and overseas races aren't
supposed to count in the Horse of the Year equation, a victory
today in the world's !ital!second-richest race would make him hard
to deny.
</P>
<P>
   ++ River Keen (Chris Antley): The 6-year-old started the year as
a $100,000 claimer in California but won the New York's Woodward
and Jockey Club Gold Cup in his latest starts and looks to cap a
unique rise.
</P>
<P>
   ++ General Challenge (David Flores), ++ Lemon Drop Kid (Jose
Santos): Three-year-olds who ran 11th and ninth, respectively, in
the Kentucky Derby aren't award candidates except in a weak year
for older horses. They'd have to beat their elders in the Classic
today. General Challenge already did it in Del Mar's Pacific
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Silverbulletday (Bailey): Unbeaten in 11 straight against her
sex and age, the 3-year-old filly hasn't won outside her division,
normally a must for females seeking Horse of the Year. She'll need
an impressive Distaff victory and a Behrens defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Chilukki (Flores): Can a 2-year-old filly, even one who's 6
for 6, be Horse of the Year? Only if she wins and every other
contender gets trounced. Even then . . .
</P>
<P>
   ++ Charismatic: An afternoon of wacky results could send
sentimental voters to the ex-claimer who broke down while chasing
the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'd have to be that wacky,'' said Lukas,
Charismatic's trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Wacky is possible today. The 16th Breeders' Cup features
unusually contentious races, made all the more difficult to
forecast by three variables that have dominated backstretch banter
this week:
</P>
<P>
   __ The intention of Lukas and trainers Bobby Frankel and Joe
Orseno to use nose-strip breathing aids on their horses for the
first time, introducing a controversial if amusing handicapping
factor.
</P>
<P>
   __ Questions about how 16 Europe-prepped horses will respond to
the Florida climate after their predecessors went 0 for 28 in the
1989 and 1992 Breeders' Cups at Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
   __ Curiosity over whether Baffert, holding the strongest
Breeders' Cup hand ever, will be hot or cold or something in
between.
</P>
<P>
   The pick-six, with a guaranteed $5 million pool, looks like the
hardest puzzle of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Horse of the Year puzzle is a close second.

TROJANS HOPE FOX IS THE ANSWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sooner or later, a losing streak always ends.
Right?
</P>
<P>
   But when you're at ground zero of USC's longest stretch of
losses in eight years, it's impossible to predict what will happen
on Saturdays anymore.
</P>
<P>
   So will the Trojans end their four-game losing streak today
against Arizona State at the Coliseum?
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, I want to say yes, but you never know,'' cornerback
Kris Richard said. ``It's not going to end because we want it to.''
</P>
<P>
   That about sums up the Trojans' confidence these days, battered
by an 0-4 October that is now bringing comparisons to the six-game
losing streak USC suffered in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times we show flashes of greatness, and at times we're the
team with a 3-5 record,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, USC IS a team with a 3-5 record (1-4 in the Pacific-10
Conference). It's also a team desperately seeking some type of a
boost. The only remaining option, apparently, is a quarterback
change.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett has decided to start fifth-year senior
John Fox at quarterback against the Sun Devils (4-4, 3-2) and bench
junior Mike Van Raaphorst, who started five games after Carson
Palmer broke his collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``(John) brings a speed, quickness and athletic ability,''
Hackett said. ``He's a zeroed-in guy right now and we're delighted
he's prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said both quarterbacks will play, but it's clear that
Fox's insertion into the lineup is a gamble aimed at halting this
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about finding a way to get over the hump,'' Hackett said.
``We don't want to leave any bullets in the chamber. That includes
playing both quarterbacks, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is loath to making quarterback changes but finally
relented when offensive coordinator Hue Jackson recommended that
Fox replace Van Raaphorst at halftime last week against California.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Fox is thrilled to be back at starting
quarterback, a remarkable ascension after being buried at No. 4
quarterback 15 months ago and forced to try stints at tight end and
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Fox said. ``I was really, really hyper
earlier in the week, but I think I've settled down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox brings more leadership, better feet and a stronger arm than
Van Raaphorst. But he is considerably less accurate, the main
reason Van Raaphorst replaced him late in the '97 season. If he can
find his accuracy, Fox could do more than share the spot with Van
Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to get more accurate,'' Hackett said. ``He hasn't
played in a long, long time and we can't expect him to be accurate
and on the money.''
</P>
<P>
   One interesting aspect Fox demonstrated in last week's 17-7 loss
to Cal was an ability to find any open receiver, instead of merely
favoring leading receivers Windrell Hayes and Kareem Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Fox completed 12 passes to five different receivers, including
one to his former position, tight end, which has been little-used
in USC's offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tight end is a good position. It's a position not
covered enough,'' Fox said. ``It's a big target. I really don't
favor one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Hackett. He just wants to find a quarterback who
will win a game.

COLORADO DOMINATES WITH ITS POWER PLAY IN 4-1 WIN OVER RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Colorado Avalanche make it look easy. The New York
Rangers just don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche put on a power-play clinic Friday night on their
way to a methodical 4-1 victory at the Pepsi Center. The Rangers'
most glaring problem in this disappointing season _ the power play
_ was exposed again. If you are still counting at home, the
ineptitude has reached almost laughable proportions: 0 for 4 Friday
night, 0 for their last 26 and an astonishing 4 for 66, easily the
worst in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Rangers (0-5-2) have not won a game since Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche shook off a disputed goal by Theo Fleury, who left
Colorado via free agency this summer, to take the Rangers apart.
Colorado scored on three consecutive power plays, Adam Deadmarsh
sandwiching a pair of goals around super sophomore Milan Hejduk's
11th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Drury, last season's Calder Trophy winner as the league's
rookie of the year, assisted on all three power-play goals. To add
a little insult, Chris Dingman, acquired by the Avs with Fleury
from Calgary last spring, scored Colorado's fourth goal at even
strength. For Dingman, it was his first goal in 55 games _ the last
coming against the Rangers, who else?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Rangers (4-8-3) are a fragile team, one that
played on its heels Friday night. With Eric Lacroix (broken bone in
his right hand) back in the lineup for the first time in nine
games, coach John Muckler juggled his lines, moving Mike Knuble to
the second line along with Mike York and Adam Graves. John MacLean,
still looking for his first goal of the season, was briefly
reunited on the third line with Tim Taylor and Kevin Stevens. Todd
Harvey, who has a sore right ankle, was moved back to the fourth
line with Manny Malhotra and Lacroix.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey twisted the ankle Oct. 22 against Philadelphia and he
admitted Friday morning he has not been right. And Harvey was
skating on the third line by the end of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean did not score for the 15th consecutive game but he is
not the only ineffective Ranger. Adam Graves' goalless streak is
now at 10 games. Kevin Stevens' is at nine.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury finally broke his slump Friday night at six. Even though
Muckler left the team's top line of Petr Nedved between Jan Hlavac
and Fleury intact, the line had yet to really click, leading some
in the organization to begin questioning whether Nedved is capable
of being a first-line center.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Nedved, who seems better suited to a second-line
role, is the team's best center. The Rangers have inquired into the
availability of Edmonton's Doug Weight, who came up with the
Rangers in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   A trade for Keith Primeau's rights always remains a possibility
(one for Aleksei Yashin is more distant). But until the Rangers
make a move, and they may not, the Rangers _ as one member of the
organization said _ have to make Nedved into a first-line center.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved again struggled Friday night. Fleury, however, looked
particularly inspired in his first visit back to Denver since he
signed with the Rangers as a free agent, after the Avalanche had
rented him for the stretch run last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleury the Rangers had figured on when they signed him
finally showed up Friday night. He displayed a mean streak just 1
minute 53 seconds into the game, roughing his old roommate, Hejduk,
along the endboards. That brought on the boos. And then, about a
minute after Drury rang a shot off the post and crossbar, Fleury
opened the scoring with his fifth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It came on a two-on-none break with Hlavac, after Hlavac had
blocked an Aaron Miller shot at the right point in the Rangers'
zone. Hlavac carried the puck through neutral ice and then into the
Colorado zone, passing over to Fleury who was bearing down on
Patrick Roy from the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury shot and never stopped. Roy made the stop with his left
pad. Fleury skated into Roy, kicked his pad. The puck came loose.
So did the goal off its moorings. Referee Michael McGeough signaled
goal. Roy went berserk. Fleury celebrated madly. And the Rangers
had taken a 1-0 lead 7:32 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   That, as it turned out, was the high point of their evening.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The presiding judge in the government's antitrust
trial against Microsoft Corp. issued a broad denunciation of the
software giant Friday evening as the first part of his verdict in
the landmark case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court said that
Microsoft had used its monopoly power to stifle innovation, reduce
competition and hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions
have conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in
the computer industry,'' Jackson wrote in his 207-page findings of
fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through its conduct,'' he added, ``Microsoft has demonstrated
that it will use its prodigious market power and immense profits to
harm any firm'' that gets in its way.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact are not a final statement of
liability or innocence. But they show that he has accepted almost
every element of the government's case against Microsoft and has
rejected as ``specious'' virtually all the arguments Microsoft put
up in its defense.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are the judge's conclusions about who presented the
most compelling and believable case during the year-long trial that
opened in his courtroom on Oct. 19, 1998. As such, they serve as a
clear, almost certain, indication of how he will rule in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the government both reacted quickly after
receiving the much-anticipated findings Friday evening. The judge,
who in years past wrote his decisions longhand, transmitted the
document to both sides by e-mail Friday afternoon. It was made
public at 6:30 p.m., after the stock markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department was jubilant. ``This is a great day for
American consumers,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. ``This case
is about the protection of innovation, competition and the
consumers' right to choose the products they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, on the other hand, quickly issued a terse statement
indicating that the company was already formulating its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we disagree with many of the findings,'' the statement
said, ``we are still confident that the law supports us on these
points and that the American legal system will ultimately rule that
Microsoft's actions were fair, legal and good for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft's leaders are almost certain to appeal, should
Jackson eventually rule against them, the judge's findings of fact
are likely to stand, because they are virtually impervious to
appeal. Under federal court rules, appeals courts must give great
weight to the conclusions the trial judge draws from hearing the
testimony and studying the witnesses as they offer their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, appeals courts are allowed to challenge findings of
fact only if they are ``clearly erroneous.'' And if the judge's
verdict is largely based on the questions of witness credibility he
raised in his findings, the verdict stands a better chance of
withstanding appeal.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of his findings, Jackson declared that Microsoft
``enjoys monopoly power in the relevant market'' _ a threshold
assertion that potentially makes other actions illegal. He noted
that Microsoft can charge whatever it wants for its Windows
operating system without fear that price increases would reduce
demand, a key test for monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft expended considerable energy in court arguing that it
was not a monopoly, asserting that a host of small competitors _
from the Be operating system to Palm Pilot personal organizers _
were long-term threats. But Jackson dismissed every one of those
arguments, saying that competition from these competitors was at
least a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day has not arrived, nor does it seem imminent,'' he
wrote in once case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's monopoly power,'' he concluded, ``is also
evidenced by the fact that, over the course of several years,
Microsoft took actions that only could have been advantageous if
they operated to reinforce monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Jackson ran through each of the charges raised by
the Justice Department and the 19 state attorneys general that
joined the federal government in the suit. In each case, he
endorsed the government's charge while rejecting Microsoft's
rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
   He found that Microsoft attempted to divide the market for
Internet browsing software with Netscape Communications Corp. in
1995 _ a key charge in the government's case and a clearly illegal
activity under antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that other companies had similar encounters with
Microsoft, and ``these interactions demonstrate that it is
Microsoft's corporate practice to pressure other firms to halt
software development'' that threatens Microsoft's dominance ``or
competes directly with Microsoft's most cherished software
products.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jackson found that Microsoft's decision to bundle its Web
browser with Windows and give it away was not, as Microsoft
asserted in court, simply an effort to add a desirable feature to
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior executives at Microsoft decided Microsoft needed to
give its browser away in furtherance of the larger strategic goal
of gaining market share,'' he wrote. Microsoft, he added, ``viewed
browser market share as the key to preserving its dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   And in one of his most damning findings, Jackson concluded that
``Web browsers and operating systems are separate products.''
Microsoft's key argument was that its browser was simply a feature
of Windows, not a separate product.
</P>
<P>
   He turned that argument around on Microsoft by finding that the
company had actually harmed consumers by bundling the two products.
Consumer harm is a key test in antitrust cases. Bundling the
browser with Windows ``unjustifiably jeopardized the stability and
security of the operating system,'' he wrote, adding, ``There is no
technical justification for Microsoft's refusal to meet consumer
demand for a browserless version of Windows 98.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that Microsoft had threatened and bullied Apple
Computer, Intel, America Online and other companies that Microsoft
perceived as competitors. In the case of IBM, he wrote, ``when IBM
refused to abate the promotion of those of its own products that
competed with Windows and Office,'' Microsoft's suite of business
productivity software, ``Microsoft punished the IBM PC Company with
higher prices, a late license for Windows 95 and the withholding of
technical and marketing support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's past success in hurting such companies and
stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and
businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft,'' the
judge concluded. ``The ultimate result is that some innovations
that would truly benefit consumers never occur for the sole reason
that they do not coincide with Microsoft's self interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust lawyers say they cannot recall another instance in
which findings of fact in an antitrust case have been issued ahead
of the actual verdict. ``I've been at this for 40 years, and I've
never heard of anything like this,'' said Stephen Axinn, an
antitrust litigator at Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the findings are packaged with the conclusions of law _
the legal precedents justifying a ruling _ and the verdict. But
Jackson's decision to separate the findings offers at least two
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's potentially a very clever thing to do,'' said Robert
Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's
antitrust division, now with the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it will allow Jackson to modify his final ruling
if written responses from the litigants in the weeks ahead suggest
to him that he might be standing on weak ground.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing the findings ahead of the verdict also ``prompts the
parties to try to settle,'' said Andrew Gavil, a professor of law
at Howard University. ``This is a lot brighter than tea leaves. It
tells the parties exactly where they stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has repeatedly urged Microsoft and the government to
settle the case. While the two sides have held fitful discussions
during the course of the trial, they remain far apart. Most lawyers
and analysts watching the case are not optimistic that they will
settle, even with Friday's strong findings in favor of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Litan said there's not much incentive for either side to settle.
He said the government feels it is in a position of strength, and
Microsoft will likely wait for the appeals court, or for another
presidential administration in just over a year. A new president
will appoint a new head of the Justice Department's antitrust
division, and Microsoft can hope that whoever that is will be
inclined to settle on more generous terms.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Burt, a Microsoft lawyer, agreed with that analysis but
added that Microsoft's leaders stand willing to discuss a
settlement. Nevertheless, he said, they remain unified in their
conviction that they will not accept any settlement that would
jeopardize ``our core value, the soul of our company, and that is
the freedom to innovate and design products as we see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Microsoft official said Microsoft was more than willing
to hunker down for what could be a lengthy appeals process. The
antitrust trial ``has been a very difficult period for the
company,'' he said. ``But the investment in pain is almost
completely behind us. The cost of going forward doesn't seem that
great to me.''

FIGHTING POVERTY, PRESIDENT AND SPEAKER FIND A MOMENT OF UNITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS ``and rural'' to lede)  (jw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Near the end of a bitterly partisan congressional
session, President Clinton and Speaker Dennis Hastert appeared
together here Friday night to celebrate a rare moment of accord: a
pledge to merge their plans to alleviate inner-city and rural
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the second and last day of Clinton's
latest anti-poverty tour, which began Friday morning on a tomato
farm in a rural Arkansas town of 700 and ended in one of Chicago's
most blighted neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   While the agreement they announced amounted to a set of goals
rather than any specific legislation, the accord reflected a
concern by Republican leaders that they not let Clinton dominate
the debate over how to spread a remarkable era of prosperity to
corners of the country where unemployment remains high and incomes
far below average.
</P>
<P>
   The accord announced Friday pledges that the two parties will
``work in a spirit of good faith to develop a bipartisan effort''
to bring capital to impoverished areas of the country. But all the
hard bargaining _ over what kind of tax incentives will be
established, what kind of equity and loan guarantees to extend to
small businesses and entrepreneurs _ are put off until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``America can't ignore the people who have been left behind,''
Hastert said. Acknowledging that he was somewhat out of place in a
staunchly Democratic neighborhood, he said, ``I don't think I'm
going to make Republicans out of anyone'' in the audience. ``But
this isn't about politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton and Hastert both used the event, in a technical
preparatory school in the struggling Englewood neighborhood, to
make the case that partisanship must stop at the inner-city's edge.
``They are used to writing in Washington about how we all fight all
the time,'' Clinton said, with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and several
politicians behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Rev. Jackson's famous phrase, we have decided to reach
common ground and higher ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who introduced Jackson at the end of his comments,
sounded much like Clinton in describing his goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes Democrats and Republicans do agree,'' Hastert said.
``And it's time to come together and make things happen.'' Noting
that the Democratic and Republican proposals even went by different
names, he said, ``I don't care what we call it.''
</P>
<P>
   The written principles released by Hastert and the White House
say there are ``significant untapped new markets'' in rural and
urban poor areas. They said their goal was to empower communities
``with new equity capital, tax incentives and other tools'' and to
provide ``private sector and government resources'' to empower
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan that Hastert alluded to was sponsored by
Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., and James Talent, R-Mo., for up to 100
``renewal communities.'' It is essentially a tax reduction plan
under which there is no capital gains tax on the sale of a business
or partnership inside a renewal community, a proposal the White
House opposes; a wage credit for companies hiring workers from the
community, and a commercial revitalization credit for those who
renovate nonresidential buildings in such communities.
</P>
<P>
   The second day of Clinton's ``new markets'' tour began in
familiar territory for him: a tomato farming cooperative in
Hermitage, Ark., a town of 700 not far from the area where Clinton
grew up as a young boy. Clinton's first encounter with the town
came more than 20 years ago, when as the attorney general of
Arkansas he arrived in the town to deal with labor problems
stemming from the arrival of farm workers from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came down here one night and sat and listened for three
or four hours and learned more about tomato farmers than I had ever
known in my life _ and than I've ever heard since.''
</P>
<P>
   It could not have been a more welcoming crowd: In state
elections, Clinton won overwhelming victories in the area, and
Friday he stayed to shake hands with the crowds for more than half
an hour. It resembled a campaign rally more than a celebration of
the opening of new economic markets, and it was laced with the
announcement of some old-fashioned road projects by Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater. Another member of the cabinet, Agriculture
Secretary Daniel Glickman, couldn't resist noting that Slater's
tenure had been marked by ``perhaps a disproportionate share of
roads to Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible purpose of the visit was to see the Hermitage
Tomato Cooperative Association, founded by 15 farmers who were
barely surviving and could not afford the kind of processing
equipment needed to become a major supplier of tomatoes. Now, they
sell to Burger King and the Kroger Company, but they did so with
existing government aid programs _ rather than what Clinton and
Hastert were pressing on Friday.

TRACKING POSSIBLE Y2K PROBLEMS AS THE YEAR 2000 ARRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jan. 1, 2000, will dawn first in the independent republic of
Kiribati, a group of 30 low-lying coral islands in the Pacific
Ocean straddling the equator and the International Date Line.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the Y2K bug won't do much damage there. After all,
the 81,000 inhabitants of Kiribati, in the Christmas Islands
halfway between Hawaii and Australia, only got television in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But for those of us in Missouri and Kansas, it will be the first
look at whether the change in dates brings the Y2K bug with it.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 1 in Kiribati will occur at 6 a.m. Dec. 31 in Kansas City,
and for the next 18 hours we can track the Y2K bug as it marches
across the globe on its way toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be hard to monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very big story and we are making big plans to
cover it,'' a CNN spokeswoman said. From its Atlanta headquarters,
CNN plans to devote programming from its 34 bureaus to both
potential Y2K disruptions and general millennium happenings.
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites also will track Y2K's progress.
</P>
<P>
   The first potential headlines could come from New Zealand, which
was the first industrialized nation to suffer a major bug bite when
a $1 million smelting plant went dead in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   From there, we'll be able to watch Y2K reach the South Pole,
eastern Russia, Japan and Korea, China, India, London, Canada,
United States, Mexico and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the public, several large Y2K watchdogs will be
watching, too.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations-backed International Y2K Cooperation Center,
a global clearinghouse for computer bug data in Washington, D.C.,
will collect information from 195 coordinators across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Reports there will be updated in real time on the center's Web
site _ {www.iy2kcc.org}.
</P>
<P>
   Just blocks away, the U.S. government's $49 million Y2K
Information Coordinating Center is designed to give federal
agencies a round-the-clock view of potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, head of the president's Y2K council, says the
center will feed information to the president and two working
groups, one for domestic crises and one for international problems.
</P>
<P>
   Staffing the center, equipped with its own electric generator,
will be up to 30 crisis management specialists led by retired Lt.
Gen. Peter Kind, former director of the Army's information systems.
</P>
<P>
   The center is up and running now, and will stay open until after
Feb. 29, the leap year date that also could create computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Major television networks in the United States have told
government planners they will staff the center beginning Dec. 1 to
stake a claim to precious coverage space.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center
and the federally sponsored Computer Emergency Response Team at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh will file reports of
computer acts of terrorism from across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department will collect reports from U.S. embassies
and issue ongoing travel advisories at http:travel.state.gov. The
Defense Department will gather news from military posts.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Big Apple, the 22nd floor of the World Trade Center
is home to that city's Y2K command center. The $15 million facility
features hurricane-proof walls, its own heating and
air-conditioning system, electronic maps, a call center and press
briefing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the largest event-monitoring effort in the
history of the federal government,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Want to track the bug from home? Here are five ways to do it:
</P>
<P>
   TV's Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 Info will show when and where the bug first emerges.
Click on www.timeanddate.com.
</P>
<P>
   The International Y2K Cooperation Center will file real-time
reports from 195 countries at {www.iy2kcc.org}.
</P>
<P>
   Global e-mail updates from computer guru Peter de Jager will be
sent to your home computer by sending a request to
{amy &LR; year2000.com}.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Computing magazine editor Steve Hewitt of Raytown
plans to hold a real-time Internet party at www.ccmag.com, with
updates from readers across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is offering ``Y2K and You,'' a 31-page
booklet covering a variety of Y2K-related issues. You can get a
copy at www.y2k.gov or by calling the government's toll-free Y2K
hotline at (888)-872-4925. Beginning Nov. 27, the Y2K hotline will
expand its hours to include Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday, The Kansas City Star will publish ``Y2K
Forecast,'' a 12-page special section assessing global and national
readiness, how to fix your home computer and what simple
preparations you should take.
</P>
<P>
   We answer frequently asked questions, dispel rumors, debunk scam
artists, give our predictions and offer a Year 2000 quiz. Let us
know what you think.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is improving at Y2K community forums sponsored by the
Mid-America Regional Council. Some 40 persons heard key industry
panelists outline their Y2K plans this week at Kansas City Kansas
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   The next forum is scheduled for 7 to 9 p.m. Tuesday in the large
dining room of the Campus Center Building, Maple Woods Community
College.

WASHINGTON STATE VOTES SEND MESSAGE FOR REST OF NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Bond showed considerable political savvy this week when he
announced his plan to push a tax increase for Kansas during a
legislative year when he says he won't be running for re-election.
Pushing potentially unpopular initiatives is best done when a
politician's job isn't on the line.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a lonely quest, however, for the Overland Park
Republican, who apparently will be doing his swan song as president
of the Kansas Senate. After his colleagues digest what happened
Tuesday in Washington state they may not be at all eager to join
Bond's revenue-enhancement crusade. They won't, that is, if they
hope to continue their legislative careers.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in Washington this week is reminiscent of 1978's
voter approval of Proposition 13 in California, which ignited a tax
revolt that swept eastward and culminated with the historic
tax-relief legislation during the first Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although media coverage outside Washington hasn't amounted to
much, the voters of that relatively liberal state put their elected
representatives in what appears to be one of the tightest fiscal
boxes of any state in the union. By a stunning 58 percent to 42
percent margin, voters required that all taxes and fee increases
must be approved at the ballot box before becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   This happened in a state known for leaning heavily Democratic in
presidential and gubernatorial politics, a state conceded by most
observers to be a highly liberal political environment.
</P>
<P>
   So, what happened to bring about this unlikely tax rebellion?
Washington's taxpayers apparently got mad as heck and decided they
weren't to be played for patsies anymore. The state coffers were
overflowing with surplus, and although it's a state with one of the
highest tax loads, few elected leaders seemed disposed to cutting
taxpayers a break.
</P>
<P>
   This led a populist businessman to initiate a campaign against
the state's annual excise tax on vehicles. Taxpayers were skeptical
of this approach's potential for relief because many figured
legislators would just come up with some other tax to replace the
car tax. This resulted in coupling the vehicle-tax relief proposal
to a provision requiring a vote of the citizenry on all taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was approved overwhelmingly even though the business,
labor and media establishments all opposed the initiative.
Opponents outspent proponents by 10 to 1, according to an editorial
in The Wall Street Journal. The Republican Party reportedly even
suffered reduced business contributions as thanks for its
endorsement of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, nearly six of 10 voters went for it, which is a
landslide of extraordinary proportions in an era when it's
difficult to get even a majority to agree on anything. Conventional
wisdom these days holds that taxes aren't a hot-button issue, even
though the federal tax lug is at a historic high. Developments in
Washington state, however, call that assumption into question.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of a referendum option may insulate Kansas legislators from
such populist impertinence. Nevertheless, with elections looming
next November, tax-increase debates in Topeka next year can't help
but be influenced by this year's developments in Washington state.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in Congress, eager to adjourn
with a spending deal that allows them to claim a partial political
victory, are bargaining directly with President Clinton, White
House and congressional officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said a compromise was discussed in three
conversations over the last three days among Clinton, Speaker
Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, much remains to be done. The two sides are still
billions apart on spending. And there are significant policy
disputes, like the Republicans' refusal to agree to pay $1 billion
in dues that the United States owes to the United Nations. As a
result, neither side expects a grand bargain before Congress
reconvenes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No deal has been struck. ``We feel that the only way to conduct
these kind of negotiations is detail by detail and line by line,''
Gene Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal Republicans are seeking would require the White House
to pay for new spending it wants by cutting other programs, cuts
called offsets. These real cuts would stop the creative accounting
that has masked tens of billions of dollars in the Republican
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Friday night that they had a long
list of offsets in their pocket. They have not shown Republicans
that list.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also want Clinton to agree to a small
across-the-board cut in federal spending, significantly smaller
than the 1 percent cut that he denounced as ``mindless'' and that
he vetoed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert raised the question directly, but ``the president
indicated opposition and said offsets were a far better solution,''
a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night they spoke again and agreed to try to cooperate,
but Hastert did not bring up the across- the-board cuts, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal would be aimed at allowing both sides to claim that
this year's budget will not dip into Social Security surpluses to
finance federal spending. This would defuse accusations that the
Republican spending bills, or White House demands for spending
increases, would require tapping into the retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Republicans would have to agree on using
bookkeeping devices that make the spending look as low as possible.
``I have no objection to that,'' Clinton said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already signaled his willingness to compromise with
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to sit down like grownups, go out and tell the
American people the truth, and work through this,'' he said on
Monday, two days before he vetoed the bill that included the
across-the-board cuts. ``We can find the offsets. We don't have to
spend the Social Security surplus. We can do this. And I hope they
will work with me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If a deal with the president falls through, senior Republican
aides said, their leaders would prepare a package of billions of
dollars in mandatory spending reductions that Clinton could not
easily block.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans desperately want to complete the year's four
remaining spending bills before Wednesday, the deadline set by the
year's fourth continuing resolution, passed by Congress on Thursday
night, that allows the government to keep operating without a real
budget. That budget was due 35 days ago, on Oct. 1, the beginning
of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress are tired and grumpy, and they want to
go home, said the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, Bill Young of Florida. More than any struggle over
principle, power or penny-pinching, the desire to leave town seems
likely to push them to the finish line next week, in what most of
them hope will be the last days of a desultory year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly is the mood and the hopes of all the members,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hastert and other Republican leaders emerged from his
office on Thursday night, after a marathon bargaining session with
the White House over spending on foreign aid, they looked spent.
Hastert wore a mask of exhaustion. He had just been beaten by the
White House into spending about $800 million more on foreign aid
than his conservative colleagues wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he was just plain beat. ``The days have been long,''
he said. ``The hours have been long. Lots of 15-, 16-hour days.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to wrap up a deal is that nearly two dozen
senators have planned official trips in the coming three weeks.
They include Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who is chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, which governs spending; William Roth,
R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance Committee, which governs
taxes, and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must accomplish a great deal if it truly wants to leave
town on Wednesday _ the end of the fourth overtime period in what
has thus far been a game with few stars and fewer highlights.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the $15.2 billion foreign aid bill by a 316-100
vote Friday, with 84 Republicans in dissent. Four spending bills
remain to be negotiated between the White House and Congress, since
President Clinton has either vetoed or refused to sign each one
over issues of spending and policy.
</P>
<P>
   The bill covering the Interior Department is being held up by
two disagreements. One is President Clinton's request for $550
million more to buy wilderness areas to protect them from
developers. The Republicans are willing to offer $300 million, but
want to spend it in different ways, Young said. The second
disagreement is over Republican riders benefiting the oil, gas,
mining and ranching industries.
</P>
<P>
   The bill covering the Commerce, Justice and State Departments
has two problems, as well. One is the demand by Rep. Christopher
Smith, R-N.J., that the United States refuse to pay $1 billion in
back dues to the United Nations until the White House agrees that
no federal money can go to groups trying to liberalize abortion
abroad. The other is Clinton's demand that Congress fully finance
his program to add 50,000 officers to local police forces.
</P>
<P>
   The bill covering the Education Department is stymied by a
dispute involving Clinton's $1.4 billion program to reduce class
sizes in public schools by hiring 100,000 new teachers. And the
bill providing federal funds for the District of Columbia has been
hamstrung by Republican refusals to finance an AIDS program and
other local measures.

LOOK FOR A FAMILIAR FACE NEXT TIME YOU RIP OPEN A BOX OF THIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The girls pictured on boxes of Girl Scout cookies may look
awfully familiar next year.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 area Girl Scouts began a three-day photo shoot on
Friday. Their images will appear on millions of boxes of cookies
that will be sold nationally in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm going to be on the Thin Mints boxes,'' said
7-year-old Maddie Miguel of Shawnee.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy McDermott, spokeswoman for the Mid-Continent Council of
Girl Scouts, said the area council was selected because national
Girl Scout leaders were impressed during their recent national
convention in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so thrilled because we realized it was a lifetime
opportunity,'' McDermott said. ``It's the first time this has
happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   The photo shoot started early Friday at Camp Timberlake in
Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Girls played soccer while a photographer's camera caught their
moves. Nine-year-old Lauren Hearne of Independence said it felt as
if she and the others had to repeat their actions hundreds of
times. It was tiring but worthwhile, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be cool if my picture is on a box,'' Lauren said.
``My friends would laugh when they saw me on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Girl Scouts have sold cookies to raise money since the 1920s,
when troops would bake and sell them. The first commercially made
cookies were sold in 1934 in Philadelphia, according to the Girl
Scouts' Web site. The cookie boxes are redesigned every several
years, McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 1.7 million boxes of cookies were sold in
the 18 counties in and near the Kansas City area alone.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 of the 18-county area's 34,000 Scouts applied for the
photo shoot. The 80 who were chosen range in age from 7 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   The girls will be photographed today and Sunday at the Downtown
Airport, the Kansas City Zoo, a Kansas City fire station, a
television station and on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   The cookie boxes are expected to be out next fall.

 Auto-Speedway Work proceeding on auto speedway in Wyandotte
County  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM PEDLEY and STEVE NICELY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Lesa Kennedy shrugged when asked about
problems her company encountered in getting construction rolling on
the superspeedway in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a project of this magnitude, you've got to expect some
hurdles,'' Kennedy, executive vice president of International
Speedway Corp., said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Even a quick look at the construction site shows that hurdles
have been leaped.
</P>
<P>
   Rising above the trees that separate the site from two
interstate highways is the steel infrastructure that will become
luxury spectator suites.
</P>
<P>
   That infrastructure sits atop huge concrete footings that line
what will be the front stretch of the racing surface. The concrete
pillars also will support club-level seating.
</P>
<P>
   All of that sits atop massive berms that circle the track. On
the angled faces of the berms, more grandstands will be built.
Grandstands that eventually will seat 150,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Below the berms, the 1.5-mile-long ``tri-oval'' ring that will
become the auto racing surface is visible.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ring, earthmoving equipment clears and levels an
infield that will hold garages, pits, ancillary buildings, and auto
and recreational vehicle parking places.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the track, parking for 150,000 people is being carved
out of the sandstone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, less than a year after ground was broken at the 1,250-acre
site near Interstates 70 and 435, it is easier to understand why
the final price tag for the track will be $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, for some people, it was impossible to understand why
International Speedway Corp., parent of track developer Kansas
Speedway Corp., should build the massive structure at all.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits by people who owned land upon which the track is being
built stalled the earthmoving machinery. And created anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating for us and others who wanted this project
to happen,'' said Grant Lynch, president of Kansas Speedway Corp.
``While we were in sympathy (with the folks who owned the land and
didn't want to move), we had to look at the big picture. Letting a
few individuals hold up what is good for the whole community was
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But developers never thought about chucking the project.
</P>
<P>
   The hurdle posed by the lawsuits didn't stop construction, but
it did push back the start of racing from 2000 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the site now leaves little doubt that the track should
be ready by that date.
</P>
<P>
   No formal agreements have yet been reached with auto-racing
sanctioning bodies to hold races at the track. Not to worry. The
highest-profile racing series in the country is a virtual lock to
run a race at the speedway in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a Winston Cup race,'' Lynch said. ``Bill France Jr.
and Mike Helton (NASCAR's top two officials) have both announced
they think this place should get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Schedules for the 2001 racing season will not be determined
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR also will probably grant a Grand National race date to
the speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Indy-type racing is also all but a sure thing in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy Racing League _ which competes in the Indianapolis 500
_ and Championship Auto Racing Teams are the top two open-wheel
series in this country.
</P>
<P>
   One _ and possibly both _ could race at the Kansas track in
2001. Asked about negotiations with those series, Lynch said, ``We
have been and will be'' talking.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a traveling stock-car series race will be held.
</P>
<P>
   The track was designed to facilitate construction of a road
course in the infield, so a sports-car race is also a future
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending races, Lynch insisted, will be treated to
``features not available at any other racing facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as?
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say exactly, but fans will be up close and personal in
ways not available at other facilities,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Major racing will take place at the track as often as four times
a year. However, that doesn't mean the facility will be used only
four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Similar speedways are used almost every day. The Kansas track
will be home to driving schools, car shows, tours, ride-and-drives,
corporate outings, testing sessions and other events.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch estimates something will be going on at the track all but
10 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would be going on at the track had a unique bond not
been formed between International Speedway Corp. and the Unified
Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kan., many months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hays, Unified Government administrator, called the
relationship with speedway developers ``a public-private
partnership with common interests and common goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The object was ``profits for them and growth for us,'' Hays
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, well into that partnership, Hays retains his enthusiasm for
it and belief in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult and challenging'' in the early stages, he
said. ``That's well behind us. We are both moving forward to doing
what we are committed to doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A key indicator of how strong the economic impact the track will
have on the area will come Monday when officials will hold a
briefing for potential developers of 400 acres north and east of
the site.

COUNTY

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The economic development spinoff rewards
sought by the government should occur there first, and the briefing
will be the first test of developer interest.
</P>
<P>
   The government's vision for the privately owned property is
detailed in a brochure sent nationwide to large developers. It
pictures nearly 3.4 million square feet of retail and commercial
space and nearly 15,000 parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Malls, hotels, a theater complex, restaurants, office buildings
_ even a water park and NASCAR model racing attraction _ are
included in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The total floor space envisioned is more than double Oak Park
Mall's 1.5 million square feet. And the acreage is larger than the
384 acres of the Truman Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
   A development that large could take 10 or 15 years to develop,
said LaVert Murray, Unified Government director of development.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government sought a master developer with the
resources and experience to tackle such a large project and control
its progress. Other developers could work on individual projects
under the master developer.
</P>
<P>
   The master developer also would change the Unified Government's
plan to reflect market conditions and the developer's unique
approach. But the changes would be subject to the approval of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said International Speedway Corp. could qualify as the
master developer if it chose to.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the corporation had studied the possibility but
hadn't decided whether to submit a proposal. The deadline for
proposals is 5 p.m. Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The property next door is of interest to us,'' Kennedy said.
``Anything we can do to help the economic development efforts of
the Unified Government, we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   The 400 acres have been designated as a major tourism area by
the Kansas Legislature, so it qualifies for sales tax revenue bonds
or so-called STAR bonds. It also has been designated as a
tax-increment financing district, which includes the power of
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   All sales taxes generated within the district for up to 20 years
can be used to help pay for the costs of development. State and
local sales taxes at the site total 6.9 cents on a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The Unified Government granted nearly total property tax
abatement for the 1,250 acres of the speedway, but no property tax
breaks will be offered within the adjoining 400 acres. The sales
tax incentive favors retail, entertainment, restaurant and lodging
businesses that generate sales taxes, not office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the track and adjoining development had 70,000 cars
passing by every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to pull those people off and get them to spend some
money in Wyandotte County,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The participation of businesses owned by minorities and women
has surpassed the Unified Government's goals of 15 percent and 7
percent, respectively, speedway officials reported. Minority-owned
businesses have 24.3 percent of the contacts, and firms owned by
women have 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All but $82 million in the $228 million speedway's first phase
will be financed from public sources, including diverted taxes,
direct subsidies and public improvements. International Speedway
Corp. is investing the $82 million.
</P>
<P>
   The public sources are $33 million in state highway
improvements, $71.3 million in tax increment financing bonds repaid
by International Speedway Corp. instead of paying property taxes,
$24.7 million in STAR bonds repaid with sales taxes collected
inside the speedway, $6 million in state economic development
incentives, and $10.5 million in utility and street improvements
from the Unified Government and the Board of Public Utilities.

U.S. PUSHES MISSILE DEFENSE DESPITE ALLIES' OPPOSITION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS ``could'' to ``might'' in 1st graf)  (jw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The administration said Friday that it might go
ahead with a national missile defense system, even if it meant
withdrawing from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty over
Russian objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not permit any other country to have a veto on actions
that may be needed for the defense of our nation,'' Walter
Slocombe, undersecretary of defense for policy, said Friday in a
speech at the Center for Strategic International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The first deployment _ 200 missile interceptors and a radar
station in Alaska _ would break the ABM treaty, which strictly
limits the number, type and placement of defensive missiles in
Russia and the United States. That would require renegotiating the
treaty, which Moscow has been resisting.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Russia won support for keeping the treaty intact from
many of Washington's allies and friends in a largely symbolic vote
at the United Nations. A Russia-sponsored resolution opposing any
new missile defense system that ``attempts to undermine or
circumvent the ABM Treaty'' won a lopsided committee vote of 54-7,
with all of the members of the European Union either voting with
Russia or abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer Clinton will decide whether to begin deploying a $10
billion missile system. This revamped ``star wars'' network, which
is designed to knock down incoming enemy missiles, is not large
enough to be aimed at Russia or any other major nuclear power.
Instead, it is meant to protect all 50 states from small missile
attacks from countries like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Friday, Slocombe said that in the next 15 years,
North Korea, Iran and possibly Iraq were ``likely to be able to
field intercontinental-range missiles that could deliver chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons against the territory of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocombe said the administration believed that Moscow would
eventually agree to modify the treaty, clearing the way for the
United States to deploy the missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past month, since the U.S. military successfully
tested a crucial element of the missile network, Moscow has
repeatedly demanded that the treaty be preserved, even taking its
campaign to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that the administration remains committed to the
treaty, Slocombe argued that Russia shares some responsibility for
recognizing that rapid technological changes and new political
realities require changes in the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Several European countries have raised questions privately and
publicly about the wisdom of threatening to withdraw from the
treaty, which has been the basis for nearly every nonproliferation
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany said in Washington
on Thursday that he believed the administration's willingness to
consider abandoning the ABM treaty was based on political
calculations in the upcoming presidential elections. Otherwise, he
said, it could mean a change in the U.S. policy of promoting
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should think very carefully about the results of
scrapping the treaty,'' he said. ``Is it better to have Russia in
the framework and under the control of international treaties or
not? Yes or no?''
</P>
<P>
   The ABM treaty bars the United States and Russia from building
nationwide systems, allowing each only one site for limited
defenses. Until recently the United States had its small, limited
system in North Dakota, but tore it down in anticipation of
deploying a new nationwide system in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has retained its anti-ballistic missile system of radars
and missiles built around Moscow during the Soviet era. On
Wednesday, Russia announced that it had tested a short-range
interceptor missile for that system, an act several Pentagon
officials interpreted as a warning against further American testing
of its new system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Pentagon has scheduled two more tests of the system for the
spring, before the president makes his decision in June. Though
those are to be followed by 16 more tests, weapons experts doubt
that the first three tests will provide enough information to make
a sound judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``By next summer we will have no technical basis on which to
make a very serious decision about whether this system is ready to
go,'' said Tom Collina, director of arms control at the Union of
Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that such a decision should not be made in the heat of
the political campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are too high,'' he said. ``If we pull out of the
ABM, the administration is inviting the collapse of other treaties.
Both sides still refer to ABM as the cornerstone for stability and
arms control.''

LOS ANGELES -- Sister Mary Lisette Valenzuela found her calling _
again _ spinning tunes for an hour at a top-40 radio station in
Burbank.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nun, who teaches religion at La Reina High School in
Thousand Oaks, 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles, was a natural at
the task _ introducing songs, yacking it up with listeners and even
working in an occasional religious plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counting Crows _ the guys are so cute,'' Valenzuela shouted
into her microphone over the closing notes of the rock band
Thursday. ``They're some of God's finest creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela was chosen for the lunchtime radio stint after
writing an essay for KIIS-FM (102.7) radio's popular ``Corporate
Takeover'' promotion, which allows a working professional to spend
an hour behind the mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful, great. I would do it again,'' Valenzuela
said later. ``I really hope it gave a positive image to the sisters
and that lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   The nun, 35, who grew up bopping to the station's music, said
her purpose Friday was to encourage others to consider a religious
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about being a priest or a nun,'' said Valenzuela, who
broadcast her e-mail address and telephone number. ``It's a great
life.''
</P>
<P>
   For moral support, Valenzuela brought along Sister Gina Marie,
another member of the Sisters of Notre Dame, who wound up joining
the nun in the cramped broadcast booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' said Sister Gina Marie, who normally tunes into
news stations and was unfamiliar with the likes of teen sensations
such as Ricky Martin and Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   A former student and two of the nuns' relatives were among the
listeners who called in to the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Rosie, are you living the good life?'' Valenzuela asked a
former La Reina student, who now attends the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles. ``Are you following the Lord? You go,
girl.''
</P>
<P>
   KIIS disc jockey Clarence Barnes said the sisters' appearance
gave many listeners a new perspective of nuns and noted that
Valenzuela had a natural rapport with listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made my job a lot easier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At La Reina, several dozen students paraded through the school
library to catch the program as it was broadcast from boom boxes
and even over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Stutzman, the school's spokeswoman, caught a bit of
Valenzuela's broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed how good she was,'' Stutzman said. ``She sounded
like a DJ, not somebody who came in for an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   School librarian Eileen Debruno also liked what she heard and
thought nuns and pop culture are a good mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people still have a misguided idea of what nuns are
like,'' she said. ``People need to know (nuns) are real people.
It's great to have her out there among the people, pushing the
product.''

EXECUTIVE TEAM VOWS SCHOOL DISTRICT CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Ramon C. Cortines _ newly appointed to lead Los
Angeles Unified out of its chaos _ pledged to draft a blueprint for
education reform in the nation's second-largest school district but
warned that positive, measurable change may come slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines, an energetic and battle-tested 67-year-old educator,
was asked by the school board late Thursday to ease Superintendent
Ruben Zacarias out of office by Jan. 15 with $750,000 in hand. As
Zacarias' adviser and later as interim superintendent, Cortines
will lay the groundwork for significant administrative and
curriculum changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The improvement of education in urban cities across America,
including this city, is very difficult,'' Cortines said, dominating
a Friday morning press conference attended by Zacarias, Chief
Operating Officer Howard Miller and several board members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just L.A. Unified. There is a disconnection in
America between the curriculum we say a child should know and what
we practice (in the classroom).''
</P>
<P>
   A former schools chief in Pasadena, San Francisco, San Jose and
New York City, Cortines pledged to draft a reform plan that will
guide the district through the next five to eight years. He said a
permanent superintendent should be in office by the beginning of
the next school year.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines called LAUSD dysfunctional and disconnected and said
it's criminal that the district's 711,000 students do not have
adequate supplies in the classroom or the equal opportunity to take
many courses required for college acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Mexican-American. I am talented, and I am gifted,''
Cortines said. ``And there are thousands of students in this
district like that, that need the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cortines had been the top candidate for the post of
interim superintendent for a week, the majority of the school board
had not met him in person before they agreed to hire him on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't interview Mr. Cortines,'' said board member Caprice
Young. ``He's a very intelligent man. He interviewed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines pulled together the main components of the deal the
board approved unanimously Thursday night, including Zacarias'
retirement on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Zacarias will be advised by Cortines, and Miller
will be in charge of all day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Miller, who had been given control of all
of the district's departments on Oct. 12, agreed to allow Zacarias
to interact directly with all of the district's supervisors and
employees, rather than communicate to staff through Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement was not about me. It was about the
superintendent,'' Cortines said. ``I wanted him to be able to
retire with dignity and in a professional way.''
</P>
<P>
   The board agreed to allow Zacarias to stay on for two months
rather than risk a deepening leadership crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted; I'm elated,'' said board President Genethia
Hayes. ``Mr. Cortines is exactly what the district needs. The board
will ask him to ... take a good hard look at the management
structure of the district to make sure it is aligned with the
educational needs of the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``His presence goes a long way toward healing the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias said he believes the new arrangement will ``serve the
district well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a compromise; it's something that needed to be
done,'' Zacarias said. ``I have my head up very high, and I'm proud
of the things that we have accomplished in the last 2{ years.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias will leave with approximately $277,000 in salary
compensation for the last 18 months of his contract and about
$250,000 for accrued vacation and benefits. The remaining portion
of his $750,000 buyout prevents him from suing the district for
allegedly harming his professional reputation.
</P>
<P>
   He will receive an annual pension of nearly $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best of worlds, I would have preferred to stay,''
Zacarias said. ``But it's not about the money -- it never has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a direct message to supporters who protested the
board's decision to oust him, Zacarias said, ``It's time to get
back to the main issue, which is the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined that I would have had such an incredible
outpouring of support. All the money in the world would not buy me
that satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next two months, Cortines, Zacarias and Miller will
focus on addressing the district's school construction problems,
implementing state-mandated curriculum, improving students' scores
on standardized tests and overhauling the administrative chain of
command. The contracts of nine bargaining units also come up for
renegotiation next year.
</P>
<P>
   The school board and Cortines have not agreed on his
compensation that will fit within the guidelines of his public
employees' pension.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the school board approved contract buyouts for two of
the district's highest-ranking supervisors, General Counsel Richard
K. Mason and Chief Administrative Officer David Koch. The two deals
totaled about $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias, Koch and Mason were blamed in a Sept. 14 audit for
failing to adequately supervise construction of the environmentally
plagued Belmont Learning Center. Six other employees named in the
report have been placed on paid administrative leave, pending
disciplinary review. One person resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes were a necessary investment,'' Young said. ``When
you bring in a new superintendent, you want him to come in with his
own team. That means moving some people out.'' &QL;

FIRST LADY SPEAKS TO SHOOTING VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Los Angeles) -- Calling hate crimes a ``virus'' threatening to
``infect our society,'' first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton visited
the North Valley Jewish Community Center in a Los Angeles suburb
and praised the survivors of a gunman's rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of unspeakable tragedy, you have shown the
importance of going on, not giving in to bitterness or
hopelessness. You have refused to allow the forces of hatred to
win,'' Clinton told a crowd of about 75 in Granada Hills. ``Our
best weapons against them are gathering and speaking out and making
clear that we will never give in to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 10, police said Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. walked into the
center in Granada Hills, and opened fire in the lobby, wounding
five, including three young boys. An hour later, investigators said
he shot and killed Filipino-American postman Joseph Ileto, as he
drove a mail route in Chatsworth, another Los Angeles community
about 26 miles northwest of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Furrow later confessed to the crimes, saying
the center shooting was a ``wake-up call'' for Americans to start
killing Jews, and that Ileto was a nonwhite ``target of
opportunity.'' He awaits trial on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting before Clinton during her remarks were Ileto's family,
along with the family and victims of the center shooting --
Benjamin Kadish, 5, Joshua Stepakoff, 6, James Zidell, 6, counselor
Mindy Finkelstein, 16, and receptionist Isabelle Shalometh, 68.
</P>
<P>
   Ismael Ileto, who is the mail carrier's brother, introduced
Clinton as the next U.S. senator from New York, referring to her
possible candidacy. And sounding somewhat like a candidate, Clinton
urged all to push Congress to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act
before it recesses for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The law would add gender, sexual orientation and disability to
the current categories of federal hate crimes. She noted that the
U.S. government could charge Furrow with a hate crime only because
of the allegation he killed Ileto, a federal employee on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the family great comfort to know there's somebody in
the White House addressing the problem,'' Ismael Ileto said. ``We
know we are not forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first visited privately with the shooting victims and
their families, making small talk, asking about school, not
bringing up the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stayed away from that, which I really liked,'' Finkelstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the children's story ``The Rainbow Fish'' to a
classroom, Clinton headed to another room for her speech, passing
through the same hallway where police said Furrow opened fire. On a
wall in the same entryway, a bulletin board displays Rosh Hashana
wishes from several of the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that the world had a heart,'' wrote Rachel. ``I wish
for nothing bad to happen,'' said Noah. But alongside those were
more innocent requests, showing that lingering fear of violence
isn't smothering the center and its children: ``I wish for toys,''
said Kylie and Grant; ``No pinching,'' wrote Brian.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Stepakoff, Josh's father, said it was crucial that everyone
at the Community Center wrest normality back from the violence of
Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never left. We were back the Monday after,'' Stepakoff
said. ``I think it's important for everybody to not let this make
us hide and be afraid.''

DISNEY SHARES SLIDE

<P>
   (Los Angeles) -- Wall Street has pounded Mickey Mouse, taking
out pent-up frustration with the inability of The Walt Disney Co.
to turn around its massive entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   Shares slid 14 percent Friday by falling $3.875 to $24.25 after
Disney warned that it does not expect profits to rise until 2001.
Trading was heavy with more than 25.6 million shares changing
hands, more than four times the three-month average.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's forecast, issued after the market closed Thursday,
included an expected 37 percent decline in quarterly earnings. But
investors sold off the stock in response to a bearish forecast by
Chairman Michael Eisner that profits won't rebound in the year
2000, as many hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were very disappointed that Eisner gave such a sour
outlook,'' said analyst Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
``People had gotten excited that the turnaround was coming, but
it's clear that the gains are going to come later rather than
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock began rising two weeks ago from the $24 range in
anticipation that Disney's cost-cutting programs would start to
push profits upward. But Eisner indicated Thursday that ongoing
softness in video and consumer products will hold down profits to
roughly the same as 1999. Earnings for the year ended Sept. 30 fell
30 percent to $1.3 billion, or 62 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decline leaves Disney, based in Burbank 11 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles, down 42 percent from its
all-time high of over $42, reached only 18 months ago. Still, no
downgrades were issued Friday, indicating many trackers believe
Disney eventually will rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney's valuation, which is typically never inexpensive, even
today still reflects some built-in expectation that the company
will successfully turn its business around,'' said Salomon Smith
Barney analyst Jill Krutick, who maintained her ``outperform''
rating with a $37 price target. ``Nevertheless, the valuation is
attractive for long-term-oriented investors with the stock's 31
percent pullback from its 52-week high representing an opportunity
for investors to take part in a blue-chip name.''

DISNEY SHARES SLIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dave McNary  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Los Angeles) -- Wall Street has pounded Mickey Mouse, taking
out pent-up frustration with the inability of The Walt Disney Co.
to turn around its massive entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   Shares slid 14 percent Friday by falling $3.875 to $24.25 after
Disney warned that it does not expect profits to rise until 2001.
Trading was heavy with more than 25.6 million shares changing
hands, more than four times the three-month average.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's forecast, issued after the market closed Thursday,
included an expected 37 percent decline in quarterly earnings. But
investors sold off the stock in response to a bearish forecast by
Chairman Michael Eisner that profits won't rebound in the year
2000, as many hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were very disappointed that Eisner gave such a sour
outlook,'' said analyst Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
``People had gotten excited that the turnaround was coming, but
it's clear that the gains are going to come later rather than
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock began rising two weeks ago from the $24 range in
anticipation that Disney's cost-cutting programs would start to
push profits upward. But Eisner indicated Thursday that ongoing
softness in video and consumer products will hold down profits to
roughly the same as 1999. Earnings for the year ended Sept. 30 fell
30 percent to $1.3 billion, or 62 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decline leaves Disney, based in Burbank 11 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles, down 42 percent from its
all-time high of over $42, reached only 18 months ago. Still, no
downgrades were issued Friday, indicating many trackers believe
Disney eventually will rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney's valuation, which is typically never inexpensive, even
today still reflects some built-in expectation that the company
will successfully turn its business around,'' said Salomon Smith
Barney analyst Jill Krutick, who maintained her ``outperform''
rating with a $37 price target. ``Nevertheless, the valuation is
attractive for long-term-oriented investors with the stock's 31
percent pullback from its 52-week high representing an opportunity
for investors to take part in a blue-chip name.''

CLIPPERS ENJOY STAPLES BLOCK PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like two kids who whiffed at the Easter egg hunt,
the Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Clippers hauled a combined
record of 0-4 into Friday's date at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers had an excuse _ with center Matt Geiger and power
forward Theo Ratliff on medical leave, guard Allen Iverson and crew
were only averaging 78 points in their two losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers had earned their 0-2 start without alibi. Another
stinker like Wednesday's opener with Seattle, and the Staples
engineers would be fitting the luxury suites for curtains.
</P>
<P>
   On cue, they committed 30 turnovers, and allowed the Sixers to
cut their 19-point, fourth-quarter lead to six with 1:35 to play.
</P>
<P>
   You might say it would be a shame that one of these teams had to
win.
</P>
<P>
   But an inspired third quarter _ during which they outscored
Philly, 28-12 _ provided enough distance for the Clippers to absorb
a fourth-quarter fade and register a 91-81 victory in front of
14,271.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was major,'' said coach Chris Ford, whose team has dates
with Utah and San Antonio before hitting the road. ``The ghost of
last season's 0-17 start couldn't have been far away. Nothing's
ever going to be easy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The win came at the expense of 76ers coach Larry Brown, who also
happens to be the greatest bench boss in L.A. Clippers history. Of
course, the title is about as honorable as ranking as the
most-handsome man on radio.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, who must be costing the league a fortune in orange
paint, made just 13 of 41 field-goal attempts in losses at San
Antonio and Thursday night at Phoenix. Against the Clips, the
league's defending scoring champ was a chilly 6 of 16 for 21
points. The Sixers shot 34 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The home team was particularly stingy under the hoop, recording
a franchise-record 19 blocks, six by Michael Olowokandi. Brian
Skinner had four swats to go with 11 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers rookie Lamar Odom, who scored 53 points in the first
two games, co-starred as offensive decoy. He did collect another
SportsCenter moment, banking home a 42-foot, buzzer-beater to give
his team a 42-41 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensive balance is the only way this team is going to win,''
Odom said. ``Scoring a lot of points really isn't my game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 forward managed 18 points, nine rebounds and three
blocks, but his presence created breathing space for teammates
Derek Anderson (21 points, nine rebounds, six assists) Maurice
Taylor (12, 10 in the third quarter, and 10 rebounds) and Troy
Hudson (16).
</P>
<P>
   Hudson and Anderson also earned their stripes for chasing
Iverson through a bumper crop of screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great one-on-one player,'' Hudson said of Iverson, ``so
you have to get help. That's the only way we were going to contain
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, whose coiffure and ballhandling bravado qualify the
Clipper point guard as Iverson Light, added eight points in a
decisive third quarter, including a 3-pointer that extended the
lead to 66-53 with 1:30 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clips' 22-3 blitz ended, they held a 70-53 advantage
going into the fourth quarter. But nine turnovers against Philly's
frantic pressure almost turned out to be luxury-suite curtains for
the Clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a better job of protecting the ball,'' said
Anderson, who contributed nine turnovers. ``I almost had a triple
double _ points, rebounds and turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Not good, but it's better than a three-game losing streak.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 6:
</P>
<P>
   As Congress lurches toward adjournment, the road is littered
with dead bills, messy compromises and tactics dictated by future
campaign ads. Popular initiatives to tighten gun laws, raise the
minimum wage and regulate health maintenance organizations are in
danger because Republican leaders are more loyal to their own
agenda than to that of the majority of lawmakers. But nowhere have
the leaders' perverse priorities been more clear than in the
handling of a foreign aid bill to provide a paltry $370 million to
41 of the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the White House won the money to help these poor
nations. But Speaker Dennis Hastert and his whip, Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, all but promised to run commercials against Democrats in
tight races, charging that the money came from Social Security
surpluses. As DeLay put it, the money amounts to an effort to ``rob
the Social Security surplus to underwrite the national debt of
Nepal.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has already begun commercials against vulnerable
Democrats for allegedly ``raiding'' Social Security money to pay
for other programs. In fact, the Republicans' own budget also
tapped money derived from Social Security taxes. To say that
foreign aid is being paid for out of Social Security makes no more
sense than saying that Social Security is being drained for ethanol
or to build unneeded ships in Republican districts.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining budget issues are about both money and symbolism.
The White House wants more money for police officers and teachers,
and the Republicans seem wedded to ill-advised across-the-board
spending cuts and favor money for education with no strings
attached _ and no credit given to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Two important matters have to do with the Interior Department
and overdue U.N. payments. In both cases, President Clinton must
stand firm to get appropriations without repugnant attachments. The
Interior Department bill must be passed without ``riders'' catering
to big oil and to mining, timber and grazing interests.
</P>
<P>
   As for the United Nations, once again the administration's
resolve to pay its obligations is being blocked by right-to-lifers
who want language cutting off aid for family planning groups that
lobby for changes in their countries' abortion laws. It is time for
the Republican leaders to disengage from extremists who would smash
a pillar of American foreign policy over this unrelated issue.

AETNA HMO LOSES CONTRACT WITH HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In a dispute over reimbursement rates and terms,
central New Jersey's largest regional hospital, Robert Wood Johnson
University Hospital, has decided that it will no longer accept
patients seeking elective treatment who are covered by Aetna U.S.
Healthcare, the state's largest managed care company.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's decision not to renew its contract with the
insurer will go into effect between Dec. 1 and April 1. It will not
apply to emergency patients, which the hospital is required by law
to accept.
</P>
<P>
   But elective hospitalizations by members of the health
maintenance organization make up 15 percent of the 450-bed
hospital's volume.
</P>
<P>
   There was some dispute between the hospital and the insurer over
whether the existing contract expires at the beginning or the end
of December. But both agreed that with the gradual phase-out
requirements of state law, all Aetna U.S. Healthcare members would
not be able to go to the hospital on an elective basis by April.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the hospital comes at a time when open enrollment
periods for health plans for the coming year are beginning for some
employers. A letter this week from Johnson &AMP; Johnson, one of the
area's largest employers, informed some employees of the
possibility that the hospital would no longer accept Aetna U.S.
Healthcare members and spurred widespread concern that prompted the
hospital to make a public announcement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Holzberg, president and chief executive of the hospital,
said that last week it had notified a number of employers,
including Johnson &AMP; Johnson, that they had ``reached an impasse''
in their contract negotiations with Aetna U.S. Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the move by the hospital was seen by some in the
context of the new world of health care, in which market forces and
tough negotiations over rates may prompt some parties to try to
excite public pressure on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   At least five other health care providers have recently publicly
announced plans to sever relations with specific managed care
companies. In some cases those announcements were followed by
agreements between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   But Holzberg insisted in an interview Friday that the
announcement was ``no negotiating ploy.'' He said the insurer, in
negotiating a new five-year contract, had offered the hospital
reimbursement rates that were not only ``considerably below our
costs'' but lower than current rates. The change would have reduced
revenues to the hospital by $15 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are Goliath and we are David in this,'' Holzberg said.
``We can live with the loss of 15 percent of our patients. We are
not thrilled with it, but we can do it if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement late today, Aetna U.S. Healthcare, which is based
in Blue Bell, Pa., accused the hospital of trying to negotiate in a
public forum and ``creating unfounded worry among our members.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said the end of the contract with Robert Wood
Johnson would have ``minimal impact'' on its members because other
hospitals in the area provide all of the same services, with the
exception of open heart surgery. Aetna U.S. Healthcare said it had
contracts with other northern New Jersey hospitals which could
provide any service not offered at the area alternatives.

<P>
   Money doesn't buy happiness _ and among teen-agers, it may
actually make life feel harder.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times/CBS News Poll last month, 1,038 young people
aged 13 to 17 were asked to compare their lives with what their
parents experienced growing up. Overall, 43 percent said they were
having a harder time, 33 percent said they were having an easier
time and 23 percent said it was about the same. At the same time,
there was a divide along economic lines, with the upper-income
children saying they were feeling more burdened.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the affluent teen-agers, whatever their race or gender,
were substantially more likely than those from more modest homes to
report that their lives were harder and subject to more stress:
Among those with household incomes of $75,000 or more, 50 percent
said their lives were harder, 28 percent said easier and 21 percent
said they were about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Among those from families where the household income was less
than $30,000, only 38 percent said their lives were harder than
their parents', compared to 41 percent who said their lives were
easier and 18 percent who said they were about the same. Among
those with household incomes of $30,000 to $50,000, 41 percent said
their lives were harder, 33 percent said easier and 26 percent said
about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Some social scientists believe the gap is a measure of what
parents tell their children, and how the information is conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really interesting class issue,'' said Gina Bria, an
anthropologist at the Institute for Family Development in New York
City. ``In families living close to the bone, parents are more
likely to pass on family stories about how people survived, and in
the process to pass on skills for living. Wealthy kids often have
less of a perspective on the struggles of life. And in some strata,
there is a lot of pressure to keep the family's new-found status,
and children feel the pressure to get into elite schools, to be
sure they don't slide back. Everything's about going forward, about
prosperity. Falling back is the American nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   In later interviews with some of the teen-agers who took part in
the poll, the more affluent said that higher parental expectations,
more pressure for good grades, a faster pace of life and a more
dangerous world made their teen years more stressful than those of
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   It may come as a surprise to parents who came of age in the
druggy 1960s and 1970s, with the Vietnam War raging, but many of
their teen-agers sound wistful, describing their parents'
childhoods as care free, leisurely and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents both said they felt safe growing up, my dad in Long
Island and my mom in California,'' said Ashley Nielsen, 14, of Alta
Loma, Calif. ``They could do a lot of things we can't do today,
like I don't think they had to worry about things like
hitch-hiking. Sometimes at football games, or when there's a whole
bunch of teen-agers around, I feel a little nervous, like something
could happen. My world is pretty safe, but I know there's a real
world out there. I think there's more peer pressure now than there
was in their time, and more expectations to get good grades. Grades
are the biggest stress for most kids I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teen-agers who said their lives were harder described a
steady anxiety about peer pressure and living up to their parents'
academic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was just a lot easier when my parents were growing up,''
said Tommy Shipp, 15, of Houston. ``They didn't have as much peer
pressure to do drugs and all that. There's a lot more pressure to
be popular, and to drink. I've heard my parents talk. My dad's
parents didn't really care what he did; he got kicked out of the
house at 15.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that his father is a highly successful businessman,
Tommy says: ``I'm definitely going to go to college, and they care
about how I'm doing in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the more affluent teen-agers who said life has gotten
harder attributed it to a sense of too-muchness: too many
activities, too many consumer choices, too much to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything's gotten harder since my parents were
growing up,'' said Molly Wilhelm, 15, of Lakeville, Minn. ``Back
then, I think everyone was more equal, but now, because there's so
much more offered in styles of clothes and stuff, we all want to
fit in. I think my parents had more free time, and the world isn't
as safe as it was in their day. It's more common for kids to do
drugs and all that stuff. Education gets progressively harder as
people learn more, and there's more to cover. And now that there's
more technology, they expect more out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many teen-agers from more modest backgrounds view the new
technologies and new opportunities as making their lives easier
than their parents' were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's easier now, because of technology,'' said Ariel
Garcia of Opa-Locka, Fla. ``When you want to do a report, you just
look at the Internet, you don't have to go to the library. Cars
have air-conditioning now, so you're comfortable. There's
microwaves, so it's easy to cook. My dad had it much harder. He's
Dominican, and he was in the Navy. That's tough. I would never go
into the Navy. Those rich kids, they don't appreciate what their
parents do for them. The money just goes through their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   While the more affluent teen-agers portray their parents'
upbringing as easier, and more idyllic, the lower-income youngsters
talk more of the difficulties their parents had to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 13 in my mom's family, and there's only four of us,
and without so many brothers and sisters, my mom can take care of
all of us,'' said Rae-chelle Nunn, 17, of Columbia, Tenn. ``Like my
mom drives me to school, but when she was a kid, she had to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the richest teen-agers might see their lives as
harder, Ms. Nunn has a quick answer ``They're just spoiled brats,''
she said, laughing. ``But I am too. My mom spoils all of us.''

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Nov. 7:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-ECON-CULTURE (Wittenberg, Germany) _ The tale of a
sister and brother separated in 1960 when she fled East Germany for
the West, eventually making her way to America. Competing cultures
and economic systems shaped them over four decades into strikingly
different people _ he passive and dependent on the state; she a
fervent believer in boot-straps capitalism. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   (With photos.)
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-POPE (New Delhi, India) _ After blessing the tomb of
Mahatma Gandhi, Pope John Paul II on Saturday instructed Roman
Catholic bishops in Asia to respect other religions, but not lose
sight of their ``call to conversion'' in the next millennium. By
Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRALIA-MONARCHY (Sydney, Australia) _ A mismatched coalition
of political opposites soundly defeated a move to end the symbolic
rule of the British monarchy here Saturday, even though that is
clearly what most Australians want. By Seth Mydans. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-INVASION (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ In early June, Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain, the most outspoken advocate of a
ground invasion of Kosovo, had ordered the preparation of 30,000
letters calling up Britain's army reserves. Typed and addressed,
they were about to go into the mail, making possible the commitment
of up to 50,000 British troops _ half the standing army _ to go
into Kosovo. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-PEACE (Bogota, Colombia) _ With startling swiftness and
a sense of civic commitment rarely seen in this country, an
organized mass peace movement is suddenly becoming an important new
force in efforts to negotiate an end to civil conflict after 35
years. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ As Western leaders urge Moscow to
move quickly to a political solution to the war in the breakaway
region of Chechnya, Russian generals are pressing publicly for an
all-out military victory against the Chechen rebels, and in
unusually strident fashion warning Russian politicians to get out
of the way. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-REFUGEES (Nazran, Russia) _ Russia has vowed that this
latest war in Chechnya would be different from the previous
conflict, which ended in a stalemate in 1996 and led to about
30,000 deaths, mostly civilians. But Chechens who have fled here
into Ingushetia, a neighboring Russian republic, portray the
situation as in some ways more desperate than during the earlier
war. By Neela Banerjee.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-PRIMARY (Mexico City) _ The governing party's first
presidential primary campaign began months back as a smiling
affair, but the campaign closed last week with three candidates
attacking the primary as an unequal competition in which party
officials had greased the way to victory for the fourth, Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, who seems to be the choice of the party elite. The
sullen recriminations have surrounded Sunday's primary vote with
tremendous uncertainties. By Sam Dillon and Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-POLITICS (Talcahuano, Chile) _ Joaquin Lavin, the
presidential candidate of the Chilean right, flashed a wide grin
and laughed triumphantly as a throng of dockworkers, unemployed
coal miners and students cheered wildly in response to his every
promise. Lavin's campaign is taking the once stodgy Chilean right,
long associated with the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
into uncharted territory. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-EUROPE-DEFENSE (Paris) _ In a Europe that is increasingly
concerned about unilateralism and resurgent isolationism in the
United States, France seized the moment this week to urge the
European allies to develop a more independent defense and foreign
policy. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>

vehicle emission standards for New York. By Richard Perez-Pena.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-STRATEGY (Washington) _ Campaign donations were just
one element of a multimillion-dollar effort to win allies in
Washington, where a battery of lawyers argued Microsoft's case
before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in U.S. District Court. The
company also poured millions of dollars into an aggressive public
relations and political offensive, hiring an armada of
well-connected lobbyists and underwriting the work of research
groups, academics and consultants who have made arguments
sympathetic to Microsoft's defense in the antitrust case. By John
M. Broder and Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-ASSESS _ In the 18 months since the government filed
its antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., it has been remarkable
how little impact the case has had on Wall Street or on Main
Street. An analysis. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-OLD-NEIGHBORS (Philadelphia) _ They have lived side by
side on this short block of red and white row houses, most of them,
for 40 and 50 years. Now, with failing hearts and aching backs,
they are negotiating old age together in a neighborhood like many
others in Philadelphia, burdened by poverty, crime and years of
neglect by the city. By Sara Rimer. (With photo, graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   MLK-SPEECH-LAWSUIT (Atlanta) _ Reversing a lower court's
decision, a federal appellate court has revived a lawsuit by heirs
of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who claim that CBS violated
copyright laws by broadcasting portions of his ``I Have a Dream''
speech without permission. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-HOMELESS-KILLINGS (Denver) _ His muscles tightened as he
talked about life on the streets. He admitted he was afraid. ``You
have to look around every corner now,'' Tom Hollis said.
``Especially when it is getting dark.'' Hollis is one of about
5,800 homeless people in Denver. Many of them sleep on downtown
streets and in local shelters. But since the killings began, many
more are crowding into churches and shelters for safety. By Michael
Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   WVA-STRIPMINING-FIGHT (Blair, W.Va.) _ Jim Weekley, the last
litigious man in Pigeon Roost hollow, is warily awaiting word from
Washington about how the politicians are trying to get around his
big court victory against strip mining, which has put this state's
coal mining industry and government establishment in a state of
shock. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-MARIJUANA (Los Angeles) _ In a July 1997 raid, police
officers and federal agents here found more than 4,000 marijuana
plants in a Bel-Air mansion known as the castle, near the home of
Ronald Reagan, whose administration created the ``zero tolerance''
approach to illegal drugs. With a trial scheduled to begin Nov. 16,
the case has turned into a test of judicial tolerance for a defense
strategy based on marijuana's medical uses.

brought cohesion and confidence to the Gore campaign. By Adam
Clymer. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CONSERVATIVES (Washington) _ Fearful that Gov. George W.
Bush's stand on abortion could cost him crucial support, prominent
conservative leaders are working aggressively behind the scenes to
persuade their followers to put aside misgivings and rally behind
the Texas governor. By Richard L. Berke. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-STOCKS (Washington) _ Campaign contributions are, by
nature, risky investments, given the unpredictability of election
outcomes. But the speculative element has grown with some members
of Congress, who are investing part of their campaign treasuries in
the stock market. By John Files.
</P>

COMMENTARY: NAME THAT GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's a wonderful old Calvin Trillin essay about
how he and his wife, Alice, would give each other global hot spots
for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   If Calvin unwrapped a map of Iran, with the message ``Leave It
to Me,'' he was free not to keep up with news on Iran, or figure
how to pronounce the names of Iranian dictators and generals. Alice
would read everything and inform her husband only if Iran was about
to start a Worldwide Nuclear Conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   A global hot spot, the writer observed, was like ``some dreadful
old uncle who is always alarming the family with emergencies that
are invariably described as beyond solution.''
</P>
<P>
   I want the same deal with the president. If I'm not up to the
daily strain of distinguishing between Gen. Muzaffar Usmani and
Gen. Khwaja Ziauddin, the guy elected to be had better be.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, W. has given an interview on foreign affairs that
seems willfully clueless. Although the coup in Pakistan had been
front-page news for weeks, he drew a blank on the name of its
leader, outrageously declaring: ``The new Pakistani general, he's
just been elected _ not elected, this guy took over office. It
appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I
think that's good news for the subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   As W. painfully reached to retrieve the name of the Pakistani
leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, you could almost hear the music
swelling from the Regis Philbin quiz show, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.'' But unlike the stumped contestants on that show,
Bush was not allowed to call a friend for help. (``Yo, Condi!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't name the general,'' he stammered on, before going
generic with a final try: ``General.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has tried to blame ``gotcha'' journalism rather than his
failure to do his homework. But the Boston TV reporter did not ask
trick questions about obscure spots like Burkina Faso, or try to
trip up W. on the difference between Iran and Irian. (``Yo,
Condi!'')
</P>
<P>
   If W. had been reading the newspaper closely the last few weeks,
he could have aced his quiz. India and Pakistan were central to the
recent debate on the nuclear test ban treaty, and India's prime
minister _ whose name also escaped Bush _ has been in office a year
and a half. Bush was also unable to name the leader of Chechnya,
long one of the diciest pieces of the crumbling Soviet empire. He
correctly provided part of the name of the president of Taiwan,
``Lee,'' but it sounded suspiciously like a lucky guess.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter was reminiscent of that famous Roger Mudd
interview with an utterly inarticulate Teddy Kennedy. Men who are
running largely because of their last names sometimes trip over
their entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor had the cornered look of a man who has been
winging it too long, and hiding behind his advisers' skirts too
long.
</P>
<P>
   He let himself be rolled on an interview he should have seen
coming. The question has been hanging out there for months about
whether Bush the Younger knows enough about the world to deal with
all the loons, coups and wars that spring up like twisters across
the post-Cold War plains.
</P>
<P>
   His intensive foreign affairs coaching (which must have included
Global Hot Spots 101) supposedly began last winter, yet the gaffes
keep coming. So it was natural to try to ascertain whether he was
studying or slacking. Has his huge advantage in money and family
made him so cocky he doesn't care about the gaps in his knowledge?
</P>
<P>
   His interview smirk _ that anti-intellectual bravado _ was
jarring. Has he grown so accustomed to getting things easily _
Yale, the National Guard, lucrative business deals _ that he
expects family connections to carry him through here?
</P>
<P>
   President Bush had a passion for foreign policy. ``You couldn't
get him to go to an education briefing with Lamar Alexander, but
he'd spend three days with some two-bit dictator from Sri Lanka,''
recalled an official in the Bush White House.
</P>
<P>
   But when the president was accused of knowing heaps more about
Berlin, Germany, than Berlin, New Hampshire, his press secretary,
Marlin Fitzwater, began carrying around an index card with the
price of eggs and milk and gas.
</P>
<P>
   W. can try an index card with names of mutinous generals, or
scrawl them on his shirt cuff. But he should remember that by the
time his father got his index cards, it was already too late.
</P>

   TOKYO _ For those parents frantically beating the pavements to
find yet another pack of $5.99 Pokemon cards, take heart: your
children are unwittingly demanding a healthy dose of Japanese
values.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon, the army of feisty, funny, fantastic cartoon creatures
that has become a smash hit among the under-10 crowd in the United
States and will star in the first Pokemon movie, opening Nov. 12,
stands to become one of Japan's biggest, most successful cultural
exports.
</P>
<P>
   This latest fad follows on the heels of the Tamagochi craze,
which saw the most selfish of children _ and even some adults _
setting aside their own priorities to care for a virtual pet (also
known as a giga-pet), which was programmed to die without their
steady ministrations. Pokemon shows a gentleness and humor that
reflects the best of Japan in a way that high-quality cars and
instant noodles can't.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon is steeped in traditional Japanese values _
responsibility, empathy, cooperation, obedience, respect for
elders, humility _ that go far beyond its obvious references to
things Japanese. It may sound like the makers of Pokemon cribbed
those themes from Sesame Street, but there is something notably
Japanese in the emphasis on team-building and lending a helping
hand, values that are admired but not always handsomely rewarded in
American society and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese elementary schools strive to instill those values in
their students, placing a premium on their transmission that
exceeds their zeal to teach reading, writing and arithmetic. This
heavy emphasis on socializing children is the bedrock of Japanese
society and is credited, at least in part, with producing the low
rates of juvenile crime rates, teen-age pregnancy and drug abuse
that Japan enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not pretend that children recognize the show's subtleties.
The aim of Pokemon (the name is short for ``Pocket Monsters''), as
far as they're concerned, is to collect all 151 creatures, become a
master trainer and win battles - none of which, by the way, ever
result in death. Death occurs only when Pokemon trainers, the
humans, fail in their duties.
</P>
<P>
   Ash, Misty and Brock are the central human characters of the
show, and they all understand that capturing a Pokemon is not
enough. Becoming a real trainer takes compassion and
responsibility, although there is a Pokemon Center in town where
ailing Pokemon can go to recuperate if their budding trainers fail
to live up to their obligations _ and where they absorb lectures
about being nice to their Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   Take the episode where Charmander, a sort-of dinosaur, whose
power lies in its ability to shoot fire from his tail, almost dies.
Charmander's master has abandoned it (Pokemon have no sexual
identity), leaving it sitting in the rain with a tail almost out of
firepower. If the tail goes out, Charmander will die.
</P>
<P>
   But Ash comes to the rescue, even though this particular
Charmander (the name connotes a sort of breed, not an identity) is
not his responsibility. He tolerates jarring electric shocks
emitted by Pikachu, the sassy little yellow Pokemon that is his
sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of patient tending can be seen here at the
playground, where older children tend to look out for younger ones,
to tolerate their piques and help them learn to use the slides and
swings.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Ash and Professor Oak, the ultimate
authority on Pokemon, is very much like that of deshi to sensei, or
student to teacher, the ubiquitous junior-senior relationship that
pervades Japanese institutions. The older sensei offers friendship,
advice and guidance to the deshi, who returns it with gratitude,
respect and loyalty. Even Pikachu rewards Ash's care with unerring
loyalty, and by fighting far stronger Pockemon and suffering
injuries on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The factionalism of Japanese politics, the tradition of
seniority-based pay, the hierarchical nature of organized crime
here all reflect this sensei-deshi relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not Professor Oak who corrects Ash or criticizes him.
Rather, it is Ash's peers who, in classic Japanese style, point out
his errors and run to his assistance when he finds himself in a
jam, as he often does. In the same way that Japanese elementary
school classes have been broken into small groups for problem
solving, Ash and his friends work as a team, resolving their
conflicts without appeal to the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   So as parents brace for the movie, which will surely unleash
another wave of card-trading hysteria, it may be some small comfort
to remember the hidden values. In trading cards, children learn
negotiating skills, cooperation, value judgment and the thrill of
human interaction that is increasingly lost in this virtual, wired
world. Or they learn materialism and cheating. But that's a
non-Pokemon story.

COMMENTARY: GEORGE W.'S MAKEUP EXAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Boston TV reporter surprised Republican presidential
front-runner George W. Bush last week with a pop quiz on foreign
policy that the governor pretty much flunked. He was asked to name
the leaders of Taiwan, India, Pakistan and Chechnya, and got only
Taiwan right. What was scary about the interview was not that
George W. didn't know all the names. It was the
Quayle-in-the-headlights look on his face when he was asked for
them. If I were the Democrats, I would run commercials over and
over again just showing that look on his face. And the voice-over
would say: ``Here's how George W. looked when he was asked to name
the leaders of Taiwan, India, Pakistan and Chechnya. Imagine how he
would look if he were asked what to do about them.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the point is not whether George W. can keep these
leaders' names in his head. What matters is how he feels about
these countries in his gut. We have to know if that tank is empty
too. A lot of people say that Bush, while he knows little foreign
policy, has hired smart advisers. Oh, really? Well what happens
when his two smartest advisers disagree? What happens if he is
president and he finds himself, as Harry Truman did in 1948,
sitting between his brilliant secretary of state, Gen. George
Marshall, who's telling him not to recognize the new state of
Israel, and his brilliant adviser Clark Clifford, who's telling him
to recognize Israel. That's not a ``Jeopardy'' question; that's a
gut check. That's what needs probing.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the 10 questions George W. should be asked:
</P>
<P>
   1. You've already brought on some foreign policy advisers _
Condoleezza Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle. They're all Cold
War conservatives. What is it about their world view that appeals
to you?
</P>
<P>
   2. You were in favor of the Senate's rejection of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which banned all nuclear testing.
Fine. Suppose you were sitting with Prime Minister what's-his-face
of India and General whatever-his-name-is from Pakistan and trying
to persuade them to stop testing. How would you explain why you
believe America should retain the right to test nukes, but India
and Pakistan should be denied it?
</P>
<P>
   3. Do you believe your father was right when he decided at the
end of the Gulf War not to go to Baghdad and take out Saddam
Hussein, even though we had 500,000 troops on Iraq's border?
</P>
<P>
   4. Do you believe America should remain neutral _ even skeptical
_ about promoting democracy in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Morocco,
while we are pushing hard for it in Nigeria, Ukraine and Indonesia?
</P>
<P>
   5. There have always been two Republican views on Arab-Israeli
diplomacy. One view, the George Shultz school, tended to argue that
the United States should not push the peace process unless the
Israeli government was united behind it. The other view, the James
Baker school, tended to argue that the United States should
constantly be pushing Arab-Israeli diplomacy, even if Israel was
lukewarm _ because it was the only way an Israeli government would
develop positions and because America had its own interests in
advancing the peace process. Which school are you in?
</P>
<P>
   6. We all favor a free and democratic China, but there are two
Republican schools on how to get there. One school thinks we should
contain and quarantine China, in order to bring down its Communist
regime. The other school thinks we should engage China, and enable
more and more Chinese to deal directly with the outside world, in
hopes of bringing about a gradual transformation there. Which
school are you in?
</P>
<P>
   7. Could you imagine Russia ever being asked to join NATO? And
while we are on that subject, now that the Clinton team has
expanded NATO to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, do you
believe NATO should be expanded farther, so it goes right up to the
Russian border, or should expansion now be frozen?
</P>
<P>
   8. Hispanic Americans are increasingly in favor of lifting the
pointless U.S. embargo on Cuba. Your brother, Jeb, the governor of
Florida, wants to maintain the embargo in deference to his Cuban
supporters. Where do you come down?
</P>
<P>
   9. Do you believe the United States should intervene in regions
where our interests are ambiguous, but the human tragedy is
unambiguous?
</P>
<P>
   10. Do you think you could raise as much money for the foreign
aid budget as you did for your campaign?

   As if presidential candidates don't already have enough tests of
character to worry about _ financial impropriety, drug use,
adultery _ now it seems they have to make nice as well. The Arizona
Republic ran an editorial last week criticizing Sen. John McCain
for his ``volcanic'' temper, claiming that temperament is a
legitimate campaign issue. The Republican responded by accusing the
campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas of helping to plant the
charges against him, which first appeared in The New York Times.
``Do I insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like
that?'' McCain asked. ``No, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But so what if he does? Judging from the behavior of some past
chief executives, a hot temper seems almost a prerequisite for the
Oval Office. Let's go to the presidential biographies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; George Washington wasn't always the dour icon of the dollar
bill. At the Battle of Monmouth, he laced into Gen. Charles Lee for
retreating instead of attacking. Burke Davis explains in ``George
Washington and the American Revolution'' (Random House, 1975):  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Washington roared: ``Whatever your opinions, sir, I expect my
orders to be obeyed! ...'' Lee protested once more that his plan of
attack had been foiled by disobedient subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Others were to recall that Washington cursed Lee in a fury.
General Scott cherished a long memory that Washington ``swore till
the leaves shook on the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In ``Andrew Jackson and the Course of American Democracy''
(Harper &AMP; Row, 1984), Robert V. Remini recounts a 1836 Cabinet
meeting over a crisis with Mexico: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Without stopping to inquire of the other members what their
advice on the matter would be _ which was his usual procedure _ the
president lashed out in a frightening display of Jacksonian
passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write immediately to Commodore Dallas,'' he barked, ``and
order him to blockade the harbor of Tampico, and to suffer nothing
to enter till they allow him to land and obtain his supplies of
water and communicate with the Consul, and if they touch the hair
of the head of one of our citizens, tell him to batter down and
destroy their town and exterminate its inhabitants from the face of
the earth!''
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet members sat looking at each other in a near state of
shock.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ulysses S. Grant would send thousands of men to their deaths in
the Civil War, but could not abide cruelty to animals. Gen. Horace
Porter, who served with him, recalled in ``Campaigning With Grant''
(1897) what happened when Grant, astride his mount Egypt, saw a man
whipping a team of horses: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Putting both spurs into Egypt's flanks, he dashed toward the
teamster, and raising his clenched fist, called out to him: ``What
does this conduct mean, you scoundrel? Stop beating those horses!''
The teamster looked at him, and said coolly, as he delivered
another blow aimed at the face of the wheel-horse: ``Well, who's
drivin' this team anyhow _ you or me?'' The general was now
thoroughly angered, and his manner was by no means as angelic as
that of the celestial being who called a halt when Balaam was
disciplining the ass. ``I'll show you, you infernal villain!'' he
cried, shaking his fist in the man's face. Then, calling to an
officer of the escort, he said: ``Take this man in charge, and have
him tied up to a tree for six hours as a punishment for his
brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To end the coal strike of 1902, Theodore Roosevelt contemplated
sending in troops to man the mines. Nathan Miller indicates in
``Theodore Roosevelt: A Life'' (Morrow, 1992) that Roosevelt felt
the spirit of the Framers mattered more than the rights of a few
individuals:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the Constitution of the United States?''
Congressman James E. Watson protested to the president. ``What
about using private property for public purposes without due
process of law?''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt stopped suddenly, took a firm grip on Watson's lapels
and, looking him squarely in the eye, fairly shouted: ``The
Constitution was made for the people and not the people for the
Constitution!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Warren G. Harding was incensed when he learned of corruption at
the Veterans' Bureau under his friend Charles R. Forbes. In ``The
Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times''
(McGraw-Hill, 1968), Francis Russell depicted him at the boiling
point:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon a visitor to the White House with an
appointment to see the president was directed by mistake to the
second floor. As he approached the Red Room he heard a voice hoarse
with anger and on entering saw Harding throttling a man against the
wall as he shouted: ``You yellow rat! You double-crossing ...''
Whirling about at the visitor's approach, Harding loosed his grip,
and the released man staggered away, his face blotched and
distorted. ``I am sorry,'' Harding said curtly to his visitor.
``You have an appointment. Come into the next room.'' On leaving
the White House, the visitor asked a doorman who it was who had
just gone out after he had come in, and the doorman replied:
``Colonel Forbes of the Veterans' Bureau.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When Harry Truman gave 'em hell, he often did so on paper. He wrote
this memorable letter to Paul Hume, music critic of the Washington
Post, following Hume's devastating review of a 1950 singing recital
by the president's daughter, Margaret:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hume: I've just read your lousy review of Margaret's concert ...
Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new
nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter
below!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lyndon B. Johnson perfected his bullying of subordinates during
his 1948 Senate run. In this scene from ``Means of Ascent'' by
Robert A. Caro (Knopf, 1990), his desire to shake hands with all
the students at a high school is thwarted by an advance man:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have time, sir,'' Carter said, and produced the list
of all the stops he was already scheduled to make. Johnson didn't
even look at the paper; instead, he looked at Carter. As the
principal observed the intensity of Johnson's glare, the hand he
had extended to welcome the candidate slowly dropped to his side.
The smiles faded from the faces of the delegation. There was a long
silence. Then Johnson said, in a low, threatening tone that his
aides feared more than any other: ``Are we gonna join the Can't Do
It Club right here on the steps of Robstown High School?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And what really drives President Clinton up the wall, according
to Dick Morris, his former political adviser, is staff members
leaking executive decisions that make their boss look politically
conniving. Morris writes of the president in ``Behind the Oval
Office'' (Random House, 1997): &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He was red-faced as he yelled, ``I will do this race alone,
alone, alone if I have to'' _ his voice now reaching a higher
octave _ ``to avoid having done to me what was done to me every
week, ev-er-y week, in 1993 and 1994 by my staff and my
consultants. I will not have decisions that I make'' _ his fist now
pounding his chair arm, keeping time with his words _ ``that take
guts, that take courage, where I'm really risking everything, and
have them transformed into'' _ his lips curling in a sneer _
``seamy, seedy, political decisions so some staff member or some
consultant can blow his own horn to look so smart and oh so good to
some journalist. I'll do the race alone first.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I think I got the point.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WITTENBERG, Germany _ On March 15, 1960, an 18-year-old German
girl and her younger brother boarded a train here to escape East
German communism for the West. But police were patrolling and the
girl, convinced they could not make it together, pushed the boy off
the train as it started to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police were asking me who I was, where I was going, why I was
traveling, and I realized we were too suspicious as a pair,'' said
Heidi Boettcher, now an American citizen. ``My brother was just 16.
I was sure he would join me later.''
</P>
<P>
   But the nudge that left the boy, Hans Schulz-Netzer, marooned at
Wittenberg station led to permanently divided lives. One was long
lived in the Soviet bloc, the other in rural Missouri. By the time
the Berlin Wall fell a decade ago, Hans and Heidi stood at opposite
poles in the basic post-Cold-War debate of Western societies.
</P>
<P>
   That debate no longer concerns the merits of capitalism, a
system without ideological rival since communism collapsed. Rather,
it centers on the differing European and American views of how far
capitalism should be regulated in order to cushion people from the
harshness of market forces.
</P>
<P>
   A German without job prospects, Hans favors enveloping social
protection. An American with a convert's zeal, Heidi wants ``the
government out of my face.'' Hans sees his sister as ``way over to
the political right.'' Heidi views her brother as the victim of a
German system ``that still assumes people are so dumb they need to
be taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   German unification without German neutrality was a great Western
achievement, but the economic toll was also great. Over the past
decade, the decision to extend state pensions, unemployment
benefits and all West Germany's elaborate social programs to 17
million new citizens has precipitated a crisis in Europe's largest
welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, a once envied ``social market'' model is now
carrying more weight than it can bear. Schulz-Netzer, 56, is part
of the burden. He has been collecting about $825 a month in
unemployment benefits for the past two years. His wife, Karin, 55,
gets another $600. Karin's daughter, also unemployed, receives some
more.
</P>
<P>
   That money has to come from somewhere, free lunches being as
scarce in Germany as anywhere else. The taxes and charges needed to
finance all the social cushioning have pushed up wage costs and so
deterred hiring. Long Europe's engine, Germany has stalled, unable
to dent 10 percent unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   This crisis does not surprise Mrs. Boettcher, 58, who is married
to a farmer in Missouri, a state with a 4 percent unemployment
rate. ``If you want to work, I don't give a damn, you find work,''
she said, laughing. ``But Germans are sheep. Why should my brother
think for himself if money is being thrown at him?''
</P>
<P>
   Having raised 11 children since arriving in the United States in
1961, she has now started a small business _ a day nursery for
infants. Charging a daily rate of $11 a child and on the move from
morning to night, she makes a little more than her brother's family
receives from the German state for doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to see in Mrs. Boettcher's dynamism and her
German brother's passivity facile symbols of American vitality and
German self-doubt, of the vigor of the New World and the late
middle age of the Old. But the divisions of the post-Cold-War era
are more nuanced than that.
</P>
<P>
   Germans in general reject unmitigated ``Americanization''; if
that is the sum of Cold War victory, they tend to say, no thanks.
To the millions of American jobs created this decade, some respond
that Germany has free health care, free universities, smaller
prison populations, streets free of the homeless: capitalism
tempered by equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could benefit a lot by being more American,'' said Norbert
Walter, chief economist for Deutsche Bank. ``We should apply the
market economy instead of being a museum of Western socialism. But
Americans only need to take a look at their inner cities to see
they might also learn a little from Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, this debate is
coming to a boil. Time has run out; Hans Eichel, the finance
minister, said recently that the German model was ``finished.'' But
a look at the divergent lives of Heidi Boettcher, American
immigrant, and her brother suggests that trans-Atlantic agreement
will prove elusive on how much state-directed compassion global
capitalism needs.
</P>
<P>
   Germans make good Americans. Between 1820 and 1996, 7.1 million
Germans immigrated to the United States _ more than from any other
nation. The desire to forget an often painful past, honesty and
thoroughness, a practical bent _ many Germans share these
qualities, and they have made absorption easier.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Mrs. Boettcher looks the part. With one infant on her
back, another in her arms, she exudes a ready friendliness that
speaks of 38 American years. Her manner is easygoing to the point
that even 10 children under four in her newly built home in
Altenburg, Mo. (population 256), seem a manageable charge.
</P>
<P>
   So the darkness of the story she tells _ punctuated by the
contented squeals of little Americans _ is doubly shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Germans of her generation, Heidi grew up fatherless.
Like most Germans, she suffered. Her father, Karl Schulz-Netzer,
was captured by the Americans and held in St. Louis. On his return
to Germany after the war, he filed for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents were divided at the same time as her country. Age 4
when the war ended in 1945, Heidi fell into the communist world.
She recalls her mother cutting up a blanket to make pants for her
and her brother. The garden yielded bare subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a rural area, she saw communist doctrine at work. Land
was taken over by the state, farmers put to work eight hours a day
and granted a month's vacation. But holidays were scant
compensation for expropriation.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat sometimes grew ``to the ceiling'' because nobody could be
bothered to harvest it, she recalls. A first lesson in communism's
effect on motivation: Nobody wants to herd the state's sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Care packages sent from the United States by distant cousins,
the Degenhardts, provided the only relief. The family had emigrated
to Missouri in the 1870s. For the young girl, sweet Hershey bars
and succulent lard constituted America's first lure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A good athlete, Heidi was sent at 17 to the German high school
of physical culture in Leipzig, training ground for many East
German Olympic gold medalists. In this palace of high socialism,
indoctrination moved into high gear. But Heidi was more marked by
rationing than revolution. If the latter produced the former, how
good could it be?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I turned 18,'' she said, ``I was nominated to join the
party. It was, of course, the greatest honor. The only problem was,
I didn't believe in communism. I'd already decided it works fine on
paper, but in reality people need incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   Her own incentive became escape. With the Berlin Wall not yet
built in 1960 _it would go up the next year _ thousands were
leaving every week. It was enough to get to Berlin and board a
subway to a Western sector. But movement into the capital was
tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a vacation at home in Teuchel, an outlying
district of Wittenberg, Heidi feigned sickness to put off returning
to school and decided to take a train to Berlin, a little over an
hour away. She went to the station with her little brother, Hans,
who kept saying that he wanted to go with her.
</P>
<P>
   They boarded the train, with Hans, as she recalls, clinging to
her. But he was only 16, without qualifications, and, seeing
police, she urged him to get off. In the end she had to prod him as
the train started to lurch forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd never make it,'' she said, ``and I was already
wondering what prison would be like. The police cornered me between
two cars and kept grilling me. And then, for the first time in a
long time, I thought of my father.''
</P>
<P>
   A visit to her long-lost father: That was the reason for her
journey to Berlin. An older policeman _ about her father's age _
listened to the girl's story of estrangement. How she wanted to see
her dad now after so many years. Then, abruptly, after 45 minutes,
he smiled and ordered the interrogation ended, saying, ``Have a
nice trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The voyage would be long. It took her, that night, to West
Berlin: a first Coke, refugee camps, her first 10 West German marks
for giving blood. On to Hanover, then Bavaria, and training as a
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom was real; it was also lonely. She wrote to the
Degenhardts, who invited her to join them in Missouri. The Berlin
Wall had gone up in August 1961. A few weeks later, on Sept. 22,
she flew to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Her road took her from Wittenberg, Saxony-Anhalt, to Wittenberg,
Mo., where the Degenhardts lived. It was one long traveled by
Germans. The American Wittenberg was founded in 1839 by about 700
Lutherans who sailed to the United States after leaving the town
where Martin Luther nailed his explosive theses to the church door.
</P>
<P>
   Wittenberg, on the banks of the Mississippi, is now a ghost
town, destroyed in the flood of 1993. But in Altenburg, a parish
founded at the same time and set on higher ground above the river,
all is neatly ordered around the Lutheran church. Boxes contain
pretty floral arrangements and American-flag pennants.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, in a tightknit, church-dominated community, Heidi
quickly felt at home. What struck her was the absence of fences,
the unlocked doors, the friendliness, the positiveness. A place
free of the shadow of bad German history.
</P>
<P>
   Soon she met Albert Boettcher, known as Junior, president of the
Lutheran youth association, descendant of Germans who had moved to
the area in the 1920s, proud owner of a 1960 Chevy. They were
married in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heidi was always a wild one,'' Boettcher said. ``That's why
she got out and her brother stayed: a question of spirit. She swam
the Mississippi twice, you know, and that's about a mile. Always
she hated authority, regulations, doctors, hospitals, pills. So we
just went right ahead and enjoyed nature.''
</P>
<P>
   To such effect that the Boettchers had 11 children between 1964
and 1984 on their 100-acre Altenburg farm. In Germany, this would
have provided them with something close to a living. The state pays
``kindergeld,'' or child money, for every child regardless of
parents' income. The idea is to encourage child-bearing and support
families.
</P>
<P>
   At a rate of 250 marks per child for the first two children, 300
for the third, and 350 for each subsequent one, the Boettchers
would have been entitled to about $2,000 a month from German
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States they received nothing. ``I never could
bring myself to sit in a county office and ask for some handout
like food stamps,'' Mrs. Boettcher said. ``I know where that kind
of thing leads.''
</P>
<P>
   All the family ever accepted was free school lunches during a
two-year period. Like more than 15 percent of Americans, they never
even had medical insurance. They did not want it, and the children
were generally healthy. When one daughter was sick and
hospitalized, they raised $3,000 through a collection in the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the German sheep yet,'' Boettcher said, ``although
we're trying to play catch-up with President Hillary's universal
health care. More taxes and more programs will kill this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The hypothetical has scant value in history, but Schulz-Netzer
dwells on it. The Berlin Wall went up on Aug. 13, 1961; he
qualified as a mechanic 15 days later. That qualification was what
he had been waiting for to join his sister in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``My handicap was the wall,'' he said, sitting drinking a beer,
his gaze distant. ``If it had gone up three weeks later, I would be
with Heidi. But fate wanted me here.'' And what of his sister's
nudge on the train? ``At that time, I don't think I was ready to
go, anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 years after his birth in 1943, the two grew up in the
same Wittenberg home. But they are so different now, shaped by
opposing cultures, that this shared past seems infinitely remote.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He is full of the caution, the fatalism, the unspoken fears of
Germany; she seems to have been freed of them by a wide-open
continent. ``In God We Trust,'' says the dollar bill, but Germans
have every reason to be suspicious of God's benevolence.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, its traumatic past explains the country's social
safety net. In West Germany, after hyperinflation and Hitler,
social cohesion was worth almost any price. In the East, free day
care centers and regular visits by doctors and dentists to schools
were billed as the gifts of socialism; they also helped secure
compliance to a police state.
</P>
<P>
   But the world has changed. Germany has ceased to be the
treacherous epicenter of the Cold War. It desperately needs more
risk-taking: 8.4 percent of the American adult population has
started a business, against 2.2 percent in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the country's essential difficulty since 1989 has been in
convincing people it might be worthwhile to trade some of the old
and no-longer-affordable security for the rewards of risk.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Schulz-Netzer seems stuck with the old habits. Can-do
is not his motto. For decades he worked in a state company
repairing increasingly obsolete buses. It was dull and repetitive;
it was also absolutely secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd roll up on Monday morning with a headful of alcohol and
know nothing would happen,'' he said. ``It was written right there
in the East German constitution: Every man and woman has the right
and obligation to work.''
</P>
<P>
   And, where possible, work the angles. From time to time,
Schulz-Netzer would be called into his boss' office and some
prominent Communist Party leader would be there needing his car
repaired. On the black, for a quiet payment.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz-Netzer was happy to oblige. Over the years they flocked
to him: party officials, police, state security agents. ``It became
a routine,'' he said. ``They were all so stiff and formal in their
official roles, and then they'd show up at my place and be quite
sympathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   East Germans called such angles their ``lebenstrategie'' _
``life strategy'' for making a bad system bearable. And so,
Schulz-Netzer said, people were lulled. ``We get used to things,''
he said, shrugging. ``We had movies, we had television, we had cars
of a sort, and we even had our own little Florida on the Baltic.''
</P>
<P>
   Was anything missing? He pondered the question for some time.
``Well, we had no incentive to be self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his acquaintances with party officials, he secured
permission to use his moonlighting money to build a house on land
next to his mother's home.
</P>
<P>
   He had to request official approval for the purchase of each
hinge, each doorknob, each tap _ but over a six-year period he got
the job done. That bungalow, completed in 1982, is now his pride
and security.
</P>
<P>
   Other security evaporated when the wall fell in 1989. The car
company struggled through various incarnations before closing in
1997, leaving Schulz-Netzer without a job _ like 21.7 percent of
adults in Saxony-Anhalt, whose population of 2.7 million is about
half that of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple in this society,'' he said. ``If you're over 40,
nobody wants you.'' He has sent out hundreds of job applications,
without luck. Garages, he says, do not want to hire a master
mechanic when they can employ a youth for half the price.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when the wall came down, he had the option of turning
his informal domestic workshop into a real enterprise. He thought
seriously about it. ``But I was 46, and I would have had to go into
debt to be competitive,'' he said. ``It seemed like too much risk,
especially as I have no sons who could inherit the business.''
</P>
<P>
   So he has been living on handouts instead and awaiting a monthly
pension of over $1,000, which begins at 60 if he opts for a
slightly lower payment than he would receive at the official
retirement age of 65. As of next month, he will be on a one-year
state program that will put him to work at odd jobs like cleaning
cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Karin Schulz-Netzer, who lost her job as a
seamstress in 1991, received an early pension after convincing
authorities that she was psychologically troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live all right on our 2,400 marks a month,'' Schulz-Netzer
said. ``I garden, I potter around. I worked for 34 years. This
money we get is money we have earned by paying taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, two years after the wall fell, Mr. and Mrs.
Schulz-Netzer traveled to the United States for the first time. In
New York they missed their connection, and spent one terrified
night in a hotel, not daring to telephone or even urinate.
</P>
<P>
   ``American toilets are different,'' Schulz-Netzer explained.
``The water level is higher, and so we were worried about a
flood.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister could not believe it. ``That is the fear the
communist system engendered,'' Mrs. Boettcher said. ``They were
scared to pee, to sleep, to phone, to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   After this trauma, the reunion in Altenburg was a happy one. But
there was no meeting of the minds. They visited Chicago, and
Schulz-Netzer was appalled by the homeless people he saw. He was
also troubled by the restlessness of Americans. ``It's slower here
in Germany, and I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boettcher says that sometimes she feels she does not even
recognize her brother. She cannot imagine not working and derives
an enormous satisfaction from her baby-sitting business. ``I keep
the kids happy, I am doing something,'' she said. ``And I get
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, now 72, also works hard. Apart from the farm, he is
active in a bovine artificial-insemination business called Genex.
His record, he said, is 2,600 cows bred in a single year. For each
calf, he gets paid. ``It's great business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By almost any estimate, business is better in Missouri than
Saxony-Anhalt. The discrepancy between a 4 percent and a 21.7
percent unemployment rate tells much of the story. In Missouri,
wage costs are about half the German level.
</P>
<P>
   But a central conundrum of European-American relations is that
the American success story of the 1990s may not be exportable, any
more than Schulz-Netzer can be convinced that his sister's active
American life is better than his own state-supported existence.
</P>
<P>
   As Walter of Deutsche Bank put it: ``One thing about Germany
today, and much of Europe, is that if you want to achieve
something, change something, don't say it's the American way.
There's an allergy to American triumphalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But a decade after unification, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has
not yet found another way to convey a reform message that
resonates. A united Germany continues to live beyond its means.
There are 46 pensioners for every 100 active workers today; in 2030
there will be 96 pensioners for every 100.
</P>
<P>
   But of course 2030 is still 30 years away. ``We like the social
line here,'' Schulz-Netzer said. ``In fact, in many ways, we
thought of the old regime as good.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Mornings begin on West Hagert Street at 7, when
Dorsha Mason, 80, crippled and bent by phlebitis and arthritis,
rises from bed in the row house of the north Philadelphia
neighborhood where she has lived for more than half a century,
inches her way across her living room with her walker and opens her
front door.
</P>
<P>
   Her neighbors do not have to worry; the open door says she has
made it through another night.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the block, neighbors echo the signal. Across from
Mrs. Mason, Rachel Lockhart, 83, opens her door, and so does Mary
Little, 80, next to her, and Amanda Riley, 89, two doors down. On
the corner, Katherine Jones, 66, opens hers.
</P>
<P>
   They have lived side by side on this short block of red and
white row houses, most of them, for 40 or 50 years. They raised
their children together, and paid off their mortgages, while
scrubbing other people's floors or working in the factories that
brought tens of thousands of black families here from the South.
</P>
<P>
   They went to church together, singing in the choir and cooking
for the needy. Through it all, they always made time for the
neighborhood, organizing meetings and voter registration drives,
sweeping the streets, planting prize-winning gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with failing hearts and aching backs, they are negotiating
old age together in a neighborhood like many others in
Philadelphia, burdened by poverty, crime and years of neglect by
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all deteriorating,'' said Mrs. Mason, who has outlived
two husbands. Wearing a flowered satin robe and receiving visitors
on a hospital bed that she keeps in her dining room, she threw back
her silvery hair and laughed. ``And I'm the chief deteriorator.''
</P>
<P>
   Though West Hagert Street is considered relatively safe, many
residents have installed triple locks and security bars. Mrs. Riley
still takes a morning walk, but on the advice of a neighbor she has
adjusted her route to avoid drug dealers on 20th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some rough spots,'' Mrs. Riley acknowledged. But she
does not focus on the drug dealers any more than she does on the
arthritis that racks her body. The neighborhood, she said, is not
unlike her life: ``I assume there's going to be rough spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Riley and her neighbors, like most older Americans, are
staying put, not moving to retirement communities. ``Don't move me
from this block,'' declared Mrs. Riley, who still recalls her
elation when she and her husband and their two teen-age sons moved
in on May 20, 1950.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many retirees, Mrs. Riley and her elderly neighbors,
with a few exceptions, could not move if they wanted to. As hard as
they have worked to maintain their row houses, painting regularly
and keeping up with repairs, they have, in a sense, outlived the
neighborhood. They would be lucky to sell their homes for $20,000,
they say. Where could they move with that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our younger people don't want our houses,'' said Geraldine
Cade, 74, who has spent 42 years on West Glenwood Avenue, a block
from West Hagert. ``They don't want to live around the
neighborhood. They want an apartment or a condo.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cade and her neighbors hang on in row houses that were not
built for the old. The bathrooms are on the second floor, up 15
steps. They all know the number; after knee-replacement surgery,
said Theodosia Golson, 73, ``I crawled up those steps.''
</P>
<P>
   They make do with Social Security and modest pensions. They are
sustained, they say, by their faith in God. The traveling they do
is mostly to church and back. At night they stay home, listening to
the radio, watching television and reading their Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   And they look to one another. These neighbors were all
specializing in assisted living _ the informal, unpaid kind _ long
before developers began using the term to attract the affluent
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   At 83, Rachel Lockhart is still working, taking care of other
people's children, but in her free time she bakes pound cakes and
casseroles for people on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Hodge, 79, who lives on Glenwood Street, is not giving
rides the way he used to _ his car is too old, he says, and the
windows have been broken and the tags stolen _ but he says he is
available in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Riley, at 89 the oldest resident on the block, takes care
of her 87-year-old brother, Arthur Hemphill, who had a stroke in
June, and she still helps sweep the street.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mason, who worked as a procurement clerk, purchasing agent
and negotiator for the Navy, says she retired as block captain and
president of the neighborhood association, but she still does the
jobs. She is too crippled to pick up cigarette butts on the street
as she once did, but she pays a neighborhood man, Harry Gathers, a
few dollars to do the job for her.
</P>
<P>
   Gathers, 50, is one of Mrs. Mason's projects. ``Harry has a
problem with self-esteem,'' she said. ``Mrs. Riley and I are
working with Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1990 census, nearly 20 percent of the
neighborhood's residents were 60 or older, and three out of every
10 of those lived at the poverty level. Social workers say some
residents make do on Social Security checks of $500 a month. It is
not the easiest neighborhood to live in at any age.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery on the corner is gone; in its place is a vacant lot.
There is a new Pathmark grocery, part of a rebuilding effort, but
it is eight long blocks away, along a busy avenue, past abandoned
buildings and more vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby drugstore also closed, and residents complain that a
chain drugstore five blocks up the hill is expensive. One benefit
to living in the city, though, is that a bus line passes through
the neighborhood, and people 65 and older ride free.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, the landscape of vacant lots and abandoned
buildings defines one vast north Philadelphia zone.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Mason said of her neighborhood, once so well tended
that even after whites left and factories began to close, it was
known as Upper Society Hill: ``This is not a ghetto. This is a
place where people worked hard to build a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is high, but the neighborhood is home to nurses,
teachers and accountants. Mrs. Mason does not have children, but
she does have plenty of nieces, nephews and cousins who visit
regularly. Mrs. Riley's son Charles, 67, a retired machinery
painter, has moved back home to help his mother.
</P>
<P>
   A block away, James Golson Jr., a high school principal in New
Jersey, has returned to Boston Avenue with his wife and their
6-year-old daughter so he can keep an eye on his parents, James and
Theodosia, who live four doors away in the house where they raised
their five children.
</P>
<P>
   Golson Sr., 84, a retired Navy cook, is a rarity in the
neighborhood. ``Most of the husbands have died,'' Mrs. Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the members of the neighborhood association's board have
also died. Mrs. Little had to give up her post as secretary because
of palsy in her hands. The remaining members do not meet nearly as
often as they used to, but when Mrs. Mason gets on the phone and
calls them together, as she did recently, they are at her door
promptly at the appointed hour, bringing chairs and homemade cakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not where you live,'' Mrs. Mason said, directing the
meeting from her bed, ``it's how you live where you live.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mason moved to the block with her husband in 1943, and when
Mrs. Riley arrived seven years later, Mrs. Mason was one of the
first people at her door. ``She introduced herself as the block
captain,'' Mrs. Riley said. ``She said what we all were expected to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meetings were going to be at her house, and we're going to
keep the block clean,'' Mrs. Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't just keep the block clean; with help from
Philadelphia Green, a nonprofit gardening program, they planted
trees and gardens. ``Everywhere you had a pot, or a tire, or
whatever would hold dirt, it would have flowers in it,'' recalled
Mrs. Riley, who grew up on a farm in Rock Hill, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mason's scrapbooks are filled with photographs of the
flowers that year after year won top prizes from the Pennsylvania
Horticultural Society. There is also a 1972 newspaper clipping
describing West Hagert Street, with its gardens and community
pride, as ``the essence of what urban living can be for the
ordinary citizen who can't afford Society Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mason organized children to help sweep the streets. She ran
an after-school program in her living room. When drugs arrived in
the late '80s, Mrs. Mason and her neighbors formed a community
watch. Mrs. Mason patrolled the streets with an elderly neighbor,
Ora Lee Camp, who lived on 20th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out at 11 p.m. and walked the block till 5 a.m.,''
Mrs. Mason recalled. ``We had nerve. You had to have nerve to do
this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Mrs. Mason was in her 70s and on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all those efforts, the neighborhood declined. There were
drug-related killings on Opal Street. Several houses burned. One
morning Grace Skinner, 77, who lives in the row house where she was
raised, found two bullet holes in her windshield. The flowers were
stolen. Many residents and businesses fled.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mason and her aging neighbors stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured out how to survive with each other,'' said Kim
Camp, the daughter of Ora Lee Camp, who died two years ago at age
74.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before direct deposit they would rob people coming out of the
bank,'' she said, so the neighbors would all go to the bank
together.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how much longer these neighbors can carry
on.
</P>
<P>
   The other afternoon Mrs. Mason was maneuvering from Mrs.
Carter's car to the sidewalk and up the five steps to her front
door. Back from one of her regular hospital visits, she had
neighborhood business to tend to. ``Mrs. Dugue needs help,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Dugue, 77, who lives across the street, had broken her
ankle on her stairs the night before. And she could not afford to
be laid up; she is taking care of three great-grandchildren. Her
granddaughter, Mrs. Dugue said, died of a drug overdose last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mason telephoned Mary Cook, the 70-year-old volunteer
social worker at St. Martin de Porres, the neighborhood Catholic
parish. Fifteen minutes later, Mrs. Cook was at Mrs. Dugue's
bedside.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mason turns 81 on Nov. 17. ``I retired in 1995,'' she keeps
telling people. ``I'm too old to keep doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cook worried aloud: ``Who's going to take over after Mrs.
Mason?'' People in the neighborhood ask the same question. Mrs.
Cade apologizes for not being able to keep up the community garden
the way she used to; her arthritis makes bending over painful.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mrs. Mason's proteges, Kim Camp, is trying to start her
own business. It is hard to get to neighborhood meetings, said Ms.
Camp, who is 43. ``I don't know how they did it,'' she said of her
mother and Mrs. Mason and the others. ``I sit in awe. I don't know
where they got their energy.''

NEW YORK TO SET TOUGH NEW LIMITS ON AUTO EMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y., Calif., Mass., Vt., Maine)  (jw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki of New York will impose new
state vehicle emissions standards that are more stringent than
federal requirements, a step that is expected to help push the
entire auto industry to develop lower-pollution cars, trucks and
vans.
</P>
<P>
   New York will become the second state to accept the standards,
which were adopted by California a year ago; Massachusetts has
signaled that it is also likely to do so. The standards would begin
in the 2004 model year, becoming stricter with each year until, in
2010, they would require new cars to produce less than half the
pollution that is put out by new cars being sold now. The reduction
for trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans would be greater.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and New York officials predicted that the
alliance with California and Massachusetts, which accounts for
about one-fourth of the national vehicle market, could effectively
set a new national standard, because automakers are loath to build
the same cars to more than one standard for different states.
</P>
<P>
   ``California and New York are the two largest vehicle markets,
so what they do has incredible importance for the entire auto
industry,'' said Richard Kassel, senior lawyer at the Natural
Resources Defense Council, an environmental group in Washington.
``New York effectively sets the standard for the whole Northeast,
and that, in turn, helps set the standard for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday, Pataki said, ``With New York and
California, it clearly will have the critical mass, and we hope
that other states will look at this and say this is the right thing
to do.'' He and his aides said they could take the action
administratively, though there was little doubt that the
Legislature would go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption of the California program, combined with a plan the
governor announced last month to hold New York's power plants to
the strictest air emissions limits in the country, positions Pataki
as a national leader in combating air pollution. ``He's well ahead
of almost everyone in this area,'' said David Wooley, counsel to
the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalism has been a central part of the political appeal
of Pataki, a Republican, in a state where conservation is a popular
cause and Democrats outnumber Republicans a 3-2 ratio. But it is
also an issue that has put the governor at odds with his
counterparts in other states, particularly over his demand that
power plants in the Midwest and South reduce their emissions. After
years of pressure from northeastern states, the federal
Environmental Protection Agency filed suit on Wednesday to force
the cleanup of those plants.
</P>
<P>
   The California vehicle program sets a ``fleet'' standard that
each manufacturer is required to meet, in broad weight classes,
rather than in each model. A manufacturer can have some vehicles
that exceed the standard, and others below it, so long as all the
vehicles it sells in a given class, on average, meet the
requirement for that class. If not, it faces heavy fines.
</P>
<P>
   For the main category of vehicles _ which includes almost all
passenger cars and light trucks, and some minivans and sport
utility vehicles _ the original program required automakers to
attain a fleet average for the 1995 model year of producing no more
than 0.231 grams per mile of a group of pollutants called
``nonmethane organic gases.'' For the 2000 model year now being
sold, the limit has been lowered to 0.073, and by 2003, the ceiling
would be fixed at 0.062.
</P>
<P>
   The new program would drop the limit to .035 for the 2010 model
year.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has proposed a national set of limits, known as Tier 2,
that would impose a fleet maximum of 0.06 for that same category of
vehicles for the next decade. But even if that program is adopted,
as is expected, federal law allows the states to go with the
California program.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our viewpoint, we believe that the federal Tier 2 program
provides all the emissions benefits that a state needs,'' said
Gloria Berquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry does not consider the California standards
unattainable, she said. Rather, she said, ``It's a problem of
having a patchwork quilt of different standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The California program demands even greater reductions for
heavier vehicles _ trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans weighing
more than 3,750 pounds _ by dropping the fleet average from the
current 0.099 to 0.043 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, it expands the standards to apply to the very
heaviest vehicles, which were exempted from the original program.
Under the federal Tier 2 proposal, trucks weighing more than 6,000
pounds could average 0.09 grams, more than double the eventual
California standard.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, recent events have reprised the history of the
original California emissions program, enacted in the early 1990s,
which produced a national tightening of tailpipe emissions
standards.
</P>
<P>
   At first, some automakers complained that the requirements were
impossible to meet. Then, they signaled that in many cases, they
would make one version of each model for the national market, and
another, cleaner version for the California market. In an effort to
persuade other states not to join California, the industry
voluntarily adopted its own set of standards that were stricter
than those demanded by the federal government, but fell short of
California's.
</P>
<P>
   But after New York, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine took the
California rules as their own, the industry began building most
models for sale nationwide to meet California requirements. A
handful of states had set a de facto standard nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has always been critical to the effectiveness of the
California standard,'' said Wooley, the environmental lawyer. ``If
you have one isolated market, even one as big as California, it's
much less likely to drive the national standards than if you have
the two major markets on both coasts.''
</P>
<P>
   The California program ostensibly requires that by 2003, 10
percent of the cars and light trucks sold in the participating
states be zero-emission _ presumably electric _ vehicles. But in
fact, manufacturers are permitted, and expected, to skirt that
mandate with additional reductions in their fleetwide emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The new California program retains the 10 percent zero-emissions
requirement, but this time, many industry analysts believe that by
2010, there really will be mass production of electric vehicles.

   FARGO, N.D. _ To Scott Halley, there was never any question that
he was meant to be a farmer, his life forever set to the rhythms of
planting and harvesting wheat.
</P>
<P>
   But the balance sheet told another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the numbers at the end of the pencil,'' said
Halley, 44, ``and you realize it's time to try something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   With a heavy heart, but a clear head, Halley recently joined a
growing trend of American farmers who are voluntarily leaving
agriculture rather than lose money year after year. But what has
surprised many of them is that the transition to urban life has
been so successful. Businesses are eager to hire farmers, who are
often well educated and highly skilled as managers. And their
families often relish the social and cultural offerings in places
where the lights shine brighter.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, nearly half of all Americans lived on farms and
ranches. Now fewer than 1 in 100 people farm. The winnowing of
their numbers has been chiefly a matter of the food supply
exceeding demand; technological advances, from tractors to
computers, have allowed each acre of land to produce more and more
bushels of grain.
</P>
<P>
   While the resulting decrease in crop prices benefits consumers,
farmers are struggling to survive. Operating on slim margins, only
the largest farms stand a chance of turning a reasonable profit.
Thousands of small farmers sell out every week, typically to a much
larger agricultural enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving his family's farm in remote Bisbee a year ago to
work as a soil scientist at North Dakota State University here,
Halley has seen the family's income double to more than $40,000.
And the Halleys' three children, who feared leaving rural life and
starting over in suburban West Fargo, have thrived academically and
socially in their new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids would never want to go back now,'' said Halley. ``The
telephone never stops ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study at Iowa State University found that former
farmers have largely succeeded in building satisfying new lives and
sound financial foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that there is life after farming,'' said Fred
Lorenz, a sociologist who worked on the study, which is to be
published in the journal Rural Sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State has begun a program that helps farmers move into
other jobs. While farmers often walk away from the fields with deep
feelings of dejection and failure, they have highly marketable
skills, including working on computers, dealing with financial
markets and running a business. Many farmers under age 50 are
college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers underestimate their market potential,'' said Bruce
Babcock, an agricultural economist at Iowa State. ``They have a
skill package that's in demand. It's just a matter of convincing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But even for those who found good jobs, leaving farming exacts a
profound emotional toll, made all the more keen since farmers are
surrendering a way of life that has often been carried on for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about making money, but about having a life that
is meaningful,'' said Dr. Michael Rosmann, a farmer and
psychologist who counsels farmers. ``For most of them, that
grieving lasts for the rest of their lives. To make the decision to
quit farming, to do what's best for the family, takes an awful lot
of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Halley, who tended land that had been homesteaded by his wife's
grandfather, feels the pull of the land every day. Once a week he
drives eight hours to work a portion of the farm that has not been
rented to other farmers, just to sustain the bond for a day.
Halley, who earned an economics degree in 1978, is working on
completing a master's degree. His wife, Denise, works for a catalog
company in Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed on their farm, the Halleys needed to get about $100
from an acre. Nearly 70 percent of that cost was tied to planting _
buying the crop, paying for fertilizer, maintaining machines;
another 10 percent went for overhead and interest payments on the
$130,000 debt for machinery. But with wheat selling for $2.40 a
bushel, with 30 bushels an acre, the Halleys were falling far
short.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said farmers often succumb to a crisis mode of thinking
_ ``If I can just hang on for one more year, maybe things will get
better.'' Too often the result is a draining of resources until
nothing is left, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today grain prices are at their lowest levels in more than 10
years, even without adjusting for inflation. Farm aid packages
enacted by Congress in the last two years have helped some farmers
stave off failure. Despite the hard times, farmers have not been
whipsawed by the terrible conditions of the 1980s, when land values
fell sharply, interest rates soared and many banks called in their
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The number of full-time farmers in the country has been falling
since the 1930s, to less than 1 million. Iowa alone is losing some
1,500 farmers a year, Babcock said. The typical Iowa farmer earns
between $25,000 and $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Iowa's farmers commute to jobs in offices or
factories. It has become unusual for any farm to survive without
some non-farm paycheck, often provided by a wife.
</P>
<P>
   In the Iowa State study of farmers who left the land, incomes
rose, and measures of stress and symptoms of depression declined,
among children as well as parents.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Halley, 13, who transferred from a class of 30 at Rock
Lake School to a class of 400 at West Fargo Middle School, spoke
with excitement about the courses in her new school. She especially
likes art, which was not offered at Rock Lake, and computer
technology. Back on the farm, she said, the antiquated phone system
took five minutes or more just to dial up to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool here,'' said Megan, who now shops at a nearby Gap,
rollerblades at Skateland and finds the latest releases of one of
her favorite band, Savage Gardens, at the record outlet. The
closest store to the Halleys' Bisbee farm is a 10-mile drive.
</P>
<P>
   Megan had worried she might not fit in with the young people in
her new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys here aren't any different than back in the country,''
she said. ``There's just a lot more of them.''

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Diplomacy. Sanctions. Bombs. There isn't much the
Clinton administration hasn't tried to rid itself of Saddam Hussein
and Slobodan Milosevic. Now, suddenly, Congress is handing the
administration tens of millions of dollars and demanding that it to
do more.
</P>
<P>
   And so the administration has responded by offering one of the
things it does best: mounting political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq and Serbia, American taxpayer dollars have begun flowing
into the campaign coffers of opposition political parties that, at
best, are sharply divided and even, in the case of the Iraqis, were
at war with one another not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   As it would in America, the money is paying for the nuts and
bolts of campaign organizing _ from office space to telephones to
high-priced consultants. In Serbia, money has gone to that staple
of American politics, polling.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long lent moral support and money to
political parties overseas, but the scale and ambition of the
efforts in Iraq and Serbia are staggering. In each case, the
administration and Congress are talking about spending as much as
Vice President Al Gore (or former Sen. Bill Bradley) is expected to
spend (more than $100 million) running for the most powerful
political office in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO's air war over Kosovo ended, the administration has
spent nearly $12 million to support Milosevic's political opponents
in Serbia, as well as to nurture independent media and labor
unions. On Thursday, the Senate approved a bill (introduced by the
staunchly anti-interventionist Jesse Helms) to spend up to $100
million more over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   What does this kind of money buy?
</P>
<P>
   In its support of Saddam's fractious opponents, the
administration has spent $8 million this year, most of it just in
trying to get the opposition leaders to work together, let alone
work together against Saddam. Among other things, it has hired the
public relations firm Burson-Marsteller USA and has paid a
Virginia-based firm, Quality Support Inc., to organize conventions,
including a gathering of some 300 opposition leaders in New York
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also announced that it would give the groups
the first $5 million of $97 million in military equipment and
training that Congress authorized last year to speed the overthrow
of Saddam. But instead of surplus weapons and gear like boots, as
Congress called for in the Iraq Liberation Act, the Pentagon is
sending desks, computers and fax machines needed to equip an office
and begin spewing out pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's approach has evoked ridicule on Capitol
Hill and disappointment from those it is supposed to help. Rep.
Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, the Republican chairman of the
House International Relations Committee, derided the idea that
Iraqi exiles ``brandishing fax machines'' could topple Saddam; he
has called for genuine military, not just political, support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only conclude the administration is not very serious
about the policy President Clinton announced with regard to
replacing Saddam's regime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials concede that political support alone is unlikely to
topple two rulers who have tight grips on their countries. American
assistance, after all, can be a double-edged sword, providing help
to opposition politicians but also exposing them to anti-American
backlash. Last week, officials in Serbia and Iraq denounced
opponents who were meeting with American officials, calling them
puppets of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the opposition leaders are divided, often
bitterly so. Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said he
would offer this advice to Milosevic's opponents in Serbia: ``Maybe
you can have a pause in your macho behavior'' until after
elections. ``Then you can hate each other again in a democratic
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the strategy is a political bind: The administration has
been forced to respond to growing frustration in Congress,
particularly among Republicans, that two demonized foes have
managed to survive and, potentially, to pose new threats. At the
same time, though, there is no Congressional or public support for
using the American military to do the job, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   That means political support may be the only option left. ``What
else can we do?'' one State Department official asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said he supported the
efforts to aid opponents but warned that the United States risked
setting itself a dangerous trap: supporting the opposition leaders,
without having the will to support them militarily if Milosevic or
Saddam turn on them violently.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened in 1996 when Saddam's forces
crushed a cell of dissidents in northern Iraq who were supported by
the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big nations can't bluff,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, administration officials hope that openly
supporting what amount to political campaigns could lead to
peaceful, political transformations. ``In the case of Yugoslavia,
from 1991 on, that assumption has been that politics in some form
would probably be the device that would bring about change,'' James
F. Dobbins, the president's special envoy to the Balkans, said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is another question. Few officials expect American
assistance to have an immediate impact. Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, a Democrat, said that the internal divisions in the
Iraqi opposition and Saddam's ironclad control over the country's
political system and security apparatus, were formidable barriers
to change. ``No one,'' Kerry said, ``should have unrealistic
expectations about what this can accomplish.''

   WASHINGTON _ Diplomacy. Sanctions. Bombs. There isn't much the
Clinton administration hasn't tried to rid itself of Saddam Hussein
and Slobodan Milosevic. Now, suddenly, Congress is handing the
administration tens of millions of dollars and demanding that it to
do more.
</P>
<P>
   And so the administration has responded by offering one of the
things it does best: mounting political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq and Serbia, American taxpayer dollars have begun flowing
into the campaign coffers of opposition political parties that, at
best, are sharply divided and even, in the case of the Iraqis, were
at war with one another not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   As it would in America, the money is paying for the nuts and
bolts of campaign organizing _ from office space to telephones to
high-priced consultants. In Serbia, money has gone to that staple
of American politics, polling.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long lent moral support and money to
political parties overseas, but the scale and ambition of the
efforts in Iraq and Serbia are staggering. In each case, the
administration and Congress are talking about spending as much as
Vice President Al Gore (or former Sen. Bill Bradley) is expected to
spend (more than $100 million) running for the most powerful
political office in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO's air war over Kosovo ended, the administration has
spent nearly $12 million to support Milosevic's political opponents
in Serbia, as well as to nurture independent media and labor
unions. On Thursday, the Senate approved a bill (introduced by the
staunchly anti-interventionist Jesse Helms) to spend up to $100
million more over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   What does this kind of money buy?
</P>
<P>
   In its support of Saddam's fractious opponents, the
administration has spent $8 million this year, most of it just in
trying to get the opposition leaders to work together, let alone
work together against Saddam. Among other things, it has hired the
public relations firm Burson-Marsteller USA and has paid a
Virginia-based firm, Quality Support Inc., to organize conventions,
including a gathering of some 300 opposition leaders in New York
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also announced that it would give the groups
the first $5 million of $97 million in military equipment and
training that Congress authorized last year to speed the overthrow
of Saddam. But instead of surplus weapons and gear like boots, as
Congress called for in the Iraq Liberation Act, the Pentagon is
sending desks, computers and fax machines needed to equip an office
and begin spewing out pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's approach has evoked ridicule on Capitol
Hill and disappointment from those it is supposed to help. Rep.
Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, the Republican chairman of the
House International Relations Committee, derided the idea that
Iraqi exiles ``brandishing fax machines'' could topple Saddam; he
has called for genuine military, not just political, support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only conclude the administration is not very serious
about the policy President Clinton announced with regard to
replacing Saddam's regime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials concede that political support alone is unlikely to
topple two rulers who have tight grips on their countries. American
assistance, after all, can be a double-edged sword, providing help
to opposition politicians but also exposing them to anti-American
backlash. Last week, officials in Serbia and Iraq denounced
opponents who were meeting with American officials, calling them
puppets of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the opposition leaders are divided, often
bitterly so. Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said he
would offer this advice to Milosevic's opponents in Serbia: ``Maybe
you can have a pause in your macho behavior'' until after
elections. ``Then you can hate each other again in a democratic
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the strategy is a political bind: The administration has
been forced to respond to growing frustration in Congress,
particularly among Republicans, that two demonized foes have
managed to survive and, potentially, to pose new threats. At the
same time, though, there is no Congressional or public support for
using the American military to do the job, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   That means political support may be the only option left. ``What
else can we do?'' one State Department official asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said he supported the
efforts to aid opponents but warned that the United States risked
setting itself a dangerous trap: supporting the opposition leaders,
without having the will to support them militarily if Milosevic or
Saddam turn on them violently.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened in 1996 when Saddam's forces
crushed a cell of dissidents in northern Iraq who were supported by
the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big nations can't bluff,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, administration officials hope that openly
supporting what amount to political campaigns could lead to
peaceful, political transformations. ``In the case of Yugoslavia,
from 1991 on, that assumption has been that politics in some form
would probably be the device that would bring about change,'' James
F. Dobbins, the president's special envoy to the Balkans, said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is another question. Few officials expect American
assistance to have an immediate impact. Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, a Democrat, said that the internal divisions in the
Iraqi opposition and Saddam's ironclad control over the country's
political system and security apparatus, were formidable barriers
to change. ``No one,'' Kerry said, ``should have unrealistic
expectations about what this can accomplish.''

TROUBLED LOS ANGELES SCHOOLS PROJECT DRAINS FUNDS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Los Angeles) -- While the environmentally troubled Belmont
Learning Center places an unprecedented drain on Los Angeles
Unified's general fund, teachers, students and parents districtwide
say they lack necessary programs and materials.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's costliest high school _ unlike other school
construction projects _ is being built largely with general fund
money normally used for textbooks, supplies and paying salaries. To
date, the district has invested $170 million in Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Four of seven board members have said they lean toward voting
Nov. 19 to abandon Belmont because of serious contamination
problems, which would free up $142 million almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see _ what would I want'' said Principal Bob Kladifko at
Reseda High School, before rattling off a laundry list of items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Included on my wish list would be textbooks, library books,
any and all instructional materials. I'd also like a salary
increase for staff _ both teachers and classified employees; money
for professional development, and something to help improve student
achievement on the Stanford 9 and enhance standards-based
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the uppermost things that come to mind. Hmm, did I
forget anything? We need just about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Frydman, principal at Frost Middle School in Granada
Hills, said he would use some of the $142 million to boost starting
teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But first he wants back the $200,000 the district took out of
the $350,000 his school earned last year for improved attendance.
The district told him it needed the money for special education
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big B word never came up,'' said Frydman, referring to
Belmont. He said he would use that amount to finish buying books
and computers for his school.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Gonzalez, who directs the parent center at Polytechnic
High School in Sun Valley, said she would spend the money on
computers for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our students are our future and they need these skills,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Ramirez, an Arleta resident with one son at Canterbury
School and another at Sepulveda Middle School, said she would scrap
Belmont immediately on safety grounds even though ``so many schools
are overpopulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Mocking the administrative chaos that had engulfed the
district's downtown headquarters in recent weeks and culminating
with Superintendent Ruben Zacarias' $750,000 contract buyout, the
wishes of many staffers drifted toward fantastical and sarcastic
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   A few district employees suggested using the Belmont money to
buy a luxury box at the new Staples Center downtown to wine and
dine potential candidates vying to become the new superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Others pointed out the school district could recruit its very
own aspiring baseball legend in center fielder in Ken Griffey Jr.
The baseball superstar just turned down an eight-year, $135 million
offer from the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're throwing so much money around downtown, signing
Griffey isn't that far of a stretch,'' said a San Fernando Valley
principal who asked to remain unnamed. ``They should start taking
care of the kids in the classrooms. It's not like the kids have
everything they need.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last two years, the state has repeatedly refused to
give the district funding for the school partially built downtown
atop an oil field that seeps deadly and explosive gases.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa,
D-Los Angeles, told the district not to expect the state to give it
``a dime'' for Belmont. Typically, the state pays for at least 50
percent of the costs to construct public schools, using bond money
and other revenue, with the rest coming from local bond money.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the district's downtown bureaucrats were adamant
they were sticking close to the ``guaranteed maximum price,''
arguing the entire school could be built for about $170 million.
</P>
<P>
   As the Daily News' ongoing investigation of the school continued
to expose hidden costs, the district revealed on Oct. 7 that $170
million already had been spent with the school years away from
completion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a majority of the school board has indicated that they are
leaning toward scrapping Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Caprice Young, Julie Korenstein and David Tokofsky
have pledged to vote against building the school. Board President
Genethia Hayes said she is not convinced the site can be made safe,
and Mike Lansing and Valerie Fields are withholding their position.
Victoria Castro remains a supporter of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The board is awaiting a final report from the Belmont
Commission, detailing the reasoning behind the panel's
recommendation on a 4-3 to finish the school.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the commission's report contains drastically new
information about the safety of the site, which is unexpected,
sources close to the board said they expect construction to be
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there are four definite votes against it,'' said one
board member. ``I'd say at least five people are going to vote to
not go forward.

NEIGHBORS COMPLAIN ABOUT NOISE FROM CHURCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Michael Coit  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES-- Ministers with microphones moved among the pews
one recent Sunday at Iglesia Apostolica de North Hollywood and
delivered forceful Bible readings punctuated by testimonials.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 congregants sang hymns inspiring some to shake
tambourines and others to clap loudly. The rhythms backed music
from an amplified electronic keyboard, guitar and trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church, the sound is uplifting. Outside, it's a
nuisance, say residents who say the noise reverberates throughout
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Love thy neighbor is the message people on Lamkins Street want
to convey to their noisy neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But church leaders, who lease the sanctuary from Sun Valley
United Methodist Church and its Tongan congregation, said they have
toned down services as much as they can.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they are reluctant to crack down on the
church in the Los Angeles community of Sun Valley because of legal
issues arising from regulating religion. This place of celebration
now has become a center of controversy _ and a precedent-setting
case for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churches are still subject to the nuisance abatement
provisions,'' said Horace Tramel, an associate zoning administrator
for the city Planning Department. ``There can be issues as far as
practicing their religion that may be subject to constitutional
protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is a sensitive use,'' he noted. ``It's not a
liquor store, prostitution or a motel.''
</P>
<P>
   What began as a dispute with the Tongan Methodist congregation
over singing and gatherings in the parsonage down the street became
a greater battle with the larger Spanish-language congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty lively church,'' said the Rev. Carlos
Alvarez, the lead pastor. ``It's part of our devotion. Worship is
an expression of gratitude, and we use music because the Bible
talks about using musical instruments. It wouldn't be the same
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have responded to neighbors' complaints nearly 40 times
since the spring of 1997. Officers have noted noise and traffic
problems, but church leaders have responded, and no citations have
been issued, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Residents remain upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear it at the end of the block. I have a friend who
has to close up her house to hear the television,'' said Frances
Engle, who is leading the neighbors' battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's their religious right,'' Engle said. ``They
don't seem to be Christian enough to respect neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediation brokered by the office of City Councilman Joel Wachs
in July 1998 brought a respite. But within months, leaders from the
two churches and the neighbors were charging each other with not
honoring the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors sought relief in small claims court in May. But
the judge declined, without explanation, to impose any restrictions
or award monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Next, neighbors sought help from the city Office of Zoning
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   City ordinances were amended two years ago to include churches,
temples and other religious uses in laws against public nuisances.
Since then, the city has set restrictions on churches, including
that they keep doors and windows closed and turning down amplified
music, Tramel said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits.
</P>
<P>
   If church leaders have controlled noise, Tramel said
constitutional protections limit restrictions on services, such as
limiting evening services or banning music. Closing the church is
not a likely option.
</P>
<P>
   The zoning process and appeals can run a year or more. City
officials have visited the neighborhood, and police are preparing a
report, but no public hearing has been set.
</P>
<P>
   With the churches and neighbors showing no signs of yielding in
the meantime, the conflict won't end anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both churches keep saying, It's our culture, it's our culture.
They think they have all the rights. They will not respect us,''
said Engle, speaking for the 11 church neighbors involved in the
fight. ``These people have to be forced. They won't cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Heightening the tension are charges of racial bias in an
increasingly diverse part of the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still complain, and I believe nothing will satisfy them
unless we are out of there,'' said the Rev. Sione Veikoso, minister
of the Methodist church. ``It's not the services, it's not the
music, it's the people that come to the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really unfortunate to see that in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments bother residents on the block-long street of small
homes with fenced yards.
</P>
<P>
   John Clark, a retired Lockheed worker, moved with his wife onto
Lamkins Street when it was still a dusty road with only three homes
and the original Methodist church in 1948. Clark said he has a
quarrel with churches that are noisy and create traffic problems,
not with the Valley's changing faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like this area. We've got some friends still on the
street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the rights of a church, but they're not being
neighbors like the churches we used to know,'' Clark said. ``To
have it suddenly go this way was quite bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quiet neighborhood. They just kind of took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Methodists have been congregating for services on the corner of
Lamkins and Sunland Boulevard for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The current sanctuary, built in 1962, recalls a different time.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural features of the modern style popular then include
the wood beam roof, bowed inward and resembling a grounded sailing
ship upside down. There are rounded, high-backed wood pews and a
circular communion rail with a rounded wood cross in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The capacity for 200 suggests the congregation's size before
members aged or moved from the area. Their numbers dwindled until
the Tongan Methodists took over in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Veikoso said there are 15 Tongan families, including some 70
children, in the slowly growing congregation. ``The future of the
church looks great. That is, of course, if the neighbors will be
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   While their services aren't bothersome, the Tongans clashed with
neighbors by holding choir practices and late night social
gatherings in the parsonage.
</P>
<P>
   Veikoso acknowledged they were loud and disruptive. Those
activities were moved to the church under the mediation agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But neighbors still complain about large Tongan gatherings on
the church grounds, including an annual fund-raising feast in
November that draws more than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said they also are frustrated that the Methodists
don't exercise more control over the larger, louder Apostolic
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the amplification so you can be heard. We don't think
we're that loud,'' Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   There's still too much noise and traffic for Clark and his
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could keep it down to a small roar, that wouldn't be
so bad,'' he said. ``But you can hear them down the block, and you
have them three or four times a week.''

HOLLYWOOD TO FIRE UP CAMERAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dave McNary  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Los Angeles) -- Hollywood producers looking to put a little
heat into their shoots should head north to Kern County.
</P>
<P>
   The central California county's film commission is inviting
entertainment producers to accompany fire crews as they stage a
controlled burn in the remote Black Mountain region of north Kern
County anytime in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service wants to rid the area of about 600 acres
of dense undergrowth. But in a rare gesture to Hollywood, the
Forest Service will allow cameras to shoot close-up footage of what
will appear to be a raging forest fire. The burns will be
supervised by several dozen firefighters _ presumably off-camera _
equipped with fire engines and a fire-fighting helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity to get stock footage since people
don't usually have this kind of access during an actual fire,''
said the commission's Dave Hook, who has already received nearly a
dozen inquiries from production companies and free-lancers to film
the fire. ``From what we hear, this kind of footage isn't available
very much of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Emling, chairman of the Association of Film Commissioners
International, said the idea is both smart and unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty astute of the commission to recognize that
people in the film world will want to take advantage of a
controlled situation to get fire footage,'' said Emling, who heads
the Mississippi film commission. He noted that other commissions
have helped producers film floods and building demolitions, but the
Kern County offer was the first such arrangement involving what
will look like an out-of-control wild fire.
</P>
<P>
   Also offered will be a chance to shoot operation of the
``heli-torch,'' a napalm-fueled contraption strapped on the bottom
of a helicopter to start up fires in relatively inaccessible areas.
``The heli-torch alone is worth getting,'' Hook noted.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the commission has decided to waive any charges for
a filming permit and is negotiating with the Forest Service over
how much to charge. ``The fee will depend on the size of the crew
and will probably be fairly nominal, maybe in the $50 range,'' Hook
said.
</P>
<P>
   All this will occur only 100 miles away from Los Angeles and is
being offered by the commission with the goal of enhancing Kern
County's reputation as a producer-friendly location.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been filming up here since the days of `The Keystone
Cops,''' Hooks said, noting that recent productions in central
California county include ``City of Angels,'' ``Deep Impact,''
``Armageddon'' and ``The X-Files Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The date of the burn is not yet pinned down. ``We probably won't
know for certain until a day or two before because the weather
conditions have to be idea,'' said the commission's Aimee Barajas.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kleinman, who serves as the Forest Service's ``burn master''
in the Sequoia Forest, said the four-to-five day ``prescribed
burn'' between the communities of Wofford Heights and Alta Sierra
could begin around mid-November. He noted that planning has been
complicated by many firefighters being out of the area working on
other blazes and by having to clear the planning with the federal
Bureau of Land Management and Kern County officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of coordination so we're hoping to have
everything in place in two weeks,'' said Kleinman, who met in
September with residents of Wofford Heights and Alta Sierra to
placate any fears about the burn.
</P>
<P>
   The area has not seen a fire for more than four decades and has
become choked with dead vegetation as a result. ``To get through,
you either have to crawl or use a chain saw,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the fires, which will be designed to burn in a
checkerboard or mosaic pattern, will achieve the twin goals of
making it easier to fight subsequent blazes and allowing wildlife
to return to the area. Kleinman said the Forest Service will be
particularly mindful of preventing the fires from getting out of
control, which means waiting for the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a fire is active and burning well, we'll take it slow and
easy,'' he said. ``We may have only two hours each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though setting huge fires sounds far out of the ordinary,
Kleinman's office conducts at least one chaparral burn per year.
The Sequoia Forest was also the setting two years ago for scenes of
actual firefighting that were shot for the current Imax movie,
``Wildfire _ Feel the Heat.''

</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty astute of the commission to recognize that
people in the film world will want to take advantage of a
controlled situation to get fire footage,'' said Emling, who heads
the Mississippi film commission. He noted that other commissions
have helped producers film floods and building demolitions, but the
Kern County offer was the first such arrangement involving what
will look like an out-of-control wild fire.
</P>
<P>
   Also offered will be a chance to shoot operation of the
``heli-torch,'' a napalm-fueled contraption strapped on the bottom
of a helicopter to start up fires in relatively inaccessible areas.
``The heli-torch alone is worth getting,'' Hook noted.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the commission has decided to waive any charges for
a filming permit and is negotiating with the Forest Service over
how much to charge. ``The fee will depend on the size of the crew
and will probably be fairly nominal, maybe in the $50 range,'' Hook
said.
</P>
<P>
   All this will occur only 100 miles away from Los Angeles and is
being offered by the commission with the goal of enhancing Kern
County's reputation as a producer-friendly location.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been filming up here since the days of `The Keystone
Cops,''' Hooks said, noting that recent productions in central
California county include ``City of Angels,'' ``Deep Impact,''
``Armageddon'' and ``The X-Files Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The date of the burn is not yet pinned down. ``We probably won't
know for certain until a day or two before because the weather
conditions have to be idea,'' said the commission's Aimee Barajas.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kleinman, who serves as the Forest Service's ``burn master''
in the Sequoia Forest, said the four-to-five day ``prescribed
burn'' between the communities of Wofford Heights and Alta Sierra
could begin around mid-November. He noted that planning has been
complicated by many firefighters being out of the area working on
other blazes and by having to clear the planning with the federal
Bureau of Land Management and Kern County officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of coordination so we're hoping to have
everything in place in two weeks,'' said Kleinman, who met in
September with residents of Wofford Heights and Alta Sierra to
placate any fears about the burn.
</P>
<P>
   The area has not seen a fire for more than four decades and has
become choked with dead vegetation as a result. ``To get through,
you either have to crawl or use a chain saw,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the fires, which will be designed to burn in a
checkerboard or mosaic pattern, will achieve the twin goals of
making it easier to fight subsequent blazes and allowing wildlife
to return to the area. Kleinman said the Forest Service will be
particularly mindful of preventing the fires from getting out of
control, which means waiting for the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a fire is active and burning well, we'll take it slow and
easy,'' he said. ``We may have only two hours each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though setting huge fires sounds far out of the ordinary,
Kleinman's office conducts at least one chaparral burn per year.
The Sequoia Forest was also the setting two years ago for scenes of
actual firefighting that were shot for the current Imax movie,
``Wildfire _ Feel the Heat.''

HOLLYWOOD TO FIRE UP CAMERAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Los Angeles) -- Hollywood producers looking to put a little
heat into their shoots should head north to Kern County.
</P>
<P>
   The central California county's film commission is inviting
entertainment producers to accompany fire crews as they stage a
controlled burn in the remote Black Mountain region of north Kern
County anytime in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service wants to rid the area of about 600 acres
of dense undergrowth. But in a rare gesture to Hollywood, the
Forest Service will allow cameras to shoot close-up footage of what
will appear to be a raging forest fire. The burns will be
supervised by several dozen firefighters _ presumably off-camera _
equipped with fire engines and a fire-fighting helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity to get stock footage since people
don't usually have this kind of access during an actual fire,''
said the commission's Dave Hook, who has already received nearly a
dozen inquiries from production companies and free-lancers to film
the fire. ``From what we hear, this kind of footage isn't available
very much of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Emling, chairman of the Association of Film Commissioners
International, said the idea is both smart and unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty astute of the commission to recognize that

   TEHRAN, Iran _ High on the slopes of the Alborz mountains above
the smog-choked heart of Tehran, million-dollar townhouses and
condominiums have sprung up just below the sprawling estate that
housed the shah's winter palace. Here, in the suburbs, is the
Beverley Hills of Iran, an area of high, white walls that give onto
homes with magnificent panoramas, lush gardens and swimming pools.
It is a surreal setting, the kind Antonioni might have chosen for a
film, encoded with messages about the very strange society Iran has
become after 20 years of Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Side by side, living as neighbors, are representatives of the
main protagonists in a struggle for Iran's soul. There are the
``formerly privileged,'' in the contemptuous phrase the ruling
clerics use for the old bourgeoisie. There are the new rich, many
of them from the old merchant class, who have built fortunes from
favors granted by the clerics in return for support during the
revolution of 1979. And there are the mullahs themselves, clerics
who have taken over properties confiscated from those among the old
ruling class who did not survive the upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   It was here, last weekend, in a nondescript office building
constructed in the grounds of a confiscated mansion, beside an
empty swimming pool, that the ruling clerics convened a trial that
has become a tableau for the wider struggle going on across Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In the dock was Abdullah Nouri, himself a cleric and until
recently a vice president of the Islamic republic. But it was hard
not to notice a second trial as well: It could be called The People
vs. The Clergy. Even as Mohammed Salimi, a white-turbaned cleric,
starchily admonishes Nouri to show proper respect, millions of
Iranians are judging the court itself, through the blanket press
coverage Iranian newspapers are giving the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri is a man who has helped to shape and lead a reform
movement that aims at curbing the clergy's absolute power. He is
charged before the Iranian equivalent of the Inquisition, the
Special Court for the Clergy, with being an apostate.
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing has Nouri, 50, been called the Martin Luther of
Iran. Like Luther, Nouri nailed his principles where the clerical
establishment could not ignore them _ in the pages of the country's
most widely circulated reformist newspaper, Khordad, which Nouri
controls. Among other things, he is charged with ``insulting the
sanctities of Islam'' by advocating political reforms that would
undermine the principle of clerical rule. In particular, he would
establish the sovereign right of Iran's 65 million people to choose
their governments, and he is urging the re-establishment of
relations between Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a 44-page indictment that reads like an encyclopedia of
treachery, articles in Khordad are cited as proof that Nouri's
conspiracy to subvert the revolution even extended to advocating
clapping and cheering in public, a taboo under Islamic laws, and to
``propagating'' on behalf of Farah Diba, the shah's widow, by
supporting another newspaper's decision to publish excerpts from
her New Year's greeting to Iran's people.
</P>
<P>
   But after only a week of testimony, many Iranians, and clearly
Nouri himself, have concluded that the trial's significance lies
not in the verdict, but in how it has come to represent the chasm
that has opened up within Iranian society.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being conducted, bizarrely, in the lobby of the
court building, with reporters perched on a winding staircase to
the upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   It may be years before the world will know which represents the
``real'' Iran _ the medieval process initiated by the mullahs
against the reformer, or the breezy, late 20th-century atmosphere
that invades the courtroom, of reporters in jeans and boat shoes,
with mobile phones, lounging against walls and reading reformist
newspapers replete with articles about the New York Yankees' World
Series triumph and the growing power of internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But to an outsider, the sense taken from the courtroom, and from
just about everywhere else in Iran, is that the changes sweeping
the rest of the world cannot be halted at Iran's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Some Iranians see what is happening as a sort of Marxist
dialectic, in which the old and the new are driven into conflict,
driving the historical wheel onward. Certainly, there is an
inexorability in the way in which the conservative mullahs and
their backers have chosen to confront the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, the climate of paranoid resistance to
change contributed to the brutal killings in Tehran of five
reformers, including three writers, all of whom had appeared on
death lists circulated by shadowy Islamic groups. Under pressure
from President Mohammed Khatami, the main standard-bearer for
reform along with Nouri, the intelligence ministry was forced to
admit in January that a ``rogue'' group within the ministry had
carried out the killings. Although none of more than 30 people
arrested have gone on trial, and two ring-leaders are said to have
committed suicide in jail, the result, many Iranians believe, has
been to persuade the mullahs that the battle for power must
henceforth be conducted within the law.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same process was visible in the upheaval in July, when
students protesting at the University of Tehran against the closure
of a reformist newspaper were attacked by policemen and vigilantes
who killed three students and ransacked a dormitory. The ensuing
riots were the worst since 1979. Hardliners appeared to have won
the day when they summoned tens of thousands of demonstrators into
the streets. But only four months later, the affair is widely seen
as a Waterloo for the hardliners. Khatami, visiting the rebuilt
dormitory two weeks ago, described the attack on the students as a
``disgraceful, bitter and ugly event'' of a kind Iranians will no
longer tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Iranians who hanker for greater democracy and human
rights believe it is too late for the mullahs to reverse the tides.
They could send Nouri to jail, depriving reformers of their main
campaigner in parliamentary elections that will be held in
February. Beyond that, the clerics retain the possibility of
violent suppression, since they control the police, the army, and
an array of vigilante and paramilitary groups. But much the same
could have been said for two other ruling elites in the past 10
years, in South Africa and the Soviet Union, and neither survived
the popular will for change.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ It is not yet clear if moving Vice President
Al Gore's campaign from K Street in Washington to Charlotte Avenue
here will make it ``closer to the American people,'' as he
promised, or make him more likely to win the presidency, as he
hoped.
</P>
<P>
   But while Washington ponders the importance of Naomi Wolf, the
Gore consultant who writes of dominant men as ``alpha males,''
people in Nashville are wondering what snacks to bring to
headquarters. No pies today, but supporters left bagels, petit
fours and a cake decorated with the Gore 2000 symbol.
</P>
<P>
   And, calories aside, Gore's hope for a ``leaner campaign'' has
been achieved. The staff is quite a bit smaller. The payroll has
been cut 30 percent to 40 percent, starting at the top. ``As of the
middle of this month, no one will make six figures,'' said Donna
Brazile, the campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   That is, no one will make more than the $95,000 she will get, a
reduction from the $120,000 salary she had before she was promoted
from political director, and way below the old ceiling of $160,000
in the Washington-based campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brazile is not fond of consultants as a class. Their maximum
has just gone from $15,000 per month to $5,000. Though she refused
to discuss individuals' compensation, she made it clear Ms. Wolf
was not the only consultant whose pay was cut.
</P>
<P>
   From Tony Coelho, the campaign chairman, on down, everyone in
this former physical therapy installation says the friendly
atmosphere of Nashville and sudden fact of all being together on
one floor, in a new place, has brought cohesion and confidence to
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about running for president with a
headquarters outside Washington. Jimmy Carter won the presidency
from Atlanta, and Ronald Reagan won from Los Angeles. Michael
Dukakis won the nomination from Boston. And this year, George W.
Bush is running from Austin, Texas, while Bill Bradley's
headquarters are in West Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a logic to those locations; that is where the
candidate lived or lives when running, and where the core of his
campaign staff was from. Gore, who represented Nashville in
Congress from 1977 to 1985, now lives in the vice president's
residence in Washington, and there are only a couple of native
Tennesseans on staff here.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying logic of the Gore move was to shake up a
top-heavy, highly paid staff, and to do it in a politically polite
way _ allowing the campaign to shave the staff without firing
anyone. People who were not wanted could say they would have loved
to stay but just could not move to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The money being saved on big salaries, or $160-a-month parking
fees, is paying for more field workers and producing campaign
literature for voters, which until very recently was largely
overlooked. ``We were prepared to talk to the elite media and the
chatterers,'' Ms. Brazile said, ``but not to the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is an obvious energy to the headquarters, even if it
has an unfinished look. Spools of telephone wire and boxes yet to
be unpacked clutter corridors. The old signs like ``Treatment Room
No. 1,'' and ``hydrotherapy'' are still on some doors, although the
``Clean Linen'' sign that once adorned the finance office has been
removed. ``The place looks small and feels like a campaign,'' said
the message guru, Carter Eskew.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Ray, Tipper Gore's campaign chief of staff, said he now
knew people who had only been voices on the phone before. ``I don't
have to take a security key to go up or downstairs,'' the way he
had to on K Street. ``Research is 20 feet to my left instead of two
floors down.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage may be distance from Washington. Ms. Brazile
told of meeting a group of Tennessee women the day the national
press was writing about Naomi Wolf's advice to the candidate.
``Nobody asked about it,'' she said. Eskew said, ``The distance
from Washington makes it easier to concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   And the supportive atmosphere helps, from the dozen pies that
greeted the first campaign arrivals to the offers of housing and
cars to the 400 supporters who came to watch Gore's debate with
Bradley on television from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho said ``the young people inside the building pick up the
vibes from outside the building.'' In Washington, where the Gore
campaign was seen as bloated and unfocused, those vibes were all
discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Not here. Heather Morabeti, a Tennessean who serves as the
campaign's personnel chief, said the out-of-staters ``have all been
pleasantly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as small a town as they thought it would be,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Hayes, who has been finance chairman for Gore back to his
1976 run for Congress, said of his fellow Tennesseans, ``they
really have opened their arms and hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of spark comes from within the campaign in the person
of Ms. Brazile. This morning, she held the staff's attention
through a one-hour meeting. Ringing phones went unanswered
(something that often happens even when there is no meeting as a
new system is installed and volunteers try to figure out who is who
on the staff).
</P>
<P>
   She told them of her first presidential campaign experience,
working in 1984 for Jesse Jackson, and his inspiration to his
troops: ``We are making history.''
</P>
<P>
   And she argues that a campaign ``facing Main Street, not K
Street'' has ``unshackled Al Gore,'' enabling him to be more
relaxed, more effective. That started before the campaign moved,
she said, but the campaign is now in a much better place to get his
message out. ``None of us is the story here,'' she said. ``Al Gore
is the story here.''

   Asians, not knowing who or what these strangers were, called
them barbarians. The intruders were Europeans with ruddy faces,
insatiable curiosities and a certain amount of greed who wandered
into the mysterious East in the late Middle Ages. A lot of them
were Portuguese _ pious priests who first penetrated high Himalayan
valleys or the byways of Japan, and storm-hardened seafarers washed
ashore on the steamy beaches of South India, Ceylon, Malaya and the
spice islands of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese were durable. They came, they conquered and they
stayed. And stayed. The last of their Asian colonies will finally
be relinquished in mid-December, when Macau, off the coast of
China, drops quietly into the pocket of Beijing. East Timor, over
which Lisbon asserted residual rights more than two decades after
the territory was seized by Indonesia in 1975, is being adopted by
the United Nations as it moves, at last, toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   First in. Last out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nice little paradox there,'' said Lucien W. Pye, a political
scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the
author of ``Asian Power and Politics: The Cultural Dimensions of
Authority'' (Harvard). The Portuguese may have opened the doors to
European imperialism and stuck around in some places for a long
time, he said, but they left very little political legacy when
compared with the British or French.
</P>
<P>
   For a small country on the edge of Europe, the Portuguese
created an astonishingly large empire. They did it, initially, for
the sheer adventure of discovery, and for Christianity. A maritime
nation, they threw off Moorish rule early and professed themselves
ready to pursue Muslims zealously to the ends of the Earth, while
excoriating fellow Europeans who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here at least, in this small land of Portugal, there will
not lack those who will do and dare for Christendom,'' wrote Luis
Vaz de Camoens, a 16th-century poet, in the Portuguese national
epic, The Lusiads.
</P>
<P>
   When the Portuguese finished their conquests and conversions,
they had churches as well as trading bases scattered across Asia,
at a time when the spices of the East Indies were the most valuable
commodities in Europe. ``Happily it was possible to serve God and
Mammon at the same time,'' D.G.E. Hall wrote in his classic
``History of Southeast Asia'' (Macmillan). ``By striking at Arab
trade in the Indian Ocean, Portugal aimed a blow at the Ottoman
Empire, which drew the major part of its revenues from the spice
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Americas, Portugal had the vast colony of Brazil. In
Africa, there was Angola, one of the continent's largest and
potentially richest nations, as well as Mozambique, Cape Verde and
other islands. In India, where Muslims ruled when the Portuguese
arrived, they created Christian Goa, complete with basilicas and
the bones of saints. Goa remained a Portuguese colony for more than
four centuries, until the Indian army seized it without warning in
1961, an act of neo-colonialism that, strangely, never brought down
on India the kind of sustained international retribution Indonesia
would later face in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese had also dabbled in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, where
the 16th-century King of Kotte was informed by his spies that the
outlandish folks in metal hats and coats who had come ashore seemed
to be picnicking on blood and hunks of whitish stone.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal was ultimately unable to sustain all of its
possessions, especially in Asia. But around the world, elements of
the Portuguese language and Portuguese family and place names live
on, a legacy of a relaxed colonial style _ religious zeal apart.
Portugal, unlike others, did not frown on intermarriage with local
populations. ``There was no color line,'' said Pye. ``No exclusive
clubs. No insults. The Portuguese didn't lord it over as much. They
were gentler, more tolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sad thing is what they left or didn't leave
behind,'' he said. ``They left behind religion, culture. But they
never left behind anything that was political. They never had a
vision for their colonies. They never had the British white man's
burden. They never had the task of modernizing. They didn't have a
sense of mission. There was no grand design. Certainly there was no
end game. It just sort of came to an end because of the Portuguese
revolution back in Lisbon.''
</P>
<P>
   That revolution in 1974 unexpectedly cut loose the remaining
colonies that had not been lost to the Dutch, Spanish or British
over the centuries. Angola and East Timor were suddenly freed _
really left in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Portuguese stayed too long,'' said Dame Margaret Anstee,
who served as a special envoy of the U.N. secretary-general in
war-ravaged Angola. ``There was no preparation for independence.
There was no transition.'' Indeed, the extended period of colonial
rule allowed divisions to fester among the frustrated and ambitious
anti-colonialist forces.
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor, the Portuguese had left the Roman Catholic Church
in charge of administration. With the Indonesian invasion of 1975,
the church lost its temporal power, which helped make the
disaffected clergy a potent, persistent foe of the Indonesian
government. Indonesia underestimated its power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church played an administrative role for the Portuguese in
a strange kind of way so that the state didn't have to do it,''
said Pye. ``It didn't have to modernize, like in India _ create a
civil service and all that.'' Educational institutions were as
scarce as government institutions. The best and brightest boys were
sent to seminaries. ``One of the things that is striking in terms
of both East Timor and Macao is that the Portuguese have suddenly
realized that they really didn't create any institutions that can
carry on and identify with Portugal,'' he said. Macao's only
university is already run by the Chinese, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil was different. There, by the beginning of the 19th
century, a nation had coalesced. With the help of the British, a
24-year-old exiled Portuguese prince was able to declare the
country independent of the motherland. In 1822, he was crowned
Pedro I, emperor of Brazil. Pedro took the advice of his father,
who _ according to the historian Hubert Herring _ had said: ``If
Brazil demands independence, grant it, but put the crown upon your
own head.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil thus came of age with a strong national identity as well
as an enduring Portuguese culture, later to be blended with
indigenous American strains as well as African strains, a legacy of
Purtugal's infamous involvement in the slave trade. Brazil
subsequently grew into the largest and most influential of
Portuguese-speaking nations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Brazil is eager to help distant East Timor create a
society true to itself and yet in tune with its history. When the
United Nations looked for the perfect administrator to guide the
East Timorese through the transition, it found a Brazilian, Under
Secretary General Sergio Vieira de Mello. He sees his role as part
of a closing of the circle of colonial history.

MICROSOFT'S BIG EFFORT TO WIN POLITICAL FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty months ago, Rep. Billy Tauzin walked into
the office of Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, bearing a
10-inch-by-10-inch white box and a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin, R-La., the chairman of a subcommittee that oversees the
telecommunications industry, placed the box on Gates' desk. Inside
was a lemon meringue pie, a reminder of another pie that had been
thrown in Gates' face several weeks earlier by a Microsoft critic.
</P>
<P>
   The message to Gates, the richest man on earth and the leader of
the digital world, was blunt: You need to make friends in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Tauzin's visit in early 1998, the Justice
Department was contemplating filing its antitrust suit against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he was being demonized,'' Tauzin said in an
interview. ``I said he had to win the antitrust case in court, but
there was also the court of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates apparently took Tauzin's message to heart _ with a
vengeance. While Microsoft and its executives contributed a
relatively modest $60,000 to Republican Party committees in 1997,
the company's contributions in 1998 shot up to $470,000 as part of
its overall political contribution of $1.3 million. The 1998 figure
included donations to political candidates, with the bulk of the
money going to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company's contributions of nearly $600,000 have
been more evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats,
according to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lobbying, focused on swaying Congress and creating a
generally friendlier climate in Washington, has had little if any
effect on the current antitrust litigation in U.S. District Court,
where the company was dealt a major setback on Friday by Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson's initial findings that it had used
monopoly power to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the lobbying campaign is a long-term strategic push
intended to alter the political terrain where future power
struggles will be fought.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign donations were just one element of Microsoft's
multimillion-dollar effort to win allies in Washington. The company
also poured millions of dollars into an aggressive public relations
and political offensive, hiring an armada of well-connected
lobbyists and underwriting the work of research groups, academics
and consultants who have made arguments sympathetic to Microsoft's
defense in the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lobbying budget nearly doubled in 1998 from the
previous year, to $3.74 million, according to the company's
lobbying disclosure reports, and is on pace this year to
significantly surpass that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Gates and his top lieutenants have made dozens of trips to
Washington, cultivating powerful figures in both parties and hiring
some of the city's priciest lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has retained Haley Barbour, former chairman of the
Republican National Committee; Vic Fazio, a former Democratic
congressman from California; Vin Weber, a former Republican
congressman from Minnesota; Tom Downey, a former Democratic
congressman from New York and a close friend of Vice President Al
Gore; Mark Fabiani, former special counsel to the Clinton White
House; and Kerry Knott, former chief of staff to Rep. Dick Armey of
Texas, the House majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also given hundreds of thousands of dollars to
research groups, trade groups, polling operations, public relations
concerns and grass-roots organizations. It has financed op-ed
pieces and full-page newspaper advertisements, and mounted a
lobbying effort against an increase in the Justice Department's
antitrust enforcement budget.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Gates met for lunch with the Republican leaders of the
House in the small whip's room off the House chamber. They
discussed Microsoft's public policy agenda, ranging from exports of
encryption software to Internet privacy to antitrust actions, said
several participants at the meeting. Knott, now a top official in
Microsoft's Washington office, attended the session.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days later, Armey introduced what he called his
``e-Contract,'' a list of Republican legislative initiatives that
pointedly adopted Microsoft's view of the role of government
antitrust actions, like the one that now threatens to dismantle
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When federal agencies use heavy-handed tactics to target
specific companies,'' the Republican document states in language
that echoes Microsoft's own, ``the real message they send to the
market place is this: You could be next.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey's aides insist that the release of the document was just a
coincidence and that Republicans had long opposed aggressive
enforcement of antitrust laws. Microsoft officials also denied that
they had influenced Armey's priorities or his language. The package
of Republican proposals is still before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Another Microsoft move on Capitol Hill drew criticism for
heavy-handedness. Its lobbying to trim the antitrust division's
budget brought a flurry of editorial condemnation. The Washington
Post said Microsoft's actions were ``a comical caricature'' of a
company trying to bully its way through Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   One Justice Department official said, ``Even the mob doesn't try
to whack a prosecutor during a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials acknowledge that they came late to
Washington. Gates long disdained the capital as an analog
anachronism in a digital age and refused to devote time or
resources to courting government leaders. That has now changed, in
a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that grew up in an unregulated environment
and didn't pay much attention to Washington,'' said Jack Krumholtz,
the 38-year-old director of Microsoft's Washington lobbying
operation.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the rapid growth of the Internet raised numerous
regulatory issues, from privacy to taxation to antitrust concerns.
The government's growing interest in Microsoft's business forced
the company to increase its presence in the capital, Krumholtz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second reason we felt we had to ramp up was that it became
apparent that there was a cabal, a handful of our competitors, that
were really very aggressively engaged in a concerted campaign to
lobby Congress, the Department of Justice, state governments to
take action against Microsoft,'' Krumholtz said. ``They understood
they couldn't beat Microsoft in the marketplace, so they've chosen
to turn to government to hamstring us. We were slow at first to
appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Krumholtz defended the company's effort to trim the Justice
Department's antitrust budget, which so far has been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The company has come up to speed very fast, recruiting a rapid
response team of academics and trade organizations to serve as
public spokesmen for the company. Microsoft gives money to the
Brookings Institution, the Cato Institute, the Progressive Policy
Institute and numerous other research organizations that publish
papers and provide quotable experts on antitrust matters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has hired as consultant-spokesmen two former heads of
the Justice Department's antitrust division and a dozen or more
prominent academics and writers, who publish articles and give
interviews advocating Microsoft's position.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Among them are Charles Rule, director of the Justice
Department's antitrust division in the Bush administration, and
Paul Rothstein, a professor of law at Georgetown University and a
frequent network and cable-television commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's opponents also hire prominent spokesmen. For
example, Robert Bork, the former federal judge, has served as a
lobbyist for Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, Sun Microsystems and Oracle, three of Microsoft's
biggest competitors, spend heavily on lobbying and campaign
contributions and finance a group called the Project to Promote
Competition and Innovation in the Digital Age to try to counter
Microsoft's political and market power.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has an additional strategy. The company does its
best to turn around or undermine some of the trade groups that have
taken positions against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is continually trying to get my members to
withdraw,'' said Ed Black, president of the Computer and
Communications Industry Association, a trade group that has taken
the government's side in the antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two big companies told me explicitly that they had to drop
out, because Microsoft made it clear'' there would be retributions
if they did not, he said. And with only 30 members, Black noted,
the defection of two is not an insignificant matter.
</P>
<P>
   Black would not name the companies, and Rick Miller, a Microsoft
spokesman, declined to comment on the charge. Oracle and Sun
Microsystems are among the association's remaining members.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Microsoft is a longstanding member of the
Software and Information Industry Association, the United States'
largest software-industry trade group, with 1,400 members.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in February, the group's board of directors voted
12-2 to publish a 57-page document that seemed to advocate breaking
up Microsoft, if the company was found to have violated antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, Microsoft invited the group's president, Ken
Wasch, to Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., campus for two days of
discussion and ``worked very hard to change my mind,'' Wasch
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   When that did not work, Robert Herbold, Microsoft's chief
operating officer, put himself up for election to the association's
board of directors and won a seat last spring. One board member
said Herbold also set out to have Wasch replaced as president, but
``he counted the noses and saw he didn't have the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Krumholtz said the association ``has been fairly vocal, and its
leadership has been co-opted by competitors in an anti-Microsoft
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be one of biggest members,'' he added, ``and we feel
strongly that an activity like that is not appropriate for an
industry association.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also set out to hire platoons of academics and
former government officials to write op-ed columns and serve as
spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Cass, dean of Boston University's law school, is among
them, and recently, a couple of days before the judge's findings of
fact were to be published, he remarked, half joking: ``I haven't
received my marching orders yet. I guess I'll say that it's a
travesty of justice or a great decision, depending on what comes
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's paid spokesmen are so numerous and prolific that
quite often they wind up quoting each other's work to support their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Barbour, whose lobbying concern earned $600,000
from Microsoft last year, wrote an opinion article for The
Chronicle of Augusta, Ga., last December that offered the opinion
that the American public opposed the government's suit. To support
that, he cited the findings of a national survey published by two
other Microsoft-financed groups: Citizens Against Government Waste
and the Technology Access Action Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   One Washington lawyer hired to advise Microsoft last year said
that the company made a mistake years ago by not cultivating
friends in government, academia and the media, and now appears too
brazen in trying to buy favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do when you're in the middle of a problem,'' this
lawyer said. ``I've told them they have to make friends before you
need them, rather than after. They have taken a blunt-ax approach
to things in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely didn't get it early on,'' he added. ``They
still might not get it.''

<P>
   Alpha males dominate wolf packs, boss baboon troupes and lord it
over harems of elephant seals. Like other mammals, human groups
also foster alpha males. But though the leadership abilities are
valued, many societies are uncomfortable with other alpha traits,
like aggressiveness, temper tantrums and indiscreet expression of
the drive that spurs the pursuit of alphadom in the first place _
sexual access to plenty of women.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps excessive surprise has greeted reports that Naomi Wolf,
a consultant to Al Gore, told the vice president that he was a beta
male who needed to become an alpha. What stirred the commotion, of
course, is that a feminist writer was caught advising a man to play
out of the male rulebook. Little wonder that Ms. Wolf was furiously
backpedaling last week on the significance (though not the fact) of
her advice.
</P>
<P>
   But her critics miss the point that her proposal was surely
sound. People like the leadership and status that alpha males seek
to possess, and probably would not vote heavily for President Beta.
Besides, the flexibility of human behavior allows alpha males a
range of modes, from the savagery of Genghis Khan to the deftness
of Disraeli.
</P>
<P>
   When biology points one way and culture another, feathers get
ruffled. No one yet knows just how tightly or loosely biological
rules govern human social and political behavior. That is one of
the tasty treats that still lies locked within the human genome
project's hamper box. But those who share 98.5 percent of their
genes with chimpanzees, as people do, would be unwise to bet that
they are totally free of the genetic drives nature built into the
common ancestor of chimps and people.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic of all nature's games is getting as many of one's
genes as possible into the next generation. So it should be no
surprise that reproductive rights are the bottom line of alpha male
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is pursued with tactics of varying subtlety in
different species. The bull elephant seal physically corrals as
many females as he can into his rocky harem. But in most chimp
societies the alpha male combines brute aggression with
sophisticated networking among male and female partners, even
sharing his reproductive rights with kin and henchmen.
</P>
<P>
   With people, the link between biology and behavior is probably
even looser than in chimpanzees, though it is hard to see ourselves
objectively. We assume our societies embody many more and higher
values than mere sexual reproduction and expect our alpha males to
behave accordingly. Yet some primatologists, like Richard Wrangham
of Harvard, see human societies as just one modification of normal
primate biology. The degree of hierarchy is usually far less steep
than in chimp groups, Wrangham notes, because language is a great
leveler, allowing the beta humans to hatch elaborate conspiracies
that temper the tyrant's powers.
</P>
<P>
   In most human societies, there is more room for the sexes to
play out their different agendas. ``Put simply, in our evolutionary
history it seems likely that a woman's value was usually her
reproductive value, and a man's value was his resource value,''
writes Bobbi S. Low of Princeton University in her forthcoming book
``Why Sex Matters'' (Princeton University Press). Her thesis is
that men have always striven to command the wealth or prestige and
that women will seek to assure their children are protected.
</P>
<P>
   Even in today's societies, Dr. Low argues, each sex advertises
the qualities desirable to the other. Men sport gold chains or BMWs
to signal wealth while women, with clothing, cosmetics or
liposuction, strive for the young and healthy look, whose basic
message is reproductive fitness. ``The specifics change across time
and societies, but the desired result does not,'' Dr. Low writes.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much the resource-seeking alpha male depends on
aggression or on conciliation to achieve his goals depends on the
prevailing social expectations. Maybe Ms. Wolf should have told the
vice president to be the more empathetic type of alpha male. That's
the advice he would have gotten from Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, a
primatologist at the University of California, Davis.
``Ethnographers who study hunter-gatherers often report quite a
different style of leadership admired there: the
consensus-building, wise-man mode, with an aversion to discord and
bullying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in societies that wish their alpha males to wear velvet
gloves, the basic urge is never too far beneath the surface. ``The
search for power is to a large extent independent of any search for
sexual rewards,'' Wrangham said of politicians, ``but it is
dramatic how often power leads to sexual access.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one politician agrees: ``I don't know of a single head
of state who hasn't yielded to some kind of carnal temptation,
small or large.'' Francois Mitterrand said in 1998, toward the end
of a long political career. ``That in itself is reason to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever license is permitted, political leaders are likely to
indulge their libido. Look at the sexual excesses of Caligula, the
seraglios of the Ottoman sultans, the tribes of children fathered
by potentates like the pharoah Ramses II (52 sons) or the Saudi
king Abdel Aziz (44 sons). Even in Communist China, Mao Tse-tung
consorted with a stream of young girls procured by the Cultural
Work Troupe of the Central Garrison Corps and was never so happy as
when he had several of them sharing his bed, according to the
memoirs of his personal physician, Dr. Li Zhisui.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans do not expect their president to practice lust and
statecraft at the same time. The chief executive must be the model
of monogamous virtue along with all his other roles, and howls of
disapproval greet every slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy, as the Duc de la Rochefoucauld noted, is the tribute
that vice pays to virtue. Ms. Wolf's advice startled because it
embodied the contrary currents in the public's expectations of its
leaders. Strive to dominate, but deny the very urge that spurs the
drive for dominance. It's like demanding that a lion eat lettuce.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The median size of a new house in the United States
just passed 2,000 square feet, 25 percent bigger than two decades
ago. Ford's new Excursion, a $37,000 behemoth of a sport utility
vehicle, is selling out as soon as it reaches dealers. Half of all
households now invest in the stock market. Unemployment is at a
nearly 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   America is doing well by any material measure, and for the most
part is thoroughly enjoying the experience. But there are also
signs amid the prosperity that people are asking whether this is
all there is, whether driving cars the size of tanks and parking
them in garages the size of gymnasiums is truly the national
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Polling shows that most Americans view themselves as less
cynical and more compassionate than even a few years ago, and that
they are inclined to do more for the less fortunate now that they
have taken care of themselves. There has been a surge in
volunteerism. Charitable giving is up across income levels.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, sociologists and commentators report that
people feel more stressed, that they do not have enough time for
their families, that they sometimes see their quality of life
failing to keep up with their improved finances.
</P>
<P>
   Restless searches for spiritual fulfillment and backlashes
against consumerism are longstanding features of American society,
and are magnified during periods of affluence, when people have the
luxury of looking beyond the next paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Culture warriors, especially on the right, have long warned of a
dangerous emptiness in the national soul. And it may be that the
whole phenomenon this time around is nothing more than an attempt
by self-absorbed baby boomers to feel better about themselves,
especially given the persistence of the gap between rich and poor
and the unforgiving nature of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the country also seems to be grappling genuinely with the
question of how it can best put its prosperity to use.
</P>
<P>
   There may never be a single or clear answer. But the issues
behind the question are bouncing around Washington and on the
campaign trail with increasing prominence.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of a bitterly partisan presidential scandal, it
is perhaps not surprising that Washington has not yet reached any
consensus. Presented with the opportunity this year to allocate
huge projected surpluses, Congress and the Clinton administration
gridlocked, shunting big ideas from both parties to the sidelines
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seems little doubt of a renewed willingness on the
part of politicians across the ideological spectrum to focus more
on those who have not benefited from the current boom. Less clear
is how big an effort the country is prepared to mount to deal with
such problems.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who twice won office by appealing to the
middle class, spent two days last week touring inner cities, using
some of his dwindling reserves of political capital to draw
attention to ways in which a little bit of public money can
encourage private enterprise to bring jobs and hope to the
country's most blighted neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Republicans accepted an invitation for
Speaker Dennis Hastert to join Clinton in promoting the approach,
which as much as any program illustrates a trend toward small-scale
solutions that look to market forces and individuals rather than
big government.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bill
Bradley is bucking the trend to some degree. He is suggesting that
government can tackle a few big problems with big programs and lots
of taxpayer money, although even he looks to the private sector and
markets in his plans to alleviate child poverty and improve access
to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has positioned himself somewhere in the
center. He has blasted Bradley for proposing to spend so much that
the nation's newfound fiscal health would be endangered, and talks
mostly about ``working families,'' but has his own plans for issues
like providing health care to poor children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you believe that the federal government should do it
or the state government or your church, there is a general feeling
that we can now as a country look beyond our driveway and say, who
in my town needs help?'' said Rich Galen, a Republican consultant.
``If somebody can tap into that, it can be a powerful political
force.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, seemed to recognize the opportunity
particularly early, and built his campaign around the theme
``Prosperity With a Purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   That purpose, it seems, is as broad and vague as it is
indisputably admirable: that nobody gets left behind. And if the
main beneficiaries are meant to be the poor and the poorly
educated, the act of addressing their needs is intended to make
those in a position to help feel more fulfilled as well.
</P>
<P>
   It has not escaped Bush's team that the approach could help
neutralize the strong economy as an issue favoring the vice
president by shifting the focus from whether voters are better off
than they were four or eight years ago to how to capitalize on the
good times. But they say the slogan only resonates because the
country is looking for a moral dimension to its happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense out there in America that for years people
strived for prosperity, and now they've achieved it but feel
incomplete,'' said Mark McKinnon, Bush's media consultant.
``Governor Bush has articulated a message that many Americans feel,
which is that it's not enough for our wallets to be full if our
hearts are empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ideas on how to achieve such a transformation _ like
supporting faith-based charities, giving tax breaks to the working
poor and improving underperforming school systems _ would not put
any big new burdens on the middle class and would by no means rule
out a broad-based tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the context of a middle class that is looking for
more than material gain, the middle class is still likely to demand
attention for its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are acutely conscious of a vague but persistent
sense among many relatively well-off families that their children
are not getting the attention they deserve, that they hardly know
their neighbors anymore, that their lives are getting harder, not
easier.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the government can respond with specific
policies, like requiring employers to provide leave for births,
deaths or family emergencies. In other cases, politicians are
struggling with how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a new agenda, and a lot of times leaders don't
know what the solutions are or even what the questions are,'' said
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``Leaders who speak to it and
come up with new approaches will be received well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruminating last week on the new politics of prosperity, a senior
member of the Clinton administration said that while the revived
focus on poverty fighting was well established, there would also be
a greater focus on what he called ``trans-economic'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of inner angst, beyond-materialism kind of
dynamic that's emerging,'' he said. ``It's `Tipper Gore was right'
kind of stuff: Is there a movie you can take your kids to? Are we

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The median size of a new house in the United States
just passed 2,000 square feet, 25 percent bigger than two decades
ago. Ford's new Excursion, a $37,000 behemoth of a sport utility
vehicle, is selling out as soon as it reaches dealers. Half of all
households now invest in the stock market. Unemployment is at a
nearly 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   America is doing well by any material measure, and for the most
part is thoroughly enjoying the experience. But there are also
signs amid the prosperity that people are asking whether this is
all there is, whether driving cars the size of tanks and parking
them in garages the size of gymnasiums is truly the national
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Polling shows that most Americans view themselves as less
cynical and more compassionate than even a few years ago, and that
they are inclined to do more for the less fortunate now that they
have taken care of themselves. There has been a surge in
volunteerism. Charitable giving is up across income levels.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, sociologists and commentators report that
people feel more stressed, that they do not have enough time for
their families, that they sometimes see their quality of life
failing to keep up with their improved finances.
</P>
<P>
   Restless searches for spiritual fulfillment and backlashes
against consumerism are longstanding features of American society,
and are magnified during periods of affluence, when people have the
luxury of looking beyond the next paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Culture warriors, especially on the right, have long warned of a
dangerous emptiness in the national soul. And it may be that the
whole phenomenon this time around is nothing more than an attempt
by self-absorbed baby boomers to feel better about themselves,
especially given the persistence of the gap between rich and poor
and the unforgiving nature of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the country also seems to be grappling genuinely with the
question of how it can best put its prosperity to use.
</P>
<P>
   There may never be a single or clear answer. But the issues
behind the question are bouncing around Washington and on the
campaign trail with increasing prominence.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of a bitterly partisan presidential scandal, it
is perhaps not surprising that Washington has not yet reached any
consensus. Presented with the opportunity this year to allocate
huge projected surpluses, Congress and the Clinton administration
gridlocked, shunting big ideas from both parties to the sidelines
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seems little doubt of a renewed willingness on the
part of politicians across the ideological spectrum to focus more
on those who have not benefited from the current boom. Less clear
is how big an effort the country is prepared to mount to deal with
such problems.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who twice won office by appealing to the
middle class, spent two days last week touring inner cities, using
some of his dwindling reserves of political capital to draw
attention to ways in which a little bit of public money can
encourage private enterprise to bring jobs and hope to the
country's most blighted neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Republicans accepted an invitation for
Speaker Dennis Hastert to join Clinton in promoting the approach,
which as much as any program illustrates a trend toward small-scale
solutions that look to market forces and individuals rather than
big government.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bill
Bradley is bucking the trend to some degree. He is suggesting that
government can tackle a few big problems with big programs and lots
of taxpayer money, although even he looks to the private sector and
markets in his plans to alleviate child poverty and improve access
to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has positioned himself somewhere in the
center. He has blasted Bradley for proposing to spend so much that
the nation's newfound fiscal health would be endangered, and talks
mostly about ``working families,'' but has his own plans for issues
like providing health care to poor children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you believe that the federal government should do it
or the state government or your church, there is a general feeling
that we can now as a country look beyond our driveway and say, who
in my town needs help?'' said Rich Galen, a Republican consultant.
``If somebody can tap into that, it can be a powerful political
force.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, seemed to recognize the opportunity
particularly early, and built his campaign around the theme
``Prosperity With a Purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   That purpose, it seems, is as broad and vague as it is
indisputably admirable: that nobody gets left behind. And if the
main beneficiaries are meant to be the poor and the poorly
educated, the act of addressing their needs is intended to make
those in a position to help feel more fulfilled as well.
</P>
<P>
   It has not escaped Bush's team that the approach could help
neutralize the strong economy as an issue favoring the vice
president by shifting the focus from whether voters are better off
than they were four or eight years ago to how to capitalize on the
good times. But they say the slogan only resonates because the
country is looking for a moral dimension to its happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense out there in America that for years people
strived for prosperity, and now they've achieved it but feel
incomplete,'' said Mark McKinnon, Bush's media consultant.
``Governor Bush has articulated a message that many Americans feel,
which is that it's not enough for our wallets to be full if our
hearts are empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ideas on how to achieve such a transformation _ like
supporting faith-based charities, giving tax breaks to the working
poor and improving underperforming school systems _ would not put
any big new burdens on the middle class and would by no means rule
out a broad-based tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the context of a middle class that is looking for
more than material gain, the middle class is still likely to demand
attention for its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are acutely conscious of a vague but persistent
sense among many relatively well-off families that their children
are not getting the attention they deserve, that they hardly know
their neighbors anymore, that their lives are getting harder, not
easier.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the government can respond with specific
policies, like requiring employers to provide leave for births,
deaths or family emergencies. In other cases, politicians are
struggling with how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a new agenda, and a lot of times leaders don't
know what the solutions are or even what the questions are,'' said
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``Leaders who speak to it and
come up with new approaches will be received well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruminating last week on the new politics of prosperity, a senior
member of the Clinton administration said that while the revived
focus on poverty fighting was well established, there would also be
a greater focus on what he called ``trans-economic'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of inner angst, beyond-materialism kind of
dynamic that's emerging,'' he said. ``It's `Tipper Gore was right'
kind of stuff: Is there a movie you can take your kids to? Are we
raising a nation of Nintendo zombies?'' What may be new is the
degree to which such social and family concerns are no longer
articulated un-self-consciously just by the religious right, which
claimed them as its own during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have become part of what Amitai Etzioni, a
sociologist at George Washington University, called the ``new, more
moderate language of the moral center.''

NEW YORK'S CABBIES SHOW HOW MULTI-COLORED RACISM CAN BE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may be the most blatant form of racism in New York
City: a cab driver refusing to pick up someone who is black.
</P>
<P>
   It happens to blacks all the time. Former Mayor David Dinkins
says it has even happened to him. And now the actor Danny Glover,
who last week went public over what he described as a string of
such slights in different areas of Manhattan one night last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so angry,'' Glover told a news conference, recounting
how several empty cabs had refused to stop for him, his college-age
daughter and her roommate. Later, when one finally did, the driver
refused the 6-foot-4 ``Lethal Weapon'' star access to the front
seat even though he has a bad hip and is entitled under taxi
industry rules to stretch out in front.
</P>
<P>
   A simple case of traditional American racism? Perhaps. But in
New York such incidents often have the distinct flavor of the
melting pot: In this case the driver was nonwhite, too _ apparently
from southern Asia, Glover said.
</P>
<P>
   So the actor's experience may illustrate not just continuing
American racism, but one way its character is subtly changing with
demographics: As recent immigrants from Asia, the Middle East and
Africa come to dominate the taxi industry, they are bringing with
them new strains of bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, according to people in the taxi industry, racism is
perpetuated by cabbies whose attitudes have roots not only in
colonial rule and the strict social stratification of their native
lands, but also in the more recent distorted images of the global
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racist images flow throughout the world,'' said Bhairavi
Desai, a native of India and the staff director of the Taxi Workers
Alliance, a 2,000-member drivers' group. Because of the impact of
movies, television and rap music, she said, part of the baggage of
some new immigrants is an established, and sometimes deeply flawed,
attitude toward race.
</P>
<P>
   Among immigrant cabbies from some nations, including India, she
said, ``many of the attitudes stem from a history of colonialism,
and from a sense of competing for bread crumbs with other poor
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no precise breakdown is available, from 60 percent to
70 percent of the city's yellow cab drivers are now immigrants from
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, according to Allan J. Fromberg,
spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Among the other
drivers, people born in the United States or western Europe
comprise a tiny minority compared with the large number of
immigrants from countries like Russia, Korea and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the taxi industry provides a grueling point of entry
to the American work force, and episodes of rudeness and
discrimination sometimes result from a drive to keep the fare box
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some drivers really don't want to pick up minorities because
they think it will mean ending up in neighborhoods where they won't
be able to find another fare,'' said Edward Rogoff, a Baruch
College professor and longtime taxi industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   And many cabbies, acutely aware of their high vulnerability to
robbery and attack, undoubtedly take note of higher rates of crime
among lower-income blacks and in certain areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few seem to doubt the bigotry factor. Industry executives
note that they are trying to inculcate racial sensitivity among new
immigrant drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer who accompanied Glover at his press conference,
Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, said such efforts should be broadened.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, McLaughlin, a 20-year veteran of civil rights
litigation and a professor at Pace Law School, said drivers like
the one who antagonized Glover ``have adopted the same patterns of
racial profiling that emerged when when most drivers were were
Irish, Italian-Americans, or from somewhere else in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Acts of racial discrimination by cabbies are illegal, punishable
by a fine or the revocation of the offender's taxi-driver license.
But Scott-McLaughlin, who himself is black, said Glover did not
intend to pursue a formal complaint with the Taxi and Limousine
Commission because he had no interest in punishing a single driver.
(The driver remains unidentified.) Instead, the actor spoke out
last week to focus fresh attention on racism in the taxi industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is educating these people that we are not dangerous
criminals,'' said Scott-McLaughlin.

JUDGE WAKES UP THE BLASE INVESTORS WHO SHRUGGED OFF ANTITRUST CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a year, Microsoft Corp. has been untarnished on
Wall Street and on Main Street from the government's relentless
antitrust assault on the company. But suddenly, it may begin
feeling some pain as investors and the computer industry consider
the likely impact of the blow delivered on Friday evening by U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who is deciding the antitrust case without a jury,
took a defining first step toward a verdict, with findings of fact
that concluded that Microsoft was a monopoly whose bullying tactics
had hurt consumers and the economy by stifling innovation in the
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   With that conclusion, Jackson set the stage for an eventual
ruling against the software giant and remedies that could be as
extreme as a breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has not known this kind of threat to its business or
public image in the 18 months since the government filed its
antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial in Washington, Microsoft was pummeled again and
again with harsh allegations of corporate misconduct and
incriminating evidence. Its every embarrassing slip up in the
courtroom was chronicled daily in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wall Street shrugged it all off as an irrelevant sideshow.
Microsoft's stock price kept climbing, minting more Microsoft
millionaires and ensuring that Bill Gates continued to extend his
lead as the world's richest person. And polls of public opinion
have shown that the favorable reputation of Gates and his company
have been untarnished by its antitrust battle with the government.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday night, in late after-hours trading after Jackson's
findings were made public, Microsoft's stock price fell sharply,
down $5 from $91.5625. David Readerman, an investment banker who
studies the company, says he expects Microsoft's shares to drop
early this week, though by no more than 10 percent. Still, a 10
percent decline would erase $47 billion in the wealth of Microsoft
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be a wipeout,'' said Readerman, a managing director
at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco. ``Microsoft is still a
great growth story. But not only the Department of Justice, but
also now a federal judge feel that some of that growth was acquired
improperly.''
</P>
<P>
   Readerman added: ``The findings of fact by a United States
federal judge is a serious thing, and now it's out. It's new
information, and it's not pretty reading.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge's findings of fact are not a ruling, but they set the
framework for the outcome of the case _ a legal judgment or an
out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, the industry and investors will begin thinking
seriously about remedies the government might seek. With Jackson's
one-sided findings, even sanctions that had seemed extreme _ like
breaking up the company _ now seem to be back on the table.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Readerman noted, bankers will surely be doing
spreadsheet calculations of the value of Microsoft if it is broken
up into separate companies. The division most often mentioned is
into three companies: one with its industry-standard Windows
operating systems, a second with its office productivity software
and a third with its Internet and electronic commerce products.
Many bankers have said they believe that if the court split up
Microsoft, as Standard Oil was split when the government forced its
breakup, the company's value would actually increase.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier rounds of settlement talks, Microsoft has shown a
willingness to loosen its contracts with personal computer makers,
including opening up its secret ``marketing development
agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson found that these contracts provided price incentives for
companies that favored Microsoft's software products and punished
companies that did not. Microsoft, according to people close to the
talks, has also offered to publish the pricing lists _ adjusted for
volume sales _ for its licensing agreements with personal computer
makers like Compaq, Dell, Gateway and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has fiercely resisted any suggestion that it
must be forced to give companies wide-ranging access to its
fundamental software technology or allow them to modify it. ``We
take the simple-minded view that it is our intellectual property,
we made it _ it's our song, and you should play it our way,''
explained William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that Microsoft uses access to its Windows
technology as another tool to reward allies and punish rivals.
Without that access, other software products will not run smoothly
on Microsoft's Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the government allegations or the judge's
findings, Microsoft believes that the case law protecting
intellectual property strongly supports its stance. And while the
company would find it difficult, if not impossible, to appeal
Jackson's findings of fact, an appeal can be built around legal
precedents.
</P>
<P>
   In any settlement talks, it is Microsoft's concept of
intellectual property protection that is the biggest obstacle,
according to antitrust scholars. ``Anything that suggests
compulsory access to its technology is poison to Microsoft,'' said
William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University
law school.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, the great incentive to settle would be to
sidestep an actual verdict declaring the company a monopoly. That
could open the floodgates to rounds of private antitrust suits
because proving that a company is a monopoly is often the most
costly, time-consuming hurdle. Being a monopoly is not illegal in
itself. But if a federal court has ruled Microsoft to be a
monopoly, that hurdle has been overcome for all subsequent
antitrust litigation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since Jackson's findings of fact are not a final ruling, a
settlement would presumably erase the monopoly finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking that off the table is the biggest carrot the government
has to offer Microsoft,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at
the University of Iowa law school.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jackson's findings of fact come down so
strongly on the government's side, it gives Microsoft little room
to compromise and thus little incentive to settle. Instead, the
company may well hope to win the case on appeal, which could end up
before the Supreme Court and last until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, there is perhaps one incentive to try to
reach a settlement. ``Despite the finding coming down strongly on
the government's side, there is one additional reason for it to
seek a settlement: We have a presidential election next year,''
said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school.
``And a new administration in Washington could change a lot in its
thinking and approach to the Microsoft case.''

   SYDNEY, Australia _ A mismatched coalition of political
opposites soundly defeated a move to end the symbolic rule of the
British monarchy here on Saturday, even though that it is clear
that most Australians want a republic.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the ``No'' vote triumphed by using the old British
colonial tactic of divide and rule. Although all surveys show that
at least 60 percent of voters would prefer to have an Australian as
head of state, many of these rejected the type of republic that was
offered Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding their votes to those of the country's minority of
monarchists, they held out for a wide-open democracy with a
directly elected ceremonial president. The ballot on Saturday
offered a head of state selected by Australia's ruling Parliament,
a setup lampooned by opponents as a ``politicians' republic.''
</P>
<P>
   The referendum would have amended the 98-year-old Constitution
to remove the British monarch as the figurehead leader in
Australia's parliamentary democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote was 55 percent to 45 percent against the measure,
with all six of Australia's territories also voting it down. A
proposed amendment to the Constitution's preamble that would have
given it a more populist tinge was also defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to become a republic, but we had a false step on
this first go,'' said Ted Mack, a leader of the ``No'' campaign who
supports a republic with an elected leader. ``Next time, when we go
to a referendum with a directly elected president, or some variety
of that, we'll have the thing carried.''
</P>
<P>
   But most political commentators said it would be years before
Australia mustered the energy to confront the question of its
postcolonial identity again.
</P>
<P>
   They said a directly elected head of state would create an
untenable political structure with competing power centers and
would raise the question of whether Australia should move from its
parliamentary system to an American-style presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very safe, minimalist proposal for change,'' said
Greg Barnes, the director of the ``Yes'' campaign. ``Any other
proposal will require a very long and complex debate. It
essentially means rewriting the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Saturday's vote demonstrated the basic conservatism
and caution of Australian voters, particularly those with lower
incomes and in rural areas. Faced with complex political arguments
over the form of a proposed republic, and a campaign full of
contortions and predictions of doom that obscured the issues, many
voters seemed to respond to the clear-cut slogan, ``If it ain't
broke, don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher up the socioeconomic group, the more they are
pro-republic,'' said Andrew Robb, the head of a campaign group
called Conservatives for an Australian Head of State, as he handed
out election fliers Saturday. ``The lower you go, the more
threatened they are by change and the more they mistrust
politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators called the vote a success for Prime Minister
John Howard, who opposed the change and thwarted the supporters of
a republic by offering them a government setup they did not want.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just demonstrates how shrewd a politician John Howard
is,'' said Barry Jones, who was a co-chairman of the convention
that prepared the referendum last year. ``He split the republican
case by insisting on a model that most of them would not support.''
</P>

<P>
   In a statement released Saturday by Buckingham Palace in London,
Queen Elizabeth II promised to serve Australia ``to the very best
of my ability in the future as I have tried to do over these past
47 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect and accept this result,'' the queen said in her
statement. ``I have always made it clear that the future of the
monarchy in Australia is an issue for the Australian people and
them alone to decide, by democratic and constitutional means.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lopsided outcome, the only voters whose real wishes
it reflected were the 37 percent or so who favored the monarchy in
the most recent surveys.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is Ross Tompson, who runs a printing factory and
who was handing out ``No to the politicians' republic'' leaflets at
a polling place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just see no point in the change,'' he said. ``Certainly the
monarchy hasn't been bad for Australia. I like a bit of pomp and
ceremony. You Americans like it too; you're always outside
Buckingham Palace watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tompson, who like many Australians is proud of his descent from
the British convicts who were the first white settlers here,
represents Australia's fading traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Li, a young delegate to the constitutional convention, is
one of millions of Asians who are changing the nation's demographic
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't attach themselves or identify with the monarchy
anymore,'' he said. ``We will become a republic; it's just a matter
of time.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In early June, Prime Minister Tony Blair
of Britain, the most outspoken advocate of a ground invasion of
Kosovo, had ordered the preparation of 30,000 letters calling up
Britain's army reserves. Typed and addressed, they were about to go
into the mail, making possible the commitment of up to 50,000
British troops _ half the standing army _ to go into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton, with enormous reluctance, was
about to give his own approval to preparations for a ground
invasion of Kosovo, including up to 120,000 American troops _
despite his vow, in a televised speech on the first day of the war,
March 24, that ``I do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo to
fight a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on interviews with senior officials from seven governments
_ the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, France, Finland and
Yugoslavia _ the United States came much closer to a ground war in
Europe than is commonly understood.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, the day before President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia agreed to accept NATO's terms for an end to the
conflict, the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, convened a
lengthy meeting of the Clinton administration's top national
security officials. The meeting included a detailed discussion of
how NATO could win the war.
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time, former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin of Russia and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland
were in Belgrade, laying out NATO's terms to Milosevic, but few in
Washington expected Milosevic to agree to them.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, unhappy with the terms, had nearly refused to go
to Belgrade, but he listened as Ahtisaari told Milosevic that NATO
would hit the city harder from the air, destroying its bridges and
power plants, and was bound to invade Kosovo if necessary. Two
weeks before, Clinton had said that ``all options are on the
table,'' and Chernomyrdin made it clear to Milosevic that Russia,
which had supplied Belgrade radar information on incoming NATO
aircraft, would be unable to help any further, even in the event of
a ground invasion.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House officials were still looking hard for
ground options short of the proposal put forth by Gen. Wesley
Clark, the NATO commander, which called for an invasion by up to
175,000 allied troops. They discussed the creation of a limited
``exit corridor'' for displaced Albanians to get out of Kosovo, and
of ``safe areas'' for them inside Kosovo, where they could be given
food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who did not favor an invasion,
made it clear that they preferred Clark's proposals to anything
that committed too few American troops to too limited a goal.
</P>
<P>
   And the officials knew, they say, that Clinton had just a few
days to authorize preparations for an invasion if it was to be sold
to NATO, a reluctant Pentagon and a skeptical Congress and carried
out before the winter, giving the refugees a chance to return home.
The idea of the war's dragging through to the spring _ with
Milosevic damaged but hanging on to Kosovo, 850,000 refugees still
in camps and the NATO alliance fraying or splitting _ ``was too
awful to think about,'' one senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   The British thought they needed up to four months _ 120 days _
to prepare for an invasion, which is why the call-up letters were
nearly in the mail. The Americans thought they needed less than 90
days _ but their schedule was rudely extended when they suddenly
discovered that, without significant new roadwork, the large
American M1 Abrams tanks could not negotiate the single route from
Albania into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, whose troops were already rebuilding the road from Tirana
to Kukes, in Albania, in preparation for a possible invasion, had
wanted a decision by June 1, but thought June 10 was an absolute
deadline to start an invasion in September. Clinton's ambassador to
NATO, Alexander Vershbow, a former National Security Council
official, believed for the first time that he could sell a ground
war to the alliance, despite German, Italian and Greek unhappiness,
but would need five or six days to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the officials broke up with an understanding that
of the three American goals for the war _ NATO's victory, holding
the alliance together and keeping Russia on board _ victory had
become the only outcome that mattered, even if the alliance split
and the Russians broke off cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   There was as yet no paper for Clinton to sign, but the only plan
on the table was Clark's idea of an invasion by 175,000 troops
through Albania, with some helicopter assaults from Italy and
possibly a feint from the north, from Hungary, to tie Yugoslav
forces down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton was going to have to decide in a couple of days,'' one
senior official said, referring to a formal approval by the
president of intensive preparations for a September ground war.
``There was no way around that.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced that Clinton would meet with the Joint
Chiefs on June 3.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on June 2, Berger had met a group of outside experts and
analysts who had been critical of the administration and urged the
authorization of a ground war. The group included a former
ambassador to the United Nations, Jeane Kirkpatrick; two former
ambassadors to NATO, Robert Hunter and William Taft; a former NATO
commander, George Joulwan; a former State Department official,
Helmut Sonnenfeldt; a RAND Corp. official, Stephen Larrabee; and
two former National Security Council officials, Ivo Daalder and
Jeremy Rosner, who had helped Clinton sell NATO expansion to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Berger told them that he was still convinced the air war was
working _ an opinion not universally shared _ but told them that
``we will win'' no matter what was required to get ``the Serbs out,
NATO in and the Albanians back'' to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There were ``four irreducible facts,'' Berger said, according to
notes taken by participants. ``One, we will win. Period. Full stop.
There is no alternative. Second, winning means what we said it
means. Third, the air campaign is having a serious impact. Four,
the president has said he has not ruled out any option. So go back
to one. We will win.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent discussion, Berger elaborated: ``We have not yet
concluded that the air campaign is not working. But we are
preparing for the possibility that it isn't.'' And he said that
victory would be won ``in or outside NATO,'' adding: ``A consensus
in NATO is valuable. But it is not a sine qua non. We want to move
with NATO, but it can't prevent us from moving.''

 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia: from moving.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He said, ``There are a number of options and a number of time
lines on how to use force, and we are looking at all of them.'' But
in fact, officials say, there was only one option by then that the
Joint Chiefs would support: Clark's option, even though the
Pentagon and Defense Secretary William Cohen never liked the idea
of an invasion at all.
</P>
<P>
   An authorization by Clinton to send tens of thousands more
American and NATO troops to prepare for a Kosovo invasion would
have a psychological impact on Milosevic. Ideally, the officials
hoped, such a decision would bring Milosevic to capitulate without
the need to send those forces into battle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had already had severe criticism from NATO officials and
even a former NATO general, Klaus Naumann, for what they called the
strategic folly of ruling out a ground invasion from the beginning
of the war.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the bombing campaign, American and NATO
expectations were that Milosevic would give in after just a few
days of essentially symbolic bombing. American estimates that he
would not hold out for more than 12 days of an escalating air
campaign were wildly inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks into the war, the officials said, as Milosevic drove
ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo by the tens of thousands, there was
real panic in Western capitals and new strains between Berger and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who thought Milosevic would
cave in early.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was becoming convinced that a ground option was vital and
made his own trip to NATO headquarters in mid-April _ just before
NATO's queasy 50th anniversary summit meeting and again just
afterward _ to discuss such an option.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton asked Blair in a telephone call to stop pressing
publicly for a ground invasion before the summit meeting, the two
men met with top officials during the meeting for a serious
discussion of an invasion and approved joint planning for one,
though it is not clear, some officials said, whether the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Henry Shelton, was informed.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was given quiet authorization by the NATO
secretary-general, Javier Solana, after conversations with Berger,
to begin to discuss ground options. And Clinton was said to have
decided that a ground war, if it had to happen, would not be ``a
half effort,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-May, Clark had come up with his plan, and it was treated
skeptically by the Pentagon, which was still unwilling to authorize
the use of Army Apache helicopters over Kosovo. Still, with Blair
pressing Clinton and the apparent failure of the air war to drive
Milosevic out of Kosovo, Solana was authorized to have Clark work
out a modified, detailed invasion plan. Clinton again had to ask
Blair, in strong terms, to stop his government's public campaign
for a ground option.
</P>
<P>
   But in a photo opportunity on May 18, Clinton pointedly said
that ``all options are on the table,'' and within days, Clark was
in Washington going over his plan with the Joint Chiefs. Clinton
approved positioning up to 45,000 NATO troops (including 7,500
Americans) in Macedonia, to serve as part of a NATO occupation
force for Kosovo if Belgrade capitulated, but as the core of a
potential invasion force if not.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed again by the British, Clinton sent Cohen to a secret
meeting with his counterparts from Britain, Germany, France and
Italy. At the meeting in Bonn, Germany, on May 27, the ministers
decided that their governments would have to decide whether to
assemble a ground force for an invasion, and do so pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   So the officials, including Clark, reacted with enormous
distrust and skepticism to clear signals coming from Belgrade as
early as May that Milosevic was interested in discussing a deal.
Despite all of NATO's public claims that Milosevic's army was being
badly hurt, NATO generals understood that the army was well dug in
and was not going to be bombed out of Kosovo. Increasingly,
therefore, NATO strikes were aimed at putting political pressure on
Milosevic and his regime by bombing civilian targets like bridges,
roads, heating plants and electrical power stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he would have to capitulate sometime,'' one senior
Western official said. ``The only question was when. And no one
expected him to cave in so soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's acceptance of NATO's terms hit Washington with a
shock early on June 3, and Clark and others evinced great
skepticism, convinced that Belgrade was just trying to buy time and
short-circuit any invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But senior Yugoslav officials have said that Russian support for
NATO's terms, the prospect of more intensive airstrikes against
Belgrade's bridges and electrical and water systems, and, perhaps
most important, the understanding that a ground invasion was
imminent, were enough for Milosevic, who had won some important
diplomatic shifts in NATO's stand.
</P>
<P>
   Important for him, the United Nations would sanction the peace
and control Kosovo, not NATO; Russian troops would be among the
peacekeepers, and Kosovo was acknowledged to be a sovereign part of
Yugoslavia. ``It was the best moment for Milosevic to agree and
save himself,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the president concluded that he could not risk
losing the war, and he was therefore prepared to send ground forces
into Kosovo to assure a NATO victory,'' Daalder said. ``But why did
he and his advisers arrive at this conclusion so late into the war?
Why did they not consider what might happen if Milosevic did not
immediately cave when the bombing started? Indeed, why go to war if
you're not prepared to go all the way?''
</P>
<P>
   Daalder, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is
working on a book about the Kosovo crisis with Michael O'Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   Some have contended that Kosovo has shown the possibility of
winning a war with air power alone. But Daalder and numerous
officials suggest that key to the psychology of Milosevic's
decision was the prospect, real at last, of a ground war that he
could not win and that would have decimated his army and police,
two of the pillars on which his regime clearly rests. And one of
the great security problems of the Balkans, as Milosevic holds on
to power, these same officials say, remains his army and police,
which he was able to withdraw nearly intact from Kosovo, precisely
because NATO failed to destroy them from the air.

CONSERVATIVES BACKING BUSH'S ABORTION STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>

(jw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearful that Gov. George W. Bush's stand on
abortion could cost him crucial support, prominent conservative
leaders are working aggressively behind the scenes to persuade
their followers to put aside misgivings and rally behind the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush opposes abortion, he has taken pains not to appear to
be a single-issue crusader. He rarely uses the word ``abortion.''
He said there would be ``no litmus test'' for judicial nominees.
And last month, in a speech to the Christian Coalition, he
mentioned abortion only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a flurry of newsletters, speeches and one-on-one
conversations, many conservative leaders are mounting what they
call a ``pre-emptive strike'' intended to tamp down stirrings of
unrest in their ranks and prevent Bush's strategy from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of these conservatives are urging their
supporters to oppose any third-party contenders, most notably Pat
Buchanan in his drive to win the Reform Party nomination. They
concede that Buchanan has a more appealing record on abortion, but
say that he would only drain votes from the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are trying this newly pragmatic approach on issues
including school prayer, gay rights and international affairs. But
their biggest push is on abortion, one of the most divisive topics
in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   In appeals to the politically active members of their groups _
the ones most likely to vote in the Republican primaries _ the
conservative leaders make clear that they believe Bush can win the
election if he is left politically unfettered on the issues _ and
that he will support their causes once in office.
</P>
<P>
   In its recent newsletters, the National Right to Life Committee,
the nation's largest anti-abortion group, has repeatedly urged its
members not to stray to a third party. The group has not officially
endorsed Bush but leaves no doubt of its support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility for inflicting a President Bill Clinton on
this nation belongs not only to those who voted for Clinton
directly,'' one article said. ``It must be shared by those who made
Clinton's election possible indirectly by casting a third-party
vote that had the effect more of punishing than actually electing
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore or Bill Bradley or some other pro-abortionist wins
the presidential election in 2000, the eight years of pro-life
misery under Clinton will turn into 12 or even 16 years of
misery,'' the article said.
</P>
<P>
   In another article, the committee urged its members, ``for the
sake of unborn children,'' to oppose Buchanan because ``he will
only take away votes from a pro-life candidate who can win.''
</P>
<P>
   This preaching of pragmatism has been partly orchestrated by the
Bush campaign, according to both conservative leaders and Bush
advisers, but it also reflects independent judgments by many
prominent conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Two other contenders, Steve Forbes and Gary Bauer, are trying to
capitalize on the uncertainly about Bush's position on abortion by
presenting themselves as more unabashed in their stands. Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., has a long history of opposing abortion but is not
as popular among many conservative groups because he advocates
campaign finance laws that could restrict their organizations'
fund-raising potential, and because he has called on Republicans to
be more inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   While well-known conservative leaders like Pat Robertson, Jerry
Falwell and Ralph Reed have lined up behind Bush, the campaign has
quietly enlisted the support of many other influential
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mike Ferris, president of the Home School Legal
Defense Association, was a national co-chairman of Buchanan's
campaign four years ago but this year is advising Bush. (He said he
would also be satisfied with the positions of Steve Forbes.)
</P>
<P>
   Ferris said he was about to publish several articles to urge his
followers to be pragmatic. ``Some people think it's a matter of
great faith just to support the things that are unrealistic; I
don't read the word of God to say that,'' Ferris said. ``We stand
for ideals. But we stand for ideals in a way that they are going to
be accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ferris said ``Buchanan takes a stronger pro-life view
than Bush,'' he urged his supporters not to back his former
candidate because ``he's not going to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty
Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said that because of
his position in the church he would make no endorsement. But he
said that he had been spreading the word of pragmatism at church
retreats.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression among evangelicals and Southern Baptists is that
they are at this point satisfied that Gov. Bush is strongly
pro-life,'' Land said, ``that he is committed to changing the
hearts and minds of Americans on this issue and that he believes we
cannot substantially change the law until we change hearts and
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life
Committee, said Bush ``would be as effective a pro-life president
as anyone seeking the office.'' He said his group was contacting
members in its 3,000 chapters to counter ``other Republican
candidates who will go after the front-runner _ that's not helpful
to the pro-life movement.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the most influential conservative voices, James Dobson,
leader of Focus on the Family, whose daily radio show draws 5
million listeners, has stayed silent for months, perhaps an
encouraging sign for Bush. Dobson has for years been particularly
close to Bauer but has not endorsed him despite pleas from the
Bauer campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary has talked to Dr. Dobson about it and would very much
like Dr. Dobson's official endorsement,'' said Tim Goeglein, a
spokesman for Bauer. ``We want to do what we can to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative leaders said Dobson was not inclined to side
with Bauer because Bauer stood little chance of winning the
nomination. Carrie Earll, an official at Focus on the Family, said
people should not interpret Dobson's failure to endorse ``as a
failure of Dr. Dobson to be supportive of Gary or of disinterest in
his campaign.'' Dobson has not taken a public position on Bush, she
said, because ``there are still a lot of unknowns'' about Bush's
stands.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to reassure the party's conservative base is central
to Bush's strategy for winning the Republican nomination and the
White House. By opposing abortion rights, but softening his oratory
on the issue, Bush has sought to satisfy conservative as well as
more moderate voters, particularly women, whose support he would
want in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the strategy has its perils. While many rank-and-file
conservatives appear inclined to back the front-runner, his glide
to the nomination could be complicated by an outspoken minority of
conservative purists. These people could sit out the campaign, or
worse, work against Bush in the primaries and in the general
election if he wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly, founder of the Eagle Forum, who has not
endorsed anyone, said the Bush campaign had reason to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the grass-roots level, I just don't see enthusiasm for
Bush,'' she said. ``It's a problem for him because he doesn't stir
up the fervor and enthusiasm he needs. I've heard several people
say George Bush is not adequate on the pro-life issues. He isn't
100 percent. His heart isn't in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said it was ``a smart move'' by
the anti-abortion groups to rally behind Bush. ``Their calculation
is that if they can help get Bush to the White House but allow him
to moderate his rhetoric, they will achieve their goals of
overturning Roe,'' she said, referring to the Supreme Court ruling
that supported the constitutional right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential campaign four years ago, the National Right
to Life Committee was outspoken in demanding that candidates speak
out against abortion. At one point, it circulated fliers referring
to two candidates, Forbes and Lamar Alexander, as favoring abortion
because the group viewed them as not assertive enough on the issue.
And the Christian Coalition upbraided another candidate, Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, for saying he would not apply an anti-abortion
litmus test when choosing a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Right to Life Committee has tempered its oratory.
In one newsletter, it scolded conservatives in New York for
refusing to support Sen. Alfonse D'Amato because he did not have
``a pure 100 percent record.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the presidential race, the group warned its rank and
file, ``Think of the unintended consequences. They can be awful,
especially for babies in the womb.''
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign of 1992, Bush's father, President George Bush,
was excoriated by conservatives when he tried to appeal to
moderates on abortion. Now many of those conservative groups are
far more tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ironies in this business,'' said Mitch
Bainwol, a former chief of staff for the Republican National
Committee. ``But in a real sense, the father's loss paved the way
for the son. This is one very specific example of that.''

FRANCE PRESSES FOR A POWER INDEPENDENT OF THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In a Europe that is increasingly concerned about
unilateralism and resurgent isolationism in the United States,
France seized the moment last week to urge the European allies to
develop a more independent defense and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, speaking Thursday at an international
conference, warned that a world with only one superpower is not as
secure and safe as a multipolar world in which Europe is one of the
strongest poles.
</P>
<P>
   He believes this, Chirac said, ``because the present situation
is causing difficulties in numerous countries, including the most
powerful among them, the United States, where Congress too often
gives in to the temptations of unilateralism and isolationism.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, he added, was that ``the forerunners of what
could someday become a new bipolar tension are already arising''
between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   French officials close to Chirac said that one of the main
causes for concern in both China and France was the possible
deployment by the United States of a limited missile defense shield
to protect against attack by ``rogue states'' like Iraq or North
Korea. Such a shield in the eastern Pacific region might also make
China think it had to build more missiles to keep its own nuclear
forces from being marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   France, Germany and Britain all have strong reservations about
amending the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow to
permit more anti-missile defenses, and Russia has said that
changing the treaty could destabilize the global strategic balance.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the view of the European allies. ``President Chirac
has told President Clinton that it could open a Pandora's box that
is in none of the allies' interest,'' one French official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of French leaders since Charles de Gaulle in the
early 1960s, the best insurance against both U.S. isolationism and
the capriciousness of heavy dependence on the United States has
always been an independent French or European strategic power.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chirac and other French officials are capitalizing on the
Senate's rejection last month of a global treaty banning nuclear
tests to urge Europeans not to defer to U.S. leadership but to go
ahead and build something that Americans have long been calling
for: stronger European defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The world needs ``responsible involvement'' by the United States
in international affairs, Chirac said in his remarks, which were
warmly received by many other Europeans present.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke for me and for all Europeans on that,'' said Karl
Kaiser, a German foreign-policy expert who was an adviser to
Gerhard Schroeder, the German chancellor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chirac singled out the United States for only one moment of
praise: ``I salute their impressive economic and technological
dynamism,'' he said at a gathering organized by the French
International Relations Institute. ``I deplore the present American
diffidence in several major areas as a result of decisions by
Congress. I wish the United States would once more take on all its
responsibilities on the international scene, and as soon as
possible. But the world is a fragile place. It won't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist ministers of defense and foreign affairs also took
a strongly Gaullist line last week. ``For my part, I believe that
since 1992 the word `superpower' is no longer sufficient to
describe the United States,'' Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told
the same audience on Wednesday. ``That's why I use the term
`hyperpower,' which American media think is aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supposing Europeans really do want to become a power,''
Vedrine added, ``the willingness of the United States to accept
with anybody, and particularly with Europe, partnership that is
anything but momentary or limited, and to move from unilateralism
to multilateralism, remains to be demonstrated. We would like to
believe it. This question underlies the whole question of the
European common foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot accept either a politically unipolar world, nor a
culturally uniform world, nor the unilateralism of a single
hyperpower,'' he added. ``And that is why we are fighting for a
multipolar, diversified and multilateral world.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Alain Richard, speaking of lessons the
Europeans learned from Kosovo, where only the United States was
quickly able to mass the sophisticated precision-guided weapons
needed for the NATO bombing campaign, urged Europeans to cooperate
and build forces for similar missions.
</P>
<P>
   He and some other Europeans complain that the United States has
been warning Europe against trying to build multilateral defenses
that would duplicate the alliance's.

ON TENSE VISIT TO INDIA, POPE TELLS BISHOPS TO EVANGELIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ After blessing the tomb of Gandhi, Pope John
Paul II on Saturday instructed Roman Catholic bishops in Asia to
respect other religions, but not to lose sight of their ``call to
conversion'' in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In the twilight of his papacy, the ailing 79-year-old pope has
made the renewal of evangelization throughout developing countries
one of his highest priorities. On Saturday, he issued a document
that serves as a pastoral guidebook for Asia, where Catholics
remain a tiny minority. The pope noted that other faiths can lead
to salvation, but stated that Christianity is the true path.
``Respect,'' the pope explained, ``does not eliminate the need for
the explicit proclamation of the Gospel in its fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's message is particularly sensitive in India, where
Hindu fundamentalists have protested his visit precisely because
they oppose Christian proselytizing, which they dismiss as ``forced
conversions.'' Anti-Christian violence by Hindu extremists has
increased dramatically over the past two years, creating tension
between the Vatican and Indian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In separate meetings Saturday, the president and prime minister
assured the pope that India is a secular state that respects all
religious minorities. President K.R. Narayanan told the pope that
he himself had attended Catholic primary school.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, whose Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party leads the ruling coalition, also talked
about the guarantees of the Indian constitution. ``You know, Holy
Father, that India is a land of religious freedom,'' he said. ``But
we have some intolerant fringes.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, whose party depends on the support of hard-line Hindu
groups, is determined to avert incidents during the three-day papal
visit. Relying on 3,500 paramilitary troops as well as 55,000 city
police officers, the government banned demonstrations anywhere near
the pope. On Saturday, the police beat three Hindu nationalists
who, chanting ``no conversions,'' started a protest close to the
Gandhi memorial.
</P>
<P>
   After greeting political leaders, including Sonia Gandhi, leader
of the opposition Congress Party, the pope donned sandals to enter
the site where Gandhi was cremated. The pope, who often uses a
cane, slipped and lost his balance for a moment. An aide helped him
remove the sandals so he could toss red rose petals on the tomb, a
traditional Indian homage. He then made the sign of the cross over
it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pope called for tolerance and expressed sympathy
for the thousands of victims of the cyclones that have devastated
the eastern coast of India, his words were likely to be
overshadowed by his insistence on Catholics' duty to evangelize.
``Indians could misunderstand the call, because they have not
understood quite clearly the meaning of conversion in the Christian
sense,'' the Rev. Dominic Emmannuel, the spokesman for the Indian
Bishops' Conference, said. ``They see it only as a change of
religion. The church is talking about a conversion of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In his exhortation to the bishops, the pope repeatedly lamented
the persecution of the church in China. Noting that bishops from
mainland China appointed by the Vatican were not allowed to attend
synod events, the document stated: ``Their absence was a constant
reminder of the heroic sacrifices and suffering which the church
continues to endure in many parts of Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   While decrying totalitarian and atheist governments, the pope
sought to position his church in the next millennium as the
champion of disadvantaged people in capitalist systems as well. The
document spoke on a wide range of issues on which the Vatican
differs with the United States, from globalization to debt
forgiveness for poor countries, consumerism, pornography and
economic justice. It specifically lamented the U.N. embargo on
Iraq, where the pope intends to go next year to visit Ur, the
ancient city that believers say is the birthplace of Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with Asia, the pope did not mention abortion as much
as he does in speeches in the West, but he did stress the need to
uphold church teachings in countries ``where the demographic
question is often used as an argument for the need to introduce
abortion and artificial population-control programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The document is based on the suggestions made by bishops in Rome
last year, and in many ways it reflected the priorities of church
leaders in the field. But not always.
</P>
<P>
   The pope affirmed the right of local bishops to adapt to local
cultures, customs and sensibilities to promote the faith. But he
drew the line at allowing local bishops to make their own decisions
in adapting liturgy for Asian believers, something many bishops had
requested in Rome. ``The sacred liturgy cannot be determined by
local churches in isolation from the universal church,'' he said.

   PROGRESS SEEN IN SEARCH FOR CLUES TO EGYPTAIR CRASH
</P>
<P>
   An EgyptAir flight bound for Cairo fell from a moonlit sky early
last Sunday morning, plunging into the Atlantic south of Nantucket
Island and killing all 217 people aboard. So began a painful and
familiar ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives gathered in New York City and Newport, R.I., to seek
comfort and word of the recovery of remains. Federal investigators
explored whether mechanical failure, human error or terrorism was
the cause. The Navy searched ocean waters for telltale wreckage of
the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being delayed by stormy seas, investigators made some
progress. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders had been
located. And the synthesis of radar information indicated that the
jumbo jet had twisted and turned in its frighteningly fast descent
_ suggesting an aircraft out of control.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA STAGGERED BY CYCLONE
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of one of the mightiest cyclones in India's
history, the government tried _ fitfully and often futilely _ to
provide relief to 10 million people affected by the Oct. 29 storm
in the eastern state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
   The military was stymied by felled trees and buffeting winds,
and was delayed in reaching millions who were stranded in thousands
of villages that have been made all the more remote by flood
waters. Authorities estimated the death toll at 3,000, though they
said that preliminary figure was largely guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   VERDICT IN GAY MAN'S DEATH
</P>
<P>
   After a brief trial and 10 hours of deliberation, a Wyoming jury
found Aaron J. McKinney guilty in the 1998 murder of Matthew
Shepard, a gay college student who was found beaten to death and
tied to a prairie fence. The verdict was hailed as a major victory
by gay and lesbian groups because the judge would not allow
McKinney's lawyers to use the so-called gay-panic defense to
maintain that sexual abuse he suffered as a child triggered a
violent reaction against Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Following a call for mercy from Shepard's parents, McKinney was
spared the death penalty and instead received two consecutive life
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS EASES BANK LAWS
</P>
<P>
   After decades of trying, Congress finally repealed
Depression-era laws that limited the ability of banks to enter the
securities and insurance industries. President Clinton is expected
to sign the legislation shortly, ushering in a new era on Wall
Street as leading institutions seek partners to become financial
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the law to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act marked an
end to one of Washington's great gravy trains. In the last
congressional session alone, the industries affected by the bill
poured more than $300 million into lobbying and campaign
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY'S GREAT LEAP FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co. said it would open its third international theme
park in Hong Kong in 2005. Not since China took back the former
British colony in 1997 has there been so much fuss about a new
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Disney extracted rich terms for bringing Mickey Mouse to town.
Hong Kong will put up more than $3 billion and be the majority
owner of the park, prompting critics to dub it the Disney
state-owned enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   A RULING AGAINST GIULIANI
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge held that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani violated the
First Amendment when he cut public funding to the Brooklyn Museum
of Art for refusing to cancel an exhibition he considers offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the judge had ``lost all reason,'' Giuliani promised to
appeal and renewed his claim that museum officials acted
unethically by raising money for the ``Sensation'' exhibit from
those who have a direct financial stake in the show: contemporary
art dealers, Christie's and Charles Saatchi, the owner of the
``Sensation'' art.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA DEMOCRAT WINS
</P>
<P>
   As the vote tally clicked past midnight, Philadelphia came
closer to ending a half-century of Democratic rule in City Hall.
But finally, by dint of the party machine, former City Council
President John F. Street emerged as the people's choice, just
barely, with 50.2 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   An easier election day was had by Ross Anderson, a civil rights
lawyer and unapologetic liberal, who was elected mayor of Salt Lake
City. In San Francisco, Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. eluded the defeat
some pollsters predicted and survived for a run-off in December.
</P>
<P>
   7 UTILITIES IN POLLUTION SUIT
</P>
<P>
   Spending $60 million for five new furnaces does not qualify as
``routine maintenance.'' So said the Justice Department and
Environmental Protection Agency as they sued seven big electric
utilities in the Midwest and South, accusing them of polluting the
air by revamping old coal-burning power plants under the guise of
normal upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the utilities have hidden behind grandfather
clauses in the Clean Air Act to avoid spending money for modern
anti-pollution equipment. The utilities denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   MAKER OF DRUG KITS FINED
</P>
<P>
   After six years of warning Abbott Laboratories about
deficiencies in the manufacture of its medical test kits, the Food
and Drug Administration put new restraints on the sale of products
that help detect everything from the virus that causes AIDS to
hepatitis in donated blood. Abbott also agreed to pay a record $100
million to settle accusations that the company failed to meet
federal quality standards when it made a wide variety of test kits.
</P>
<P>
   REPORT CITES MEDICARE FRAUD
</P>
<P>
   For several years, administration officials have boasted of
success in their effort to curtail Medicare fraud. But a report to
Congress from the General Accounting Office suggests that those
claims may be premature.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators told Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine, that
``career criminals and organized criminal groups'' had infiltrated
Medicare and Medicaid. ``This isn't a matter of padding the bill,''
Ms. Collins said. ``It's billing for services that were never
provided. And that is much more pernicious.''
</P>
<P>
   A BLACK EYE FOR BOXING
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the International Boxing Federation and three
other top officials were indicted on charges of receiving bribes
from fighters and their promoters in exchange for manipulating the
federation's rankings to allow boxers to qualify for lucrative
fights. A prosecutor cited the ``culture of corruption'' in the
organization, one of three major international ranking groups for
boxing.

waters. Authorities estimated the death toll at 3,000, though they
said that preliminary figure was largely guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   VERDICT IN GAY MAN'S DEATH
</P>
<P>
   After a brief trial and 10 hours of deliberation, a Wyoming jury
found Aaron J. McKinney guilty in the 1998 murder of Matthew
Shepard, a gay college student who was found beaten to death and
tied to a prairie fence. The verdict was hailed as a major victory
by gay and lesbian groups because the judge would not allow
McKinney's lawyers to use the so-called gay-panic defense to
maintain that sexual abuse he suffered as a child triggered a
violent reaction against Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Following a call for mercy from Shepard's parents, McKinney was
spared the death penalty and instead received two consecutive life
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS EASES BANK LAWS
</P>
<P>
   After decades of trying, Congress finally repealed
Depression-era laws that limited the ability of banks to enter the
securities and insurance industries. President Clinton is expected
to sign the legislation shortly, ushering in a new era on Wall
Street as leading institutions seek partners to become financial
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the law to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act marked an
end to one of Washington's great gravy trains. In the last
congressional session alone, the industries affected by the bill
poured more than $300 million into lobbying and campaign
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY'S GREAT LEAP FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co. said it would open its third international theme
park in Hong Kong in 2005. Not since China took back the former
British colony in 1997 has there been so much fuss about a new
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Disney extracted rich terms for bringing Mickey Mouse to town.
Hong Kong will put up more than $3 billion and be the majority
owner of the park, prompting critics to dub it the Disney
state-owned enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   A RULING AGAINST GIULIANI
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge held that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani violated the
First Amendment when he cut public funding to the Brooklyn Museum
of Art for refusing to cancel an exhibition he considers offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the judge had ``lost all reason,'' Giuliani promised to
appeal and renewed his claim that museum officials acted
unethically by raising money for the ``Sensation'' exhibit from
those who have a direct financial stake in the show: contemporary
art dealers, Christie's and Charles Saatchi, the owner of the
``Sensation'' art.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA DEMOCRAT WINS
</P>
<P>
   As the vote tally clicked past midnight, Philadelphia came
closer to ending a half-century of Democratic rule in City Hall.
But finally, by dint of the party machine, former City Council
President John F. Street emerged as the people's choice, just
barely, with 50.2 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   An easier election day was had by Ross Anderson, a civil rights
lawyer and unapologetic liberal, who was elected mayor of Salt Lake
City. In San Francisco, Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. eluded the defeat
some pollsters predicted and survived for a run-off in December.
</P>
<P>
   7 UTILITIES IN POLLUTION SUIT
</P>
<P>
   Spending $60 million for five new furnaces does not qualify as
``routine maintenance.'' So said the Justice Department and
Environmental Protection Agency as they sued seven big electric
utilities in the Midwest and South, accusing them of polluting the
air by revamping old coal-burning power plants under the guise of
normal upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the utilities have hidden behind grandfather
clauses in the Clean Air Act to avoid spending money for modern
anti-pollution equipment. The utilities denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   MAKER OF DRUG KITS FINED
</P>
<P>
   After six years of warning Abbott Laboratories about
deficiencies in the manufacture of its medical test kits, the Food
and Drug Administration put new restraints on the sale of products
that help detect everything from the virus that causes AIDS to
hepatitis in donated blood. Abbott also agreed to pay a record $100
million to settle accusations that the company failed to meet
federal quality standards when it made a wide variety of test kits.
</P>
<P>
   REPORT CITES MEDICARE FRAUD
</P>
<P>
   For several years, administration officials have boasted of
success in their effort to curtail Medicare fraud. But a report to
Congress from the General Accounting Office suggests that those
claims may be premature.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators told Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine, that
``career criminals and organized criminal groups'' had infiltrated
Medicare and Medicaid. ``This isn't a matter of padding the bill,''
Ms. Collins said. ``It's billing for services that were never
provided. And that is much more pernicious.''
</P>
<P>
   A BLACK EYE FOR BOXING
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the International Boxing Federation and three
other top officials were indicted on charges of receiving bribes
from fighters and their promoters in exchange for manipulating the
federation's rankings to allow boxers to qualify for lucrative
fights. A prosecutor cited the ``culture of corruption'' in the
organization, one of three major international ranking groups for
boxing.

   PROSPERITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ America is doing well by any

   ALPHA-MALE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A certain consternation has
greeted the news that Naomi Wolf, a consultant to Vice President Al

   FOREIGN-POLICY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Diplomacy. Sanctions.
Bombs. There isn't much the Clinton administration hasn't tried to
rid itself of Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic. Now, suddenly,

   IRAN-REVIEW (Tehran) _ It may be years before the world will
know which represents the ``real'' Iran _ the medieval process

Businesses are eager to hire them for the management skills they
developed during the hard years of farming. By Dirk Johnson.

<P>
   TEENAGERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Money doesn't buy happiness _ and
among teen-agers, it may actually make life feel harder. More than
1,000 young people aged 13 to 17 were asked to compare their lives
with what their parents experienced growing up. Over all, 43
percent said they were having a harder time, 33 percent said they
were having an easier time and 23 percent said it was about the

RUSSIAN MILITARY, USUALLY SILENT, URGES HARD LINE ON CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>

 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Western leaders urge Moscow to move quickly to a
political solution to the war in the breakaway region of Chechnya,
Russian generals are pressing publicly for an all-out military
victory against the Chechen rebels, and in unusually strident
fashion warning Russian politicians to get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews in the Russian news media, top army
commanders now leading the campaign in Chechnya have said that this
time, they will not be robbed of the victory that in their view was
snatched from them in 1996. Then, Russia signed a treaty with
Chechen leaders, putting the region on the road to
quasi-independence.
</P>
<P>
   A report in the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets last week said
that Gen. Anatoli Kvashnin, chief of the Russian general staff,
even threatened to resign recently when members of President Boris
Yeltsin's administration proposed sending out peace feelers to
Aslan Maskhadov, the Chechen leader, whose appeals for talks have
been rebuffed by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   That report could not be confirmed, but the military's hard-line
views have already surfaced in unusually blunt and public comments
made by members of an officer corps that traditionally has stayed
out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest comments, published in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, came
from Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, commander of the western group of
forces in Chechnya, who warned that if an order came down from
Moscow ``to stop the army, there would be a massive defection of
officers of all ranks from the armed forces, including generals.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``officer corps of Russia will not stand for another slap in
the face,'' said Shamanov in a lengthy interview. ``Some even think
that with such a turn of events, the country would be pushed to the
brink of civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   What struck some observers here most about his statements was
not just his open expression of doubt about Russia's political
leadership, but the fact that they were published, and thrust into
the middle of Russia's political struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very complicated game,'' said Yevgeny Krutikov, a
correspondent for the newspaper Izvestia. ``We are used to
intrigues, but when a general talks about civil war, then it means
the situation is moving out of the usual framework.''
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agree that the military's new forcefulness is a
reflection of the weakness of Russia's civilian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military is becoming very assertive in a situation where
there is a political vacuum, a lack of political will, control or
expertise,'' said Dmitri Trenin, a military affairs commentator at
the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. ``The military would be right to
oppose tinkering because at this point, tinkering is all it would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the war started up in Chechnya in September, Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin has snubbed overtures by Maskhadov, whose
leadership in Chechnya since 1996 has been steadily weakened by the
rising influence of two warlords _ Shamil Basayev and his
lieutenant known as Khattab, who was born in the Middle East. Both
men have been singled out by Moscow as the masterminds behind armed
attacks against Dagestan, which borders on Chechnya, in August and
a bombing campaign that killed almost 300 people in Moscow and two
other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian airplanes and artillery have bombed and strafed the
region, causing uncounted civilian casualties and forcing almost
200,000 Chechens to flee the war zone, Maskhadov has allied himself
more closely with the rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, there is no one to talk to, and that is the
real tragedy on both sides,'' said Trenin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Russian military weighs into the debate, the terms
for a political settlement are sounding more and more like
unconditional capitulation. ``Negotiations are possible only on the
condition of the terrorists' destruction or neutralization,'' said
Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, a deputy chief of staff, at a news
conference on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With the military reporting minimal casualties on the front
lines in Chechnya, the war still has broad support from the Russian
public, which has welcomed the harsh crackdown against
``terrorists'' seen here as responsible for turning Chechnya into a
haven for criminals and kidnappers. Putin has also benefited from
the army's military successes; one opinion poll last week showed
him outstripping his rivals in next year's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   But with Western leaders stepping up their criticism of Russia's
war efforts, and in particular its failure to deal with the refugee
crisis that has developed on Chechnya's border, some here say that
pressure is building on the Kremlin to tone down the war, or at
least to show more compassion.
</P>
<P>
   But a military spokesman continued to criticize Western leaders
for expressing concerns that the military says are exaggerated.
``They are making political statements based on information that
has not yet been verified, has not yet been proved, but is being
spread on a mass scale,'' said Manilov.
</P>
<P>
   Charges that Russia's military campaign is ``leading to a
humanitarian catastrophe, that we are using disproportionate force
and that the refugees are in a terrible situation are not true to
fact,'' he said.

LAWMAKERS PUT CAMPAIGN CASH TO WORK IN THE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., N.Y., Texas)  (lb) 
 By JOHN FILES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Campaign contributions are, by nature, risky
investments, given the unpredictability of election outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   But the speculative element has grown with some members of
Congress, who are investing part of their campaign treasuries in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Investing campaign money in the market is legal, according to
Federal Election Commission rules, though it is a relatively new
practice. Increasingly, the stock-market boom is luring lawmakers
who are aggressively seeking ways to fatten their election
treasuries and scare off challengers. While some lawmakers have
padded their treasuries with market profits, others have suffered
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who is seeking a Senate seat next
year, has made more than $100,000 in the last three years from what
his campaign spokesman, John Sowinski, called a ``prudent
investment strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that more and more candidates want to get more
return from their money,'' said Sowinski, who emphasized that
McCollum had paid taxes on the investment income.
</P>
<P>
   Most of McCollum's $1.4 million re-election fund is in a
Prudential Securities money management account, Sowinski said, with
about 5 percent invested in two individual stocks: Cephalon, a
biopharmaceutical company working to develop products to treat
neurological disorders, sleeping disorders and cancer, and Diamond
Multimedia Systems Inc., a maker of interactive multimedia
components for computers.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman also invests personally in both of these stocks.
Sowinski said that the campaign was very careful choosing
investments to avoid any conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, ultimately,'' he said, ``candidates
want to make the final decision, because they have to raise the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal election guidelines, all the money received by a
campaign committee must be deposited into checking accounts or
other accounts maintained in an umbrella account designated as the
campaign depository. Money can then be transferred into other
accounts for investments.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee is required to disclose all income earned
through its investments, like interest or dividends, even if the
income is put directly back into investment accounts. And before
any money made through investments is spent, the investments must
be sold and the money returned to the campaign depository.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns for all members of the House of Representatives
and the Senate must report gains and losses from investments to the
election commission. Although lawmakers must disclose personal
investments to satisfy conflict-of-interest concerns, they are not
required to do so with investments of their campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Political committees must pay taxes at corporate rates, without
the advantage of capital gains, within a range of 15 to 35 percent,
depending on the amount of income generated through investments,
said Clint Stretch, the director of tax policy at the accounting
firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., is another legislator who has put
campaign dollars into today's tumultuous market, investing $1.7
million in blue-chip companies like Microsoft, Coca-Cola and
General Electric. According to election commission reports filed by
the campaign, investments and bank interest returned nearly
$400,000 in 1997 and 1998, and more than $25,000 in the first half
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch's spokesman, Ray Krauze, acknowledged that when the
market had dipped, the campaign fund had lost money. Last year, he
said, the campaign fund lost about $80,000 on one such downturn,
before making up for the loss when the market bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   This year, most of the campaign money was moved into mutual
funds and a money market account. Krauze said that Deutsch had
``nothing to do with decisions on investments,'' noting an
awareness of possible conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   But for some campaigns, the market has brought disappointment.
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., lost over $55,000 in 1997 and 1998,
according to election commission reports. This year, however, his
campaign has recorded profits, the reports show.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public
Integrity, a Washington policy research group, said that
investments of campaign money created a ``new wrinkle'' in the
contributor-candidate relationship. Lewis said he doubted that the
average donor was aware of what was happening with the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that some members have a fair amount of money that
they are sitting on,'' said Lewis, adding that the potential
profits in the market would inevitably tempt candidates. ``And as
campaigns have gotten more expensive over time, there is more money
being accumulated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Edwin Kahl, a real estate agent in Woodside, Calif., who
contributed to the Campbell campaign, said that he understood the
urge to profit from the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what any politician does with the money when
they are not spending it,'' Kahl said. ``But it doesn't bother me a
whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright Andrews Jr., a Washington lobbyist and lawyer, who has
contributed to the campaign committee for Deutsch and many other
candidates through the years, said that he assumed some candidates
dabbled in the stock market and he considered it reasonable
business discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's market you are not likely to go wrong,'' Andrews
said. ``You are likely to get a big return.''
</P>
<P>
   And given that many incumbents have millions of dollars in their
campaign treasuries, the temptation to score big in the market is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers have opted to follow a more conservative
tack, including Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who now has the most
campaign cash on hand among House members, with over $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Moriarty, Lazio's campaign spokesman, said that the
campaign had focused on ``flexibility, safety and responsibility to
donors'' when considering different methods for handling
contributors' money. They have avoided the stock market, Moriarty
said, though he acknowledged that campaign officials had discussed
the possibility of investing in it.
</P>
<P>
   But with such a hefty campaign war chest, the returns for
Lazio's fund from more conservative investing have been good: about
$200,000 from 1997 to 1999 from interest on certificates of deposit
and payments from Treasury notes and bills.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, has over $6 million in
campaign cash on hand. Kenneth Anderson, her treasurer, said her
campaign, too, had the money conservatively invested, avoiding
equities because ``federal election money is hard to raise and you
cannot replace it if it is lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's campaign fund earned nearly $90,000 in the first
half of this year on $4 million to $4.5 million worth of Treasury
bills and notes, Anderson said. He added that knowing the campaign
money was safe enabled him to sleep comfortably.

 &HT;    Butler refuses to be pigeonholed
 &HT;    By Leigh-Ann Jackson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When asked about the millennial doomsaying that
has America spinning on it heels, Octavia Butler cuts the question
to the quick. ``We made up this calendar for goodness sake!'' she
shouts.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not evidence that this award-winning fantasy/sci-fi
novelist is firmly planted in reality, what is? Never mind that
books like ``Dawn'' and ``Adulthood Rites'' pit Butler's
protagonists against the wilds of post-apocalyptic settings and the
wills of otherworldly creatures. If there's one thing she knows,
it's the difference between fact and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Butler has been telling stories for more than
40 years. For the bulk of that career, her daily life was marked by
the tedium of odds-and-ends temp jobs; her dreamlike creations were
cravings that could only be satisfied in the wee hours. Throughout
this double life, she was sending out manuscripts, short stories
and essays to anyone who would read them.
</P>
<P>
   Though her trials have brought her more rejections than she
cares to recall, they've also garnered her a nationwide fan base,
critical acclaim, and Nebula and Hugo Awards for the 1995 short
story ``Bloodchild,'' which features human refugees and wormlike
aliens engaged in oddly beautiful acts of trans-species
reproduction. That year, she also received a MacArthur Foundation
``genius grant.''
</P>
<P>
   The main body of Butler's work is composed of the ``Patternist''
and ``Xenogenesis'' series, which focus as much on the realistic as
on the fantastic. Works like ``Clay's Ark'' and ``Imago'' showcase
such sticky real-life issues as class stratification, feminism and
religion. Another story written on flypaper is ``Kindred,'' about a
black woman who is reluctantly transported from the 1970s to the
antebellum South. In order to ensure her own existence, she finds
herself encouraging the rape of an enslaved ancestor at the hands
of a white master. While the sci-fi element of time travel holds
the story together, at the center is the emotionally explosive
issue of a black woman perpetuating one of our country's most
shameful institution for the purpose of self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Butler to admit to the presence of socio-political
messages in her works is a daunting task. ``It's not really up to
me to interpret the things people see in my work,'' she argues
bluntly, offering little more input to probing questions.
</P>
<P>
   Her stories feature creatures with anatomies that aren't easily
described. Telepathic powers are common, as are alien domination
plots and cross-species breeding. This is obviously no ``Dick and
Jane'' reader, but Butler is troubled by the fact that her writing
is pigeonholed as science fiction. ``Labels are marketing
devices,'' she says in a frustrated tone. ``(The term `science
fiction') tends to be used to beat (writers) with.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler is daily faced with two more prominent labels that are
even harder to elude _ ``black'' and ``female.'' While many black
female writers find gender and race to be mixed blessings _ sources
of pride and experience on the one hand, grounds for stereotyping
on the other _ Butler claims not to be fazed by it, standing
staunchly by the belief that her story is what she wants to share,
not her lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   When asked her opinion on the status quo of black female writers
forming a sea of romance novelists, poets and spiritual advice
dispensers, Butler stands by her live-and-let-live philosophy,
saying that all a writer can do is write about what he or she
feels.
</P>
<P>
   She does make note of a small but profound handful of
contemporaries whose tastes follow her own. But she won't go so far
as to claim to be a part of any literary community. Her work is a
deeply personal effort and she hopes that readers bring to it an
equally personal perspective. Her unofficial credo _ voiced in
interviews and published in her essays _ is: ``What people bring to
my work is at least as important to them as what I put into it.''

<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia _ Late one recent sunny morning, the seven women
lying shoulder-to-shoulder in Ward 1 of the Sunzhenskaya District
Hospital grew quiet, turned inward, as doctors tended to the little
girl in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Several times a day, doctors come to change the dressings on
3-year-old Patima Ablusheva's face and shell-pink hands. When she
sees the doctors enter, she starts to cry. As they touch her and
try to soothe her, telling her how good and brave she is, she
begins to scream.
</P>
<P>
   She was badly burned when an aerial bomb exploded and set fire
to her house in Grozny, the Chechen capital, and she has been here
for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so bad for her when she first came here,'' said the
head nurse, Khadizhat Khairiyeva. ``Her face was so badly burned
she couldn't eat. She would always be crying because she was
hungry. She's better now. But we let her and her mother stay
because they have no place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has vowed that this latest war in Chechnya would be
different from the previous conflict, which ended in a stalemate in
1996 and led to about 30,000 deaths, mostly civilians. The
government has said its quarrel is only with the Islamic insurgents
of Chechnya, whom it also blames for terrorist attacks that have
killed about 300 people in Moscow and other Russian cities. The
government has promised unequivocal victory over the separatist
republic while avoiding civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   But Chechens who have fled here into Ingushetia, a neighboring
Russian republic, portray the situation as in some ways more
desperate than during the earlier war.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged Chechen woman lay a hand's breadth from Patima.
``Before,'' she said, ``we could run somewhere when they shot or
bombed.'' Her voice cracked into a sharp sob. ``Now, there is
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The wounded from Chechnya overwhelm the tiny Sunzhenskaya
Hospital, set behind a low wall and some juniper trees a few miles
from the border. Patients, most of them women, fill up the wards
and overflow onto iron cots in the dim, narrow hallways. Most leave
before they recover fully, making way for new victims.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-ager with hollow eyes sat propped against a wall,
surrounded by her aunts. A blanket pulled up to her shoulder
slipped, revealing that the right sleeve of her sweater was gray
and limp. Her legs, too, had been amputated. Neither she nor her
relatives wanted to talk to a visiting reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Mallika Adullayeva, 30, once a schoolteacher, and her sister,
Sotsita, were in two beds on the stair landing below the roof.
Afraid of air raids, they had lived for days in a basement in the
town of Samashki. On Oct. 26, they emerged to buy some bread. A
rocket exploded in their yard, they said, and left them with
shrapnel in their hips and sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the previous war, they would warn us about an attack,''
Mallika Adullayeva said. ``Before, the rebels fought back,'' her
sister said, ``but now there are no fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Civilians say that Russian gunships and artillery pound their
villages, which the government denies. Attacks on civilians
occurred in the last war, too, but this time, refugees have only
one exit. Borders to all neighboring states except Ingushetia have
been closed. The Ingushetia border itself was sealed for 10 days,
trapping tens of thousands inside Chechnya until international
pressure on Russia pried it open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war is completely different from the last one,'' said
Leche Ansarov, 40, a resident of Grozny. He was waiting in a
traffic jam at the border to get back into Chechnya in hopes of
retrieving his family. ``Then, there were some kind of corridors.
Now they surround you and want to destroy every living thing in
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   If he gets back to Grozny and finds his house deserted, he said,
``What else can I do but take up arms?''
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Djembulat Asmayev has lost everything he had, twice. His
parents were killed in the last conflict. He and his five siblings
lived with relatives during that war and then entered a Grozny
orphanage. Lately, life had gradually become normal: The children
went to school, the boys played soccer afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sept. 28, the orphanage was evacuated to the Komarov
Young Pioneers camp outside Nazran, a Soviet-era retreat for
children. Russian helicopters patrol the neighboring fields. In one
cabin, the children, dressed in dirty sweatshirts and Nike caps,
gathered around a television, mesmerized by a cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bombed Grozny with rockets,'' Djembulat said. He is small
for his age, with a shock of chestnut hair falling over his eyes.
``I don't know why Russia wants this war. The Russian people aren't
guilty. Everyone is so mixed up. The soldiers aren't to blame
They're ordered to do what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked evenly and quietly, all the while turning a coppery
rifle bullet over and over in his hand. ``We're so angry,'' he
said, his voice barely rising, ``but we don't know at whom _ who's
guilty for all this.''

 &HT;    GOP controlling map to presidency
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Precisely one year before the presidential
election, Gov. George W. Bush's quest to move from a white house in
Austin to The White House in Washington is more than halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   At least on paper.
</P>
<P>
   An early look at the state-by-state general election map shows
that any Republican nominee probably can lay solid claim to as many
as 190 of the 270 electoral votes it takes to win the White House.
Democrats, meanwhile, start out with about 55. Even Roger Salazar,
spokesman for Democrat Al Gore, acknowledged, at a minimum, that
early maps make a Republican road to victory look more doable than
a Democrat's path.
</P>
<P>
   Bush remains the odds-on favorite to be the Republican nominee,
bolstered by a $60-million fund-raising effort and poll numbers
that make it news whenever a GOP challenger climbs within 10 points
of him.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since any presidential candidate, save for
an incumbent, enjoyed such an early edge in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The rising tide of GOP governors, the growing suburbs with a
Republican-leaning electorate, and fresh memories of a Democratic
administration that has slalomed through scandal could combine to
make 2000 a watershed political year for Republicans, and possibly
for the Republican governor from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has plenty of hurdles to clear first. Election Day is
not until Nov. 7, 2000, and anything can happen. Even some of his
campaign advisers acknowledge that Bush's toughest challenger could
be himself. Self-inflicted wounds, such as not knowing the names of
world leaders, are always the most potentially damaging for a
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   High expectations, which Bush is burdened with, also are a
potential curse. Then there is the unforeseeable, like, say, a dump
truck flipping over and tossing its load onto the jogging governor.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bush is not working on a victory speech for a year
from tonight, there is optimism in Bushland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're winning,'' a top Bush aide said as the candidate prepped
for a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at how the Bush camp plans to keep things that
way:
</P>
<P>
   THE STRATEGY IN A NUTSHELL
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes the first leg of his trip to the presidency ends
on the first Tuesday in March, when 12 states hold primaries or
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all leading up to March 7,'' he said during a Delaware
campaign stop last week. ``I figure that's going to be it for me
one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore is in a surprisingly real battle
with former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. National polls show each
candidate running behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As for the general election, North Carolina-based pollster Scott
W. Rasmussen is doing presidential surveys in all 50 states. He's
done 19 so far and shows Bush leading Gore by more than the poll's
margin of error in states that offer 322 electoral votes. Gore
leads in none. Bush leads Bradley in states with 207 electoral
votes. Bradley leads in states with 68 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   But, Rasmussen notes, nobody has voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``All survey data collected more than a year in advance of an
election should be treated with caution,'' he said. ``In mid-1992,
Bill Clinton trailed both then-President Bush and billionaire Ross
Perot in the polls. Six months later Clinton was elected
president.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SPRING PRIMARIES
</P>
<P>
   The Bush primary season strategy is built on the belief that
Steve Forbes won't get much ballot-box bang for his bucks and
Arizona Sen. John McCain, emerging as the top challenger, is headed
for weekly survival contests. A couple of bad showings could end
the campaign for McCain, a lesser-known candidate with about $2
million on hand. Bush, on the other hand, has the money (about $38
million in the bank) and organization to survive an early loss or
stumble.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for now, is planning to skip the Iowa caucuses Jan. 24.
That would make New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary the first major
head-to-head test against Bush, whose lead, according to a recent
Franklin Pierce College poll, is down to eight points over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain has lobbed some criticism at Bush, Bush has not
reciprocated, opining only that he is not surprised that the New
Hampshire margin is narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good fellow and he's a good man and he's a formidable
candidate,'' Bush said there last week. ``I suspected there was
going to be a contest in this state. There always is in New
Hampshire politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home at Bush headquarters, strategists believe McCain's
last stand could come Feb. 22 in his home state, where polls show
him in a tight race with Bush. McCain has been locked in a
long-running war of words with his state's leading newspaper, the
Arizona Republic, which editorialized last week that McCain was too
hot-headed to be president. Strong showings by McCain in New
Hampshire and South Carolina could be erased by a less-than-stellar
showing in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers note that, going back to Jimmy Carter in 1976,
eventual nominees win their home-state primaries by an average
margin of 51 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The home-state challenge for McCain is further complicated by
the fact that Forbes won the state in 1996. And Bush, running a
close second to McCain in Arizona polls, recently won the
endorsement of Arizona Gov. Jane Dee Hull.
</P>
<P>
   THE FALL CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Nudged to look beyond the primaries, the Bush team is encouraged
by the way the general election battle is shaping up, convinced it
would be fought largely on the opposition's turf. They see Bradley
as too liberal for some centrist Democrats, and Gore, though backed
by the AFL-CIO, as a tree hugger who makes auto workers and coal
miners nervous.
</P>
<P>
   They also like the fact that Bush is competing for minority
voters, a key part of the Democratic constituency. The Democrats'
best hope for in-roads among GOP-leaning voters may be among
suburban women attracted by the Democrats' stance on abortion and
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee Chair Joe Andrew took heart last
week from his party's mayoral victories in GOP-leaning areas,
including Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis; Manchester, N.H.; and
Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, Republicans have been forced to play defense in areas
of the country they used to take for granted,'' he said. ``These
victories prove that it's message, not money, that wins
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans also found something to like about what Election
Day 1999 could mean for Election Day 2000. After last Tuesday, the
GOP now controls the governor's mansions and legislatures in 15
states, up from just three 10 years ago. Those 15 states offer 260
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also are confident they have an answer to what
shapes up as the biggest hurdle for the GOP presidential candidate:
Why would a nation change course in the middle of economic
prosperity?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in a ``new paradigm,'' says Bush political
adviser Karl Rove. New technology has spawned new thinking about
government's effect on the economy, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who came of age during the New Deal tended to put a lot
of faith in government to create the strong and vibrant economy,
but people who came of age after that have come more and more to
believe that the good economy is the result of their efforts
engineering the new technology which they themselves are unleashing
or employing,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   MAP MATH
</P>
<P>
   At Bush headquarters, it all adds up to cause for muted optimism
complete with short-term plans for the primary season and
longer-range plans to make sure things are aligned for a fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, or any GOP nominee, gets halfway to winning the White
House merely by carrying the 16 states (with 135 electoral votes)
that went Republican in the 1992 and 1996 wins by Democrat Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The maps also show that Bush can get the other 135 electoral
votes needed by winning as few as four more states, albeit big ones
(New York, California, Florida, and Pennsylvania) that, in varying
degree, could be up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   All but one (Florida) went for Clinton in 1992 and 1996, a
source of optimism for the Democrats next year. But Rove can spin a
victory scenario for his guy in each of the four states.
</P>
<P>
   Take New York. ``Since '94 they have twice elected a Republican
governor. They've got a Republican state Senate and a Republican
mayor in New York City,'' Rove said. ``And the Republican mayor of
New York City is running for the U.S. Senate and is ahead in the
polls against the first lady of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has gubernatorial support (Tom Ridge in Pennsylvania,
George Pataki in New York and little brother Jeb in Florida) in
three of those electoral vote-rich states.
</P>
<P>
   California, home office for political schizophrenia, is more
problematic for Bush or any Republican. The latest wild mood swing
in left coast politics has the Democrats back in favor and the
governor's office. But Bush has a top-notch organization in
California and it is showing some results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a state that Al Gore has visited 62 times and Governor
Bush has been there three times. And we're ahead. He should be
ahead of us in California given the amount of time he has been in
California,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers are convinced their candidate can succeed in his
effort to lure Hispanic voters, a key group in California and
elsewhere. At the least, they believe, Democrats won't be able to
portray Bush as a ``hate figure.''
</P>
<P>
   But California Democratic Party officials are eager to link Bush
to ex-California Gov. Pete Wilson, who became a hate figure among
Hispanics for his positions on immigration and affirmative action;
Bush differs on those positions.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is backing Bush, but, so far, has no official role in the
campaign. California Democrats would love to see Bush give Wilson a
very official-sounding title.
</P>
<P>
   ``A simple request,'' California Democratic Party adviser Bob
Mulholland said in a fax to Bush last week. ``When you meet with
Pete Wilson for that valuable endorsement, could you do so in
public, during daylight hours? We desperately need to take the
photo of the two of you smiling, shaking hands, etc. We need it in
2000, especially for ads in the Latino community.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ads could be damaging, but Bush, while working hard in
California, is banking on a political fact of life. California, the
undisputed big man on campus at Electoral College (54 votes, 21
more than runner-up New York) is not a must-win for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way a Democrat can win the presidency while losing
California,'' Rove said. ``There are ways for the Republican to win
while losing California.''
</P>
<P>
   The last person to win the White House without carrying
California was Carter in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Salazar does not deny that California is more
important for the Democrats than the Republicans, though he
declines to lock his candidate into any firm scenario.
</P>
<P>
   At Democratic National Committee headquarters, a veteran
political map-watcher who requested anonymity, said, ``It's a year
out. You can't be confident about anything. But you can't put
together a (winning Democratic) map without (California). No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the math map that offers a glimpse at the way the Bush
team is charting its course: _ Start with the 135 electoral votes
in the 16 states that went Republican in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add 75 electoral votes from these states to which the GOP can
lay credible claim (especially the Southern states if northerner
Bradley is the Democratic nominee): Nevada, Montana, Colorado,
Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, Louisiana and Georgia. That leaves a
GOP candidate 60 votes short.
</P>
<P>
   _ The GOP can pick up at least 54 of those electoral votes by
winning any three of these six states: Illinois, Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. Each of those states has a
Republican governor. All, save for New Jersey's Christie Todd
Whitman, already have endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the three least-populous of those states would leave
Bush six votes short of the 270 needed to win. And that leads to a
possibility that completes the circle for conspiracy theorists who
believe the Bush campaign is all about revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Only one remaining state offers exactly six electoral votes _
Arkansas, offering Bush the opportunity to seal victory by winning
the home state of the man who ousted his dad.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, Arkansas is a toss-up state, more likely to go
Republican if the Democratic nominee is not Tennesseean Gore.

 &HT;    Chili receptions helping Forbes build following
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBUQUE, Iowa _ A presidential campaign can be measured in
different ways. One optimistic measure of Steve Forbes' campaign,
as he traveled the length of Iowa last week, was in bowls of chili.
</P>
<P>
   At recruitment rallies in town after town, his staffers ladled
out chili by the gallons. When it ran out at an evening rally at
the John Deere Supervisors Club in Waterloo, they scrambled and
came up with 500 pieces of fried chicken before the candidate
finished his speech.
</P>
<P>
   From Sioux City, where local reporters said the crowd was two or
three times larger than the one Gov. George W. Bush drew a few days
before, to this German Catholic river town on the Mississippi,
every event Forbes spoke at was standing room only. In two days, he
signed and gave away close to 1,500 copies of his book, ``A New
Birth of Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely the lure of free food and an autograph helped. But on his
first bus tour of this state since the Iowa straw poll, Forbes had
to be encouraged by his reception. He was winning converts, like
Constance Krueger of Mason City, who liked what Forbessaid about
the military and abortion, and decided Wednesday to support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest job in the United States should be held by a
businessman,'' she concluded.
</P>
<P>
   An argument could be made that, at this stage in his second bid
for president, the conservative magazine publisher with the
deer-in-the-headlights stare is running a little under the media
radar. He is far from toppling Bush, but with the departure of
three Republican candidates since the straw poll, he figures to be
the front-runner's chief competition in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that makes Forbes such a long shot from a media
perspective is something the mostly gray-haired, grass-roots
conservative audiences who ate his chili don't give a hoot about.
</P>
<P>
   Even after four years of polish his delivery is still stiff and
corny _ and so are many of these voters. His core proposal, for a
17 percent flat tax on incomes above $30,000 hasn't changed since
the last campaign, and it is still just as popular with them. His
wife Sabina traveled with the campaign and waved cheerfully to
audiences, but there was no power-couple reflection in the way she
played her role.
</P>
<P>
   He looks like he doesn't know what to do with his hands, and
seems unable to tailor his message to an audience, causing blank
stares at North Iowa Area Community College when he talked about
Medicare and social security.
</P>
<P>
   But his promise to take the federal tax code and ``kill it,
drive a stake through its heart and hope it never rises again to
terrorize the American people,'' repeated thousands of times since
1996, still drew warm applause at most stops last week, as did his
pledge to restore ``integrity and professionalism'' to the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes still casts the capital as the culprit in a national
disconnect, in a ``netherworld drift'' as the nation stands within
grasp of ``possibilities and grandeur.''
</P>
<P>
   He presents himself as the ambassador of a high-tech capitalism,
an ``independent outsider'' prepared to make the few changes that
stand between the nation and a golden future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not so much anger, as you had eight years ago, as
disgust and anxiety,'' Forbes said of the public's mood about
Washington, as his campaign bus rolled toward Bettendorf. ``I think
it strikes a very real chord. People want to believe again.''
</P>
<P>
   At most stops he reminded audiences he was the only Republican
candidate criticizing the tight-money policies of Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, which he thinks have artificially driven
down commodity prices, hurting farmers and imperiling the economic
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Would he replace Greenspan, if the patron saint of the great
bull market were up for renomination and he were president?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have a heart-to-heart conversation with him, and if
he's still wedded to this crazy theory that prosperity causes
inflation ... if he believes in that theory then I'll get a new
chairman,'' said Forbes, whose grandfather founded the business
magazine which bears the family name.
</P>
<P>
   With a boost in ad lineage and the launch of several new
publications, the 52-year-old Forbes has grown the family fortune
since taking over the reigns from his late father, Malcolm Forbes,
a character as flamboyant as his son is reserved.
</P>
<P>
   While he has not held elective office, Forbes chaired the board
overseeing Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty during Ronald
Reagan's administration, which garnered him some important
conservative contacts, including former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   The family fortune he helped build _ Forbes is worth an
estimated $500 million _ has bankrolled his two bids for president.
</P>
<P>
   In the first campaign, he spent some $36 million and put up
negative attack ads on Bob Dole which ultimately backfired.
</P>
<P>
   This year, money and four years' experience has enabled him to
put together a campaign team with a deep well of institutional
memory about presidential races and the technical ability to e-mail
photos to small-town Iowa newspapers from the campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago Forbes was what I would call a novice and so I
was a little skeptical about his ideas, and in all honesty I was a
little skeptical about his sincerity,'' said Sen. Merlin Bartz of
Mason City, a former Alexander supporter who said he now considers
Forbes the most ``genuine'' candidate in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes admitted that political inexperience affected his
handling of the abortion issue in his first race. He was
``pro-life'' four years ago, he told a questioner at Dubuque
University on Thursday, but his efforts at bridge-building between
opposing sides of the issue were misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   This year he casts the issue as part of a trilogy. ``Life''
stands for how conservatives can work by stages to turn around
public opinion on abortion. ``Liberty'' stands for the right to
chose any doctor you want, and carry your insurance policy from job
to job under Forbes' ``Medical Declaration of Independence'' plan.
``The pursuit of happiness'' will be much easier, he tells
audiences, when taxes are lowered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you can be taught,'' Forbes said about
running for president. ``It's a painful experience of seeing what
works and what doesn't. Which is why I think Bush is making a huge
error, because if you're not out there and learning now how to do
things, pretty soon it's going be a little late in the campaign to
try to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Forbes campaigned across the state last week, Bush accepted
debate invitations from two Iowa television stations, portending
the upcoming phase of the race when voters will at least be able to
compare the candidates on the same stage. Forbes said he will push
for formats in debates here and in New Hampshire that allow the
candidates to ``mix it up'' and compare their platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative reluctance to join the Bush bandwagon has helped
Forbes' campaign to keep up a steady drumbeat of e-mailed and faxed
releases announcing the conversions of operatives from fallen
campaigns, such as Darrell Kearney, who headed Elizabeth Dole's
Iowa campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Forbes is the leader of the new conservative
movement,'' Kearney said in Sioux City.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding beyond that circle of disaffection with the Republican
establishment will be difficult, but Forbes holds as one of his
campaign models Abraham Lincoln, for his ability to bring the
public around by slow degrees on the slavery issue. He also reveres
Wendell Willkie, another businessman outsider who surprised the
experts.

 &HT;    Trendsetters predict blue stones, silvery platinum hot for Y2K
 &HT;    By Amy Kincheloe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Jewelry is taking on the flash and flair of the
millennium fashions, as glistening gems and shiny metals replace
the minimalist look of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think millennium, you think clean, you think shiny,''
said Dianne deWitt, a style expert who regularly appears on ``The
Today Show _ Weekend Edition.'' ``People are in a celebratory mood
and it has been fun to wear more jewelry lately.''
</P>
<P>
   That clean and shiny look will show up on everything from
precious metal finishes to semiprecious stones, deWitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Platinum is popular,'' she said. ``It's also the most
expensive, but that will be the metal of choice if you can afford
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that silver and white gold are more affordable metals
that glisten.
</P>
<P>
   Classic translucent stones like diamonds, colorless quartz and
cubic zirconia provide the futuristic look that is white hot as the
millennium approaches, deWitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone will be bringing out their biggest and best diamonds
for this historic moment,'' said Lynn Ramsey, president of the
Jewelry Information Center. ``More diamonds, textured metal,
combinations of matte and shiny fishes and an increased desire for
platinum are all driving new looks for this season of
celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue has been forecast as the the color of the new millennium by
fashion forecaster David Wolfe of D3 Donegar Design Direction,
Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So think blue, especially in combination with shiny, white
metals, such as sapphires and tanzanites set in platinum or white
gold _ very millennium,'' Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion designers Chloe and John Bartlett put American Indian
jewelry in their fall runway shows, giving turquoise a more stylish
presence, Ramsey said. Other blue-colored stones such as chalcedony
and lapis are also growing in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey predicts that the minimalist jewelry look of the 1990s
will fade out as women opt for larger pieces of jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to prettier, softer, more romantic,
multistrand jewelry,'' Ramsey said. ``It's a bigger look, not a
heavier look. There's a lightness there _ it's a different type of
feeling. It's about making a statement without going over the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Erica Courtney, a jewelry designer whose work has most recently
appeared in the movies ``Mumford,'' ``The Story of Us'' and ``The
Haunting of Hill House,'' agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current trend is way more glamorous,'' Courtney said
during a recent visit to Linda and Co. in Waco. ``I find people
aren't afraid anymore to wear their big diamonds. You can have
expensive jewelry and not look ostentatious. Now even the stars are
dressing like stars.''
</P>
<P>
   And what else is to come?
</P>
<P>
   ``The buzz word for spring 2000 is color,'' Ramsey said.
``There's a growing interest in colored gemstones like citrine and
pink tourmaline. Bold, oversized rings, strands of beads
(especially in coral and turquoise) and faceted gemstones are some
of the most popular ways to brighten up the wardrobe. A flash of
green peridot or yellow citrine against fashion's neutral palette
adds fun and style.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Courtney and deWitt agree that colored stones will be more
popular than they have been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of strong black and white tones (this season)
that need strong jewelry to compliment them,'' deWitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney said she believes ``yellow gold will be much more
important again,'' and Ramsey agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably see a resurgence of yellow gold with the burst
of color in fashion,'' Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Buying jewelry that will last until the year 3000 is a current
trend that all three women say they believe has staying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find my clients, in part, are more about a piece that's
going to stay with their jewelry box forever,'' Courtney said.
They're buying one expensive piece to build on and that they'll
hang on to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey said people are making more of an effort to let future
generations know what time period their jewelry is from.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are taking time to personalize their jewelry by
engraving it with the date,'' Ramsey said. ``Can you imagine having
a piece of jewelry with Jan. 1, 2000, inscribed on it _ it becomes
a historic piece.''
</P>
<P>
   According to deWitt, www.MyJewelry.com, a jewelry Web site where
people can design their own rings, has seen a lot of people wanting
to have the millennium date engraved on the jewelry they've
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium rings are fun,'' deWitt said. ``And how nice is it
to get a present for no other reason but the turn of the century?''

 &HT;    Men today face mixed messages about
 &HT;    masculinity, society's expectations
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ At Ken's Gym in downtown Waco, sensitivity
training is not part of the workout routine.
</P>
<P>
   The men who pump iron at this gym are focused on muscle
development when they're between the barbells, not emotional
well-being. Even though bigger biceps may help many of the guys at
Ken's stay in shape and feel good about their physical appearance,
being a man in today's world is about more than just looking big
and bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone looks at guys and says, `He's tough, he can make
it,''' Waco resident Dusty Miller said between deadlifts recently.
``There's a standard, set mold that people think all guys fit into,
but it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many men may be trying to fit that mold, which, according to
researchers, includes a laundry list of expectations and
stereotypes that society in many cases has not prepared them for.
Guys are supposed to be all things to all people: sensitive, tough,
compassionate, funny, smart ... the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1950s, we had clearly defined roles,'' Baylor
University sociologist Larry Lyon said. ``We moved away from that
in the '60s, '70s and '80s. A man's role was to provide and
protect, but that was redefined.''
</P>
<P>
   The plight of American men has been attracting more attention
lately, particularly after author Susan Faludi released her new
book, ``Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man.'' In the book,
Faludi writes that most men in the real world, especially those
from the baby boom generation, feel betrayed by what society has
handed them.
</P>
<P>
   Before and immediately after World War II, the sense of purpose
for men was simpler, and the role they played in society was
supposed to mean something.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it all fell apart so dramatically,'' Faludi said in a
recent media interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the space program. The new frontier of space turned out
to be an empty void where the new pioneer was a guy strapped into a
capsule. Instead of Normandy, we got Vietnam. Instead of
brotherhood, we got a situation where young men offered a lifetime
of service to a corporation and then got downsized, thrown away
like Kleenex.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last three decades, some of the changes in men
probably would make John Wayne spittin' mad. More and more men are
turning to plastic surgery every year to take care of blemishes and
beer bellies, according to the American Society of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons. Liposuction continues to be the No. 1
cosmetic surgery among men, and last year, nearly 20,000 such
procedures were performed, more than triple the 1992 figure.
</P>
<P>
   Eyelid surgery has seen a 75-percent jump since 1992, and nose
reshaping, the third most popular procedure among men, has gone up
almost 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons noted that his research shows men are spending more money
on clothes and their appearance than ever before. Part of the
change has come in response to media images that portray what a
``real man'' is supposed to be, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical appearance seems to matter more now,'' he said.
``There's a feeling that if you don't look like Brad Pitt and don't
have money you're not worth anything. At one point, if a man was a
good provider, period, that was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Men are also having to deal with changes in women's roles over
the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Women, for the most part, are now viewed as equals to men and
regularly achieve the kind of professional and financial success
that before the 1950s was reserved for men.
</P>
<P>
   More men have become Mr. Moms, staying at home to rear the kids
and putting aside many of the traits considered manly before World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   At Carver Park Baptist Church in Waco, Pastor Gaylon Foreman
said he tries to teach men to avoid living up to expectations put
on them by the media and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Real men, Foreman preaches, are responsible citizens of the
community who are accountable for their actions. They provide
strong role models for boys in the church and community, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to push them to be leaders in the community and in the
church,'' Foreman said. ``That helps benefit their personal
families and the larger universal family.''
</P>
<P>
   With a bustling economy, many men are expected to be financially
successful, buying fancy cars and living in big houses, he said.
But it's integrity and honor, not sport utility vehicles and trophy
wives, that are important things to have. Families, not fortune,
should be the priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to challenge our men not to get caught up in the rat
race and miss out on what matters,'' Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the expectations, sociologists say, are not healthy,
such as trying to achieve a certain physical appearance or status
at any cost. But many men can't even meet the reasonable
expectations _ like being compassionate and sensitive _ because
parents continue to rear boys using archaic practices, William
Pollack argues in his book, ``Real Boys, Rescuing Our Sons from the
Myths of Boyhood.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes that society judges the behavior of boys based on
``outmoded ideas about masculinity and about what it takes for a
boy to become a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These models (many of which date from the 19th century) simply
have no relevance to today's world,'' he said. ``Yet if boys don't
conform to these ideas, society has ways of shaming them into
compliance. By placing a boy in this straitjacket, society is
limiting his emotional range and his ability to think and behave as
freely and openly as he could, to succeed in the ever-changing
world in which we live.''
</P>
<P>
   The accepted practice of rearing boys with this ``straitjacket''
of expectations has been coupled with the late 20th century barrage
of media icons that continue to hold onto a sense of traditional
masculinity, like being tough, while exhibiting a gamut of other
traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to be `new men' in the making, showing respect
for their girl peers, sharing their feelings in emotionally charged
circumstances, and shedding their `macho' assumptions about male
power, responsibility and sexuality,'' Pollack writes. ``In short,
we want our boys to be sensitive New Age guys and still be cool
dudes. Is it any wonder that a lot of boys are confused by this
double standard?''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Capenter, 58, has owned Carpenter's Auto Repair in Waco
for 22 years. He said not all the expectations society has for men
these days are bad.
</P>
<P>
   Being a real man should include being sensitive and willing to
share emotions, something men in his generation and previous ones
weren't always encouraged to do. Men should be sensitive and
caring, but it's up to each individual man to be sure the
traditional values, like opening car doors for women and taking the
trash out at home, are not lost along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little embarrassed with today's man,'' Carpenter said.
``Today's men don't do for their families like they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Miller's struggle is trying to keep up his grades at Texas
State Technical College and hold down a job to pay for tuition and
books.
</P>
<P>
   But the likelihood that men like Miller will talk about their
hardships is slim, Pollack writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is ... a major difference between the plight of boys and
that of girls,'' Pollack argues. ``Even when their voices are
stifled in public, girls generally feel comfortable speaking in
private to one another about their pain and insecurities. By
contrast, though boys may exhibit bravado and braggadocio, they
find it more difficult to express their genuine selves even in
private, with friends and family. Their voices, as loud and
forceful as they may sound, may not reveal what is really in their
hearts and souls.''
</P>
<P>
   For many people, Wayne remains the icon of 20th century manhood,
though the kind of man he played in movies seems more impossible to
become all the time.
</P>
<P>
   When asked `Who is your favorite star?'' in 1993, Americans put
Wayne second, though he had been dead for 14 years. He was second
again in 1994. In 1995, he was first.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne's persona was created during a time of American dominance
in the world, a time when being the hero, being the man was about
simple values. After the Vietnam War, the male character in
Hollywood changed. He became more violent and more angry, like the
character played by Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The note of these films is rage,'' said Garry Wills in ``John
Wayne's America.'' ``Wayne did not normally have the contempt for
his opponent that Dirty Harry does. The Wayne hero could be calm,
in a time of the empire's dominance. His self-discipline was
counted on to awe or attract others. The mature Wayne was lightly
weaponed _ a rifle, or one pistol, and he often did not have to use
that. He faced down his foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reversing the laws of optics, Wayne seems to become larger the
farther off he goes,'' Wills writes. ``Down the street of the 20th
century imagination, that figure is still walking toward us _
graceful, menacing, inescapable.''
</P>
<P>
   A real man. But a man who today seems farther away than ever.

MINING FIGHT EVOKES A LIFETIME OF PASSION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: W.Va.)   (jw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLAIR, W.Va. _ Jim Weekley, the last litigious man in Pigeon
Roost hollow, warily awaited word from Washington about how the
politicians were trying to get around his big court victory, which
has put this state's coal mining industry and government
establishment in a state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Sen. Bobby Byrd's done a whole lot for this state, but
Bobby Byrd's just like all our politicians here: they're coal
company men,'' said Weekley, a retired miner who chain-smoked
watchfully in the autumnal glow of the hollow where his mother was
born.
</P>
<P>
   The hollow is a gentle valley containing 200 years of his family
history. It is set amid a series of mountaintops that the coal
industry targeted for decapitation with mammoth mining machinery _
``mountaintop removal'' is the technical term.
</P>
<P>
   It is a technique of dynamiting and bulldozing that Sen. Robert
Byrd, a Democrat, and the rest of the state congressional
delegation are now furiously defending in the name of the state's
economic health. They are pressuring the Clinton administration and
fighting to undo the stunning court victory over this high-tech
strip-mining practice recently won by Weekley and a group of other
homesteaders and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike tens of thousands of others in hollows across Appalachia,
Jim Weekley decided to rebuff the mining company's offers and cling
to his seven-tenths-of-an-acre homestead as he saw this backwoods
hamlet about 40 miles from Charleston shrink to 60 families from
200 when the mountaintops and hollows were bought for removal.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of gargantuan removal machinery that juts 20 stories
above the horizon, Weekley became the holdout among his now
departed hollow neighbors. He joined a public interest lawsuit to
block the common mining practice of dumping the vast tons of
dynamited waste from the obliterated mountaintops down into valleys
just like his beloved Pigeon Roost hollow, where streams and
woodland vistas are choked off and buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran free in this hollow all my life,'' said Weekley. ``The
memories and the footsteps and the happiness we have had in the
hollow. The six children we raised. The love tree where I courted
my wife. This fight is not about money. It's about being for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Chief Judge Charles Haden Jr., a veteran
Charleston jurist with a reputation for being conservative
Republican in his outlook, shocked the state last month when he
ruled for Weekley, the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and a
half-dozen other landholders. He found that the state had violated
federal mining and clean water laws for years by permitting the
blockage of hundreds of miles of vital valley streams with the
mountaintop rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``That judge came down my hollow to see what it was all about,''
Weekley proudly recalled even as he awaited word from Washington on
the efforts to undo the ruling, which environmental lobbying groups
have hailed as a landmark defense of antipollution law. As Weekley
spoke, that lobby was in a tooth-and-claw struggle against the
storied powers of Byrd, the dean of Senate constitutionalists and
leader of the state congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who loves to revel in such home state glories as
mountain fiddling, is alarmed that the state's mining economy and
jobs are threatened from the court ruling. He is planning to block
the decision by attaching a legislative rider to some final bill in
the congressional rush to end the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken some reasoned steps toward ensuring the
viability of the coal mining industry in our state,'' the
delegation declared in an opinion essay prepared for Sunday
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Lovett, the lawyer who won the court decision in behalf
of Mountain State Justice Inc., said that he had seen the rider and
that it would plainly gut the court decision by eliminating the
current valley fill standards and buffer zone requirements for
protecting streams _ strictures that Judge Haden found had clearly
been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The state delegation, which has declined to release details of
its rider to the public, is insisting a way can be found to repair
the problem while protecting both jobs and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House is hedging,'' said Lovett, noting that under
pressure from Byrd, the administration has declined to repeat in
this case its earlier unqualified warnings that the president will
veto any late session bills that include anti-environmental riders.
``My guess after eight years of watching this president is that
he's not going to veto it,'' Lovett said pessimistically.
</P>
<P>
   He is concerned as well that any last-minute effort to
compromise may also mean a weakened environmental law.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups are watching Vice President Al Gore in
particular because he is running for president on his
pro-environment credentials. He has contended that the urgency of
the issue was eased by Haden's subsequent decision to stay the
ruling pending an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But environmental lobbyists, noting that the delegation is
pursuing a rider to trump the appeals process, are dissatisfied
that Gore has not explicitly guaranteed a presidential veto if the
Byrd rider is passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's resolve does not seem so great,'' said Courtney Cuff,
Washington legislative director for Friends of the Earth. ``We fear
they're going to talk the talk, but not walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here in the state, the coal industry, the miners union and
virtually all government officials have attacked the court ruling
as economically ruinous. Gov. Cecil Underwood, a Republican,
ordered a hiring freeze and a 10 percent budget cut, steps that
environmentalists say was part of a pro-industry panic scenario to
help passage of the Byrd rider.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's Secretary of State, Ken Hechler, a Democrat,
accuses the White House of trying to finesse politics over
principle in this struggle. Long a crusader against mountaintop
removal, Hechler asserted that both Clinton and Gore had been
``oblivious to the utter devastation'' left by this rapid form of
strip mining. Precious mountains in four coal-rich states of
Appalachia are being reduced to ``moonscapes'' by a technique
increasingly on the rise, Hechler warns. The industry proudly
points to showcase reclamation projects, but Hechler, grieving for
lost nature, dismisses them as ``lipstick on a corpse.''
</P>
<P>
   As he patrols Pigeon Roost hollow, Jim Weekley is pleased that
by defending his family roots and memories on seven-tenths of an
acre he has managed so far to block a huge plan for a mountaintop
mining swath of 3,100 acres, a project that needed his hollow to go
forward.
</P>
<P>
   He is not against mining, he emphasizes, speaking as a veteran
of the old deep-shaft mines where, he says, the work could be
lethal but at least a man knew that his labors below were not
literally erasing his place in the hollow. Weekley is angry that
the politicians so concerned now about the environmental laws never
really told their constituents about their provisions in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't they tell the little guy?'' he asked, studying the
horizon and Washington beyond. ``The companies sure knew, but what
about the little guy in the hollows?''

 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The search for Bishop Dike, according to his coach,
would be a simple rescue operation: drive to Philadelphia, find the
sweet, freckle-faced African dreamer and persuade him to let go of
his shame, return to New York to finish high school and then apply
to a junior college that needed a soccer star.
</P>
<P>
   But as Martin Jacobson entered a North Philadelphia neighborhood
of vacant lots and abandoned buildings called the Badlands Oct. 29,
the coach's jaw muscles pulsed and the simple operation swelled
into a mission. He shook his shaven head at the hustlers and
addicts sharing the streets with children in charter school
uniforms. When the coach finally found Bishop in a shabby 24-hour
convenience store, working behind a grimy shield of bulletproof
plastic, he went ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm outraged,'' he shouted at a moldy wall. ``How does it
happen that the best striker in the country comes to this? Is this
what America does to people who come here to make something of
themselves? Who did this to him?''
</P>
<P>
   There is blame enough for everyone involved in the triumphant,
chaotic, courageous, corrupt, dangerous, now hopeful journey that
brought Bishop and his friend Henry Iwuchukwu from Nigeria, where
they were born, to Georgia, where they were abandoned by
international sports promoters, to New York, where they became
celebrated and then disgraced.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bishop and Henry led New York's Martin Luther King
Jr. High School team to its third straight city championship under
Jacobson. A month later, declared ineligible for supposedly having
already graduated from high school in Nigeria and accused of lying
about their ages, the two young men dropped out of school and out
of sight. Jacobson had already been suspended. Bishop and Henry,
poor, undocumented immigrants poignantly striving toward net
dreams, seemed like two more young casualties of the wars among
international organizations, national federations, promoters,
agents, shoe companies, club teams and high school coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not even as simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   The square-jawed, Jeri-Curled Henry Iwuchukwu, the more verbal
of the two, says he was born on Dec. 4, 1980, in Aba, one of Ibo
Chief Joel Iwuchukwu's 17 children by his two wives. The chief
disapproved of Henry's playing soccer, because it might interfere
with his Bible studies. Out of respect, 6-year-old Henry sneaked
out of the house and never flaunted his quick success. Henry was 9
before his father happened upon one of his games. The chief was
impressed at the respect adults were showing Henry. The boy soon
had new soccer shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Henry was eventually selected for the national under-17 team,
which is an essential first step toward a professional career for
an African player. European scouts do not routinely travel to
Africa, and African players rarely make the big time without the
international exposure that comes from traveling with a national
team.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop says he was born on Oct. 12, 1980, in Uwerri, one of
eight children of a fish-market owner. He, too, was selected for
the team. But the organization that runs international soccer,
FIFA, had been investigating Nigerian age-group teams. Although the
Nigerians were never charged with more than sloppy paperwork, the
under-17 team did not compete in the 1997 World Cup in Egypt. Age
discrepancy is a global problem; in South America, young players
are sometimes called gatos, cats, because like cats they seem to
have so many lives _ or different reported ages.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' dreams of being discovered _ Bishop and Henry still
fantasize about playing for AC Milan or Manchester United _ were
restored when a Nigerian-born obstetrician, Obi Okehi, promoted a
tournament in his hometown, Macon, Ga., for the under-17 national
teams of Brazil, the United States, Ghana and Mexico. Since Nigeria
would not send its national team, Okehi, who is also a licensed
FIFA agent, sponsored a club team of 20 Nigerians, many of them
national team members.
</P>
<P>
   Disorganized and ill-equipped, the team arrived late for the
matches and soon found itself stranded in Macon. According to Henry
and Bishop, the team's manager absconded with the expense money and
return plane tickets. Okehi confirmed this; in fact, he said, the
manager was his own brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a family matter,'' Okehi said, closing that discussion.
``I tried to help the boys, made calls to club teams. About half of
them made their way home. I lost contact with the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry and Bishop say they were fed and boarded by Nigerian
cabdrivers, street peddlers and food handlers in Atlanta until they
accompanied a teammate, Chika Echendu, to New York on a Greyhound
bus. Chika's cousin in New York, whom they would identify only as
Big Daddy, arranged for them to board with a Jamaican woman in
Rosedale, Queens. Big Daddy pointed the three players toward the
lively club competition in Brooklyn, where they met Ralph Bavaro, a
former Italian semipro player and a well-known coach and referee.
Bavaro was delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they want to play with me, and they were good,''
Bavaro said. ``So I call some of my old players and get my old
team, Real Napoli, together and make a scrimmage with the Staten
Island Vipers. They're semipro. And we tie them. And then we beat
my old rivals, the Brooklyn Italians.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing on that Italians team were three stars from Martin
Luther King Jr. High School _ two Trinidadians and a Senegalese _
who reported back to Jacobson about the Nigerians. Jacobson called
Bavaro, and came out to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed friendly,'' Henry said. ``He bought us lunch. His
players were nice. They said we had to come to their high school.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chika went on to minor league pro competition, but Henry and
Bishop enrolled at King in the beginning of 1998. While they were
encouraged by the paternal interest that Jacobson, who is also a
guidance counselor at the school, takes in all his ``children's''
schoolwork and health _ he insists on hugging his players the first
time he sees them each day _ the Nigerians were put off by the
rough atmosphere of the 3,200-student school on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No discipline,'' Henry said. ``Back home they hit you with a
stick for not paying attention, coming late, using bad language. I
would never put my hands in my pockets when an older person talks
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other problems at King, dubbed Horror High by the
tabloids, including safety problems, low test scores and charges
that a teacher had sexual relations with students and bullied one
into silence and an abortion. There was also the uneasy rub between
American and foreign-born blacks, many of whom are isolated from
the general student body in an English-as-a-second-language
division.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, both boys maintained an 80 average, passing all
subjects that first semester. By now they were living with Cal
Nwabudu, an assistant treasurer of the Chase Manhattan Bank and
president of the Nigeria United Soccer Club in central Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Henry and Bishop made their debuts for Jacobson in June 1998,
when the Harlem Jakes, a club team made up of past, present and
future King players, won a tournament in Middlebury, Vt., and
charmed the locals. Adults in the homes in which they stayed had
never seen such respectful behavior. The Nigerians had never seen
so many kinds of cereal in a private kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was charmed by Bishop and Henry. The revival of
Real Napoli was short-lived; the Nigerians abandoned Bavaro for
another Brooklyn team that took them to a Texas tournament. While
amateur club victories are about bragging rights, wealthy sponsors
typically slip cash gifts to star players and find them easy
part-time jobs. Bavaro remembers Bishop and Henry more in sadness
than anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have stayed with me if they want to be pro,'' he
said. ``They told me later they were sorry. They made a big
mistake, but it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Success on the Field Has to Be Forfeited
</P>
<P>
   Henry and Bishop thought they were on their way to discovery. At
an Adidas-sponsored soccer camp, they made the all-star team and
were listed on preseason high school all-America predictions. Last
fall, with Bishop up front and Henry at midfield, King, which had
not lost a game in the previous two seasons, had its best team
ever.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, King won every game as it stormed to its third
title. But two victories were forfeited when two players were found
to be ineligible _ one had an inadequate school attendance record
and the other was over the maximum age _ and Jacobson was suspended
by the principal for ``egregiously sloppy paperwork.'' He was
forbidden to speak to his players, although he remained as a
guidance counselor at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The coach and principal of Theodore Roosevelt High, which King
beat in the championship game, protested that Bishop and Henry were
also ineligible based on Nigerian documents that seemed to indicate
that they had both graduated from the same senior high school. The
Public Schools Athletic League found them ineligible, but did not
forfeit the title game.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent documents from Nigeria, obtained by Stanley Ogunedo,
a former consulate official who is now president of the Africana
Legacy Press, a publishing house, appeared to show that they had
only finished the equivalent of ninth grade at two different
schools. Ogunedo said that a Nigerian entrepreneur had given them
``a set of spurious documents to enable them to enroll in high
school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The two boys probably agreed to go along with the plan,
because they were afraid of being deported,'' said Ogunedo, who
became involved at Jacobson's behest.
</P>
<P>
   But before Ogunedo's documents arrived, after days of
interrogations by administrators and nasty comments in the
hallways, Bishop and Henry stopped going to classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ashamed,'' Henry said. ``We see our names in the
papers, not for scoring goals, but for being called liars and
cheats. It goes deep in your spirit when people look at you as if
you did something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nwabudu, the bank executive, was also losing his hold on the
boys. He said they began listening to soccer hustlers who told them
they did not need school, they could go right to the pros as had
Chika. They left Nwabudu's home. Jacobson made an effort to drag
them back in early 1999 and enrolled them in a degree equivalency
program. But they had housing and job problems, and their
attendance was sporadic. Their hearts were not in it. Nor was
Jacobson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't there for them,'' he said. ``My soul was ripped. I
was devastated by the suspension. I was accused of cheating. And
then I found out I had hepatitis C and had to go on drugs and maybe
get a liver transplant.''
</P>
<P>
   By last summer, Jacobson had decided to fight back, convinced
that his problems all came from ``envy and jealousy that mushroomed
into a lynch-mob mentality.'' He pushed Henry in his equivalency
studies and found him a part-time job refereeing youth soccer
matches. He filed a grievance against the principal who had
suspended him and had refused to reinstate him. He began asking
after Bishop, who had disappeared. He quit taking the drug
interferon, because it slowed him down.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Jacobson won his appeal and was reinstated as
coach. The principal was replaced. But even as King begins a run at
a fourth straight title _ the PSAL soccer playoffs begin Monday _
other coaches have forfeited games rather than play against
Jacobson. The charges that he acts as if he operates in a league of
his own show no signs of fading. His righteousness, success,
personal history (he is a recovering drug abuser and the father of
six children by five women), publicity (he is the subject of a
proposed feature film and a television news magazine profile) and
his willingness to work harder than most coaches can be spun for or
against him.
</P>
<P>
   And then two weeks ago, Jacobson got a call. Bishop had joined
his 27-year-old brother Ibian in a $375-a-month apartment in the
rear of a sagging house in South Philadelphia. It was time to bring
a close to that last championship season.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From the Badlands, A Dream Revived
</P>
<P>
   The apartment is bare, but scrubbed clean. Bishop calls Ibian,
who does the cooking, ``Martha Stewart.'' Tubs of rice and farina
are piled in the tiny kitchen. The Dike brothers sleep on
mattresses on the floor. At the head of each mattress is an
old-fashioned brass alarm clock. Ibian has the 1 a.m. to 9 a.m.
shift at the convenience store, which is an hour away by two buses
and a train. Bishop works from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. They make about $4
an hour from a Nigerian.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson presents his gifts _ a soccer ball for Ibian, new Nike
shoes for Bishop _ and plops on a mattress. Ibian, a college
graduate who originally came here on a mission for the A.M.E. Zion
Church, is jolly, but Bishop is wary and tight-lipped. Jacobson
asks if he plays at all these days. Bishop says he goes by himself
to a park on weekends to dribble and juggle. Some Liberians have
invited him to play on their team, but it is too far to go without
a car.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bishop says: ``I am sorry. I missed a lot. I should be
in college.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You still can be,'' Jacobson says. ``I can put you with a
coach who treats you right. You'll be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I should go to UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not right away. First, a junior college, then a four-year
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop sighs. ``Do the girls ask for me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone still talks about you. I'll tell you about it at
dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson drives to Upper Darby, Pa., to find a large,
middle-class, family-style restaurant where the Dikes can fill up
on meat and pasta and salads. Relaxed, sated, the brothers play
with the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our youngest brother, he is the best, the best by far,'' Ibian
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``How old is he?'' Jacobson asks, idly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen,'' Ibian says.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson perks up. ``I must have him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will bring him to New York,'' Bishop says, ``and he will
play for another high school.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dike brothers collapse, laughing. Ibian is dropped off at
his apartment. It is late Friday night, and a dozen young Americans
are shooting craps on the sidewalk. They stare sullenly as Ibian
strides through them. He does not have time to be afraid. He has to
get ready for his overnight shift behind the bulletproof plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop sleeps on the ride back to New York. He plans to spend
the weekend with Henry deep in the badlands of Brooklyn. Jacobson
thinks the rescue attempt may turn out successfully. He will stay
on the boys now, help them get their equivalency degrees, hook them
up with junior colleges, work on their immigration problems.
</P>
<P>
   The night has energized Jacobson. He will save Henry and Bishop,
he will win another title, he will defeat his enemies, he will be
healthy again. In the darkness of the highway, he sees a bigger,
brighter picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always look for signs,'' he says. ``It's not about winning
games, as much as I like to. Did I tell you, the other day, in the
school cafeteria, one of the basketball stars sat down with a
soccer player? American black and a West African. They talked
sports, school, girls, whatever. Everybody saw it. That could lead
to something.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a July 1997 raid, police officers and federal
agents here found more than 4,000 marijuana plants in a Bel-Air
mansion known as the castle, near the home of Ronald Reagan, whose
administration created the ``zero tolerance'' approach to illegal
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   With a trial scheduled to begin Nov. 16, the case has turned
into a test of judicial tolerance for a defense strategy based on
marijuana's medical uses.
</P>
<P>
   Two defendants, Todd McCormick and Peter McWilliams, advocate
legalizing marijuana for medical use and have used it to treat
their own ailments: McCormick for pain from cancer treatments that
fused several of his vertebrae, and McWilliams for nausea from
drugs he takes to treat AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the plants were for personal use and research on a book
about medical marijuana, they contend their actions were legal
under Proposition 215, the ballot measure approved by California
voters in 1996 allowing patients to smoke marijuana with a doctor's
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors, however, sought and received an order from
a federal judge barring the defendants from telling the jury that
side of the story, even offering to drop some of the counts against
them to keep those issues out of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling on Friday, U.S. District Judge George King
prohibited the defendants from making any reference to Proposition
215, the purported medical benefits of marijuana or even the
federal government's own experimental program, now closed,
providing marijuana to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants say they are not being allowed to defend
themselves. ``I'm devastated,'' McWilliams said in an interview on
Friday. ``I can't even present my case to the jury. We just have to
sit there and listen to the evidence, and we've already admitted
everything. Obviously, the federal government is stonewalling any
discussion of medical marijuana in any forum.''
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams, a best-selling self-help author, McCormick, who
founded a club that distributes marijuana for medical purposes, and
another defendant, Aleksandra Evanguelidi, were among nine people
charged with conspiring to grow and sell marijuana. They face
minimum prison sentences of 10 years if convicted. Three other
defendants have pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In court filings, prosecutors have said the medical issues are
irrelevant to the charges, and if allowed into evidence, ``will
serve only to confuse and mislead the jury.'' Further, they
maintain that if the defendants want to change the government's
position on marijuana, they should petition the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the defendants like it or not, the proper challenge is
through the regulatory process,'' Mary Fulginiti, a prosecutor,
said in court last month.
</P>
<P>
   The trial comes at a time of increasing conflict in America's
relationship with marijuana. On Tuesday, voters in Maine approved
an initiative allowing medical use, joining six Western states. A
report commissioned by the Clinton administration concluded earlier
this year that marijuana's active ingredients were useful in
treating pain and nausea, though the benefits were limited by the
smoke's toxic effects.
</P>
<P>
   And in September, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed
a cannabis club in Oakland to resume providing marijuana to
patients, in the face of an injunction from the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Yet marijuana remains classified by Congress as a Schedule I
controlled substance, putting it in the company of heroin and LSD.
That raised a central question: whether the defendants could assert
a ``medical necessity defense,'' maintaining that they broke the
law because their health required it.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contended that marijuana's Schedule I status
precluded such an argument, because it legally defined the drug as
having no legitimate use. But defense lawyers maintained that the
appeals court decision in the Oakland case opened the door to such
a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are so intent on keeping medical issues out
of the courtroom in the case that they agreed to dismiss charges of
intent to distribute if the judge barred the medical-necessity
defense. Under the law, the defendants could have been allowed to
assert that Proposition 215 and their medical conditions
contributed to their ``state of mind'' if they were prosecuted on
the intent charges. But with manufacturing charges, state of mind
is not relevant.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, King said the medical-necessity defense would be
unavailable to the defendants because allowing them to use it would
explicitly contradict a congressional determination. Judge King
found that the appeals court ruling in Oakland did not directly
address the issue, and he rejected admission of Proposition 215 and
medical benefits of marijuana because the government agreed to
limit its case to simple manufacturing charges.
</P>
<P>
   The number of marijuana plants, which rose to more than 6,000
after the discovery of other growing sites, has led to charges that
the defendants sought to reap profits by selling to cannabis clubs,
an enterprise not sanctioned by Proposition 215, which allows
possession in ``personal use amounts.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, the two men signed a detailed
agreement on financing and managing cultivation sites, distribution
plans and profit sharing. McWilliams is accused of approaching an
employee of a cannabis club with an offer to sell it marijuana,
saying that he wanted to become the ``Bill Gates of medical
marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has become a celebrated one with legalization
advocates. The actor Woody Harrelson, who was once arrested for
planting hemp seeds in a ceremonial protest, put up McCormick's
$500,000 bail, and Alan Isaacman, the lawyer who defended Larry
Flynt on pornography charges, signed on to defend him.

</P>
<P>
   McCormick made his case on the television show ``Politically
Incorrect.'' And a fugitive in the case, Renee Boje, who was hired
by McCormick to sketch the plants for his book, is profiled in the
December issue of Glamour magazine under the headline ``Drug
Queenpin or Innocent Victim?''
</P>
<P>
   Legalization advocates say the results of the case will serve as
a barometer of the federal government's willingness to prosecute
medical marijuana cases aggressively in states where medical use is
legal.
</P>

   ``To some degree, the outcome of this case will shape the extent
to which the federal government proceeds with additional federal
prosecutions for offenses which are no longer illegal under state
law,'' said Keith Stroup, the executive director of the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, a lobbyist for
marijuana legalization. ``If it's a clean victory, it will
encourage them to use federal prosecution.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A surge a very cool air will follow a front in the Northeast
states Sunday. Winds from the northwest will average 15 to 25 mph
from the eastern Great Lakes to New England adding to the chill of
the day. Plenty of clouds and a few flurries will occur near the
mountains of northern New England. Elsewhere in the region, partly
to most sunny skies will prevail. Sunday night will be one of the
coldest nights so far this season from the central Appalachians to
the Northeast Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Mild and dry weather will linger over most of the southeastern
states. Sunshine will be plentiful although onshore breezes will
promote patchy clouds and isolated showers in southeastern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably warm air will cover a large area from the interior
West to the central and northern Plains. Record high afternoon
readings are expected in many parts of the northern Rockies and
western Plains, especially where gusty breezes from the west are
further warmed by compression as they descend from the higher
terrain. Farther east, patchy clouds will prevail at the periphery
of the warm air mass from eastern Texas to the central and northern
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A potent front will approach the Pacific Northwest. Periods of
light rain will develop along the Washington and Oregon coasts
early Sunday. Later Sunday afternoon and Sunday night, locally
heavy rain will spread across northern California. Farther to the
south and east, variable high clouds will dim the sun across the
deserts of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution Season
</P>
<P>
   Fair fall weather can bring about severe pollution. During late
October 1948, Donora, Pennsylvania, was in the midst of the worst
air-quality disasters in the nation's history as twenty people died
from a fog poisoned with industrial smoke. The tranquil high
pressure systems of fall favor pollution. Sinking air that
accompanies autumn's high pressure systems acts like a tight lid to
trap pollutants near the ground. Light winds, another hallmark of
high pressure, are unable to disperse pollutants. Autumn highs can
also move slowly, allowing pollution episodes to sometimes last a
week.

 &HT;    It's a family affair

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ There are magazines for everything from dogs to
dollhouses, but when it comes to the really personal and highly
useful, there seemed to be a big gap in the periodic offerings.
</P>
<P>
   F&AMP;W Publications, a Cincinnati-based publisher, aims to change
that with Family Tree Magazine, which it bills as the first
mass-market, user-friendly magazine about genealogy and family
history.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogy is certainly a hot topic: American Demographics, which
studies these things, has found that about 7 percent of American
adults consider themselves ``deeply involved'' in researching their
family histories, and 40 percent are interested.
</P>
<P>
   The target audience of Family Tree Magazine is anyone beginning
the process or deeply immersed in tracing their roots. It offers
several tools and points of entry, including a Web site
(www.familytreemagazine.com). Standing columns include tips on
``reading'' photos for clues to the past; storming through brick
walls encountered in research; and reviews and roundups of the
myriad resources available, including other Web sites, software and
books.
</P>
<P>
   F&AMP;W Publications is an 80-year-old company whose products
include Writer's Digest, The Artist's Magazine and Popular
Woodworking. It also publishes books on genealogy, giving it a
built-in stable of experts to tap for its new magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Family Tree Magazine will begin slowly, with two pilot issues.
The first is available now; the second will be on newsstands on
Feb. 8, 2000, before commencing its bimonthly publication schedule.
Cover price is $3.99; subscription information is available on the
Web site.
</P>
<P>

ANGRY RECRIMINATIONS AS MEXICAN PRIMARY VOTE NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAM DILLON and JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The governing party's first presidential primary
campaign began months back as a smiling affair, with the four
candidates holding their hands aloft in a kickoff ceremony,
projecting comradeship and party unity.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign closed last week with three candidates
attacking the primary as an unequal competition in which party
officials had greased the way to victory for the fourth, Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, who seems to be the choice of the party elite.
</P>
<P>
   The sullen recriminations have surrounded Sunday's primary vote
with tremendous uncertainties. In itself, the party's decision to
end seven decades of authoritarian tradition by holding a
competitive primary represented a long step toward democracy. But
it remained unclear whether the balloting would strengthen the
party for the presidential race next year or cause a scarring
rupture that would diminish its chances for a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a catastrophe,'' Manuel Bartlett Diaz, a former
governor and one of the candidates who complained about the
inequity of the campaign, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting will shatter the tradition under which successive
Mexican presidents have chosen the party's presidential candidate
in private, later portraying him as the man preferred by the party
rank and file. After anointing a successor, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, has won every presidential
contest since 1929, sometimes through electoral skulduggery and
often facing only token opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The party has played a central role in Mexican life, and its
nominating ritual, known as el dedazo, or the finger-tap of the
candidate, has radiated authoritarianism throughout the culture.
President Ernesto Zedillo renounced the tradition in March after
concluding that the party rank and file would no longer accept a
candidate he imposed.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear how the primary will turn out for the PRI, and
whether a party used to stiff discipline among its rank and file
will end up too brittle to remain intact at the end of what has
become an extraordinarily rancorous campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far the primary has strengthened the PRI's image among most
Mexicans, because it's seemed like a pretty open process,'' said
Jorge Chabat, a professor at the Center for Teaching and Research,
a private university in Mexico City. ``But within the party it's
not clear the primary has been positive, because it could end in a
fracture and that could make them lose the elections next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls before the primary vote suggested a victory by Labastida,
a former interior minister, but few experts would rule out an upset
by his main rival, Roberto Madrazo Pintado, a former governor of
Tabasco. Polls suggested that Bartlett and the fourth candidate,
Humberto Roque Villanueva, a former congressman, had attracted
little support.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Labastida's opponents have accused party
officials of discriminating against them and using government
resources on his behalf. Such charges have made it uncertain
whether Sunday's election will produce a winning candidate with
decisive support and losers willing to accept their defeat
graciously.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins will have to face two major candidates in the July
2 presidential elections: Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the former
Mexico City mayor, who is the candidate of a center-left coalition,
and Vicente Fox Quesada, a former Coca-Cola executive representing
the center-right National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Under the governing party's rules, all registered voters, even
members of opposition parties, may cast ballots on Sunday. In
Mexico City, voters will also choose among three party candidates
for mayor.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In a system that resembles the functioning of the Electoral
College in the United States, the winner of Sunday's balloting will
be the candidate with a majority of the country's 300 electoral
districts, rather than the one who simply wins a majority of votes
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, the governing party experimented with
primary elections to select the candidates for governor in 13
states. Joseph Klesner, a political scientist at Kenyon College in
Ohio, studied the state primaries and concluded that several
strengthened the party by producing stronger candidates, but others
provoked ruptures.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans did not become completely convinced that the primary
was a genuine competition until Madrazo shot to an early lead in
the polls this summer with a television campaign portraying him as
a rebel defying the PRI's tradition of the finger-tap.
</P>
<P>
   The caustic rivalry between Madrazo and Labastida, who is the
only candidate drawn from Zedillo's cabinet, has deepened that
impression.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Zedillo's presidency, his first interior minister,
Esteban Moctezuma Barragan, accused Madrazo of engineering his 1994
election to the governorship of Tabasco through fraud, and sought
unsuccessfully to prevent Madrazo from taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Now Moctezuma is Labastida's campaign manager, and has
demonstrated his continuing personal animosity for Madrazo. In
September, he said that Madrazo's portrayal of himself as a
democrat was like Hitler parading as a human rights crusader.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has been equally vituperative, referring in one
television commercial to Labastida as ``a complete loser.'' He
repeatedly has accused Labastida of being Zedillo's ``official
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Labastida and Madrazo have been launching broadside
critiques of the president's tight-money economic policies, saying
they will spend far more freely on social programs and job creation
than has Zedillo. Labastida, nonetheless, surrounds these promises
with pledges of continuity and stability, while Madrazo has styled
himself as a rebel dedicated to wholesale policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo turned his campaign into a confrontation with the party
establishment, even calling for Zedillo's hand-picked party chief
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a leaf from U.S.-style negative campaigns, each of the
leading candidates has focused more on the other's defects than on
his own proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of the most damning accusations of corruption ever
leveled at the governing party were lodged during the campaign by
the party's own candidates against each other.
</P>
<P>
   The lavish campaigns by Labastida and Madrazo left the
impression that both candidates had dramatically exceeded the
spending limits decreed by party authorities. But the party imposed
no sanctions, especially angering Bartlett and Roque.
</P>
<P>
   The primary has also raised tempers at the grass roots. In
Iztacalco, a neighborhood of crumbling apartment buildings near the
Mexico City airport, for instance, the governing party has
traditionally had just one neighborhood headquarters that has been
the focus of all party activity. But during the primary, the party
divided into Labastida and Madrazo groups. Rivalries proliferated
and the other day a group of Labastida supporters broke the windows
of the house serving as offices for the Madrazo campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process has really confused people,'' said Cristina
Alcayaga, a former congresswoman who is a Mexico City coordinator
for Labastida. ``Our members ask, `Why do we have to choose between
two PRI candidates?' This is traumatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Monday, the governing party will set into motion a
program, Operation Scar, to reach out to valued party members who
worked for losing candidates and offer them party and government
posts in hopes of uniting them around the victorious presidential
candidate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This primary has been a cultural struggle for us,'' she said.
``There are going to be winners and losers, and it's going to leave
wounds.''

   DENVER _ His muscles tightened as he talked about life on the
streets. He admitted he was afraid. ``You have to look around every
corner now,'' Tom Hollis said. ``Especially when it is getting
dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollis is one of about 5,800 homeless people in Denver. Many of
them sleep on downtown streets and in local shelters. But since the
killings began, many more are crowding into churches and shelters
for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Since early September, five homeless men have been found beaten
to death and two others have been assaulted near the trendy section
known as Lodo, for lower downtown, an area of new bars, bistros and
restaurants that attracts thousands of patrons every night.
</P>
<P>
   Police have arrested two people in connection with one of the
killings and six in connection with the two assaults. All those
arrested are from 16 to 21 years old and are known to police as
``mall rats,'' for their hangouts along the 16th Street Mall, the
13-block commercial center of downtown. Like the men attacked,
police said, many of the mall rats are homeless, and they often
compete with other homeless men for corners to panhandle on.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those in custody has been linked to the four other
killings, which have had a startling effect on many of Denver's
homeless, including Hollis, 44, who was one of the men assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a big change, a big change,'' Hollis said on Friday.
``Everybody is really scared right now. Everybody used to get along
real well. People were friendly, like brothers and sisters. Now,
people carry railroad spikes in their pocket to protect themselves.
You're always worried about who's going to mess with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the killings have not had any appreciable effect on
downtown business, they have prompted an offer of $100,000 for
information leading to the arrest and prosecution of those
responsible. City officials refused to identify the donor,
describing the person only as a Colorado resident and business
associate of Larry Strutton, publisher of The Denver Rocky Mountain
News, one of the city's daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The reward has not appeared to stimulate progress in the case.
Sgt. John Priest, a homicide detective who is leading the
investigation, said the authorities were still developing leads and
were reasonably certain they were not searching for ``one mad
killer.'' More likely, he said, several people might be responsible
for the killings, and some could be involved in more than one case.
</P>
<P>
   The first victims _ Donald Dyer, 51, and George Worth, 62 _ were
found together on Sept. 7 under a loading dock, beaten on the head
and upper body. Police officers have not arrested anyone in
connection with those killings, but they have arrested two suspects
in the killing of Melvin Washington, 47, who was found on Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks later, Hollis and another man, George Burdge,
39, were assaulted. They provided police with enough information to
arrest six people, one of whom, Thomas Holden, 18, is suspected in
the killing of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 26, the same day Hollis chased away his assailants with
a rock, police discovered a fourth homicide victim, Milo Harris,
52, floating in the Platte River with wounds on his face, broken
ribs and internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Police found the latest victim, Kenneth Rapp Jr., on Oct. 22 in
an open field with severe head wounds. His body was badly
decomposed, and police said he had probably been dead four to six
weeks. He was 43.
</P>
<P>
   Hollis said he was sleeping when the attack on him began, with
one young man kicking him in the back before ``five more came from
out of nowhere.'' Despite wounds to his head and face that required
16 stitches, he said, he scrambled to his feet and began chasing
them. Along the way he picked up a rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found two of them,'' he said. ``I hit one of them in the
head with the rock.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no idea why he was attacked. It could not have
been for money. He said he had $2.50, maybe $3, and a few
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Hollis said three of the dead men were his friends. But now, he
said, many homeless people are so frightened that they do not know
whom to trust. And the arrests have not eased fears because no one
is sure if the killers are in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the ones in jail are the ones that did this,'' Hollis
said. ``They need to put a stop to this. I've lost three friends. I
don't want to lose any more.''

APPEALS PANEL REVIVES SUIT ON USE OF `I HAVE A DREAM' SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By KEVIN SACK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Reversing a lower court's decision, a federal
appellate court has revived a lawsuit by heirs of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. who claim that CBS violated copyright laws by
broadcasting portions of his ``I Have a Dream'' speech without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, a federal judge here ruled that King's famous 1963
speech, delivered on the Mall in Washington before some 200,000
people and a throng of reporters, was, in essence, public property.
U.S. District Judge William O'Kelley dismissed the King estate's
case in response to CBS' request for summary judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 2-1 decision issued late Friday, the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals overturned that ruling and sent the case back to
O'Kelley for a more thorough hearing. The judges said there were
issues to be decided about whether King's delivery of the speech
constituted a ``general publication,'' a legal principle that
denies copyright protection to those who make their work available
to the public without regard to how it may be used.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate judges did not address other issues raised by CBS,
including its claim to be protected under the First Amendment and
fair-use copyright doctrines, because the lower court had not dealt
with them. ``Of course, we express no opinion on the eventual
merits of this litigation,'' Judge Lanier Anderson III wrote for
the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Beck, an Atlanta lawyer who represents the King estate,
which benefits King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and their four
children, called the ruling ``great news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After all Dr. King did to protect his copyright through
registration and bringing a lawsuit against an offender, it's
especially gratifying to see that the copyright has been
restored,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, the New York City lawyer for CBS, said the company
would consider asking for a hearing before the full appeals courts.
He noted that the three-judge panel was divided and that even the
two judges in the majority differed in their legal analyses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, we're sorry that the entire case isn't over,''
Abrams said. ``But whichever court finds on this case, we're
confident on the facts and the law that CBS will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit stems from CBS' use of substantial footage of the
``I Have a Dream'' speech in a recent documentary series, ``The
20th Century With Mike Wallace,'' which was produced for the Arts &AMP;
Entertainment Network. CBS did not seek the permission of the King
estate.
</P>
<P>
   King's speech, a masterpiece of oration and a critical moment in
the civil rights movement, was broadcast live on television and
radio and was widely reported in newspapers. Advance copies of the
text were made available to news organizations. Those factors
helped convince O'Kelley that the speech had been in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   But King also copyrighted the speech about a month after it was
delivered in an effort to block the sale of unauthorized
recordings, and then successfully sued the producer of the
recordings. And while the speech was reprinted in a newsletter by
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the civil rights
organization that King led, Beck has argued that King did not
authorize that publication.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court ruled on Friday that the size of King's
audience and his eagerness for publicity on that day in August 1963
did not necessarily undermine his estate's claim to ownership of
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are unable to conclude that CBS has demonstrated beyond any
genuine issue of material fact that Dr. King, simply through his
oral delivery of the speech, engaged in a general publication,''
the court wrote. ``A performance, no matter how broad the audience,
is not a publication; to hold otherwise would be to upset a long
line of precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   The King estate, which has jealously protected its financial
interest in King's words and image, is trying to sell his papers to
the Library of Congress for $20 million. That price is $10 million
less than one appraisal of the collection's value and could allow
the estate to take a tax deduction for that amount.

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ With startling swiftness and a sense of civic
commitment rarely seen in this country, an organized mass peace
movement is suddenly becoming an important new force in efforts to
negotiate an end to civil conflict after 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting and demanding on banners, ``No Mas,'' or ``No More,''
at least 5 million Colombians marched late last month in more than
700 cities and towns to urge an end to the fighting and related
human rights abuses. In a country of 40 million, it was an
eye-opening display of strength, as well as a show of support for
formal peace talks just getting under way between the government
and leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in the history of Colombia that we are
seeing a mass mobilization on this level,'' said Francisco Leal
Buitrago, dean of the faculty of social sciences at the University
of the Andes here. ``It's not just their rejection of the war that
is important, but the fact that No Mas represents the dawning of
the process of building the civil society we have never had.''
</P>
<P>
   The No Mas coalition's most sweeping demand is for an immediate
and permanent cease-fire, ``not just some sort of Christmas
truce,'' said Francisco Santos, founder of the Free Country
Foundation, an anti-kidnapping group. But its call for an end to
the kidnappings that have become a social plague here and its
support for a negotiated peace have also resonated widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a very strong awakening of Colombian society,''
said Ana Teresa Bernal, director of Redepaz, a No Mas group,
``because the combatants are showing little or no respect for the
civilian population and the peace process seems to have bogged
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos said: ``People are really fed up _ tired of seeing things
getting worse and feeling impotent and forced into a corner. They
want to have a voice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the movement's show of strength has inevitably brought new
questions. Last week, the cover of Semana, the country's leading
news magazine, raised the main one: ``Now What?'' The words
appeared under a picture of the green loop, modeled on the AIDS
awareness ribbon, that has become the movement's symbol. It is
often seen on lapels, or on bumper stickers along with the slogan
``I Want Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long fight, and we are not a totally chartered
operation, Step 1, Step 2, Step 3,'' Santos, who has emerged as the
movement's most visible leader, said in response to the question.
``A lot of it has to do with gut feeling, with intuition. We are
going to have to be very creative in doing different forms of
protest, long-term education, building a regional base, whatever it
takes to achieve the critical mass we need to get our message
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, though, none of the warring parties have shown much
interest in heeding the movement's platform. Unlike leftist Central
American guerrilla movements whose credibility depended on
mobilizing popular support, Colombia's insurgents draw their
strength from money made through kidnapping, drug trafficking and
extortion. They are therefore less susceptible to moral suasion.
</P>
<P>
   The main guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, known by its Spanish acronym FARC, has in fact belittled
the movement and its message. In their stronghold of San Vicente
del Caguan, the largest town in the sizable area that the
government ceded to them a year ago, the insurgents have erected
banners that mockingly use the movement's name and catch phrase, No
More: ``No More Massacres,'' ``No More Hunger,'' ``No More Gringo
Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the guerrillas' animosity toward No Mas stems from their
suspicion of Santos. He is an heir to Colombia's leading publishing
family, whose paper El Tiempo has consistently criticized the
guerrillas. But the rebels also vehemently disagree with the peace
movement's position that ``all armed groups,'' including right-wing
paramilitary death squads, should be invited to take part in
national peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   There is also suspicion of No Mas on the right, group leaders
acknowledge. Some within the Colombian military, said Camilo
Gonzalez Posso, director of Citizen Mandate for Peace, see the
movement's insistence on a peaceful settlement as playing into the
hands of the guerrillas and tying those of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, peace movement leaders have been critical of
both of Colombia's traditional parties, and have resisted being
co-opted by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a social and civic network, not a party network,''
Gonzalez said. He added that because the parties are
``discredited'' and because ``we do not want this to be a movement
of regional or national bosses,'' no party leaders spoke at the 44
regional rallies that followed the marches last month.

   BUSH-YEAROUT _ AUSTIN _ It's a long time until Election Day, but
it's been a long time since any presidential candidate, save for an
incumbent, enjoyed such an early edge in the race. Texas Gov.
George W. Bush is bolstered by a $60-million-and-growing campaign
war chest and poll numbers that make it news whenever a GOP
challenger climbs within 10 points of him. He also stands to reap
the benefits available to any Republican who wins the nomination,
including a rising tide of GOP governors, growing suburbs bulging
with a Republican-leaning electorate and fresh memories of a
Democratic administration that has slalomed through scandal. A look
at the presidential race a year out, state by state, electoral vote
by electoral vote. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman). 40. WITH

   FORBES _ Steve Forbes is emerging as the conservative challenger

runoff Tuesday. We talk to folks in Montgomery and to Folmar and

   TEXAS-BLACKS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ For some, like the Bushes of

was something to flee and overcome. As Texas Railroad Commissioner
Michael Williams seeks to become the first African-American in
Texas elected to a nonjudicial statewide office, we look at
African-American Texans who had to go elsewhere to find political
opportunity, including San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, former

   NEWT-DIVORCE _ Like in so many high-profile divorces, Newt and
Marianne Gingrich's case is ultimately about money. But unlike the
fat bank accounts, mansions and ``priceless'' knick-knacks bandied
about in the Evander Holyfield divorces of the world, the
Gingriches' quarrel centers on fortunes not yet made. On Thursday,
the Gingriches are expected to appear in a Cobb County courtroom
for the first time since Newt Gingrich filed for divorce in July.
Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson will take up several
discovery motions still in contention, such as requests that the
couple's money be accounted for by a neutral person. We'll take a
look, as best we can tell, at what the Gingriches are worth now and
what the former U.S. House speaker could be worth in the future.

   KINGSPALD-MAIN _ ATLANTA _ Twice this year, the prestigious King
&AMP; Spalding law firm has been involved in withholding information
that had the potential to damage clients. In what appeared to be an
egregious case earlier this year, a judge said the internationally
known law firm obstructed justice by helping client GM withhold
evidence in the lawsuit over the faulty construction of the
Chevette gasoline tank. Such an admonition from a federal judge
would have been bad enough, but then the firm found itself facing
an even larger and more damaging problem: withholding ACOG records
from a congressional committee looking into Olympic bribery
allegations. The law firm turned to its most prominent member _
former U. S. Attorney General Griffin Bell, who still is referred
to as Judge Bell _ to help it save face. Bell told the panel the
firm had made an error in not surrendering records. Looking at
whether the resignation of the managing partner _ which happened
before the revelations about ACOG _ is related to the records
fiasco, and whether all of this has tarnished the K&AMP;S name in the
community. (Rankin-Mantius, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 60.

it would be normal for those in King &AMP; Spalding to call Griffin

attorney general goes well beyond Atlanta. Even in Washington, he
is still called Judge Bell, which made him the natural choice as
the messenger when King &AMP; Spalding had to tell a congressional
committee that it had not provided all the files the committee
sought in its probe of Olympic gift-giving. (Rankin-Mantius,

family, the 10 years that followed the razing of the Berlin Wall
have been a time of exploration and adventure. For others, the
decade has brought home the problems of living in a market economy
with all the perils that come with opportunity. And for still more,
the wall remains ? not in bricks and mortar but in the minds of two
groups of Germans who have been forced to come to terms with each
other. (Roughton, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

The fictional Major Zeman was Czechoslovakia's favorite television
detective during Communist times. A decision by Czech TV to
rebroadcast the 1970's serial has raised a vigorous debate in the
Czech Republic over whether the show is propaganda or

fines for spreading ``totalitarian ideology'' and former political
prisoners have filed a lawsuit to ban the broadcast. The TV chief
says the show is visual history and the decision to air it was made
to force the country to face up to its past. The debate goes to the
very heart of how this Eastern European country ? now a member of
NATO ? defines its fledgling democracy. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

exceptions, has literally redrawn the diplomatic map of the world
as the United States has pursued international relationships based
on economic interests rather than ideology. The Cold War's demise,
though, has also challenged the United States to four key
imperatives: managing the collapse of the Soviet Union; helping to
negotiate the rise of China; building a global trading order that
provides equity and opportunity to poor countries as well as rich;
and reducing the risk of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass
destruction. Failure in any of these four imperatives invites
trouble on such a scale as to diminish, if not totally negate,
gains made in any of the other optional areas. (Deans, Cox News

CHILE'S RIGHT IS STEERED IN NEW DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALCAHUANO, Chile _ Joaquin Lavin, the presidential candidate of
the Chilean right, flashed a wide grin and laughed triumphantly as
a throng of dock workers, unemployed coal miners and students
cheered wildly in response to his every promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich can take care of themselves,'' Lavin bellowed from a
platform set on a dusty street in one of this port's poorest
barrios. ``I'm going to fight for the weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed down in a blue work shirt, chinos and scuffed shoes, the
46-year-old former mayor pledged to help more disadvantaged
students go to college. Pensions for the elderly would go up, he
said, and the long waiting lines at public health clinics would be
a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's campaign is taking the once stodgy Chilean right, long
associated with the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, into
uncharted territory. He is changing the style of Chilean politics
from its traditional ideological roots to one more driven by
personality and image.
</P>
<P>
   And though he served as a junior economist in the Pinochet
regime, he has promised to open up his government to officials who
served in the old Socialist government of President Salvador
Allende, which was overthrown in 1973 by Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Many old-style conservative politicians and military officers
are privately expressing reservations about Lavin's populist
message. His suggestions that military spending can be cut, his
meetings with the families of dissidents who disappeared during the
Pinochet years, and his less than wholehearted defense of Pinochet
since his house arrest in London last year have raised right-wing
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   But Lavin is quickly rising in the polls. And his campaign
slogan _ ``Long live change'' _ has become the dominant one in wall
graffiti from the desert mining towns in the north to the frigid
settlements on the Chilean side of Tierra del Fuego.
</P>
<P>
   Only three months ago, polls suggested that the Chilean election
campaign was progressing predictably, with the candidate of the
Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition easily beating the right as
it has done in the two presidential elections since Pinochet
acceded to civilian rule in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But a leading poll published Oct. 27 showed Ricardo Lagos, the
61-year-old former education and public works minister, leading
Lavin by the slim margin of 39.2 percent to 36.7 percent, with the
rest of the electorate undecided or choosing minor candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lavin is increasingly doing better than expected,'' said
Ricardo Israel, a political scientist at the University of Chile.
``Can he win? We just don't know, but his competitiveness is good
for democracy since it takes Chile away from the Mexican model of
one-party rule no matter how well it governs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most political experts now predict that Lagos will not be able
to win the majority he needs on Election Day, Dec. 12, to avoid a
runoff with Lavin in January. Lagos has been hurt by the worst
recession in Chile in 16 years and by growing disaffection with the
governing coalition of Christian Democrats and Socialists, known as
the Concertacion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lavin and Lagos appear to have a tacit agreement not to dig up
each other's pasts. Lavin does not bring up that Lagos was slated
to be Allende's ambassador to the Soviet Union until the military
coup. And Lagos does not attack Lavin for working in the Pinochet
government, nor for writing several books praising the economic
record of the regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us in Chile have learned from past experience,'' Lavin
said in an interview. ``No one wants that history to return.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's strategy is to break Christian Democrats and the largely
apolitical youth away from Lagos, and he appears to be doing so by
distancing himself from some traditional conservative positions and
projecting a youthful image. He dances the regional and Indian
dances with people across Chile's varied countryside and has his
staff shoot instant pictures of him posing with voters at every
campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   In a break with traditional Chilean political practice, he has
put his family front and center in the campaign, and he appears as
little as possible with traditional politicians. Lavin's bearded
20-year-old son, Joaquin Jr., has become a heartthrob among Chilean
girls. And in a highly scripted campaign, it did not go unnoticed
that his wife, Maria Estela Leon, gave him a long, passionate kiss
on national television following a televised debate with Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Lavin promised to clean up Santiago's
pollution with a tree-planting campaign, to generate new jobs and
to bring specialized health care to the remote provinces.
</P>
<P>
   And in a careful endorsement of the arrests of about 50 military
and police officers on charges of human rights abuses in recent
months, he said, ``Calm justice should go forward, and in the last
few months we've seen that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview the day after the debate, Lavin said Pinochet's
house arrest in London was an affront to Chilean sovereignty. But
he added that the former dictator should be treated by the Chilean
courts like any other Chilean if he manages to escape extradition
from Britain to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The families of more than 1,000 dissidents who disappeared
during military rule and are still missing ``deserve, at the very
least, to know what happened to their loved ones,'' he said. ``As
president, I will work toward that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading backers of Lagos say his campaign has been put off
balance by Lavin's embrace of positions normally taken by the left
_ even as he remains a member of the conservative Catholic
organization Opus Dei who strongly opposes abortion and even
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin has long been an unorthodox politician. As the mayor of
Las Condes, a largely upper-middle-class area of 250,000 residents
in Santiago, he opened negotiations with street gangs to fight
crime. The negotiations led to job programs and the founding of a
special high school for 150 dropouts, the first of whom will
graduate this year. He opened three charter schools managed by the
teachers themselves.
</P>

   He traveled to Singapore to study ways to solve Santiago's dire
traffic problems, and once he even hired rain makers to salt clouds

ridiculed but also served to highlight his creativity.

SPORTS COLUMN: MARCH MADNESS CAN WAIT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Maury Hanks' travel agent booked him and his basketball team on
a flight that did not exist this week. The perfect itinerary,
months of meticulous planning, evaporated into a mad dash for
Tuscaloosa, Ala., through Cincinnati, slowing down in Birmingham
for a few hours sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do your team justice, you've got to do your travel so
you're not getting in at 5:30 in the afternoon, grabbing a van,
eating a Big Mac and going to play a game,'' Hanks said from
somewhere in the southeast, on the day when that's what he and his
team were about to do.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing was that Hanks' team, having won the night
before, was just beginning to get on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you read the score in the newspaper, or on the Internet.
Very likely you didn't, because you, and more importantly, Dan
Patrick, don't know Maury Hanks, and don't care that his team,
Global Nextlevel Sports, defeated Old Dominion University, 76-68,
Thursday night, before rising at 4:30 the next morning to go play
the University of Alabama Friday night, which would precede a
four-hour drive and another game Saturday night in Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   The games fall under the heading of exhibition college
basketball, and you can find them in the tiny agate print of the
daily papers. For Maury Hanks, for the growing number like him in
this strange basketball subculture, they are not practice, not
preseason. They are the pursuit of more guarantees, more games,
when the big-time programs begin filling two allotted slots for
exhibition games next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marathon Oil and Athletes in Action are the longest-running
teams like us,'' Hanks said. ``Everybody wants to be like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most college teams want to be like Duke, but everyone,
apparently, needs a role model. Marathon Oil beat Rutgers the other
night, after being trounced by St. John's. Some other college
basketball scores you may have missed this week as Ken Griffey Jr.
was being traded every five minutes on sports talk radio, the
Knicks were winning the first of 82 playoff tuneups and a few
boxing officials were indicted for failing to see that if the sport
became wrestling with gloves, people would just laugh all the
aberrant behavior off as clean family fun:
</P>
<P>
   Duke 128, Five-Star Hawks 80.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville 97, Premier All Stars 85.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois 104, NBC Thunder 87.
</P>
<P>
   And in what had to be my absolute favorite sporting event of the
first week with no postseason baseball and nothing else to stir our
big event-driven juices:
</P>
<P>
   Northern Iowa 71, Pella Windows 65.
</P>
<P>
   Pella Windows? Go Storm. Set screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pella Windows makes nationally known, quality windows, and
happens to be here in Iowa,'' Ron Smith, a Northern Iowa assistant
coach explained the other day when I called, much to his surprise,
for information on this game. ``Lot of Iowa guys, and Pella is
their sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Maury Hanks' sponsor, he didn't forget to say, is an
``up-and-coming'' sports apparel company, which supplies items such
as uniforms and equipment. The schools pay guaranteed money, and it
is Hanks' job to recruit the players, a wild September-to-October
scramble, as dreams of deals in Europe or a lottery ticket to a
National Basketball Association training camp are realized or
crushed.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Hanks if I would recognize the names on his current
roster, most of whom are former Division I players. He said not
likely, and he was right, except for Litterial Green, who once
played for the Orlando Magic. Depending on leverage, the players
are paid varying sums, not a lot, but enough to qualify these teams
as paraprofessional, existing for the sole purpose of conditioning
our purely amateur collegians.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that the traditional intrasquad game was
sufficient practice before the Division I juggernauts began
crushing hand-picked opponents, in the noble pursuit of 20
regular-season victories and a guaranteed tournament berth. Then
national teams from Eastern Europe were the touring rage until the
Communists were run out and the players scattered this time of year
to play for pay. In the entrepreneurial wild west, where a game
isn't a game unless a profit can be turned, the business of
barnstorming began to boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more teams every year,'' Hanks said, ``and more
competition for games. But every school I've played has played me
again.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're Spirit Express, which lost on successive nights this
week by 17 to Louisiana-Monroe and by 50 to Louisiana Tech, you can
expect Coach K to lose your number. On the other hand, last year,
Hanks' team beat Miami, Oral Roberts and Texas Tech. Business
became so good he organized two teams, hiring Darrel Johnson, who
had been the head coach at Baylor until academic turbulence hit the
program four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, 37, made the career assistant coaching rounds himself,
landing at Clemson when it had Elden Campbell and Horace Grant. He
quit nine years ago, to run and promote college tournaments, which
allows him to familiarize himself with the players, get to know
them, and stay in touch after they've left school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only want good people for my team,'' he said, ``because when
you play 11 games in 13 days, when it's cold and the airplane is
late, that's when you need them.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrel Johnson, answering the phone Friday at the Best Western
in Billings, S.D., seconded the motion. Johnson, 44, said he spent
a great deal of his own money to exonerate himself in the Baylor
mess with the National College Athletic Association, but finding
another job after the taint of impropriety was not easy, if not
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my own business now, but I still love coaching,'' he
said. ``This gives me a chance to do a lot of it in a short period
of time.''
</P>
<P>
   How much? Starting Sunday night, his team plays 10 games in 10
nights, from Missouri to Iowa to Texas to Idaho to southern
California. Long Beach State on Nov. 16 is the last game. Until
then, he'll cram himself into those airplanes and vans, knowing
that any victory, anywhere, will be the equivalent of a day at the
beach.

EFFORT TO RESTORE POCKMARK ON PARADISE'S LANDSCAPE DRAWS
OPPOSITION

<P>
   HONOLULU _ It juts into the ocean at the eastern end of Waikiki
Beach like some ghostly barge, its concrete arches crumbling, its
curving windows broken, its 100-meter saltwater swimming pool
stagnant and its 2,500 bleacher seats empty and forlorn. For 20
years, the War Memorial Natatorium has been a shuttered scar on
this famous stretch of shoreline, a victim of municipal neglect and
political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   But once it was the pride of Waikiki, and its dedication on Aug.
24, 1927, the 37th birthday of Duke Kahanamoku, the legendary local
surfer and swimmer, was a gala evening. While the memorial's
official purpose was to honor the 101 Hawaiians who lost their
lives in World War I, it stood as an equal tribute to the exploits
of the beloved Duke, who won two gold medals at the 1912 Olympics
and was credited with helping to revive surfing, the ancient sport
of Hawaiian kings.
</P>
<P>
   Now an effort to restore the old pool to some version of its
glory days, when it rang with cheers for champions like Buster
Crabbe and Johnny Weismuller (who set a record of 58 seconds for
the 100-meter freestyle on opening day), has run into opposition.
The fight has pitted local beachgoers against Honolulu's mayor and
civic boosters eager to restore Waikiki's luster, and put
environmentalists at odds with preservationists in the latest
example of Hawaii's perpetual effort to balance the pleasures of
paradise with the economic realities of a tourist economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quite frankly am ashamed that we have this rotting hulk of a
war memorial right in the heart of our beautiful waterfront,'' said
Honolulu's mayor, Jeremy Harris, who has led the $11.5 million
effort to restore the pool and the graceful colonnade that fronts
it. ``It's on both the national and state historic registers, and
as such, from a legal standpoint, it can't be torn down. And from a
moral standpoint, you shouldn't tear it down, either.''
</P>
<P>
   But a poll by The Honolulu Star-Bulletin last winter found that
Oahu residents opposed restoring the pool two to one, and Harris'
plans have been at least partly blocked by a grass-roots group of
residents, known as the Kaimana Beach Coalition, who fear that the
restoration plan would not ensure the quality of the water in the
pool and would despoil Sans Souci Beach, a quiet strip of sand just
to the east, under the shadow of Diamond Head.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Sans Souci has been a peaceful refuge from the
tourist crush of Waikiki, and it still retains the lazy feel that
in territorial days drew Robert Louis Stevenson to a genteel hotel
on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really care about that beach,'' said Rick Bernstein, 54, a
yoga teacher who leads the coalition and has lived here for 34
years. He wants the pool torn down to make way for a new 400-foot
beach with only the memorial archway restored. ``That beach is like
a lung for the people of Honolulu. All kinds of people come and
gather at all different times of day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the opponents of restoration won one round when a
Circuit Court judge ruled that any new pool would have to comply
with clarity and water quality standards for freshwater pools. City
officials say compliance is impossible. But this summer, another
judge refused to block the city from beginning restoration of the
bleachers, changing rooms and archways on the land side while the
State Health Department draws up new regulations specifying
standards for saltwater pools. Now, rusted steel rods and crumbling
concrete are being replaced, and a new head will be cast for a
majestic bald eagle on the facade.
</P>
<P>
   City officials do not dispute that the original pool was an
engineering disaster almost from the start. A deep, uneven sand
bottom (to accommodate diving towers) hindered the flow of coastal
current, and four 24-inch openings on each side proved hopelessly
inadequate for re-circulating ocean water to keep the pool clean.
It was finally closed as a health hazard in 1979. But officials say
their new plan, together with a pair of groins to be built out into
the ocean to trap passing drift, mean the water quality in the new
pool will be the same as in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say they know of no other public saltwater
swimming pools in the United States, and state health officials
have warned that it may be impossible to guarantee adequate water
clarity for lifeguards to see swimmers on the bottom. Opponents
also fear that the new groins would change the flow of current to
Sans Souci Beach, making the water there stagnant, though city
officials sharply dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the issue has prompted political infighting. In the
face of opposition from the City Council, Harris said he dropped
any plan of using the pool for nighttime water ballets or hula
shows to help finance the estimated $300,000 annual maintenance
costs. Harris' predecessor as mayor, Frank Fasi, who opposes
restoring the pool, has threatened to run against him next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a swimming pool that was an enclosed, chlorinated
swimming pool, it would be a little redundant,'' said Jim
Bickerton, a lawyer for the pool opponents who are about to file an
appeal with the state Supreme Court to try to block further
construction until the city can show it can meet government
requirements for operating a pool. ``But if that's what the
community felt would be good, we don't have any problem with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Bickerton added, ``doing it a way that's either going to be
over-commercialized or waste the ocean frontage because it's going
to be a white elephant that can never open doesn't make sense.''

U.S. LEADER URGES GLOBAL RED CROSS TO ADMIT ISRAELI AID GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The new president of the American Red Cross, Bernadine
Healy, has opened the long-simmering issue of whether to admit
Israel's related aid group, which uses a red shield of David as its
emblem, as part of the international organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is something we must correct lest the exclusion
of the Magen David Adom be perceived as partial, biased,
discriminatory or politically driven,'' Ms. Healy said of the
Israeli group last week before a meeting here of the global Red
Cross movement, held every four years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Healy, who became president of the American organization on
Sept. 1, called it an issue of ``the highest priority to the
American Red Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of admitting Israel, which does not have full status
even at the United Nations, is clearly tied to the broader politics
of Middle East peace, as one member acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Healy's unscripted demand also reignited an issue _ what
symbol best represents both the movement's humanitarian aims and
its neutrality _ that has plagued the Red Cross nearly since its
inception in 1864. And the efforts to include Israel in the Red
Cross movement have also been derailed in part by its use of the
red Shield of David.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has for years merely been an observer and not entitled to
a vote at the Red Cross global organization. Even though Israel's
work is well regarded, many delegates oppose adding the shield, a
six-sided star, to the Red Cross and Red Crescent symbols that the
international organization now uses.
</P>
<P>
   The movement's founder, Henri Dunant, who was Swiss, chose a red
cross on a white background, reversing the Swiss flag's colors, as
an easily visible sign to be used to protect the wounded and
identify those trying to help them.
</P>
<P>
   The red crescent, which is used by Muslim countries, was
accepted as an official emblem some 70 years ago after decades of
protest that the cross was a Christian symbol used in the Crusades.
Turkey and Egypt then took up the red crescent, and Iran chose a
red lion and sun.
</P>
<P>
   When other countries clamored to have individual signs, the
Geneva Convention was modified in 1949 to allow only the cross, the
crescent and the lion, which Iran eventually gave up in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Now delegates are determined not to allow individual countries
too much leeway to guard against a variety of emblems.
</P>
<P>
   The question of adding a new emblem arises at a sensitive time
for the organization because of the rise in killings of its
workers. Many fear the red cross symbol has lost some of its
protective value, and some say they fear that adding a new symbol
now would only provoke confusion and further hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the president of the International Committee of the
Red Cross, Cornelio Sommaruga, was angry at Ms. Healy's remarks and
argued that admitting Israel would force the movement to accept a
religious emblem, several delegates said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Healy's call was poorly received among delegates who
nonetheless agreed last week to a new working group to consider the
emblem issue. Ultimately the movement's 188 member countries must
ratify any change.
</P>
<P>
   The group will consider making a third, neutral emblem available
to countries like Israel, Kazakhstan and Eritrea, which refuse
either the cross, on grounds it is a Christian symbol, or the
crescent, because it is believed to be a Muslim symbol. Among the
ideas under consideration is a red diamond.

SPORTS COLUMN: FAREWELL TO AN OLD FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day after Pee Wee Reese died, my friend Bob
Fitzpatrick called and said I had to write something.
</P>
<P>
   Not really, I told him. Our people had done an excellent job in
the paper, and I felt no need to add anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' my friend said. ``You were a Dodger fan, like me.
Pee Wee was a class act. There's always more to say about Pee Wee.
I'm going to be very disappointed if you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   I have long maintained that I want my columns accessible to the
reader who is not a hard-core sports fan. I like to say I write for
a female reader, maybe a retired teacher who lives on the Upper
West Side of Manhattan, who reads her New York Times along with her
morning coffee and danish.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, there is no one typical reader, but there are
indeed people who pick up the paper every day who know the score,
who have expectations. There's a lady in Massachusetts with a cat
named Baggio who monitors my soccer output. There's a lawyer in
Cleveland who knows his stuff. My man Taxerman keeps me respectful
toward the Yankees. My three children. My wife. And my friend Bob,
who used to live a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You nailed that one,'' Bob might say. Or, ``You let me down on
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he was after me to write about Pee Wee Reese, calling me in
his unmitigated New England accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute,'' I said. ``You come from northern Connecticut,
right on the cusp between Yankeeland and Red Soxland. How come
you're a Dodger fan?''
</P>
<P>
   He told me how his father had taken him down to the hectic
little bandbox called Ebbets Field in the '40s, and how he saw Pete
Reiser when he was whole, Pee Wee Reese and then Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a Brooklyn Dodger household,'' said Sean, his oldest
son, the other day. ``We were taught to hate the Yankees at an
early age. He kept a shrine to the 1955 Dodgers in his library, a
picture of Ebbets Field. He was really into it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bob and Sharon Fitzpatrick and their four children
and their house full of books made it down from New England in the
late '60s, so Bob could rise in the Lord &AMP; Taylor hierarchy, the
Dodgers were long gone. It helped me immensely to know that my
friend, with his Amherst education, was equally passionate about
Cormac McCarthy short stories and sports at their best.
</P>
<P>
   For years, we took in an afternoon at the U.S. Open, watching
Connors and Borg, Evert and Navratilova, and maybe even the female
spectators in the stands, while we giggled like teen-agers playing
hookey.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday mornings for years there was a touch football game in
the park. Bob, who was nearly a decade older than me and 10 yards
quicker, could breeze past me, but then again so could Leo the
lawyer and Sam the urban affairs expert. Tennis was more of the
same. Bob did not believe in courtesy points or grace games, and
neither did I. He played his best, and expected his opponent to
look out for himself, even if it meant a 6-0 drubbing for me.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Bob and Sharon were also classicists. They were a
handsome couple _ Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward might work _ and
they dressed well and entertained well. Sharon gallantly brought
her love of literature with her every day to a challenging teaching
job in Hempstead, N.Y., and she also wrote for herself, without the
journalist's daily concern about the typical reader. Her novels and
her poems were taking form. Time was on her side.
</P>
<P>
   Bob endured a serious illness, went through the treatments, and
kept running. I would see his lean figure jogging past our house,
and I would open the door and applaud, and he would slow down and
wave.
</P>
<P>
   When they retired, they moved farther out on the Island. He
would call every so often to praise or prod. Life was serene, he
said, plus they had their projects.
</P>
<P>
   I can see them on the night of Oct. 30, well-dressed for the
flight, none of the sweatpants grunge favored by many travelers
these days. I can imagine Sharon studying a serious guide to the
pyramids, so she would know what she was seeing, Bob perhaps with a
Mahfouz novel from their well-stocked shelves, so he would have the
feel of Cairo. I can imagine them snuggling together and feeling
the EgyptAir jet's roar, taking them on the trip of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   When we heard the terrible news, I thought of our last
conversation, about the old shortstop who had shown us how to live
and die with grace.
</P>
<P>
   Upon Bob's hectoring, I had worked out a way to pay homage to
the Captain without intruding on the fine work my colleagues had
already done. I wrote about latter-day Pee Wee Reeses _ athletes of
today we can admire. Derek Jeter. Adam Graves. Michelle Akers.
David Robinson. The night the column appeared, Bob called me and
said, ``I knew you could do it.'' The job, as well as the living,
gets just a little tougher now.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STARLIGHT, Pa. _ The brown trout rose languidly, to an emerging
mayfly barely larger than the head of a straight pin. The dorsal
fin of the trout made a tiny wake on the smooth, flat surface of
the West Branch of the Delaware River, a stream that had turned
olive since those languid June days when the orchard grass and
timothy stood pale green and waist-high in the meadows.
</P>
<P>
   Trout streams also change colors with the seasons. In the fall,
the reflected light of the yellow poplars, rusty beeches and
scarlet sumacs are so intense that they tint the water the same
color children arrive at when they use too many crayons. Like such
children, we were also experimenting as we stood waist-deep in Home
Pool, in front of the author and fly-fishing innovator Al Caucci's
Delaware River Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, let's see if he wants the Iwamasa-style dun,'' said Jim
Emery, referring to a fly tied in the innovative, elegant manner of
Ken Iwamasa.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at my elbow, Emery made a short, 25-foot cast. The fly
drifted about 16 inches before the trout confidently rose and ate
it. Emery's leader sharply darted forward and then went slack. He
giggled, in his familiar way, and remarked: ``Wow. Isn't that just
the coolest thing?''
</P>
<P>
   It was my turn. In moments, the footlong trout was feeding
again. This time, I presented a differently tied imitation of the
same, tiny (size 24) Pseudocloeon mayfly. The trout levitated
confidently and sipped it down. The tip of my fly-line briefly shot
forward, but momentarily the fly pulled out of the trout's mouth. I
slowly stripped back my line.
</P>
<P>
   This anecdote may seem not quite right or even pointless, and
that's the most critical thing about it. We were fly-fishing
without hooks, which we had snipped off at the bend of each fly we
used. We were getting trout to take the fly, but even the most
gullible or impetuous of fish would not end up fast to our lines.
Eliminate the hook, and you eradicate any possibility of hooking
and fighting the fish. We were either taking catch-and-release
fly-fishing to the next level _ or reducing it to its most absurd
conclusion. But remember, as we stand at the brink of the new
millennium, catch-and-release was once considered a big fat joke,
too.
</P>
<P>
   In my circle of friends, the idea of hookless fly-fishing goes
back to the early 1980s, and a reclusive, innovative fishing
companion of Emery's, Mike Kimball. Consumed with the challenge of
realistic fly design, Kimball began to fish hookless for a
practical reason. He discovered that a trout was no more affected
by the experience of taking a hookless fly than it was by mistaking
a smidgen of flotsam for an insect. It merely rejected the
artificial and continued to feed normally. This meant that when
feeding heavily during a hatch, a single fish could be induced to
rise to any number of artificials, creating ideal lab conditions in
the quest for the perfect fly.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years later, there may be an even more compelling,
ethical reason for larger numbers and less driven types of anglers
to fish hookless. At certain times of the year, on some of our most
popular rivers, trout experience what amounts to serial harassment
at the hands of a legion of well-intentioned catch-and-release
anglers who essentially keep catching and releasing the same fish.
Many of us feel a great letdown and a twinge of guilt when we catch
a fish that shows unmistakable signs of having been previously
caught, ranging from a telltale red mark on its mouth, to a torn or
missing mandible.
</P>
<P>
   Like many devoted fly-fishers, Emery once was an astonishingly
predatory, focused angler who proudly hammered trout without
respite and felt all right about it simply because he released them
all. This spring, he took the ethical plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that in my own enlightened way, I was just as much
of a fish hog as that guy who kills everything he catches and
throws it in a bucket,'' Emery said. ``Did I really need to catch
another 16-inch trout? Of course not. The only real challenge in
trout fishing is getting the fish to rise and take your fly. The
rest may be exciting and fun, but just for the angler. The fish
goes through a lot of abuse and stress.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thus, on our heavily fished waters this summer, Emery
exclusively fished hookless. On a heavily-fished section of the
main Delaware near Lordville, N.Y., where on a banner night in the
past Emery would have landed eight or nine fish, he had over three
dozen ``takes'' during a sulfur hatch (granted, some rises were
repeats). He also took the time to watch for bald eagles and to
bask in a beautiful sunset _ things that he typically would have
ignored on those ferocious fishing days of the past.
</P>
<P>
   What he liked best about fishing hookless was the sensation that
``I entered the trout's world and got among them in a much more
natural way than ever before. I didn't interrupt their feeding
rhythms. They took the fly continually, and I still got that little
jolt of pleasure you feel when a fish takes your fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to harass or harm trout anymore,'' Emery
concluded, ``so now there's a way for me to do that and still keep
fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The hookless fly slid along, turning this way and that in the
microcurrents, behaving much more like a real mayfly than a typical
artificial one does. The hookless fly has no large bend and point
hanging down beneath the body of the fly, adding weight to what in
nature is nearly a weightless creature. All you need to transform a
conventional fly into a hookless one is a pair of wire nippers.
Surprisingly, the flies are no more apt to unravel, even after
repeated false casts or long throws.
</P>
<P>
   The trout rose. Ages seemed to go by as I saw the ivory-colored
inside of the fish's mouth, the olive snout, the tiny air bubble
left by the fish as it took the fly under. I momentarily felt the
weight of the fish, then nothing at all. In conventional trout
fishing, it usually takes from about 30 seconds to five minutes to
catch and release a trout, and the take by the fish is
simultaneously the most critical and the most short-lived part of
the experience. It occurs in a split-second, except on those rare
occasions in ultraclear water when you can actually watch a fish
leave its lie and move on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when the rise becomes the entire experience, it is
surprisingly satisfying and whole _ it seems to have a beginning, a
middle and an end, even though it's all compressed into a mere blip
in real time.
</P>
<P>
   But fishing time is rarely real time in any sense; it's almost
always going too fast, or way too slow, or something, depending on
whether or not your hands are cold, you're catching fish, or due
home. This is one of the myriad reasons why people fish, to escape
conventional time. And when an elite, conservation-minded
generation of anglers began to preach and practice
catch-and-release, they also escaped the most conventional goal of
angling, and made fly-fishing all the richer an experience for it.
</P>
<P>
   Hookless fishing may do the same thing; it works for Jim Emery,
it worked for me. It may work for you in the right time and place.
Lee Wulff, the fly-fishing pioneer and innovator, is famous for
articulating the most trenchant of all arguments for
catch-and-release: ``A great game fish is too valuable to catch
only once.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some fish are also too valuable to catch 30 times a
month.

AUSTRALIANS LEAVE NO ROOM FOR DEBATE OVER WHO'S BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDIFF, Wales _ On the day that Australians voted to keep Queen
Elizabeth II as their constitutional, if merely symbolic, head of
state, the queen handed the most important trophy in rugby to the
Australian captain, John Eales.
</P>
<P>
   Eales and his teammates won the World Cup on Saturday by
defeating France, 35-12, in a game that was not nearly as inspiring
or entertaining as last weekend's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game full of penalties and nervous ticks; an
occasionally ill-tempered game full of the frequent interruptions
and staccato rhythm that the rest of the world often associates
with the American brand of football, not the traditionally
free-flowing game of rugby union.
</P>
<P>
   But after building a 21-12 lead on the strength of fullback Matt
Burke's penalty kicking, the Australians finally found the open
space that was lacking for most of this chilly afternoon in
Cardiff's new and very costly Millennium Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   First came a try from the Wallaby wing Ben Tune in the 65th
minute; finally came a try from second-half substitute Owen Finegan
in the fifth minute of injury time. But Finegan's romp through the
now-dispirited French defense came well after the wake for the
French had begun.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians were clearly the winners, and in winning, they
became the first team in the brief but increasingly rich history of
this tournament to win the World Cup twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud that this team has won today, and we're part
of our own piece of history,'' Eales said. ``It has been a long
time coming. It has been four years that we've been talking about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory also maintained the southern hemisphere's domination
of this quadrennial event. Since its inception in 1987, the only
teams to win it are Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When this World Cup began nearly five weeks ago in this same
stadium, it appeared that the New Zealanders, not their arch-rivals
from across the Tasman Sea, had the better chance of making
history. But the All Blacks, the most widely recognized and feared
team in the game, proved too vulnerable defensively and
emotionally: getting beaten by the French in the semifinals in
arguably the biggest upset in the history of a sport that is hardly
overflowing with upsets.
</P>
<P>
   But the unpredictable French, so poor earlier this season and so
brilliant against the All Blacks, could not find a way to create
another upset Saturday. They played with plenty of desire, making
good use of their forwards early and, if their opponents are to be
believed, making good use of some dirty tricks in the bottoms of
the scrums, as well.
</P>
<P>
   They simply could not find a way to get behind the Australian
defense. They tried the same lobbed kicks into space that had
worked to perfection against the New Zealanders but without the
same spectacular results. All 12 of France's points would come on
penalty kicks by fly-half Christophe Lamaison, and while they came
close to the Wallabies' try-line on two occasions in the first half
and had a line-out on the Australian 5-meter line in the 69th
minute, they could never convert.
</P>
<P>
   In six games in this World Cup, Australia allowed only one try,
which is rugby's equivalent of a touchdown. And that one try was
surrendered against, of all teams, the United States, in a pool
game Australia won handily with several of its stars resting for
the bigger challenges to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Australians have the best defense in the world,
and we just couldn't get it past them,'' said French captain
Raphael Ibanez. ``We lacked some legs today and a little presence
of mind at times, but this was still a great adventure for us. I've
got a head full of good memories from this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Eales, the 6-foot-7-inch Australian lock who, along with
center Tim Horan, was part of the Australian team that won the
World Cup when it was last held in Britain in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll have a couple,'' Eales said.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about beers, and there were plenty of those being
opened in the pubs of Cardiff long before Saturday's 3 p.m.
kickoff. At Oz Bar, when the doors opened at 11 a.m., there was
already a long line of Australian fans outside sporting green and
yellow uniforms, kangaroo costumes and confident attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, they were soon shouting ``Aussie, Aussie, Aussie''
between swigs and belting out rendition after rendition of Waltzing
Matilda, and in truth, they have had plenty of opportunity to sing
their nation's unofficial anthem with feeling this year. Americans
might not care much for cricket or rugby or netball, a women's team
sport that is the rough equivalent of basketball, but the
Australians do, and they have now won world titles in all three
sports this year.
</P>
<P>
   Early next month, they will face the French again in the Davis
Cup final and then start finalizing their preparations for next
year's Summer Olympics in Sydney in which the Australians should
win a disproportionate share of medals for a nation with a
population of just over 18 million.
</P>
<P>
   What might rankle their opponents in this tournament more is
that rugby union, the 15-man version of the game, is not even the
favorite contact sport at home. Both Australian Rules Football and
rugby league, the 13-man version of the game, are more popular,
although Saturday's victory might begin to change that.

 &HT;    Folmar's tactics finally fail him
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ During his 22 years as mayor of Alabama's
capital city, cantankerous Emory Folmar seemingly pushed his
administration toward Apocalypse Now.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite of conservative white Republicans, the Korean War
veteran constantly exchanged racial snipes with black City Council
member Joe Reed. On his call-in radio and television shows, the
69-year-old has been called worse than a redneck and good ol' boy
by residents who claimed the 1982 gubernatorial loser to George C.
Wallace ignored the city's predominantly black west side.
</P>
<P>
   Folmar's political framework had been forged long ago _ it was
Us or Them.
</P>
<P>
   In October, after being forced into a runoff for the first time
in his mayoral run, Folmar opened the campaign against a white
upstart Democrat with his take-no-prisoners rhetoric blazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the smell of napalm in the morning,'' said Folmar,
brashly offering Robert Duvall's movie line as a victory theme.
</P>
<P>
   But years of political war grew tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with the racial crossfire, voters Tuesday turned Folmar
out of office. They tossed Reed out with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a tidal wave of change,'' said Reed. ``They wanted
new faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The same black precincts that turned out heavily for new Mayor
Bobby Bright also replaced the city council's four black
incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   As for Folmar: ``They believed he was their enemy,'' said Bob
Ingram, a longtime political columnist in Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram and others now are hearing how Montgomery may transform
into a ``little Birmingham.'' There, the divide of racial politics
pits a majority black inner city against an affluent ring of white
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a far greater visibility and greater
influence of west Montgomery in city government _ and it's time,''
Ingram said. ``Their interests will now be on the front burner.''
</P>
<P>
   OUT WITH THE STATUS QUO
</P>
<P>
   Consciously or not, Folmar helped lay the foundation for such a
political structure. The promise of keeping law and order was a
code word for protecting whites from black criminals, analysts say.
In the past four years, the city's black population has grown 4
percent as whites moved to the suburbs. In another four years,
blacks may represent the majority of voters _ just as they do in
Birmingham and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot stay in this office, making decisions,
without at some point making somebody mad,'' Folmar said election
night, just 70 minutes after the polls closed. The same man who
beat 46 people without a runoff 22 years ago won just 46 percent of
the vote this time.
</P>
<P>
   Wearied by antagonists like Folmar and even de facto
protagonists like Reed, blacks followed their own calling: anything
but the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just in Montgomery, but blacks in the South are developing
a political maturity and sophistication,'' said Bradley Moody, a
political scientist at Auburn University in Montgomery. ``When a
group has different perspectives, it's harder for a small band of
people to move them in one direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Montgomery was better off or worse because of
Folmar's tenure as mayor, 62 percent of the respondents in one poll
said it was better, 13 percent said worse.
</P>
<P>
   Among white respondents, 81 percent said Montgomery was better
off. Among blacks, 36 percent said it was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some demographic changes that created a desire of
someone new,'' said Whit Ayres, a Georgia-based GOP pollster who
worked for Folmar's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But there were other fault lines that shook Folmar's support.
</P>
<P>
   APPOMATTOX CALLS
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Folmar helped steer the re-election campaign of
populist Republican Gov. Fob James.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter primary against moderate Winton Blount, son of
Alabama Republican patriarch Red Blount, Folmar helped engineer a
racially charged mailout in the waning days of the race. The ad
helped enrage white conservatives by suggesting Blount would run
gubernatorial appointments by Richard Arrington, the first black
mayor of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Rural voters turned out in force and delivered a landslide win
to James, after some polls had shown the race was a dead-heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may have been some lingering hard feelings,'' Ayres
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby outside Folmar's office, the mayor had decorated
the blond hardwood panels with signed pictures of Republican
luminaries. Ronald Reagan waves in one. In another, the inscription
reads: ``To Emory. Your friend, Newt Gingrich.'' In the same
cluster is a wedding portrait of Folmar seated in his Army uniform
with his wife, Anita, resting her right hand on his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The day after his election loss, Folmar walked down the linoleum
hallway toward his corner office, Room 206. Propped against one of
the walls, a bundle of 25 cardboard boxes waited to be opened and
packed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to City Hall,'' he said to a waiting reporter, holding
up his right hand and barely breaking stride. ``I just don't have
time to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   On election night, Folmar told supporters he was squarely to
blame for the loss. He smelled of neither napalm nor victory.
Change was the scent that hung heavy in the political air.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets to be kind of like Gen. Robert E. Lee,'' Folmar
said. ``At some point, you have to go to Appomattox and
surrender.''

NO CLEAR FAVORITE AS 30,000 RUNNERS PREPARE FOR NEW YORK CITY
MARATHON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of the 30,000 men and women who have entered Sunday's
New York City Marathon, only 8 to 10 men and perhaps five women
have a realistic chance to win. But even those favorites cannot
agree on which of them have the best shots.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon, the largest in the world, has attracted runners
from all 50 states and 110 other nations. About 70 percent of the
runners are men.
</P>
<P>
   The runners will start about 10:50 a.m. on the Staten Island
side of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. They will run 12 miles
through Brooklyn, enter Queens on the Pulaski Bridge, enter
Manhattan over the Queensboro Bridge, run up First Avenue, make a
quick visit to the Bronx, return to Manhattan a mile later, enter
Central Park, stay there except for a short stretch on Central Park
South and then return to the park for the final quarter-mile.
</P>
<P>
   The course, covering the traditional marathon distance of 26
miles 385 yards, will take the male winner about 2 hours 10 minutes
to complete, give or take a couple of minutes, and the leading
woman about 2:26. Recreational runners may finish hours later.
</P>
<P>
   John Kagwe of Kenya, the men's winner the last two years, and
Franca Fiacconi of Italy, who won the women's race last year, are
back. Tegla Loroupe of Kenya, the women's winner in 1994 and 1995,
said there was a 50-50 chance she would run, too. That was
surprising because of her limited recovery time after setting a
women's world best of 2:20:43 on Sept. 26 in Berlin and running
half-marathons the following two Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   If any man is favored, it is Kagwe. Danilo Goffi of Italy, a
men's contender, said: ``My favorite is Kagwe. He knows the course
very well.'' Carey Pinkowski, the director of the Chicago Marathon,
also picked Kagwe because ``he is more experienced and knows when
to surge.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe does not claim victory, but he does not minimize his
chances, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any man here is super,'' he said. ``I'm not
coming here to be super, I'm coming here to win. I do not delete
anybody from the mix, but I do not fear anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly runners to be wary of, if not fear. Joseph
Chebet of Kenya, the runner-up here the last two years and Kagwe's
April conqueror in Boston, is a potential winner. So is Zebedayo
Bayo of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's New York race, Kagwe held off Chebet by 3 seconds
and Bayo by 3 seconds more. Chebet is plainly tired of playing
second fiddle to Kagwe here and does not seem ready to allow Kagwe
to win with superior speed at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get to Central Park,'' Chebet said, ``my plan is to go
faster immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdelkhader Mouaziz of Morocco, who won the London Marathon in
April, is certainly fresh because he runs only two marathons a year
and maybe one shorter road race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to preserve my body,'' he said, ``because I think
too many road races are going to kill athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Four and a half years after his last marathon victory, Cosmas
Ndeti of Kenya, a three-time winner in Boston, said he was a
contender again. He added, ``I am very hungry. I can make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvio Guerra of Ecuador, second in Boston this year, said he
was ready to win ``a fast and very competitive race'' here. The
5-foot-5-inch Elijah Lagat of Kenya, who six years ago trimmed his
weight of 160 pounds to 120 in six months when he started to have a
heart problem, is one of the race's six sub-2:08 marathoners.
</P>
<P>
   The men's elite field is stronger than the women's, if only
because of the almost endless procession of Kenyans. Of the 33
elite men, 14 are from Kenya. Loroupe aside, of the 13 elite women
here, only two are Kenyans, and only one Kenyan, Catherine Ndereba,
is a potential winner. Although she has twice been named the
American road racer of the year, she did not make her marathon
debut until Boston this year (she finished sixth).
</P>
<P>
   Since August, Fiacconi, the women's defender, has been limited
by a broken right elbow that led to tendinitis. She said she still
thought she could win, running as usual from the front, but she did
not sound convincing.
</P>
<P>
   She named three other contenders _ Ndereba, Adriana Fernandez of
Mexico and 38-year-old Katrin Dorre-Heinig of Germany. Fernandez,
who trains at a 12,000-foot altitude in Mexico, has speed, too,
winning the 5,000-meter titles in the last two Pan American games.
Coming from a nation that has turned out many outstanding male
marathoners but few women, she says proudly, ``I have been an
example to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorre-Heinig, a product of the old East German sports schools,
has been running marathons since 1982 and by her count has won 23
of 42. Like Lagat, the Kenyan man who lost so much weight so
quickly, she has a method, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a race,'' she said, ``I eat everything for two weeks.
Then I weigh 5 or 6 or 7 kilos'' _ 11 to 15{ pounds _ ``more. When
I begin to train again, there is not so much time to eat and I lose
that weight.''
</P>
<P>
   The men will have five designated rabbits, or pacesetters, who
will try to run the first half of the race in 1 hour 3 minutes or
1:04 and maintain that pace until they reach 15 or 16 miles. The
women will have no rabbits because they will run the first eight
miles on separate roads from the men and there are no women, aside
from the contenders, fast enough to be rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   With a good pace from the rabbits, Giacomo Leone of Italy, the
surprise winner here in 1996, envisioned how he race would unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 28 kilometers'' _ 17 miles _ ``I think the real race
will begin,'' he said. ``In New York, it is important to run fast
at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the rabbits is German Silva, the popular Mexican who won
here in 1994 and 1995. He could not run from March to July because
of a deep plantar wart on his left foot that required surgery. This
is his first race back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year,'' he said, ``I want to run this race seriously.
``For now, the idea is to get back my feeling for the race and help
out. And please don't call me a rabbit. A better word would be
helper.''

<P>
   IS McCAIN DOING DOUBLE TAKE AT IOWA?
</P>
<P>
   Given the way his poll numbers keep inching up, is Sen. John
McCain, R-Iowa, having second thoughts and now considering a leap
into the Iowa caucuses? McCain has said for months that he will not
compete in Iowa, having only limited resources and having made few
friends in the state with his opposition to some subsidies that
benefit its corn farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, with polls finding him cutting into the big lead of
Gov. George W. Bush (the senator closed to within 10 points in
surveys released last week in New Hampshire and Vermont), he seems
to have relented a bit.
</P>
<P>
   First he agreed to participate in a candidates' debate to be
held in Iowa shortly before the caucuses, which are set for Jan.
24.
</P>
<P>
   Next he said he would show up later this month to promote his
best-selling book, ``Faith of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, David Yepsen, the dean of Iowa political
analysts, reported in The Des Moines Register that the senator was
nosing around about hiring campaign workers and cozying up to top
Iowa Republicans who previously supported candidates now out of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason for McCain to rethink Iowa, for in the
history of the state's caucuses no presidential candidate has ever
been elected who did not participate in them and finish third or
better.
</P>
<P>
   Further, political analysts in Iowa say McCain has some things
going for him there.
</P>
<P>
   They note that corn is now only one slice of Iowa's diverse
economy. They say that although Bush holds a big lead in pre-caucus
polls, almost 60 percent of probable caucusgoers are supporting
some other candidate or are at loose ends because their first
choice has dropped out. And, they say, McCain will most likely be
an unintended beneficiary of a multimillion-dollar television
advertising blitz that Steve Forbes plans to unleash against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So will the senator, who jumped to third place in an Iowa poll
released last week, jump in? ``We're always taking a look at
everything,'' said one aide, Todd Harris.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harris added, at the moment McCain is taking a look at
jumping into a debate in Iowa next month.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FIRST IN THE HEART OF GOVERNOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not McCain competes in the Iowa caucuses, Gov. Bush
says he's not competing in Louisiana's caucuses. No way.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's caucuses are customarily referred to as ``first in the
nation,'' but Louisiana Republicans jumped in front four years ago
and voted first. And they intend to jump in front again in Election
2000, having recently moved up their caucus date to Jan. 15, fully
nine days ahead of the Iowa vote.
</P>
<P>
   When that happened in 1996, Iowa election officials warned
candidates thinking of heading south that they might be punished by
Hawkeye voters. The threat pretty well squelched the importance of
the Louisiana vote. Still, one leading Republican contender, Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chose to head for Louisiana, only to be
ambushed there by Pat Buchanan and then be humiliated by a
fifth-place finish a few days later in Iowa. Shortly thereafter,
Gramm abandoned the race.
</P>
<P>
   Now Iowa has reissued its threat. On Thursday, Brent Siegrist,
the speaker of the state's Republican-controlled House, warned,
``I've got two words for candidates that are thing about going to
Louisiana: Phil Gramm.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah,
said they would not be cowed by threats. But Bush pledged to pass
on Louisiana and ``honor the tradition of Iowa as first in the
nation,'' as did McCain.
</P>
<P>
   That did it for Louisiana's Republican governor, Mike Foster,
who until then had favored a Jan. 15 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This effort to have the first-in-the-nation caucus is going to
be a disaster,'' Foster declared. ``George W. is not going to
participate, and I've changed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Louisiana party leaders are now talking about setting
another date.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOP TAKES PEN TO PAPER
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have always been in charge of redrawing congressional
districts in Virginia after each census, simply because Republicans
have never been in charge of the Virginia legislature. But the
Republicans finally snatched majority control in the elections on
Tuesday, and now there's a heavy whiff of gerrymandering revenge in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The way state Republican leaders figure it, the 11-member
Virginia congressional delegation will be a 12-member delegation
after the census because of the state's growth. And, they say,
after the Republican-controlled legislature finishes drawing new
lines, the delegation coming out of the 2002 elections will be
dominated 8-4 by Republicans, at a minimum, in contrast to a
delegation now dominated 6-5 by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big deal,'' said David Israelite, political director
of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Because a deal like that could happen in any number of
states in next year's legislative elections, and in the balance
hangs control of the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Virginia redistricting process is already under
way. Rep. Virgil Goode Jr., a conservative Democrat who for months
has been swinging this way and that over whether to jump to the
Republican camp, has now been sent word by Republican leaders that
it is time to leap.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't jump, they say, the lines of his district, the
5th, in the south-central part of the state, will be the first to
be redrawn to a Republican-friendly configuration.
</P>
<P>
   A RACE EVEN TOUGHER THAN IT LOOKED
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the race for governor of Mississippi could hardly
be more in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, and his
Republican challenger, Mike Parker, a former congressman, each got
around 49 percent of the vote on Tuesday, with two minor candidates
taking the remaining 2 percent. So unless a recount or absentee
ballots put somebody over the required 50 percent plus one vote, it
will fall to the Mississippi House of Representatives to declare a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   The result there would seem simple enough: the 122-member House
has a Democratic majority of about 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. In Mississippi, it is sometimes hard to tell a
Democrat from a Republican, which is one reason the Musgrove-Parker
race was so close to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the absentee ballots, or a recount (none demanded
yet)?
</P>
<P>
   It could happen. Musgrove ended up a few thousand votes ahead of
Parker, and, election officials say, there just might be (though
there are probably not) enough uncounted or miscounted ballots to
push him to victory.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   The state has an old law on the books, dating from
Reconstruction, that says that to be elected governor a candidate
must not only win the popular vote but also carry a majority of the
122 state House districts, or 62. Nobody has been able to figure
yet whether either candidate achieved that.
</P>
<P>
   Parker says he's no sore loser and will speedily cave on the
district requirement if Musgrove gets to the 50-percent-plus-one
mark. But barring that development, he says, he plans to hold out
for a House vote, and is already lobbying for support, even though
the vote will not take place, if it takes place, until Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove, for his part, is off on a ``victory'' tour of the
state, referring to himself as ``Governor-elect Musgrove.''
</P>
<P>
   WYOMING GOVERNOR SPEAKS, AND SOME JAWS DROP
</P>
<P>
   The week's prize for bluntness _ some might say insensitivity _
goes to Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming, a conservative Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The other day in Cheyenne, while addressing the annual meeting
of the Wyoming Taxpayers' Association, he said it was time that the
people who benefited the most from state services _ mostly those in
the lower income brackets, in his judgment _ began shouldering a
bigger share of the tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest consumers of service ought to have some skin in
the game,'' he declared. ``They have very little right now. Why not
have some sense of personal responsibility?''
</P>
<P>
   The next day he got an answer, from both sides. One Republican
state senator called the remark ``incredulous,'' while a Democratic
state representative said she was ``appalled.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor is sticking by his speech.

WITH NO SUCCESS PULLING POWER SWITCH, RANGERS MIGHT PUSH PANIC
BUTTON 
</HEADLINE>

 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The New York Rangers' most glaring need coming into
this season was supposed to be a second-line center. But what they
have really needed is a center on the first line to make plays,
someone who can also take charge of a power play. The Rangers'
ineptitude with the man advantage has now reached epic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are now 4-for-66 on the power play this season,
after their embarrassing 4-1 defeat here Friday night to the
Colorado Avalanche. The Avalanche, a .500 team entering the game,
scored three power-play goals to none for the Rangers, who are now
an inconceivable 0-for-their-last-26.
</P>
<P>
   With Wayne Gretzky quarterbacking the power play the last three
seasons, the Rangers never finished lower than fifth in the league
in terms of efficiency. This year, the team is last. Petr Nedved,
who inherited the first-line center role when Gretzky retired, has
no power-play goals and two power-play assists so far this season.
He has scored one goal in his last seven games. His last assist
came Oct. 11; nine games have passed since.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' weakness only starts with Nedved. At 4-8-3 overall,
they are a team in turmoil. They are 0-5-2 in their last seven
games, and their last victory came Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers lose to the Blackhawks in Chicago on Sunday
night, someone's job could be on the line. And the players are not
the only ones who could be involved.
</P>
<P>
   That could be one reason the team president and general manager,
Neil Smith, held a closed-door meeting with Coach John Muckler
after the Rangers' latest fiasco. Smith declined to speak with
reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Muckler had talked about his team and named names.
Again. And the ones he did not name were the most significant.
</P>
<P>
   The coach praised Eric Lacroix, Todd Harvey, Tim Taylor, Kevin
Stevens and Mike York for their performances against the Colorado
Avalanche. To Mike Knuble and Jan Hlavac, Muckler gave mixed
grades.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Muckler praised Sylvain Lefebrve, Mathieu Schneider
and Brian Leetch. He said Kim Johnsson, Stephane Quintal and Kevin
Hatcher all had tough nights.
</P>
<P>
   He reserved conspicuous silence for Nedved and Theo Fleury, John
MacLean and Adam Graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you should figure that out for yourselves,'' Muckler
said, when asked why he had omitted the names of Fleury and Nedved
from the list. ``I just gave you the names of the players who
played well.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the others?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the scoring has to come from,'' Muckler said.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, it hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   With the season 15 games old, MacLean _ a goal scorer his entire
career _ has yet to score a goal. By the end of Friday night's
game, he was back to skating on the Rangers' fourth line. Graves,
who led the Rangers in goals last season with 38, has two goals
thus far. He has not scored a goal in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury scored 40 goals last season, which he split between
Calgary and Colorado. He was the key free agent signing by the
Rangers this off-season, the crown jewel of their underachieving
$58.8 million payroll, by far the highest in National Hockey League
history.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Fleury has been a bust. True, he scored the Rangers'
only goal, Friday night, and he leads the team with five, two more
than any other Ranger. But Fleury all but disappeared in the second
and third periods here after Colorado took command. He has yet to
score a goal on the power play. His goal Friday was his first in
six games.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest disappointment has to be Nedved, who has simply
not produced. The first-line center is supposed to be a play-maker.
Is it any wonder that the Rangers are struggling for goals?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel more pressure than last year,'' Nedved insisted
late Friday night, when asked if replacing the legendary Gretzky
could be one reason why he has struggled so. ``It really depends on
how you deal with that. And that's not the reason why I have not
been playing as well as I wanted to this season. There are things I
wanted to do better. But I don't feel any different on the ice than
I did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but he sure looks different. True, one of his
teammates said that Nedved shined in Gretzky's absence last season,
when Gretzky was injured. That, said the player, was proof that
Nedved could handle a first-line role.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nedved's second tenure with the Rangers has not been much
different than his first, when he was viewed as an underachieving
player. And that has led others in the organization to begin
questioning whether Nedved is truly capable of being a first-line
center in a full-time role.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Nedved, who seems better suited to the second
line, is the best center the Rangers have. York has done an
admirable job for a rookie on the second line, but he is a minus-5
on the year and at times _ like most rookies _ looks overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have inquired into the availability of Edmonton's
Doug Weight, who began his career in New York. But acquiring Weight
would almost certainly cost the Rangers their promising young draft
pick, Jamie Lundmark. And Smith is not sure he wants that.
</P>
<P>
   A trade for Keith Primeau's rights always remains a possibility.
A deal for Aleksei Yashin is more of a long shot. Both Yashin and
Primeau are sitting out in contract disputes. But until the Rangers
make a move, and they may not, the Rangers _ as one member of the
organization said _ have desperately been trying to mold Nedved
into a first-line center.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, it just hasn't worked.

DEMETRIO LAKAS, 74, FORMER PRESIDENT OF PANAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ERIC PACE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Demetrio B. Lakas, president of Panama from 1972 to 1978 during
the government of Brig. Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, died Tuesday in
a hospital in Panama City. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart ailment, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Lakas was an engineer who was popular among businessmen. During
his term, Torrijos, the leader of the National Guard, governed
under a constitution that gave him extraordinary power over the
government and army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lakas was in many respects the man who kept the wheels of
government turning in Panama on a day-to-day basis,'' and ``not the
figurehead executive that some observers assumed,'' a former U.S.
ambassador to Panama, William J. Jorden, wrote in 1984 in a book,
``Panama Odyssey.'' But, he wrote, ``The central authority, the
final decision-making power, belonged to Torrijos.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Lakas had a role in contacts between Panama and
the United States that led to two treaties between the two nations
under which Panama will gain control over the Panama Canal at the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Torrijos named Lakas, a close friend, president of the
provisional government council. Lakas held that post until 1972,
when he was elected president by the 505-member Assembly of
Community Representatives. He was succeeded by Aristides Royo.
</P>
<P>
   When Lakas was president, the government controlled the news
media strictly and opposed dissent. It also had populist spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
   An important moment during his term as provisional president
occurred in 1970, when he had a 50-minute meeting with President
Richard M. Nixon in Washington that set the stage for subsequent
negotiations about the canal. As Jorden wrote in his book, when the
two presidents' talk turned to Panama and the canal, ``Lakas told
Nixon that emotions were heating up among his countrymen.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations had been tried in the mid-1960s, but they produced
treaties that Panama did not accept. Nixon assured Lakas that
something could be done about that.
</P>
<P>
   New talks began in 1971 in Washington, with the Panamanian
ambassador to the United States leading the Panamanian negotiating
team. In 1972, angry over the slow pace of the the talks, the
ambassador said he was quitting and returned to Panama. But Lakas
declined to accept his resignation and told him to resume
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Two draft treaties were signed in September 1977 and were
approved by a referendum in Panama in October 1977 and by the U.S.
House of Representatives in 1977 and then by the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Greek immigrants, Lakas was born in Colon, Panama,
the big Caribbean port, and went on to study at Texas Wesleyan
College in Fort Worth and Texas Technical College in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Elizabeth; two sons, and a daughter.

 &HT;    King &AMP; Spalding elder works half time? That's half true
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Griffin Bell says he only works ``half time,''
his King &AMP; Spalding colleagues snicker and shake their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who turned 81 on Halloween, continues to maintain a
rigorous schedule. Just recently, he took on Puerto Rico as a
client. The commonwealth, Bell said, may sue the U.S. Navy for
practice bombing on the island of Vieques. A security guard was
killed during a bombing accident in April.
</P>
<P>
   Bell just finished representing a nursing home chain in
California that was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He recently held a news conference with Billy Payne to discuss
the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games' bid. Bell painted a
picture of an Olympic process that exploits potential host cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Bell,'' as he is called at the firm, is King &AMP;
Spalding's most prominent partner and a rainmaker of the first
order. Witty, charming, politically savvy, Bell has counseled
presidents and has been a lawyer of last resort for some of the
nation's largest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Americus, Ga., Bell graduated from Mercer University law
school in Macon in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   After building a busy and prosperous law practice in Rome, Bell
received a visit from Atlanta lawyer Hughes Spalding Jr. He asked
Bell to join the law firm now known as King &AMP; Spalding.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said he was not interested. But members of the firm
continued to press him, and he finally agreed to come down to
Atlanta to talk some more.
</P>
<P>
   Bell decided that if he was going to leave a ``sure thing,''
meaning his thriving practice in Rome, he wanted to make sure his
new employer was prosperous as well. So he asked Spalding if he
could see the law firm's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were shocked,'' Bell recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied with what he saw, Bell joined the firm in 1953. He
became managing partner five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Bell to serve as a judge on
the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one step below the U.S.
Supreme Court. He served 15 years until 1976 and returned to King &AMP;
Spalding.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, another president called. This time, Jimmy Carter
named Bell U.S. attorney general. When Bell returned to King &AMP;
Spalding in 1979, he told reporters he looked forward to becoming
``a heavy taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my home,'' Bell said of the firm. ``I always have a
place to go back to.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm is certainly glad he has always returned. As a senior
partner, Bell not only has lent King &AMP; Spalding his prestige, he
also has brought in a lot of business. He established the ``Special
Matters/Government Investigations'' practice, which counsels
clients involved in white-collar criminal matters and whistleblower
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   He also has conducted highly publicized internal corporate
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Bell was called in by E.F. Hutton after its guilty plea
for check-kiting. After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spell in Prince
William Sound, Exxon hired Bell to conduct an internal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy practicing law,'' he said. ``All I ever wanted to be
was a lawyer. And I still am. I enjoy solving problems, complex
problems, complex litigation, particularly.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview, Bell appeared a bit edgy, noting that
his wife, Mary, was hospitalized. She returned home last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said one of his most pressing chores these days is to
finish autographing hundreds of copies of ``Uncommon Sense: The
Achievement of Griffin Bell.'' The biography, written by former
Atlanta Constitution editor Reg Murphy, will be in bookstores this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer, Bell's alma mater, bought hundreds of copies for him to
give away at an upcoming book-signing.
</P>
<P>
   Bell often relaxes at the family's four-bedroom home in Sea
Island, where he engages in his other passion: golf. While on the
island, he said, he plays every day. In Atlanta, he plays about
twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any regular schedule here,'' he said of his work
at the firm. ``If somebody wants me to work on something I can
handle, I'll do it. ... I do the work as it comes along. It works
out well.''

 &HT;    Law firm an amalgam of pay, perks and power
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like most major law firms, King &AMP; Spalding is an
unincorporated business operated for the benefit of its partners,
the senior lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The partners divide the firm's profits every month according to
a complicated formula that factors in each partner's value to the
firm. A peer review process sets that value every three years.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's highest-paid partner earns 3.6 times more than its
lowest-paid partner, said managing partner Ralph Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Although many firms have wider pay ranges, Levy added, King &AMP;
Spalding prides itself on generously compensating its junior
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the entire history of the law firm, there has been a
philosophy of the junior-most partners participating significantly
in the firm,'' Levy said. King &AMP; Spalding pays first-year lawyers
about $85,000 a year, according to the Fulton County Daily Report.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, clients pay major law firms based on ``billable
hours'' of work. In Atlanta, that fee can range from about $110 an
hour for a junior associate to $400 an hour for some senior
partners.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the firm's work involves representing corporations
in civil or regulatory matters or defending them in criminal
matters. In recent years, it has developed teams of lawyers with
expertise in areas such as food and drugs, intellectual property,
toxic waste and international trade regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes King &AMP; Spalding takes on ``pro bono'' work for no fee,
as is customary for major law firms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, after Chief Justice Robert Benham of the Georgia
Supreme Court notified major Atlanta firms that many defendants on
death row needed lawyers, King &AMP; Spalding took on two, pro bono.
</P>
<P>
   King &AMP; Spalding is administered by a managing partner, who is an
ex-officio member of a policy committee.
</P>
<P>
   Levy has served in that capacity since 1993. He plans to step
down at the end of the year and resume his work as a King &AMP;
Spalding trial lawyer specializing in tax and business litigation.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be succeeded by Walter W. Driver Jr., chairman of the
policy committee.

 -cox &HT;    NEWS ANALYSIS: MICROSOFT'S ROAD AHEAD?
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Now that a federal judge has branded the world's
wealthiest company as a predatory monopolist bent on destroying its
competition, where does the Microsoft antitrust case go from here?
</P>
<P>
   One path leads to a presumed guilty verdict, coupled with stiff
sanctions against the software giant. They could range all the way
from curbs on how the company does business to breaking up a firm
with a current
</P>
<P>
   market capitalization of $471 billion. Such sanctions would
alter the hi-tech landscape and could roil the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Microsoft's lawyers would file appeals at each stage
of the legal process, thereby delaying a final resolution of the
case for many years. And, well down the road, the U.S. Supreme
Court might be called upon to make a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But given the nature of the appellate process, Microsoft stands
a poor chance of overturning any of the ``findings of fact''
brought out by the trial. This is one reason why the company may
pursue another path that leads to an out-of-court settlement with
the Justice Department, as well as the 19 state attorneys general
who have joined in the sweeping antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   Any such secret negotiations would have to be approved by U.S.
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who presided over the
76-day landmark trial. But Jackson, who all along has privately
urged the parties to settle, is likely to approve.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Jackson's ruling, whether to fight or settle
looms larger in the minds of the key players than the formal
schedule to which they must adhere.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has called on the government to file a brief on Dec. 6
stating how the antitrust laws apply to his findings. Microsoft is
due to file its responding brief on Jan. 17. The government will
then file its response on Jan. 24, with Microsoft's final response
due Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Microsoft changes its strategy rests largely in the
hands of Bill Gates, who co-founded Microsoft as a 12-person shop,
only to emerge a quarter of a century later as the wealthiest
individual on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Gates is known to have called the shots for
the company's Wall Street-based elite legal team. He has
orchestrated a hard-nosed counter-attack against the government's
charges, both on Capitol
</P>
<P>
   Hill and before the media.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Gates' public posture, the judge's harsh findings must
have rattled the Microsoft chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The government had accused Microsoft of illegally maintaining
its dominance over the personal computing universe through its
Windows operating system, seeking to unfairly monopolize the market
for
</P>
<P>
   Internet browsers, bolting its Internet Explorer browser to
Windows to jack up customer usage and striking sweetheart deals
with computer makers and Internet service providers to shaft its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, prior to ruling on whether Microsoft has actually
broken the antitrust laws, Jackson issued his 207-page ``findings
of fact'' which validated these claims in their entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the judge found, has ``engaged in a concerted series
of actions'' aimed at protecting ``its monopoly power'' by seeking
to exclude rival technologies across the industry spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Gates returned to the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash., from a
``think week'' retreat to cope Friday at a press conference with
the unexpected judicial chewing out. What emerged were ambivalent
signals over
</P>
<P>
   the road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Gates noted that ``from the very beginning,
Microsoft just wanted nothing more than to resolve this case''
through a negotiated settlement. On the other, he said ``we believe
the American legal
</P>
<P>
   system ultimately will affirm that Microsoft's actions and
innovations were fair and legal and have brought tremendous
benefits to millions of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who will go to Las Vegas next week to keynote the annual
Comdex computer show, must decide whether to roll the dice and take
his chances with an appeal. One key consideration: the political
clock.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans should capture the White House next November,
at a time when appeals are still pending, the next president and
his attorney general could prove less eager to pursue Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Reagan administration decided to drop the matter in
1981, a prior antitrust case against IBM consumed 700 trial days,
spread over 12 years. The lawyer who defended IBM in that case,
David Boies, is aware of the risks posed by the clock; he serves as
the government's lead lawyer against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But as junior partners in the case, the states may urge the
Justice Department to hang tough.
</P>
<P>
   Said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal: ``One
benefit to consumers of pursuing this case to a final judgment is
that these findings then have a legal affect that they wouldn't
otherwise. They can then be used in other cases by consumers to
pursue remedies on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers, including legal experts, remained divided on whether
Jackson's sweeping findings against Microsoft hurt the prospects
for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a dozen TV cameras lined up in the twilight before the
courthouse, Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., one of Microsoft's
staunchest defenders, said: ``This makes a settlement very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape
Communications Corp., now absorbed into America Online Inc., said
the real prospect of a ruling that busts up the company could prod
Microsoft into an
</P>
<P>
   accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really taken them out to the woodshed,'' said Barksdale,
who served as a key government witness.
</P>
<P>
   While Barksdale is not alone in believing that Jackson's tough
stance could shock Microsoft into making a deal, that decision
belongs to Bill Gates.

LOBSTERMEN ALLOWED TO RETRIEVE GEAR FROM CRASH ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The National Transportation Safety Board settled
a potential dispute on Friday with an organization of New England
lobster fishermen whose members have been barred from retrieving
their gear since last Sunday, when EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into
the sea, killing 217 people.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen, who in 1996 were barred from a fishing ground for
more than six months after the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight
800, had feared that they could be prohibited from reaching the
gear indefinitely, causing them to lose income in the winter
lobster season.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the EgyptAir Boeing 767 fell from radar, the Coast
Guard began excluding vessels from a box-shaped zone of 39 miles by
30 miles around the area where investigators believed the plane's
wreckage had settled on the ocean floor. The zone _ in an area
where most cod, scallop and flounder fishing is prohibited _
affected few fishermen. But it did restrict a group of specialized
deep-water lobster fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Spinazzola, executive director of the Atlantic Offshore
Lobstermen's Association, met with investigators for most of
Friday. She said the safety board and the Coast Guard had told her
that the lobstermen could venture into the zone and retrieve their
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out real well,'' she said. ``We are happy to be
working hand in hand with these agencies. People will obviously
take their gear and get out of the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Few lobster boats venture as far as the crash site, an area
about 50 miles south of Nantucket that requires crews to work on
multiple-day trips and contend with sometimes towering seas. But
some larger vessels, generally in the 65-to-85-foot class, fish
throughout the crash site, and even all the way to steep undersea
canyons where the bottom falls away into the depths of the
continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spinazzola and Brian Fielding, captain of the 65-foot vessel
Corey-T, said fewer than 10 to 15 vessels worked the area, but only
about five had gear near the crash site. None of the gear was at
the crash site itself, Ms. Spinazzola said.
</P>
<P>
   The offshore lobstermen drop heavy clusters of weighted wire
pots, called trawls, onto the sea floor, and mark them with lines
and buoys. Each pot contains bait, typically fish carcasses, which
lure lobsters and crabs through a series of openings in the wire.
Ultimately the lobsters and crabs reach the bait and are trapped in
a large compartment, where they are held alive until fishermen
return and take them to market.
</P>
<P>
   If the pots are left too long, the gear ceases to catch
lobsters. Richard Mudd, the captain of the 65-foot Kismet, which
sails from Portsmouth, R.I., said that some of his gear was in the
closed zone and that he was eager to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overdue,'' he said.

FANS SHOULD HOLD OFF JUDGING NEW RULES; A CONTROVERSIAL START;
STARKS IS POUTING; NETS IN EARLY FUNK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jeff Van Gundy was nearly fined by the NBA for
saying, among other things, ``Unfortunately in the NBA now, we're
making up rules to hide deficiencies of players.'' The assessment
did not go over well with the people entrusted with putting more
panache in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the jury is still out on whether rule changes
instituted this season have heightened the league's quality of
play. Predictably, Grant Hill, a graceful and athletic player,
likes them. Alonzo Mourning, low on skill and big on muscle, does
not.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Thorn is preaching patience. The league's senior vice
president of operations toured the Western Conference last week to
see whether the holding, pushing and physical play of the past had
been affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, we're pleased with the new rules,'' Thorn
said from Seattle by telephone. ``It's going to take a while for
some teams to adjust, but overall we're hoping to get a few more
possessions per team per game. We're not just looking for higher
scores. We're looking for ball movement, body movement and no more
chucking and grabbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 26 games of last week, teams were averaging a
combined 51.1 fouls a game _ six fouls a game more than last year.
A regulation game averaged 2 hours 12 minutes last season. So far
this season, games are averaging five minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   But shots are increasing. Teams are averaging four more field
goal attempts a game than last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is going to adapt, and I think it's going to make
the game better,'' Hill said. ``There won't be as much physical
play, which is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   No game provided the contrast better than the season opener
between Miami and Detroit. The result was encouraging, a 128-122
double-overtime Heat victory with 41 points from Grant Hill and 32
from Tim Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   But the box score showed there was much to be desired: 91 free
throws, 81 fouls and six disqualifications. The 3-hour-21-minute
game was the longest in the Heat's 12-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the league wants every incidental contact
called,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. ``We're going to edit this
film and take every foul we think is questionable and try to get a
clarification on it, because I didn't think the game was physical
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning said: ``I prefer the old game by far. It's the game I'm
accustomed to, and the game our defensive system is accustomed to.
But unfortunately we won't be going back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the numbers, the flow and the pace hasn't been
consistent. One reason has to do with a rule change made last year
that includes an extra timeout in the second and fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes our game from a free-flowing thing to these fits
and starts every three minutes,'' said Lakers coach Phil Jackson,
who returned to the NBA after a one-season hiatus to find a
monotonous pace. ``There's no flow to the game. Someone didn't
consult with me when they started making these changes.''
</P>
<P>
   A CONTROVERSIAL START
</P>
<P>
   If the league was trying to keep positive marijuana tests
hush-hush, Rodney Buford did not help the cause. The Heat rookie
was sent home from Toronto last week after a small amount of
marijuana was found during a customs check at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The police described the amount found as ``very, very, very
small,'' and did not charge Buford. But Riley quickly sent him home
and planned to discipline him. The incident took place several days
after players who tested positive for the drug were ordered into a
league-administered treatment program.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many people tested positive during training
camp or whether Buford was among them. This is clear: The new drug
program is off to a controversial start.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches were outraged to find out at the league meetings in
late September that they, too, would have to submit a urine sample
during training camp. The league and the union agreed to include
coaches and on-floor personnel _ assistants and trainers _ in the
testing during collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   No one was more peeved than Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are as an individual is so private and personal, that
has so much do with it,'' said the Los Angeles Lakers' coach.
``That other people should be able to know _ free of access,
without your own volition _ what you've taken into your body, what
you've eaten, or what you've drunk or what you've had _ is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of your makeup. It seems to me to be a giveaway of
your own personal rights and freedoms. I think the framers of our
Constitution would stand right behind me in all these things
because this is another form of making us toe the line or get
behind the line.''
</P>
<P>
   STARKS IS POUTING
</P>
<P>
   Before the Knicks acquired Latrell Sprewell, Jeff Van Gundy once
drew affectionate comparisons between Sprewell's frenetic ways and
John Starks' playing style. Unfortunately for P.J. Carlesimo, the
Golden State Warriors' coach is also starting to see the
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo and Starks exchanged heated words after Starks was
essentially benched for throwing a pass away in the first half of
the Warriors' loss to San Antonio on Thursday night _ a loss that
put the Warriors at 0-2 to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a major blow-up, but it was a disturbing reminder of
what happens when a hot-headed player and an equally hot-headed
coach collide. Starks did not join the team for warm-ups on the
floor to begin the second half, begrudgingly returning to the bench
moments before the third quarter began. In a foul pout, he wore a
towel over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the passion of the moment, Starks is upset that he has
yet to start a game for the Warriors this season. He has been
nursing a sore right knee and not participating in full-contact
drills during practice. Carlesimo's hard-and-fast rule: You don't
practice, you don't start.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sprewell's return to Golden State on Nov. 20 _ his first
appearance as a Knick in Oakland since the choking incident in
December 1997 _ the Warriors have Dallas, Vancouver and Chicago on
their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how Golden State responds, those games can be
confidence builders or early signs of trouble for the coach and the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   NETS IN EARLY FUNK
</P>
<P>
   The season is less than a week old, and the Nets are already in
danger of falling into the abyss. They looked horrible against
Toronto on Friday night, going to 0-3 with a 112-92 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries are part of the problem; Jayson Williams is not
expected until January, and Kerry Kittles is out, too. But those
are just the obvious problems.
</P>
<P>
   Other pressing concerns:
</P>
<P>
   _ Aside from Keith Van Horn, Stephon Marbury does not trust his
teammates. You can see it each time he decides to penetrate instead
of dumping it inside to someone posting up. He needs to be more
patient and let the lesser lights make some mistakes before giving
up on them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach Don Casey's stand-up routine only works when they win.
Casey's approach _ ``It's a players' league and everyone knows it''
_ is refreshing and honest. But someone on the Nets' staff _ Jim
Lynam may be the best candidate _ needs to start playing the bad
cop in practice and mentally and physically pushing this seemingly
soft bunch of players. The Nets, a likable bunch of characters,
need someone on edge to give them a lift.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, that the Nets play no defense is no revelation, but
poor one-on-one defending teams can compensate for their flaws by
helping each other out. The Nets rotate less routinely than the
Aztec sun dial. Charles Oakley even led a fast break against them
the other night.

LABOR TILTING TOWARD MRS. CLINTON IN RACE AGAINST GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor unions overwhelmingly backed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
re-election in 1997, but now they are not only tilting strongly
toward his likely Senate opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, but also
hoping to use the Senate race to squeeze more out of the mayor in
contract talks next year.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said this labor backing could hurt the mayor
and help the first lady in several traditional ways _ through union
phone banks and get-out-the-vote efforts _ and in one unorthodox
way. Warning that city workers are fuming about the modest wage
increases in their current contract, several union leaders said
labor tensions and protests were likely if Giuliani failed to be
generous in contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to run a campaign when you have a lot of labor
unrest in your own backyard,'' said Lee Saunders, director of
District Council 37, the giant municipal employees' union,
representing 125,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Randy Levine, the mayor's chief labor negotiator,
vowed that Giuliani would be as tough as ever in the contract
talks, which cover nearly 300,000 workers, including teachers,
firefighters, police officers and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing they can do that would make life difficult for
him,'' Levine said. ``Many of these unions need to get their own
houses in order and start to represent their members' interests,
rather than worry about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Several labor experts said Giuliani faced a daunting challenge
balancing a Senate run with contract negotiations. He might be
tempted to impress conservatives by being tough on labor, these
experts said, though doing so would only erode his union support in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Several powerful unions that backed the mayor in 1997 are now
leaning toward the first lady, among them the transit workers'
union, a 50,000-member janitors' union and, most important of all,
District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, after staying on the sidelines in the mayoral race,
the city's two most politically potent unions _ 1199, a health-care
union with 150,000 members, and the United Federation of Teachers,
with 90,000 _ are making plans to endorse and campaign hard for
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With 2.3 million union members in the state, labor is often
considered New York's most potent political force. Its political
clout is smaller in statewide races, however, because union
membership is not nearly as concentrated upstate and in the suburbs
as in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts say that with polls showing the mayor and
the first lady neck and neck, labor's ability to get voters to the
polls could push Mrs. Clinton over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union endorsement and union engagement can make a significant
difference, particularly if it's a tight race,'' said Ester Fuchs,
director of the Center on Urban Research and Policy at Columbia
University. ``The candidate that can get out their base is going to
win this race, and if unions turn out Democratic voters who haven't
been turning out, then the race goes to Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Because neither Giuliani nor Mrs. Clinton has officially
declared as a candidate, no union has made a formal endorsement.
But several unions, most notably the Civil Service Employees
Association, the state's largest public employee union, with
265,000 members, have indicated they will back Mrs. Clinton as soon
as she announces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, unions backed the mayor's re-election for various
reasons, among them that they were pleased that the city had
rebounded during his tenure, they were afraid of retribution if
they opposed him, and his Democratic opponent, Ruth Messinger, had
scant chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   But union leaders say the considerations that go into a Senate
endorsement are different. Several labor leaders said Giuliani's
forceful personality worked well in City Hall, but would probably
flop in the Senate. These labor leaders also noted that senators,
unlike mayors, focus on national issues like health care, education
and the minimum wage, where Mrs. Clinton's views often parallel
labor's.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several municipal union leaders said their members
were fuming at Giuliani and unlikely to endorse him because their
salaries have languished while the city's economy has soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still tremendous anger in the city work force about
the pay freeze in the first two years of our contract, particularly
in light of the booming economy,'' said Randi Weingarten, president
of the teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters for Giuliani, the city's contract
negotiations are expected to begin early next year and could reach
fever pitch during the Senate campaign.

 &HT;    News analysis: Where does the Microsoft's road ahead lead?

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that a federal judge has branded the world's
wealthiest company as a predatory monopolist bent on destroying its
competition, where does the Microsoft antitrust case go from here?
</P>
<P>
   One path leads to a presumed guilty verdict, coupled with stiff

from curbs on how the company does business to breaking up a firm
with a current

   To be sure, Microsoft's lawyers would file appeals at each stage
of the legal process, thereby delaying a final resolution of the
case for many years. And, well down the road, the U.S. Supreme
Court might be called upon to make a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But given the nature of the appellate process, Microsoft stands
a poor chance of overturning any of the ``findings of fact''
brought out by the trial. This is one reason why the company may
pursue another path that leads to an out-of-court settlement with
the Justice Department, as well as the 19 state attorneys general
who have joined in the sweeping antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   Any such secret negotiations would have to be approved by U.S.
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who presided over the
76-day landmark trial. But Jackson, who all along has privately
urged the parties to settle, is likely to approve.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Jackson's ruling, whether to fight or settle
looms larger in the minds of the key players than the formal
schedule to which they must adhere.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has called on the government to file a brief on Dec. 6
stating how the antitrust laws apply to his findings. Microsoft is
due to file its responding brief on Jan. 17. The government will
then file its response on Jan. 24, with Microsoft's final response
due Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Microsoft changes its strategy rests largely in the
hands of Bill Gates, who co-founded Microsoft as a 12-person shop,
only to emerge a quarter of a century later as the wealthiest
individual on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Gates is known to have called the shots for
the company's Wall Street-based elite legal team. He has
orchestrated a hard-nosed counter-attack against the government's
charges, both on Capitol
</P>
<P>
   Hill and before the media.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Gates' public posture, the judge's harsh findings must
have rattled the Microsoft chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The government had accused Microsoft of illegally maintaining
its dominance over the personal computing universe through its
Windows operating system; seeking to unfairly monopolize the market
for
</P>
<P>
   Internet browsers; bolting its Internet Explorer browser to
Windows to jack up customer usage; and striking sweetheart deals
with computer makers and Internet service providers to shaft its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, prior to ruling on whether Microsoft has actually
broken the antitrust laws, Jackson issued his 207-page ``findings
of fact'' that validated these claims in their entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the judge found, has ``engaged in a concerted series
of actions'' aimed at protecting ``its monopoly power'' by seeking
to exclude rival technologies across the industry spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Gates returned to the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash., from a
``think week'' retreat to cope Friday at a news conference with the
unexpected judicial chewing out. What emerged were ambivalent
signals over
</P>
<P>
   the road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Gates noted that ``from the very beginning,
Microsoft just wanted nothing more than to resolve this case''
through a negotiated settlement. On the other, he said ``we believe
the American legal
</P>
<P>
   system ultimately will affirm that Microsoft's actions and
innovations were fair and legal and have brought tremendous
benefits to millions of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who will go to Las Vegas next week to keynote the annual
Comdex computer show, must decide whether to roll the dice and take
his chances with an appeal. One key consideration: the political
clock.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans should capture the White House next November, at
a time when appeals are still pending, the next president and his
attorney general could prove less eager to pursue Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Reagan administration decided to drop the matter in
1981, a prior antitrust case against IBM consumed 700 trial days,
spread over 12 years. The lawyer who defended IBM in that case,
David Boies, is aware of the risks posed by the clock; he serves as
the government's lead lawyer against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But as junior partners in the case, the states may urge the
Justice Department to hang tough.
</P>
<P>
   Said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal: ``One
benefit to consumers of pursuing this case to a final judgment is
that these findings then have a legal affect that they wouldn't
otherwise. They can then be used in other cases by consumers to
pursue remedies on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers, including legal experts, remained divided on whether
Jackson's sweeping findings against Microsoft hurt the prospects
for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a dozen TV cameras lined up in the twilight before the
courthouse, Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.), one of Microsoft's
staunchest defenders, said: ``This makes a settlement very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Barksdale, former chief executive of Netscape
Communications Corp., which is now absorbed into America Online
Inc., said the real prospect of a ruling that busts up the company
could prod Microsoft into an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really taken them out to the woodshed,'' said Barksdale,
who served as a key government witness.
</P>
<P>
   While Barksdale is not alone in believing that Jackson's tough
stance could shock Microsoft into making a deal, that decision
belongs to Bill Gates.

SILVERBULLETDAY, CHILUKKI LOSE IN 1ST RACES AT BREEDERS' CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: An update with complete race results is scheduled to be filed
by 6:30 p.m. ET.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The 16th Breeders' Cup got off to a smashing
start at Gulfstream Park on Saturday when Beautiful Pleasure outran
Banshee Breeze in a wire-to-wire performance that won the $2
million Distaff and left the prize filly Silverbulletday deep
behind in sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, another rousing performance by the 32-1 long
shot Cash Run upset Chilukki, the most promising 2-year-old filly
in the country, and caused her first defeat after six straight
successes. So, in the first two races of the day, the two leading
fillies from Bob Baffert's barn both lost on the threshold of
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   The fillies opened racing's most lavish day of championships
with $13 million in purses before a crowd of 45,000 spectators, and
they opened it with speed and a take-no-prisoners mood. And
Beautiful Pleasure raced straight to the head of the filly division
by winning her third straight race and her second straight victory
over the reigning filly in racing, Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   They had met last month on a sloppy track in the Beldame at
Belmont Park, and Beautiful Pleasure won by nearly five lengths.
The time before, in the Personal Ensign Handicap at Belmont in
August, she beat Banshee Breeze by more than two lengths. When the
three fillies ran on the same track Saturday, Beautiful Pleasure
simply ran away from everybody.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, she had three-quarters of a length on Banshee
Breeze, who led Heritage of Gold by a length and a quarter, with
Keeper Hill fourth. The winner ran the mile and one-eighth in 1:47
2/5 as the third favorite behind Silverbulletday and Banshee
Breeze, but she was second to no one as they crossed.
</P>
<P>
   She also provided her jockey, Jorge Chavez, with his first visit
to the Breeders' Cup victory circle after 19 losing races. Chavez
has been a leading jockey in New York for several years, but he
took a giant step by winning a Breeders' Cup race Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to do anything,'' Chavez said. ``I had the best
filly out there. Beautiful Pleasure was a beautiful pleasure to
ride today.''
</P>
<P>
   The filly is trained by John Ward and his wife, Donna, for John
Oxley, who said: ``A beautiful filly. But it all gets back to
management. The fractions were incredibly fast, but she is at her
peak.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who went into the Breeders' Cup with eight horses in
six races, said later that his jockey, Jerry Bailey, reported that
Silverbulletday was ``just flat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he pushed and she came up empty,'' Baffert said, ``he
didn't ask her again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said that ``she had great position all the day, but it
was pretty evident three-quarters of the way through the race that
she wasn't going anywhere.'' And, he added, ``She was flat at the
crucial point that I had to make a move.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Juvenile Fillies, outright speed also was flaunted and
was dominant. Chilukki stalked the leaders as she raced for her
seventh straight, but in the homestretch she overtook all but one:
Cash Run, owned by the Padua Stable and trained by D. Wayne Lukas,
who won his 14th Breeders' Cup race. Lukas also took third place
with Surfside, who ranked as a brighter star in his barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the paddock,'' Lukas related, ``I told Jerry Bailey to take
what comes. There's a lot of speed in this race. If she wants to
stay back, don't force her.''
</P>
<P>
   Cash Run won for the third time in five starts as she ran the
mile and one-sixteenth in 1:43 1/5 and paid a stunning $67 for a $2
bet.
</P>
<P>
   In the third race, the Breeders' Cup Mile, the French-bred Silic
finally became the first horse to come off the pace to win, with
the jockey Corey Nakatani driving him through the stretch to track
down Tuzla. Docksider, ridden by Gary Stevens, finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani's victory was his fifth in Breeders' Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first two races, which were contested on the main
track, this was raced on the turf.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old Silic had won twice in six previous starts this
year, including in his most recent race, the Oak Tree Breeders' Cup
Mile on Oct. 16. The colt out of Sillery also won the Shoemaker
Breeders' Cup Mile Stakes at Hollywood Park earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth race of the day, the Breeders' Cup spring, Artax
finished first with Kona Gold second and Big Jag third.

 &HT;    Law firm builds beyond Atlanta roots
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the hierarchy of Atlanta's silk-stocking law firms,
King &AMP; Spalding's regal name suits its status.
</P>
<P>
   The 114-year-old law firm employs 563 high-achieving lawyers who
brought in nearly a quarter of a billion dollars last year from a
client roster loaded with Fortune 500 corporations. Its political
connections stretch from Peachtree Street to Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's lawyers have counseled two former U.S. presidents and
a sitting U.S. Supreme Court justice. Among the names on the firm's
star-studded directory: Griffin Bell, President Carter's attorney
general; former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn; and former Georgia Gov. George
Busbee.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader counts King &AMP; Spalding among the
nation's elite corporate law firms that possess a ``penumbra of
political power.'' And when it comes to advocating for clients,
Nader said, ``King &AMP; Spalding is one of the more aggressive giant
firms.''
</P>
<P>
   That high profile in the legal community has led to cases with
higher stakes and greater sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, King &AMP; Spalding has been in the middle of two
controversies, both at home and in Washington: a preliminary _ and
incomplete _ report to Congress on Atlanta's bid for the 1996
Summer Olympic Games, and a product liability case in which a
Fulton County judge accused the firm's client, General Motors
Corp., of obstructing justice and defrauding the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Lead lawyers at the firm state that not a single King &AMP; Spalding
lawyer did anything wrong, and emphasize that the firm has an
ethical duty to vigorously represent its clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bothered by the heat,'' said Ralph Levy, the firm's
managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   King &AMP; Spalding lawyers helped prepare a preliminary 13-page
report for Congress in June on behalf of the Georgia Amateur
Athletics Foundation, the group organized to bid for the 1996
Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The report failed to detail all of the inappropriate gifts and
favors that Atlanta lavished on International Olympic Committee
members who were to pick a host city.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned by what they read and convinced they might find even
more, congressional investigators reviewed 38 boxes of GAAF
documents that were the basis for the report. Finding evidence of
additional unreported improprieties, Congressional leaders publicly
criticized the report as inaccurate and incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Bell to correct the record by filing a more
complete report Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Bell emphasized that the June report was only preliminary and
said he is proud of the firm's overall work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it enhanced our reputation,'' he said. ``It's
over with. We got through with it. We made a report. The Congress
said they were well satisfied. It seems to me that's the end of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), a member of the oversight committee
looking into the Atlanta Olympic bid, said the committee is
satisfied with the vastly expanded report. But the panel still
intends to send additional written questions to the Atlanta
organizers, Commerce Committee spokesman Steve Schmidt said. ``I
give credit to Judge Bell for delivering a fuller report,'' Upton
said. As for the Atlanta organizers' first response, he said, ``The
first report was not complete. It was not anywhere complete.''
</P>
<P>
   But King &AMP; Spalding's support for its clients certainly was.
When GAAF co-chairmen Billy Payne and Andrew Young testified before
a testy congressional committee last month on Atlanta's Olympic
bid, seated conspicuously behind them were Bell and Nunn, the
firm's most influential members.
</P>
<P>
   NEOPHYTES OR NOT?
</P>
<P>
   As Atlanta's bid process comes under increased scrutiny, the
firm's role comes under the spotlight, as well, because three King
&AMP; Spalding partners were members of the nine-member bid team.
Another member of the bid team was married to a King &AMP; Spalding
partner.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Bell portrayed the bid team members as novices who
were entering an IOC culture of gift-giving and rule-bending. ``The
Atlanta group were neophytes,'' Bell said. ``They had never been in
a contest like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   But a 1988 memo written by bid team member _ and then-King &AMP;
Spalding partner _ Charles Battle does not reflect naivete. Writing
more than two years before Atlanta won the bid, Battle described an
Olympics insider's tips on how to woo IOC voters. The insider,
Battle told Payne, had said ``each person has his price.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In saying this,'' Battle's memo continued, ``he meant that we
need to find out what is important to each (IOC) member. ... Some
of the members, especially the older ones, are still caught up in
the romanticism and high ideas of the Olympic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle's memo to Payne added: ``Our overall approach to all of
them should be that we are the novices and they are the experts.''
</P>
<P>
   The memos, released by the oversight committee, show that the
King &AMP; Spalding partners were deeply involved in the initial stages
of the bid process.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Atlanta won the bid in Tokyo in 1990, the firm
agreed to represent the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games for
free until the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992. King &AMP; Spalding has
valued that work at $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   That civic gesture had a big payout: The firm was named ACOG's
general counsel and has since collected some $20 million in legal
fees for its work.
</P>
<P>
   FIRM'S CONDUCT QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   A week before Bell submitted his follow-up report to the
congressional committee, King &AMP; Spalding was handed a resounding
defeat in the General Motors case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain instances, GM, by and through its counsel, toyed
with and ignored court orders, ethical constraints and legal
barriers,'' Fulton County State Court Judge Gino Brogdon said in a
stinging order. His ruling, finding GM had committed a fraud on the
courts, required GM to release sensitive documents the company had
claimed were protected as a matter of attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   King &AMP; Spalding, along with the Chicago firm Kirkland &AMP; Ellis,
have been the lead law firms representing GM in the fuel-tank
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bell questioned Brogdon's interpretation of
what was covered by attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge is supposed to be neutral. ... When you get away
from neutral principles, you haven't got much law,'' said Bell.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bell, plaintiffs' lawyers routinely try to force
disclosure of lawyer-client documents that should be kept private.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus lawyer Jim Butler, who represented the plaintiff who
sued GM in the Fulton County case, said privacy claims are too
often abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last resort for a defendant determined to hide
evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who heads the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen,
said Brogdon did not go far enough because he didn't sanction King
&AMP; Spalding by name for ethical lapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large firms are immune to slaps on the wrist,'' said Nader,
who has been closely allied with Butler. ``It doesn't stop them at
all. ... The corporations go to the big guys because of their
penumbra of political power and their ability to fight wars of
attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon would have been in error to criticize King &AMP; Spalding
lawyers by name, Levy, the managing partner, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere fact a law firm appears in a case in which the client
was chastised doesn't mean the lawyer did anything wrong,'' Levy
said. ``I don't think King &AMP; Spalding did a damn thing wrong in
connection with that case.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brogdon's ruling, GM settled the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   It's common for sparks to fly in high-stakes litigation, said
Roy Sobelson, a Georgia State University legal ethics professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any lawyer who fights hard is going to get knocked down and
criticized sometimes,'' he said. ``That's just the price you pay
for playing in the big game. ... It also doesn't mean they did
anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview last week, Levy questioned The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's motives in the timing of this story on his
firm.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the newspaper is litigating with GAAF, contending
that the nonprofit organization's files should be subject to the
Georgia Open Records Act. Levy noted that King &AMP; Spalding is the
firm representing GAAF and that some of GAAF's members are King &AMP;
Spalding partners.
</P>
<P>
   CARTER RAISES FIRM'S STATURE
</P>
<P>
   King &AMP; Spalding entered the national spotlight during the Jimmy
Carter presidency in the late 1970s. Bell was Carter's attorney
general, and two other partners were key presidential advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at a partners-only retreat in the early 1980s, the law
firm decided to become a major player representing companies
nationwide. It already was beginning to saturate its local market;
inevitable conflicts of interest between potential clients were
crimping its prospects for new local business.
</P>
<P>
   The firm stepped up its recruiting effort, sending interviewers
to the nation's top 25 law schools. It lured high-ranking graduates
by paying them top dollar and compensated new partners with
similarly generous financial packages.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting and keeping the best and brightest also meant
obtaining enough major clients to satisfy them. Many of the firm's
lawyers aspired to be at the closing table of major
``bet-your-company deals,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   With so many attorneys yearning to be stretched professionally,
the firm needed access to clients without regard to geographic
boundaries. So it branched out, with satellite offices in
Washington, D.C., New York and Houston, and developed specialties
in subjects such as government affairs, food and drugs, energy,
banking and finance, health care and the environment. The expansion
program also received a huge boost from former Coca-Cola Co.
general counsel Robert Keller, who helped convince major
corporations nationwide that they could get New York-quality
representation from the Atlanta firm.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy appears to have paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1960, the firm had fewer than 20 lawyers. Earlier
this month, twice that many King &AMP; Spalding lawyers helped draft
the largest proposed deal in U.S. history _ Sprint Corp.'s $115
billion merger with MCI WorldCom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   BUILDING INFLUENCE
</P>
<P>
   King &AMP; Spalding also has developed extensive political ties. For
years it has nurtured its relations with presidents, members of
Congress, judges, prosecutors and key bureaucrats, because there
are multiple ways to serve a corporate client.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, partner Larry Thompson represented his friend, Clarence
Thomas, at the highly contentious U.S. Senate confirmation hearing
on Thomas' nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   When George Bush, in the closing days of his presidency, needed
a private attorney to represent him in the Iran-Contra controversy,
he turned to Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm later courted Kenneth Starr before the GOP legal
ace was named independent counsel. Starr narrowed his list to King
&AMP; Spalding and Kirkland &AMP; Ellis before choosing the Chicago law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the firm hired Nunn, the former influential
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the firm has stretched its wings nationwide, it
remains committed to its Atlanta roots. ``Our strength is here,''
Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Busbee was finance chairman for the campaign of Lt.
Gov. Mark Taylor last year. And the firm continues to serve as
counsel on about half the state's general obligation bond issues.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the members of the firm have intensified their
civic involvement locally. Its members joined the boards of
hospitals, the Woodruff Arts Center, the American Cancer Society
and Leadership Atlanta, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is we try to be a good citizen,'' Bell said.

WOODS LURKS NEAR LEADERS AS HE SHOOTS FOR FOUR IN A ROW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOTOGRANDE, Spain _ He did it with typical Tiger Woods flair,
making birdie putts on each of his final two holes. Suddenly, Woods
was just one stroke off the lead. Suddenly, the possibility
increased that Woods might win his fourth consecutive tournament,
something that has not been done on the PGA Tour in 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to become the first tour player to win four consecutive
starts since Ben Hogan in 1953, Woods will begin Sunday's final
round of the American Express Championship tied for third place,
one stroke behind the co-leaders.
</P>
<P>
   By shooting a third-round 70, Woods set the stage for a
memorable final round at Valderrama Golf Club, where he will be
stalking history on a leader board that is one of the year's
strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Angel Jimenez and Chris Perry were tied for first place
at 4 under par (209), followed by five players tied at 210, all of
whom have won at least one of golf's major championships _ Woods,
Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard, Nick Price and Hal Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   Another impressive group loomed at 2 under par _ Jose Maria
Olazabal, Stewart Cink, Scott Hoch, David Toms and Lee Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   And the three players tied at 1 under par _ Jim Furyk, Sergio
Garcia and Tim Herron _ could not be counted out either.
</P>
<P>
   But will anyone stop Woods, who has already won eight times
worldwide this year, and who has won seven of his last 10 starts?
His confidence has never been higher. His game has never been
better.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the impressive names in contention, one name was the
most imposing in the World Golf Championship event that will end
the official 1999 golf season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I end up in the winner's circle tomorrow, I would take a
lot of pride in that,'' said Woods, who would become the first
player in history to earn more than $6 million in a season by
winning Sunday's $1 million first place check. ``There's great
depth in this field, a lot of great players. Any time you can beat
the best, then you obviously feel pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   While Woods will be the favorite on paper, Jimenez of Spain will
be the favorite among the gallery. Jimenez, a member of this year's
European Ryder Cup team, shot a 2-under-par 69 Saturday, navigating
his way smartly through Valderrama's narrow fairways with crisp
drives and iron shots, then putting with confidence. Jimenez was
urged on by a sizable gallery, and he will draw from that support
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jimenez was aware of Woods' track record. No, Jimenez did
not sound intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fear anybody,'' Jimenez said through a translator.
``I'll play my own game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry will be paired with Jimenez in the last group, and it will
be interesting to see how Perry responds. Having not won this year
despite having a consistent season, Perry was eager to capitalize
on this latest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Tiger, I came here to win,'' said Perry, who shot a
72, after starting Saturday tied with Herron for the lead. ``The
last three years I've played very consistent, made a lot of cuts,
and with a little bit of luck, I probably could have won a couple
of times this year. If I play my game and make a few putts, I'll be
there in the end, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind shifted direction Saturday and gusted to 15 mph, as
only nine of the 62 players shot in the 60s. Sutton, Olazabal and
Garcia each shot 69, while Woods and Price shot 70.
</P>
<P>
   How much of a difference did the wind make? On Friday, Woods
played No. 16 with a 2-iron off the tee and an 8-iron to the green.
Saturday, he hit a driver off the tee and a 7-iron to the green.
</P>
<P>
   With birdie opportunities difficult to come by, Woods was at 1
over par for the day when he reached the par-5 No. 17. But after
reaching the green in three shots, he made a 25-foot uphill putt
for birdie, then at No. 18, he made another birdie putt, this one
from 18 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge lift,'' Woods said of his final two putts.
``It's a lot different being one back vs. two or three back on this
kind of golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   So with Woods in the hunt, joined by the other prominent names,
all the contenders looked forward to Sunday. In Woods' eight
victories this year, he has entered the final round with at least a
share of the lead. This time, he hoped to come from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that's even-par can win,'' Woods said. ``Tomorrow is
going to be a very interesting day.''

 &HT;    As the mighty fall, the mediocre rise
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Super Bowl XXXIV still will be played in the Georgia
Dome on Jan. 30, but the participating teams might not be
particularly super.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the final NFL season of the 1900s has been a
monument to mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos, the two-time defending world champions, are
2-6. So are the Atlanta Falcons, the defending NFC champions. The
Minnesota Vikings and New York Jets, who lost in their respective
conference title games last season, are a combined 5-10.
Traditional powers Dallas, Green Bay and San Francisco also are
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the St. Louis Rams, who haven't been to the playoffs
since 1989, when the team was still in Los Angeles, has the NFC's
best record at 6-1. Detroit and Washington, which both finished
next-to-last in their divisions a year ago, are in first place this
season. And the Indianapolis Colts, who won only three games in
1998, already have five victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like baseball,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue
said. ``In New York, they're celebrating the Yankees' 25th World
Series title in 75 years. But what about the other cities? When do
they get a chance?''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue might like his league's parity, but its product has
slipped _ a lot. Because of superstar retirements, injuries to
other big-name players and the league's salary-cap rules, pro
football is starting to resemble its two biggest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Like the NBA, several games aren't being decided until the final
two minutes, while the other 58 minutes tend to be rather boring.
And like major league baseball, the game's most important position
has been diluted by expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with the introduction of the 31st team, there's an
obvious scarcity of numbers in terms of talent,'' Jacksonville
coach Tom Coughlin said. ``The talent pool is quite limited.
There's a very, very strong emphasis on somehow, some way keeping
your people healthy and on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great parity, and the example has been shown over and
over,'' Coughlin said. ``Teams that were counted on have not done
as well, and teams that were given absolutely no chance are playing
extremely well. The 31st team has contributed to that, because
there's just nowhere to go for talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The first eight weeks of the 1999 season have been
unpredictable. The current standings resemble last season's final
pecking order, only turned upside down. It's anyone's guess as to
which teams will be playing in the Georgia Dome in January.
</P>
<P>
   Some reasons for the changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Injuries: The NFL is suffering an identity crisis. Three of
the league's biggest stars _ Denver quarterback John Elway, Green
Bay defensive end Reggie White and Detroit running back Barry
Sanders _ retired in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the top four rushers from last season _ Denver's Terrell
Davis, Atlanta's Jamal Anderson, San Francisco's Garrison Hearst
and Sanders _ aren't playing. Anderson was lost to a knee injury in
Week 2, and Davis, a two-time league MVP, suffered the same fate
two weeks later. Hearst might never return from an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to this year, we could get beat by anybody or we could
beat anybody,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. ``I don't think
that's changed. You can become very mediocre quickly if you get hit
with injuries. I think that's happened to a lot of teams. But
that's not to take away from the teams that are playing well. ...
There's just so little difference now.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks, pro football's most glamorous players, have been
hammered by injuries. The league's 31 teams have started 49
different quarterbacks this season. The New York Jets and Baltimore
Ravens already have started three apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Jets starter Vinny Testaverde, the AFC's leading passer last
season, didn't throw a pass in the first game before rupturing an
Achilles' tendon. Miami's Dan Marino has missed three games in a
row because of a neck injury, and San Francisco's Steve Young might
retire because of concussions. Atlanta's Chris Chandler (hamstring)
has finished only two games, and Arizona's Jake Plummer (broken
finger) might miss a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans turn their television sets on for games that were
supposed to pit two great quarterbacks,'' San Francisco coach Steve
Mariucci said. ``(But) it's not happening, because they're not
available. It's too bad for teams like us. But it's bad for the
league, too. The fans want to see those guys perform.''
</P>
<P>
   _ No-name quarterbacks: The NFL has added three expansion teams
since 1995, and Houston will rejoin the league in 2001. Expansion
already has diluted the league's talent pool, especially at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 31 quarterbacks starting in the NFL, two are former
starters in Canada and five played in Europe. Not included are
three rookies _ Cleveland's Tim Couch, Cincinnati's Akili Smith and
Chicago's Cade McNown _ who have started at some point this season.
St. Louis' Kurt Warner, a former Arena League and NFL Europe star,
was the league's hottest passer during the first eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warner kind of gives you an idea that there are people
available that for one reason or another need maturity or
development,'' Coughlin said. ``But the problem you have is time.
They have a limited opportunity in training camp, just like
everybody else, and you have to make decisions. But when you start
thinking the quarterback pool is depleted, you have a guy like
Warner, who's a great story.''
</P>
<P>
   With increased pressure from owners to win _ teams had 12
head-coaching changes the past two seasons _ the NFL has less
patience for young quarterbacks. Before this year's draft, 16
quarterbacks had been chosen in the first round in the 1990s. Only
three are still starting for the team that selected them _
Indianapolis' Peyton Manning, New England's Drew Bledsoe and
Tennessee's Steve McNair. Seven of those first-rounders no longer
are in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think outside of maybe two or three other jobs in the world,
(playing quarterback in the NFL) is one of the hardest things you
can do,'' Green Bay's Brett Favre said. ``I can't think of too many
jobs that require you to sit back and take hits from defensive
players who are big, fast and strong and still execute pin-point
passing. I look at it this way: Quarterbacking is like playing
golf, except in golf, those guys don't get hit. Imagine the gallery
counting to `three-Mississippi' and then chasing you, and then
you're having to hit a 120-yard wedge shot within two feet of the
hole. That's what quarterbacking is like. It's not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get paid a lot of money to do this job. It's like the old
saying, 'I'd get paid $5million to (fight) Mike Tyson.' You're
crazy. You'd need it to pay your hospital bills. I get paid
$5million to drop back and take a blow from Reggie White. It sounds
easy, but it's not. And there's a lot of scrutiny, a lot of eyes
are watching you on and off the field, so a lot rides on our
shoulders, whether we like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Salary cap: When the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers
won a combined 10 division titles and four Super Bowls in five
years, 1992-96, they did it by stockpiling superstars. Even after
the league introduced the salary cap in 1993, the Cowboys and 49ers
worked their way around it. The teams awarded large signing bonuses
and pro-rated them over the length of a contract to keep the
salary-cap hits lower, even though the players were given all the
money up front. Now that those back-loaded contracts are coming
due, the teams are paying dearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The salary cap) is like a charge card,'' Reeves said. ``If
somebody charges something on a charge card, sooner or later you've
got to pay for it. A lot of these things come due, and all of the
sudden it has a ripple effect on what you can do, as far as depth.
If you look at teams prior to the salary cap, there was an awful
lot of depth. People could handle anything, particularly four or
five teams that had a tremendous amount of depth. That's the thing
you're seeing every team lose now. Teams that are successful this
year will have a difficult time signing those guys next year. It's
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Walsh took over as San Francisco's general manager in
January, he inherited $28million in salary-cap excess. Walsh had to
trade defensive end Roy Barker, quarterback Ty Detmer and Pro Bowl
guard Kevin Gogan. Walsh restructured the contracts of 12 players
and let running back Terry Kirby and cornerback Marquez Pope leave
as free agents. Free safety Merton Hanks also was released in a
cost-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any choice,'' Walsh said. ``You can't go on
forever $28million over the cap.''
</P>
<P>
   With an aging core of superstars and little talent or experience
around them, the 49ers are mired in their first three-game losing
streak since 1980. And the Rams, Titans, Lions and Seahawks keep
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``League-wide, I'm not sure I've ever seen as many surprises _
teams going in with high expectations being where they are now,''
Reeves said, ``but it's a long season. You've got to keep playing
each week, and see what happens over the second half. It's been
disappointing, but there's so little difference between top teams
and bottom teams now that if you're not ready to play every week,
you can get beat.''

NO CLEAR FAVORITE AS 30,000 RUNNERS PREPARE FOR NEW YORK CITY
MARATHON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (UPDATES 4th graf with Loroupe dropping out of race) (rk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of the 30,000 men and women who have entered Sunday's
New York City Marathon, only 8 to 10 men and perhaps five women
have a realistic chance to win. But even those favorites cannot
agree on which of them have the best shots.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon, the largest in the world, has attracted runners
from all 50 states and 110 other nations. About 70 percent of the
runners are men.
</P>
<P>
   The runners will start about 10:50 a.m. on the Staten Island
side of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. They will run 12 miles
through Brooklyn, enter Queens on the Pulaski Bridge, enter
Manhattan over the Queensboro Bridge, run up First Avenue, make a
quick visit to the Bronx, return to Manhattan a mile later, enter
Central Park, stay there except for a short stretch on Central Park
South and then return to the park for the final quarter-mile.
</P>
<P>
   The course, covering the traditional marathon distance of 26
miles 385 yards, will take the male winner about 2 hours 10 minutes
to complete, give or take a couple of minutes, and the leading
woman about 2:26. Recreational runners may finish hours later.
</P>
<P>
   John Kagwe of Kenya, the men's winner the last two years, and
Franca Fiacconi of Italy, who won the women's race last year, are
back. Tegla Loroupe of Kenya, the women's winner in 1994 and 1995,
was debating whether to run, but a sore throat Saturday morning
ended those thoughts. On Friday, said there was a 50-50 chance she
would run. That was surprising because of her limited recovery time
after setting a women's world best of 2:20:43 on Sept. 26 in Berlin
and running half-marathons the following two Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   If any man is favored, it is Kagwe. Danilo Goffi of Italy, a
men's contender, said: ``My favorite is Kagwe. He knows the course
very well.'' Carey Pinkowski, the director of the Chicago Marathon,
also picked Kagwe because ``he is more experienced and knows when
to surge.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe does not claim victory, but he does not minimize his
chances, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any man here is super,'' he said. ``I'm not
coming here to be super, I'm coming here to win. I do not delete
anybody from the mix, but I do not fear anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly runners to be wary of, if not fear. Joseph
Chebet of Kenya, the runner-up here the last two years and Kagwe's
April conqueror in Boston, is a potential winner. So is Zebedayo
Bayo of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's New York race, Kagwe held off Chebet by 3 seconds
and Bayo by 3 seconds more. Chebet is plainly tired of playing
second fiddle to Kagwe here and does not seem ready to allow Kagwe
to win with superior speed at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get to Central Park,'' Chebet said, ``my plan is to go
faster immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdelkhader Mouaziz of Morocco, who won the London Marathon in
April, is certainly fresh because he runs only two marathons a year
and maybe one shorter road race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to preserve my body,'' he said, ``because I think
too many road races are going to kill athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Four and a half years after his last marathon victory, Cosmas
Ndeti of Kenya, a three-time winner in Boston, said he was a
contender again. He added, ``I am very hungry. I can make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvio Guerra of Ecuador, second in Boston this year, said he
was ready to win ``a fast and very competitive race'' here. The
5-foot-5-inch Elijah Lagat of Kenya, who six years ago trimmed his
weight of 160 pounds to 120 in six months when he started to have a
heart problem, is one of the race's six sub-2:08 marathoners.
</P>
<P>
   The men's elite field is stronger than the women's, if only
because of the almost endless procession of Kenyans. Of the 33
elite men, 14 are from Kenya. Loroupe aside, of the 13 elite women
here, only two are Kenyans, and only one Kenyan, Catherine Ndereba,
is a potential winner. Although she has twice been named the
American road racer of the year, she did not make her marathon
debut until Boston this year (she finished sixth).
</P>
<P>
   Since August, Fiacconi, the women's defender, has been limited
by a broken right elbow that led to tendinitis. She said she still
thought she could win, running as usual from the front, but she did
not sound convincing.
</P>
<P>
   She named three other contenders _ Ndereba, Adriana Fernandez of
Mexico and 38-year-old Katrin Dorre-Heinig of Germany. Fernandez,
who trains at a 12,000-foot altitude in Mexico, has speed, too,
winning the 5,000-meter titles in the last two Pan American games.
Coming from a nation that has turned out many outstanding male
marathoners but few women, she says proudly, ``I have been an
example to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorre-Heinig, a product of the old East German sports schools,
has been running marathons since 1982 and by her count has won 23
of 42. Like Lagat, the Kenyan man who lost so much weight so
quickly, she has a method, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a race,'' she said, ``I eat everything for two weeks.
Then I weigh 5 or 6 or 7 kilos'' _ 11 to 15{ pounds _ ``more. When
I begin to train again, there is not so much time to eat and I lose
that weight.''
</P>
<P>
   The men will have five designated rabbits, or pacesetters, who
will try to run the first half of the race in 1 hour 3 minutes or
1:04 and maintain that pace until they reach 15 or 16 miles. The
women will have no rabbits because they will run the first eight
miles on separate roads from the men and there are no women, aside
from the contenders, fast enough to be rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   With a good pace from the rabbits, Giacomo Leone of Italy, the
surprise winner here in 1996, envisioned how he race would unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 28 kilometers'' _ 17 miles _ ``I think the real race
will begin,'' he said. ``In New York, it is important to run fast
at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the rabbits is German Silva, the popular Mexican who won
here in 1994 and 1995. He could not run from March to July because
of a deep plantar wart on his left foot that required surgery. This
is his first race back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year,'' he said, ``I want to run this race seriously.
``For now, the idea is to get back my feeling for the race and help
out. And please don't call me a rabbit. A better word would be
helper.''

JURY IN SUBWAY KILLING REFLECTS ON FAILED TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was supposed to end another way. The jury foreman
in the Andrew Goldstein trial was supposed to pronounce him guilty
or not guilty by reason of insanity of murdering a stranger by
shoving her in front of a subway train.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bringing to a close a closely watched trial in a case
that horrified the city, the verdict was expected to send a larger
message: either that mental illness is no excuse for violence, or
that Goldstein was himself a victim of a state mental health system
that had failed in its duty to treat a very dangerous and very sick
man.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow the trial went wrong. Instead of soberly weighing
the evidence, the jury of 12 New Yorkers spent five days furiously
screaming at one another. With 10 jurors ready to convict and two
holding out, they announced on Tuesday that they were deadlocked,
and a mistrial was declared.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the police and prosecutors discovered that the
most determined holdout juror, Octavio Ramos, had been convicted in
October of misdemeanor harassment by the Manhattan district
attorney's office. The judge and the prosecutor in the trial had
apparently failed to ask prospective jurors if they had been
convicted of any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ramos said he deliberated honestly in the case,
but legal experts said his conviction could have prejudiced him
against prosecutors, and probably would have disqualified him.
</P>
<P>
   Other jurors disclosed that some panel members considered issues
the judge specifically told them to ignore. Fears that Goldstein
would be quickly released by the mental health system if he was
found not guilty by reason of insanity hurt his case, they said.
The failure of Goldstein's family to appear at the trial or testify
in his defense was taken by some jurors as a tacit signal that they
favored his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Bathmann, the foreman, and other jurors said in interviews
that they were furious at Ramos, disappointed in the courts for
allowing him to serve and devastated by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just horrendous day after day. It was screaming and
yelling and fighting. It was unbelievable,'' Bathmann said. The
foreman, a 61-year-old retired airline employee, called the jury's
failure to reach a verdict and the resulting need to retry
Goldstein ``a travesty.''
</P>
<P>
   What, if anything, went wrong in a trial that could have
showcased New York's legal system? Did a rogue juror scuttle the
trial? Should New York change the way insanity defenses are
weighed? Or did nothing go wrong; was the deadlock simply the
result of reasonable jurors honestly disagreeing over what was a
just outcome to a tragic case?
</P>
<P>
   Jurors and legal experts said that the trial highlighted a
variety of reforms needed in the system. But there was little
unanimity on what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring error appears to be the failure of the judge,
Carol Berkman, or the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney
William Greenbaum, to discover Ramos' recent misdemeanor
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened was still unclear as of Friday.
Prosecutors and court officials said they could not get a
transcript of Ramos' questioning because the court stenographer
involved was busy with other work.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that Ramos was not asked the question, defense lawyers
said the mistake was caused partly by the increasingly short time
that prosecutors and defense lawyers were given to question
prospective jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Others argued that juries of lay people should not be asked to
decide the complex issue of insanity. H. Richard Uviller, a law
professor at Columbia, favors having a judge decide a defendant's
sanity. But Julia Vitullo-Martin, director of the Citizens Jury
Project, said the state's ``complex and confusing'' insanity
defense standard should first be simplified before the use of a
jury is scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The family of the victim, Kendra Webdale, has said New York
should adopt a type of verdict used in a dozen states that allows
defendants to be found ``guilty but mentally ill.'' Under that
system, a defendant receives treatment but is required to serve the
full prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But mental health advocates contend that such a standard results
in defendants simply going to prison and receiving shoddy mental
health care there.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the various sides could agree on was that
Goldstein's trial was far from satisfying. Philip Dolinsky, 34, a
schizophrenic man who followed the trial, said jurors' assumptions
about Goldstein's family were unfair and that the defendant was
stigmatized because of his mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Webdale of Buffalo, N.Y., the victim's mother, said
that Ramos, the holdout juror, probably had empathy for Goldstein
because he had just been a defendant. She wanted to know why the
mistake was made, and she was still struggling with the trial's
jarring conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's funny, now that I'm back home and away from it all, the
sadness is setting in,'' she said, referring to the lack of
resolution in the case. ``I'm just in shock. I feel like I did when
Kendra died.''

   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ He was a street kid growing up in Callao,
Peru. He earned nickels where he could _ at a bakery for 50 cents a
day, collecting bus fares, washing cars. One day a friend took
Jorge Chavez to a racetrack and told him he should try riding
horses.
</P>
<P>
   He was 20, a squat and muscled 4 feet 10 inches tall and old by
racing standards. Still, he became an exercise rider, a jockey the
next year in 1982 and, by the time he reached South Florida for a
vacation in 1988, the best rider in all of Peru.
</P>
<P>
   When someone suggested that Chavez stay in the Sunshine State
and earn a living here, he thought why not. ``I learned early about
hard work and believing there's nothing you can't do,'' said
Chavez, now 38.
</P>
<P>
   It was an improbable beginning for a more unimaginable saga of a
rider, now based in New York, who is finally considered good enough
for the best horses in the world. In the 16th annual Breeders' Cup
here Saturday, Chavez had four mounts, three of them _ Beautiful
Pleasure in the Distaff, Artax in the Sprint and Behrens in the
Classic _ considered top choices.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Chavez became notorious for earning 85 days of
suspensions in his first year in Florida. He was hung with the name
Chop Chop for his aggressive and unorthodox whipping action. He
became the hero for bettors who appreciated his extraordinary
effort in even the cheapest races at Belmont and Aqueduct where he
has won multiple riding titles since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But until the past year, Chavez had a hard time getting rides on
top horses _ the kind that have a real chance at collecting parts
of the combined $13 million in purses here Saturday. He won the
winter Gulfstream title, as well the Belmont spring and fall
titles. And Saturday, in the 16th annual Breeders' Cup, Chavez
broke his 0-19 Breeder's Cup streak by bringing home Beautiful
Pleasure in the $1 million Distaff and Artax in the Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   At the top levels especially, owners of million-dollar horses
tend to be comfortable with articulate and telegenic jockeys with a
flair for finesse riding, jockeys like Jerry Bailey and Gary
Stevens. Except for an expansive smile, Chavez doesn't easily fit
that mold. He has been able to improve his English, but his riding
style remains closer to wrangling than equine ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been the perception that Jorge lacked polish,''
said Chavez's agent, Richard DePass. ``It's made us work hard for
opportunities, but once he gets on these horses he brings home the
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   With DePass working the trainer's barns and Chavez their horses,
the jockey is now third in the national standings with more than
$13.9 million in purse earnings. James Bond, the trainer of the
Horse of the Year candidate Behrens, was one of the first trainers
to recognize that Chavez knew how to capitalize on substance over
style. For years, he has ridden Chavez only to have some owners
pressure him to replace the jockey with a bigger name for big
horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ride him day in and day out, and you appreciate how
skilled he is,'' said Bond, who now gives Chavez first call for all
of his horses. ``He works hard working horses in the morning, and
he wins in the afternoon. He has always made me look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides winning races, jockey and agent needed to rehabilitate
Chavez's reputation and educate trainers about his riding style to
woo the big-time outfits like D. Wayne Lukas, Todd Pletcher and
Nick Zito, that now employ the rider. They began by returning to
Florida for the prestigious Gulfstream meet for the first time
since Chavez had earned his rough riding reputation. The jockey
made it clear he's a different rider from the Peruvian street
fighter who made a raucous American debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I was winning races and doing very well down
here,'' he said. ``The other jocks were looking at this new guy,
and they started getting aggressive around me. I didn't want to go
down, so I went right back at them. It wasn't very mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more troublesome for some was the Chop Chop tag. Chavez has
short, powerful arms that make it difficult for him to reach back
and whip a horse's hip. To compensate, he has developed a quick up
and down motion targeting the shoulder. Trainers John and Donna
Ward initially winced at the notion of putting Chavez on Beautiful
Pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't like all the Chop Chop stuff,'' said Donna
Ward, who also serves as the exercise rider for the stable. ``So I
watched him ride last year at Saratoga. I didn't find he did that
at all. He keeps them busy, but there has never been a mark on a
horse that he has ridden for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has gracefully waited for his big-time opportunity and
acknowledges he is gratified that he is a fan favorite among the
rail birds in New York. But he is also clearly rattled by the
perception he is hard on horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like humans, and I wouldn't beat on them just like I
wouldn't beat on a person,'' he said. ``The horses have taken me
along way. I don't know where I would be without them.''

<P>
   Karl M. Waage, a paleontologist and former director of the
Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, died on Oct.
18 at Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from running the museum and helping to train a generation
of geologists and paleontologists in 40 years at Yale, Waage was
chiefly interested in studying the fossil animals in sediments from
the sea that stretched from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico 100
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught his students the classical or traditional approach
to sediment layering and paleontology but also encouraged new ideas

 &HT;    He fell into the hands of God
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ledge appeared to be no bigger than a typical
office desk, except it was made of rock and located about 14,000
feet above sea level. Jeff Wingo found himself there as the sun set
on Aug. 3, 1998, shivering in near freezing temperatures, stranded
with dwindling water and just a few Powerbars and raisins to eat.
Wingo was about to spend the night sharing a thin sleeping bag with
a fellow mountain climber, on an adventure he never expected.
</P>
<P>
   Wingo, a computer whiz from Smyrna, Ga., whose boyish looks and
wiry frame made him look younger than his 27 years, stood only 500
feet from the summit of Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the
continental United States, located about 170 miles from Los
Angeles. Neither he nor the three climbers he recruited expected
any danger on what is considered one of the ``50 classic climbs''
for Americans in that sport. Thousands of people walk up the
western flank of Whitney every year, and Wingo's party planned to
spend a day climbing the east face, which required ropes and other
special gear. The year before, Wingo had climbed Mount Rainier, a
far more treacherous ascent. He considered Whitney a very
manageable steppingstone to his dream of one day standing atop
Mount Everest. But that was before his careful plan started
unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Next to him sat Marty Mattingly, 38, a cable systems expert who
lives near Snellville, with the craggy looks of a modern-day
Viking. Their respective climbing partners, suffering from the
altitude, had decided to stay at base camp 2,000 feet below. The
four made the decision late in the morning, so the clock was
ticking by the time Wingo and Mattingly decided to pair up the rest
of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly led the way up the granite chimney. At one point, he
got sidetracked about 10 feet, and the two found themselves on a
more difficult route. The detour cost them even more time.
</P>
<P>
   When they pulled themselves onto the ledge, they decided it was
safer to stay there than to try to make the summit. Safety was
paramount to Wingo, who had built a reputation for meticulous
climbing skills. He even carried a large fold-out first-aid kit for
this short climb, even though it added weight to his pack and
Mattingly thought it excessive.
</P>
<P>
   But Wingo's reputation for safety made Mattingly very confident
in hooking up with him for the ascent. The night before at base
camp, they had sorted their gear and carefully picked out what they
needed to get to the top. Wingo knew the equipment thoroughly and
had talked to local climbers and studied guidebooks to figure out
what was necessary. Everyone told him that ice axes and crampons,
the special footwear needed for climbing on ice, were just added
weight on a Whitney trip, so he left those behind. But he made sure
to demonstrate to Mattingly the proper grips on an ice ax, should
he ever need to keep himself from falling on future, more difficult
climbs.
</P>
<P>
   Something else made Mattingly trust Wingo even more. As the two
repacked their gear, they talked about their families. Wingo
confided in him that his Christian faith persuaded him to remain a
virgin until he was married, and that moral strength impressed
Mattingly.
</P>
<P>
   Each knew that he was trusting the other with his life. They
also knew that if one of them fell, the best they could hope for
would be serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   But that risk was an intrinsic attraction of the sport; they had
to suspend their fear of danger or else neither of them could focus
or concentrate on finding the strongest handholds or anchoring the
other tightly. Falling had to be the last thing on their minds, or
they shouldn't be up there. So even on this tiny ledge, neither of
them felt afraid.
</P>
<P>
   As the temperature dropped, they mentally reviewed the decisions
that had led them to that spot, and felt confident about having
made them together. They had scouted out this route before
undertaking it and talked to returning climbers. They knew the
ascent was well within their abilities, and their bodies were well
acclimated to the altitude after three days on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Wingo's resourcefulness paid off as their water bottles ran dry.
He scooped snow into his bottle, dropped in a couple of iodine
tablets from his first aid kit and added some citrus drink powder.
The two squeezed into one thin ``bivy sack'' and settled into a
cold, restless night under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   AN EARLY FOCUS
</P>
<P>
   Twenty seven years earlier, a young couple in Fayette County
spent a sleepless, watchful night. Harold ``Ronnie'' Wingo, 26, and
his wife Kay, 25, hovered over the crib of the tiny 5-week-old baby
boy who had miraculously come into their lives. They had been
married for almost six years, long enough for doctors to tell them
they couldn't conceive a child. So they had applied to adopt one
and waited anxiously for a call.
</P>
<P>
   When the little boy was in their arms, they named him Jeffrey
Alex and feared to let him touch the ground. They were afraid that
if he got dirty, someone would come and take him away. ``We were
afraid he would break,'' Kay recalled, and that feeling didn't go
away until the paperwork became final a year later.
</P>
<P>
   For Ronnie, who seemed perpetually tan from his lifelong work on
local telephone lines, and Kay, whose Southern manners prompt her
to apologize for serving guests only sweet tea, a sense of destiny
filled their house with the arrival of their curly-headed little
boy. He slept a lot and never seemed cross, and his contentment,
his new parents believed, came from his impoverished birth mother
who knew she was doing the right thing in giving him to them.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up a focused, gifted child whose orderliness stood out
even in a family that prides itself on organization. He wouldn't
fall asleep until all his toys were put away. He cut out paper
dinosaurs from memory and corrected anyone who mispronounced one of
the species. In sixth grade, he was the first kid at North Fayette
Elementary School to program a computer, and at home would sit for
hours figuring out software. Almost like one of those machines, he
absorbed new information continuously.
</P>
<P>
   At age 11, he followed his parents' lead and professed his faith
in Jesus Christ at their Baptist church on Easter Sunday. He always
felt close to them, and despite their openness about his adoption
and their blessing to look for his birth parents, he never revealed
any urge to take on that search. His strong beliefs and self-esteem
helped him make it through his teen-age years, when he was known at
Fayette County High School as a friendly, nerdy sort of kid who
sang in the chorus. He had tried a lot of sports but already had
reached his full size of 5 feet 6 and 135 pounds, and team sports
never sparked much interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   He had not found his niche yet.
</P>
<P>
   THE PATH NOT TAKEN
</P>
<P>
   When dawn broke, the entire east face of Mount Whitney glowed
like a giant nugget of gold, and the burst of color greeted Wingo
and Mattingly as they rose from their chilly night on the ledge.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly climbed the rest of the way to the summit, reaching
it at 10 a.m. and gulping down the last drops of their makeshift
snow drink. A plaque confirmed they had reached 14,494 feet, the
highest point in the lower 48. They were rewarded by a vista made
even more spectacular by what they saw below _ the desolation of
the nation's lowest point, Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``What some people won't do for a view,'' Mattingly joked as
they looked down at the tops of California's next-tallest
mountains. Never in his extensive travels around the globe had he
seen anything so stunning.
</P>
<P>
   They signed their names in the log book near a hut on the
summit, and Wingo bounded from boulder to boulder, looking for the
highest one for a pose that would fittingly depict his
accomplishment. He and Mattingly met two local climbers who had
arrived by way of an easier, hiking route to the top. The four took
pictures of each other, and Wingo and Mattingly knew it was time to
move on. They knew that getting to the top was like swimming
halfway across the ocean and that the descent lay ahead of them.
Also, their friends were waiting below and Wingo and Mattingly
didn't want them to worry.
</P>
<P>
   They easily located the cairn, or rock pile, that marked the
start of a steep but hikable route down. They expected to make good
time, because they would't need any special equipment along that
pathway. But Mattingly remembers taking only a few steps before
something unexpected made them change directions.
</P>
<P>
   THE FAITH TO CLIMB
</P>
<P>
   Wingo discovered his calling on the 28,000-acre campus of Berry
College in Rome, a small liberal-arts college about 65 miles
northwest of Atlanta. He immersed himself in mountain biking,
caving, kayaking and rock climbing. In these sports, his small
frame was often an advantage. And his gregarious personality was
well-suited to learning difficult techniques. He didn't care if he
looked stupid learning something new. He even turned his new skills
into practical jokes, rappelling once from a third-story dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't fall and break anything,'' his worried mom told
him.
</P>
<P>
   The sports seemed to boost his energy further, and he became
well known around campus for his big hugs and extended hellos to
even casual acquaintances. He couldn't get through a crowded room
without saying hi to everyone, which often made him late to class.
``Jeff made you feel as if you had known each other forever,''
fellow student Tanya Messeck recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He became so wrapped up in his new pursuits that his trips home
became less frequent, and he answered his phone so seldomly that
his parents figured he never slept. When they visited, they ducked
to avoid the bikes and kayaks hanging from his dorm room ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors gear, particularly in rock climbing, became a huge
obsession for him, and he soon earned the name ``Tinker Bell''
because of all the excess equipment he hung off his harness.
Friends teased him that he had enough stuff to lead an expedition
up El Capitan, the famous climb in Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who arranged his books in alphabetical order and
stacked quarters by dates minted, he loved the precision of
climbing. He loved practicing all the knots. And he loved focusing
all of his brain power on one goal _ scaling a big slab of rock. He
started spending almost every weekend climbing with his new best
friend and fellow student, Marc Heileman, slowly gaining the
ability to master more and more challenging routes.
</P>
<P>
   His and Heileman's friendship deepened as they persevered
through the close calls climbers call ``epics.'' The pair ran out
of rope on the slick rock and mud of a difficult 1,000-foot climb
in North Carolina and didn't get out of the jam until nightfall.
Neither had a head lamp, and they groped their way for three hours
in the rain down the trails back to the base.
</P>
<P>
   Those experiences became the foundation for Wingo's safety
consciousness and never kept him from trying new climbs. Wingo told
Heileman that climbing in magnificent settings was where he felt
closest to God.
</P>
<P>
   A church friend once asked Wingo if the danger of climbing
scared him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Wingo replied. ``I know if I fall, I'll fall into the
hands of God.''
</P>
<P>
   CROSSROADS IN THE SNOW
</P>
<P>
   What happened next on the mountain depends on the person asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly remembers taking a few steps down the steep
mountaineers route when the two climbers that he and Wingo met and
photographed at the summit approached. Rick Harris, a climbing
veteran of 23 years, and Jeffrey Albrecht had met two years before
while doing emergency medical technician training. Harris' gear,
knowledge and preparation for the ascent impressed Mattingly.
</P>
<P>
   The two Californians, according to Mattingly, invited them to
take an easier route on the mountain's northwest side, a trail
across stable, firm snow that Harris and Albrecht had just trekked
across on their way up. The decision was easy for Wingo and
Mattingly. They looked at each other and instantly agreed to follow
their two new friends.
</P>
<P>
   The way Harris and Albrecht tell it, Wingo and Mattingly were
exhausted at the summit and quizzed them about whether they knew an
easier way down. However that decision unfolded, this much everyone
agrees on: Wingo and Mattingly changed their original plan and
followed the hikers on a new path.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes they were crossing snowfields that sloped
downward into the Western Cascades, picking their way through deep
footprints that were easy to follow. Their hiking boots provided
plenty of traction, and the slope was no steeper than Mattingly's
front yard in Gwinnett County. The shortcut led to a notch where
they would pick up their original route of descent.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Wingo was leading, wearing a white helmet and a
climbing harness. The other three followed, each about 10 feet from
the other, as the footprints became less shallow and stopped at the
base of a big boulder.
</P>
<P>
   The rock was taller than Wingo. According to Harris, the four
discussed whether to go over it or around it. Wingo said he could
set up a belay, but Harris, the most experienced climber in the
group, said, ``Let's go back.'' He wanted to take a look at other
routes. Mattingly doesn't recall any discussion; he and the others
would have done exactly what Wingo did in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   No one questioned Wingo when he called out to them: ``I'd feel
more comfortable with an ice ax.'' Harris passed his lightweight
aluminum ice ax up the line, and Wingo positioned the ax head in
his hand with the special safety grip.
</P>
<P>
   As he plunged the butt of the ax into the snow with a hard
swing, he expected it to anchor him as he pushed off to scale the
boulder. But the ax came down not on snow, but rock. And what
happened next unfolded too fast for anyone to do anything to
prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   CALLED TO NEW HEIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Wingo graduated from Berry College in late 1993, not wanting to
leave because he was having so much fun. He and Heileman moved to
Atlanta and dreamed of starting a Christian-based adventure sports
company. Wingo moved in with his parents and got a job selling
computer printers, intent on saving money and spending every spare
moment honing his climbing skills. He and Heileman enrolled in a
yearlong intensive training program to become instructors at The
Challenge, a rock climbing school based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you haven't tried climbing, you wouldn't understand,''
reads the inscription on the back of the school's T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   School founder Jerry Dodgen's first impression was that Wingo
was a ``smiley kid'' who was much more mature than his appearance
suggested. He found Wingo easy to trust, particularly after Wingo
took Dodgen's claustrophobic wife Kathryn on a caving trip that she
really enjoyed. Wingo valued integrity to the point that when
Dodgen gave him a tax receipt for his wages after he became an
instructor, Wingo checked his records and insisted upon a corrected
form that showed he had earned $100 more.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgen liked to tease Wingo about all the extra gear clanging
off his harness, which had earned him another nickname _ ``Mr.
Jingles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you never know,'' Wingo would reply, laughing at
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgen was well aware of the risks involved at high
altitude. Each year, he summarized national climbing accident
reports and distributed them to his staff so they could avoid such
mistakes. Out of 100 deaths or injuries, Dodgen figured that 99
started with one small, questionable decision that led to another
and finally ended in disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of our life in generalities, but we act out our life
in small decisions,'' he says. ``And those can set off a chain of
events that lead to something bad. And we all want to know about
it, so we don't do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Wingo's devotion to safety led to his resignation from The
Challenge after Dodgen was involved in an accident on a nonschool
climb. A rappel anchor failed and a young woman fell and was
injured. Wingo felt the accident compromised the trust students
needed to have in the school, and him as an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   His aspirations were moving in a slightly different direction,
away from climbing and toward mountaineering _ combining his
climbing skills and love of gear to scale an entire mountain, not
just one face of rock. He'd read books about adventures in the
Himalayas, and started talking about one day climbing Mount
Everest. To that end, in 1997, he trained for months to prepare for
a guided trip up Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Wingo always seemed to have a backup plan. In early 1998, he
bought a house, and two months later lost his job. But within
another month, after combing the Internet, he had three job offers,
picking one that offered a salary $15,000 higher.
</P>
<P>
   By that fall, he had found three fellow climbers to join him on
the Mount Whitney climb. The morning he left, he spoke to his
brother Jonathan on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be safe,'' his brother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always,'' Wingo replied.
</P>
<P>
   SLIPPING INTO THE UNKNOWN
</P>
<P>
   The rebound of the ice ax caused Wingo to lose his footing and
land stomach-down on the icy face of snow, and he began to slip
down the slope, fast. In a split second, his eyes met Mattingly's
and in them his friend could see not terror or panic, but the
knowledge that something was very, very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self arrest, Jeff! Self arrest!'' Mattingly yelled, and Wingo
quickly regripped the ax to plunge the head into the ice and stop
his fall. But his hand position was off a quarter turn, and instead
of driving the ax pick into the snow, it scraped a snakelike line
in the ice surface as he headed to a rock ledge 200 feet below. His
Goretex parka and pants seemed to grease his feet-first descent.
</P>
<P>
   The snow made depth perception difficult, and Mattingly couldn't
tell that the 30-degree slope quickly increased to about 60
degrees. He kept thinking that Wingo would hit the ledge and stop.
</P>
<P>
   Wingo didn't holler or scream. He just kept sliding. At the
ledge, he slammed into the rocks. His body hit with such force that
it flipped in the air. The last time his companions saw him alive,
Wingo was facing up, falling in the air.
</P>
<P>
   TRYING NOT TO WORRY BACK HOME
</P>
<P>
   While her son was on Mount Whitney, Kay Wingo visited his ranch
house in Smyrna to finish sewing some drapes for him. She noticed
his bed made perfectly, bathroom towels hung straight and one lone
coffee cup in the dishwasher. It was almost too clean, and it gave
her a funny feeling, as if he were too prepared to leave.
</P>
<P>
   She reflected on how hard he had searched for this house,
looking for one with a basement big enough for a climbing wall. And
how relieved she was that he had moved close to home, because she
always feared he would go far away from her to pursue his
adventures. She tried to trust God for his safety, but she worried
about him.
</P>
<P>
   He knew it, too, and didn't tell her about the Mount Whitney
trip until right before he left. She was glad he didn't, because
she remembered him packing for Mount Rainier. He crammed thick
parkas and crampons into a duffel bag so heavy that he could barely
carry it. ``I didn't know there were mountains that high in our
country,'' thought Kay, who is afraid of heights and had only flown
once. Her son returned from Rainier so sunburned that she started
crying.
</P>
<P>
   But she reminded herself that she needed to let him go, that he
had done everything to prepare, even taking emergency medical
response courses. And it comforted her that he believed that God
would always be with him. On his desk lay a laminated page from a
devotional that compared the exhilaration and challenge of mountain
climbing to leading a life of faith in Jesus Christ, that the
higher one climbs, the stronger faith grows.
</P>
<P>
   The passage describes how European climbers, on their way to a
famous peak, often pass the graves of others who went before. The
grave markers always bear the same inscription: ``He died
climbing.'' The passage ends with this prayer: ``May we still be
climbing to the very end.''
</P>
<P>
   TRAGEDY UNFOLDS
</P>
<P>
   The background of snow beyond the rock ledge made it difficult
for Mattingly to figure how far Wingo had fallen. But Harris and
Albrecht had seen the drop-off on their way to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sorry,'' Harris told Mattingly, ``but your friend
is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The three turned around, Mattingly suddenly unsure of his
footing on a trail that seemed so safe only minutes before.
Albrecht headed back to the summit to find someone with a cell
phone to call for help, while Mattingly and Harris scrambled down a
side path to find a safe way to the ledge.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly peered over. He saw Wingo 800 feet below, his body
contorted in a way that Mattingly knew instantly that he must be
dead. The impact of falling roughly 10 stories had split open his
black and red backpack, scattering his gear, including the first
aid kit. Mattingly yelled, but Wingo didn't respond. The drop-off
was so sharp that Mattingly could see he had no way to reach his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly is a logical thinker who climbs partly because the
focus and goal-setting involved helps him succeed in the business
world. He immediately trekked toward the summit and down their
original descent route to the base camp at Iceberg Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Mattingly heard a sound that always sends a chill
through every climber: the beating of helicopter wings. Helicopters
appear only when something terrible has happened, and this one
carried a litter underneath, used to transport bodies.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally met up with the other two climbers in their
original party, Mattingly, shaken, told them what had happened. He
knew that he did not have enough time to hike back to his car and
that the three would have to spend another long night on Mount
Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   By the next day, everyone on the mountain knew about the
accident. If they had not heard the news, they had seen proof of it
as Wingo's three buddies hiked down. The three of them carried four
packs. The extra one belonged to Wingo.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKING THE NEWS
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Kay Wingo left her son's house, Marc Heileman
drove south through Atlanta with a horrible feeling in his stomach.
If not for him, he knows, Jeff Wingo never would have gone to Mount
Whitney, and Mattingly never would have been at the summit with
him. Heileman had introduced the two months earlier, knowing that
each had separate plans to climb the same peak.
</P>
<P>
   Heileman's face was red from crying as he pulled into the long
driveway of an almost-rural ranch house in Fayette County and
parked in front of the security gate. He walked the rest of the
way, knowing that no one just rang the doorbell at the Wingos'
house, especially at 10 p.m. on a night that they would have just
returned from choir practice.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Wingo answered the door, and when she saw Heileman's face,
she knew instantly that something was very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Jeff,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Heileman nodded and said, ``He's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   SEARCHING FOR A REASON
</P>
<P>
   In California, National Park Service investigators were piecing
together their version of how Wingo died. From interviews with
Mattingly and the other two hikers, including questions about any
possible drug or alcohol use on the trip, the investigators
concluded that the group made some ``questionable choices.''
Included was Wingo's and Mattingly's decision to descend the
mountain while exhausted, with little sleep the night before.
Another was the choice by the four to cross a trail of ice and snow
without proper equipment. They had dismissed other ways of
descending to take ``a riskier route.''
</P>
<P>
   Wingo's family and climbing friends did not accept that human
error led to his death. He was too safety-conscious, and his faith
in God too strong for his death to be attributed to a string of
``questionable choices.'' After 500 people attended his funeral at
New Hope Baptist Church, many of those closest to him began to
search for a spiritual explanation for his loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Wingos found consolation in the book ``Sometimes Mountains
Move,'' by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and his
wife. The Koops lost a son of similar age in a rock-climbing
accident and, in searching their beliefs afterward, concluded that
God must have plucked their son off the mountain. Soon the Wingos
began to believe that their son's fall was part of a divine plan
that they could not fully comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Wingo began to envision God taking his son's soul to
heaven even before his body hit the icy slope. He imagined the wind
blowing softly by his face, the snow below white and beautiful, so
peaceful that there were no sounds as the angels whisked him
skyward. ``It was in God's plan that he would die on that
mountain,'' his father said recently. He started listening to the
Sarah McLachlan song ``Angel,'' which was one of Jeff's favorites
long before it became a paean to John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   You are pulled from the wreckage
</P>
<P>
   of your silent reverie
</P>
<P>
   you're in the arms of the angel
</P>
<P>
   may you find some comfort there
</P>
<P>
   HAUNTED BY THE MOUNTAIN
</P>
<P>
   Wingo's death sent shockwaves through Atlanta's climbing
community. If he could die on a mountain, any of them could.
</P>
<P>
   They hounded Mattingly for details, and he felt inadequate as he
tried to describe the freakish nature of the accident, how safe the
route felt and how in a million years he never would have thought
of roping himself to Wingo as they crossed the snowfield.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly replayed the scene every day, reviewing his decisions
along the way, feeling that he did the right thing. Except one
part: the decision to take a different route. If he had just spoken
up and said, ``No, let's stick with our original plan,'' he knew
Wingo would still be alive. And that ate at him even more than the
tears of his wife and daughters, who pleaded with him never to
climb again.
</P>
<P>
   When Heileman asked Mattingly to return to Mount Whitney with
him, Mattingly agreed, without knowing why.
</P>
<P>
   RELIVING THE FALL
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Wingo's closest friends and family gathered at
Berry College to dedicate a memorial stone to him, with a plaque
quoting Psalm 18:2: ``The Lord is my Rock, my fortress, and my
deliverer.'' The school set up a scholarship in his name, partly
funded by an auction of his gear.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, Heileman played a film of the trip that he
and Mattingly had taken just a few weeks before. Almost a year to
the day after their friend died, they trekked, with video camera in
hand, to the last spot where he had stood.
</P>
<P>
   On the film, Mattingly's equipment _ he carried an ice ax and
crampons that time _ makes a loud clink-clink as he ascends the
trail. A helicopter's thrum and its appearance at eye level, like a
giant dragonfly, make Heileman wince.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the ground no longer is snowy, and neither feels
fear in approaching the trail. It appears lined with flat, loose
rocks, like a shell of an armadillo.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly walks ahead. Heileman, holding the camera, sniffles
and focuses on a footprint left in a single patch of snow. It's
just about the spot where Wingo last stood. The boulder he was
trying to get around looks like the skeleton of a cow, its cracked,
jagged muzzle jutting from the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   As Mattingly demonstrates how Wingo lost his balance, Heileman
tries to hold the camera steady as he provides running commentary
through his tears:
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see from looking at it if he wasn't wearing crampons
he would have felt pretty insecure, so he tried to plant the ice ax
to make things better. And when he planted it, his foot just popped
out of that step there. And Marty was behind him about to do the
same thing, and um ...''
</P>
<P>
   The words slow as Heileman collects his breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he was out on that snowfield ...''
</P>
<P>
   The camera centers on the final footprint for a long time, and
no words are said. Finally, Heileman sighs and continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I wanted to come here was to know ... ``
</P>
<P>
   His voice breaks, and he takes deep breaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``... whether or not if I had been here if there was anything
that I could have done. Not that I doubted Marty. I asked Marty if
he had done everything he thought he could do, and he said yes, and
I believed him. The only way you could have helped Jeff would have
been to be below him on this snowfield and spot him somehow, and
nobody could have done that. ``
</P>
<P>
   Ten seconds elapse. The camera still points at the footprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something that happened,'' Heileman continues. ``And
I and nobody else could have done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 15 seconds go by, and finally the camera moves away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the last thing he saw,'' Heileman adds, as the
camera pans peaks that appear to crest as far as one can see, their
peaks dotted with white snow. Clouds look touchable, casting
shadows so large they fill entire valleys below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' said Heileman. ``A lot of people would like to be
able to choose how they go. This would surely be at the top of the
list, especially for any climber.''
</P>
<P>
   The camera pans downward, at three lakes hundreds of feet below,
near where Wingo's body was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Heileman says, ``a whole lot more than a cemetery plot
in Atlanta is where I think he rests.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mattingly watches the film, he saw himself turn around from
Wingo's last footprint. The camera has caught the moment when he
felt a weight inside him lift. He is no longer on the mountain, but
has left it, a horrible chapter of his life written and gone.
</P>
<P>
   The video ends and slowly, the friends and family of Jeff Wingo
dispersed. The family picnicked with the other guests at the Berry
homecoming, and Kay Wingo cried and smiled as she recalled many
stories about her son.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, his friends slipped away. It was a beautiful day,
the sun would stay up for many more hours, and they must go and
climb again.

 &HT;    Kings under construction
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The offseason reconstruction was appropriate, given
the fresh stucco surroundings. When a building turns a decade old
in Los Angeles, it is plowed under to make room for a new one.
Restaurants seemingly open one weekend and close the next.
</P>
<P>
   Why should the city's hockey team be any different?
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we had to do something,'' Dave Taylor, the
longtime Kings winger turned general manager said. ``We had a
disappointing season last year. We made the playoffs the year
before, for the first time in five years, then we missed them
again. It was disheartening. We felt changes were necessary. But
we're optimistic now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's November, and every team in the NHL is optimistic. But
unlike many teams, L.A. suddenly has the record to back it up.
After a 1-1 tie at Detroit on Wednesday night, the Kings were 9-3-3
going into Saturday night's game against Philadelphia. The record
was good enough for a share of first place in the Pacific Division.
The franchise missed the playoffs five out of six times since Wayne
Gretzky led one of hockey's traditionally inept entities to the
Stanley Cup finals in 1992-93. The Kings finished in last place in
the Pacific last season at 32-45-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings aren't merely winning, they are doing it the only way
to get noticed in Southern California _ with flash. Their 50 goals
through 15 games ranked among the league leaders. The guys filling
up nets either have teen-age-idol looks (Luc Robitaille) or a name
that's difficult to forget (Ziggy Palffy).
</P>
<P>
   Taylor only cares that they're winning. If the team went in the
dumper this year, his job security was tenuous at best. The team
has 18,500 seats and suites to fill in the new Staples Arena. So
Taylor decided that, if he was going to go down, it would be with a
new cast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach Larry Robinson was fired, or at least not rehired after
his contract expired. His replacement is Andy Murray, a former
seven-year NHL assistant who most recently had been coaching at
Shattuck-St. Mary's, a Minnesota Prep School. Forget the fact that
Murray's school went 70-9-2 last year and won the Midget Triple A
USA Hockey championship. Kings fans started thinking of the next
Gerry Faust, not the next Scotty Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few people said, `Who's that?''' Taylor said. ``They
just didn't know who Andy was. But I spent a lot of time talking to
people he had worked with _ (Dallas GM) Bob Gainey, (Philadelphia
GM) Bobby Clarke, (Pittsburgh GM) Craig Patrick. ``I felt very good
about his understanding of the game, his systems and his rapport
with players. I thought he would give us direction, which was
something the players said they needed.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Taylor pushed the button on the biggest trade of the
offseason, a six-player, two-draft-pick deal highlighted by
disgruntled 40-goal scorer Palffy and center Bryan Smolinski coming
from the New York Islanders for a package including center Olli
Jokinen and a No. 1 pick. Palffy (six goals, 16 points) and
Smolinski (13 points) both rank among league scoring leaders, along
with the veteran Robitaille (10 goals, 16 points) and Jozef Stumpel
(13 assists, 15 points).
</P>
<P>
   _ The defense has received a big boost from the return of Aki
Berg, who sat out last year in a contract dispute and played in
Finland, and Rob Blake, one of the NHL's best when he's healthy,
which wasn't the case for 20 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Blake wasn't the only injured King last season. Goalies Jamie
Storr and Stephane Fiset both missed chunks of the seasons,
sometimes concurrently. Forward Glen Murray tore a knee ligament.
Ray Ferraro, now of the Thrashers, struggled at the outset in his
return from knee problems. All in all, it wasn't the best of
circumstances for Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're healthy and we've got some new players who are
clicking,'' Taylor said. ``But it's early.''

 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   A DEVILISH MOVE
</P>
<P>
   Forward Claude Lemieux was in tears when Colorado dealt him back
to New Jersey this week for winger Brian Rolston, a conditional
draft pick (second or third) and a possible switch of No. 1s. But
don't let that mislead you. This was Lemieux's idea. The former
playoff MVP is in the final year of a contract that pays him $2.47
million, and Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix had no
intention of re-signing him at that price (or higher). When the
34-year-old Lemieux realized that, he asked to be traded. ``I know
how hard it is to play for a club when you know you're no longer
going to be around after the season,'' Lemieux said. ``Your heart
is not there and your mind is not there. You're just basically
playing for yourself and disregarding the main goal of the club,
which is winning the Stanley Cup. This is a place where I wish I
could have finished my career and lived, but I'm going back to a
place where I played and lived. I believe in destiny and I'll make
the best of it and give my heart and soul to the Devils and try to
have a great year.''
</P>
<P>
   `DOOMINATOR' UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Interesting rumblings in Buffalo. With Dominik Hasek off to a
horrendous start and now sidelined for at least two months,
probably longer, with a severe groin tear, some have speculated the
all-globe goalie may not retire after this season as planned.
Hasek, who has two years remaining on his contract, suddenly isn't
closing the door to coming back and putting off that permanent move
back to the Czech Republic. His decision could hinge on several
factors, including his performance when he returns, how many games
he plays and the Sabres' postseason success. The only certainty is
that considering Hasek relies so heavily on flexibility, mobility
and quickness, returning from a 90-percent groin tear won't be an
easy feat.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY . . .
</P>
<P>
   Carolina owner Peter Karmanos couldn't help himself. He had to
join the Keith Primeau contract rhetoric war: ``We'll settle this
thing if Keith fires his agents. Keith should fire his agents for
giving him an exaggerated sense of his own value. ... The team is
doing very well without him. They're probably doing better than
they would be with him.'' Well now. That should bring the two sides
together. ... Bad three-way trade rumor of the week: Primeau to
Ottawa for a No. 1 Chris Phillips and another player; Alexei Yashin
from Ottawa to Chicago for Eric Daze, Brian McCabe and a No. 1. All
important parties deny knowledge of such. ... Fishbowl Dept.:
Florida's Pavel Bure returned to Vancouver for a game Friday. He
met a friend at an out-of-the-way coffeehouse. Ten minutes later,
another friend called on a cellular phone. The friend says, ``I
know where you are.'' Bure says, ``What?'' The friend says,
``You're at Starbucks. They just said it on the radio.'' ... Tampa
Bay's left wing Colin Forbes on Philips Arena: ``It's unreal. Lots
of new buildings look the same, but nothing looks like this place.
It's pretty fantastic.''

 &HT;    Face-off with Valeri Bure

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Valeri Bure
</P>
<P>
   Position: Right winger.
</P>
<P>
   Team: Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: Ranked among league leaders going into the weekend
with 10 goals and 17 points. Faced brother Pavel Bure on Saturday
when Calgary played Florida. The two could become only the third
brother-combination in history to lead their teams in scoring. The
others: Minnesota's Neal Broten and New Jersey's Aaron Broten in
1982-83, and Pittsburgh's Brian Hextall and California's Dennis
Hextall in 1970-71.
</P>
<P>
   _ Comparing the brothers: ``I don't think I could give him
scoring tips. He tries to give me tips, but we play different
styles. He is always trying to get himself open for a breakaway and
is in front of the play. I've got to come from behind the play and
get the speed and get open on either side where the play
develops.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On benefiting from a crackdown in obstruction penalties:
``It's great for the game. The guys who have skill and can skate
can take advantage of the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On liberalizing goal-crease rules: ``You go in there, you get
a cross-check, and your face is up against the post or something
like that. But you've got to pay the price to get in there.''

   BEST LAID PLANS
</P>
<P>
   While it is true the Dallas Stars have had an inordinate number
of injuries, the team's slow start this season can be attributed at
least in part to two of the team's younger prospects, Juha Lind and
Pavel Patera, not developing as hoped. The Stars did not re-sign
Pat Verbeek (still available), David Reid, Tony Hrkac and Craig
Ludwig because general manager Bob Gainey wanted the team to get
younger and believed the timing was right. Problem No. 1: Lind had
only one goal in 10 games, then went on injured reserve with a back
injury. Problem No. 2: Patera had one goal in five games, was
scratched in five others, then was shipped back to Michigan (IHL)
along with two other players, Aaron Gavey and Warren Luhning.
Gainey recalled four replacements from Michigan, hoping for better
luck. But coach Ken Hitchcock put the onus on his struggling
veterans (Jere Lehtinen, Jamie Langenbrunner, Joe Nieuwendyk): ``We
get an energy boost from these (young) guys, but our leaders are
the ones who have to come through.''

<P>
   INVEST IN SCHWAB
</P>
<P>
   Nice debut for Corey Schwab, the goalie the Thrashers traded to
Vancouver last week for a third-to-fifth-round draft pick (pending
his playing time). Schwab flew from Orlando to Vancouver last
Friday, didn't arrive until 2 a.m. Saturday, started against
Nashville that night and recorded a 4-1 win. It made goaltending
consultant Andy Moog looked good. Moog scouted goalies for the
Thrashers leading up to the expansion draft and felt the Thrashers
were underestimating the player's potential. Moog now works for the
Canucks and GM Brian Burke pushed the button on the deal partly
because of Moog's recommendation. Schwab was oblivious to all of
that. ``I'm definitely excited about this,'' he said. ``I didn't
really know too much about what was happening with the Canucks.''
</P>
<P>
   CRUMBLING
</P>
<P>
   Expect Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin to lower his contract
demands and report soon. Things just aren't going as he planned.
The Coyotes are off to a great start and, worse, his backup,
Mikhail Shtalenkov (7-2-2), was just named NHL player of the month.
Mikhail Shtalenkov? ``I was as shocked as anyone,'' Shtalenkov
said. ``I've never even won player of the week before.'' Khabibulin
likely well settle for a deal similar to that of Boston's Byron
Dafoe (three years, $9.45 million).
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY ...
</P>
<P>
   Nashville general manager David Poile has expressed interest in
opening next season in Japan, a marketing gadget that backfired
last year with a pair of games between San Jose and Calgary. Poile
should check with his players first. Sergei Krivokrasov said, ``I
wouldn't want to make a 14-hour flight. You wake up at four or five
in the morning because of the time change.'' ... Nashville lost
five straight games after going over .500 (4-3-1) for the first
time in history. ... Edmonton GM Glen Sather has been offering
center Pat Falloon around the league. No takers. ...There is a
growing belief the Oilers will deal Doug Weight, who is in the
final year of a $4.3 million deal.

MICROSOFT'S FRIENDS RUE THE FINDINGS AS FOES RELISH THEM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Utah, Wash.)   (jw) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James Barksdale, the former president of Netscape
Communications Corp., was the first witness to take the stand in
the Microsoft case. In fact, it was his company's complaints about
Microsoft's behavior that captured the Justice Department's
attention and touched off the investigation and trial that is now
coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued
his findings of fact in the case, asserting that Microsoft was a
monopolist that abused its market power to stifle competition, to
the detriment of consumers and the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning Barksdale was savoring the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a terrific step in a long march,'' he said.
``The judge's overall conclusion was that Microsoft is stifling
innovation. That's bad for consumers. And we've said that all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale was not the only one saying I told you so. Almost two
years ago, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, hauled Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates before
his committee for a political shellacking. Novell Corp., a large
and important Microsoft competitor, is based in Hatch's state.
</P>
<P>
   And after reading Jackson's findings of fact, Hatch said:
``Almost two years ago in the Judiciary Committee, I began
examining the state of competition in the computer industry and
specifically Microsoft's business practices. That was before the
Justice Department brought its lawsuit against the company. Some
criticized me for doing it, and it was lonely. But I think people
now recognize how important those hearings were.''
</P>
<P>
   The other members of Congress who spoke up quickly were those
representing Washington state who get votes, and contributions,
from Microsoft and its employees. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who
is an unflagging Microsoft ally, noted that the findings were
``only one step in an ongoing, lengthy and complex legal process.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Gorton said, ``should the government take a major step
toward destroying America's greatest success story and regulating
the high-tech industry, our global leadership in the area of
high-tech will be put at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, a Republican who represents the suburban
Seattle area where Microsoft has its headquarters, noted that in
the past, Jackson had ruled against Microsoft twice and his rulings
had been overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Among Microsoft's friends, perhaps the most brazen reaction came
from Citizens Against Government Waste, a 15-year-old advocacy
group that receives large donations from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the group proclaimed the findings of fact as a
vindication of the company because ``the ruling confirms that the
government's case against Microsoft has been an inexcusable waste
of taxpayer dollars.'' Thomas Schatz, the group's president,
acknowledged in an interview that Microsoft gave his organization
$50,000 last year and $50,000 to $100,000 this year _ more money
than any other company provides.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Microsoft's friends, and its competitors, are members of
the largest software industry trade group, the Software &AMP;
Information Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer, is on the
association's board. That has led the association to take awkward,
conflicted public positions on the antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the judge's findings, any sense of unease has
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, said Ken Wasch, association president, ``lays to
rest many of the arguments Microsoft presented in its defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Jackson,'' Wasch said, ``should be congratulated for a
decision that directly addresses the critical factual issues that
will form the basis for restoring competition in the software
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the association published a long document
discussing possible remedies that could be applied to Microsoft if
it lost. But given the association's conflicted situation, it was
published on a password-protected Web site available only to
members.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the findings out, Wasch released a summary of that
report and concluded that ``the single most effective approach is
for the court to adopt a remedy that creates a new relationship
between the dominant operating system provider and the rest of the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In its reaction Friday night, Microsoft indicated that it would
most likely appeal the judge's verdict, which is due in a month or
two. Those appeals could last years, leading many lawyers and
analysts to observe that the case and its remedies are likely to be
irrelevant by the time legal challenges are resolved, given the
pace of change in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday, Joel Klein, head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, called that thinking simply wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem discussed in the Justice Department's case
and the judge's findings is Microsoft's use of its monopoly power
in operating systems to threaten or bully other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think that is a problem that is going to go away
in a year or two,'' Klein said. ``It's been there for a decade, and
there's nothing on the horizon to suggest it is about to go away.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Klein added, ``I don't foreclose the possibility
that remedies could be in effect while appeals are under way.'' In
other words, he said, Microsoft might not win a stay during appeals
because, after all, ``this is not an equivocal or ambiguous set of
findings.''

FIELD GOAL ON FINAL PLAY BEATS 2ND-RANKED PENN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ Penn State's visions of a national
championship may have ended Saturday when the Minnesota Golden
Gophers handed them a stunning 24-23 defeat before 96,753
crestfallen fans. Minnesota won the game on the final play when Dan
Nystrom kicked a 32-yard field goal into the wind as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   The postgame scene was surreal, with Penn State players
sprawled, face down, on the field and Minnesota players dancing
around them. The fans on this brisk, sunny day stood in the
grandstands in a hush as the Penn State band took the field in a
dejected, disorganized manner.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions came into the game ranked second in all the
polls, behind only Florida State. The top two teams in the country,
according to the blended rankings of the Bowl Championship Series,
will meet in the Sugar Bowl for the national championship. Now Penn
State is 9-1 overall and 5-1 in the Big Ten. Even a Rose Bowl
appearance is no sure thing at this point. Minnesota is 3-3 in the
conference and 6-3 overall.
</P>
<P>
   The key play for the Golden Gophers on their winning drive was a
pass by quarterback Billy Cockerham to Arland Bruce on fourth down
and 16 yards to go that took the ball to Penn State's 13-yard line
with 78 seconds remaining. The play went for 27 yards. The ball
caromed off Ron Johnson and was caught by Bruce amid a crowd of
defenders. Four plays later, the winning kick began with two
seconds left on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   It was Minnesota's third lead of the game. Earlier, Minnesota
went ahead for the second time when Cockerham hooked up with
running back Thomas Hamner for a 49-yard pass-and-run play that
made the score 21-20 for the Gophers, with 11 minutes 25 seconds
remaining in the fourth quarter. But the attempt for a two-point
conversion ended in a quarterback sack, one of several crucial
plays that went Penn State's way. On the next drive, the Nittany
Lions got a 44-yard field goal by Travis Forney to take a lead of
23-21. It was Forney's third field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota made the plays,'' said Joe Paterno, Penn State's
coach. ``They played a great football game. They played hard. They
played smart.'' His Nittany Lions, the coach said, ``made
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game was Paterno's 400th as head coach for the Penn
State. This year's Nittany Lions finish the season with two
difficult Big Ten opponents. They play host to Michigan next week
and visit Michigan State on Nov. 20 in the season final.
</P>
<P>
   The stature of the Penn State defense was acknowledged before
the game with the announcement that two Nittany Lions, linebacker
LaVar Arrington and defensive end Courtney Brown, are among the
four candidates for the 1999 Lombardi Award, for the college
football lineman of the year. The other two finalists are Corey
Moore, a defensive end for Virginia Tech, and Corey Simon, a nose
guard for Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State scored on its first possession, a 57-yard drive that
culminated with a tackle-breaking 5-yard run by Mike Cerimele.
Minnesota cut the lead to 7-3 on a 29-yard field goal by Nystrom.
The biggest gain of the 57-yard drive was a scramble run by
Cockerham, who fled the pocket under pressure, threw a few fakes in
the open field and carried to the 4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   After the Penn State offense stalled, Paterno replaced the
starting quarterback, Kevin Thompson, with Rashard Casey, who
shares the job on a regular basis. But Casey's first effort was no
better, and he was sacked for a loss of 10 yards at his own 3-yard
line on the last series of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Gophers took a two-point lead on the first drive of the
second quarter, the scoring play a 25-yard touchdown pass from
Cockerham to Johnson, who outleaped two defenders in the end zone.
But Nystrom's extra-point attempt was wide, and the Minnesota lead
was only 9-7. The second quarter turned into a struggle of field
position, and Penn State got its break when Minnesota's Zach Vevea
failed to catch a pass on what would have been a first-down play on
third-and-7 from the Minnesota 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Gophers punted, and the Lions started their next
drive from the Minnesota 35. On the fourth play of the drive,
Thompson _ back in at quarterback _ faked a handoff into the line
and then passed to Bryant Johnson in the end zone for a 17-yard
scoring play. The point after made it 14-9 for Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third quarter, Minnesota took itself out of scoring
range when, on second and 13 from the Lions 18, a trick play lost
26 yards. Ron Johnson, who caught the first-half touchdown pass,
took a pitch in the backfield and was unable to pass or run
forward. The drive ended near midfield as Arrington made his 12th
tackle of the game, a career best. On the ensuing drive, Penn State
raised the lead to 17-9 when Forney kicked a 20-yard field goal
with 5:19 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gophers came upfield and scored a touchdown to cut the
Penn State lead to 17-15, the scoring play a 3-yard run by
Cockerham. The Gophers tried to tie with a two-point conversion,
with Cockerham passing to Hamner, but he was tackled at the goal
line without getting over.

   NAZRAN, Russia _ Late one recent sunny morning, the seven women
lying shoulder-to-shoulder in Ward 1 of the Sunzhenskaya District
Hospital grew quiet, turned inward, as doctors tended to the little
girl in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Several times a day, doctors come to change the dressings on
3-year-old Patima Ablusheva's face and shell-pink hands. When she
sees the doctors enter, she starts to cry. As they touch her and
try to soothe her, telling her how good and brave she is, she
begins to scream.
</P>
<P>
   She was badly burned when an aerial bomb exploded and set fire
to her house in Grozny, the Chechen capital, and she has been here
for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so bad for her when she first came here,'' said the
head nurse, Khadizhat Khairiyeva. ``Her face was so badly burned
she couldn't eat. She would always be crying because she was
hungry. She's better now. But we let her and her mother stay
because they have no place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has vowed that this latest war in Chechnya would be
different from the previous conflict, which ended in a stalemate in
1996 and led to about 30,000 deaths, mostly civilians. The
government has said its quarrel is only with the Islamic insurgents
of Chechnya, whom it also blames for terrorist attacks that have
killed about 300 people in Moscow and other Russian cities. The
government has promised unequivocal victory over the separatist
republic while avoiding civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   But Chechens who have fled here into Ingushetia, a neighboring
Russian republic, portray the situation as in some ways more
desperate than during the earlier war.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged Chechen woman lay a hand's breadth from Patima.
``Before,'' she said, ``we could run somewhere when they shot or
bombed.'' Her voice cracked into a sharp sob. ``Now, there is
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The wounded from Chechnya overwhelm the tiny Sunzhenskaya
Hospital, set behind a low wall and some juniper trees a few miles
from the border. Patients, most of them women, fill up the wards
and overflow onto iron cots in the dim, narrow hallways. Most leave
before they recover fully, making way for new victims.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-ager with hollow eyes sat propped against a wall,
surrounded by her aunts. A blanket pulled up to her shoulder
slipped, revealing that the right sleeve of her sweater was gray
and limp. Her legs, too, had been amputated. Neither she nor her
relatives wanted to talk to a visiting reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Mallika Adullayeva, 30, once a schoolteacher, and her sister,
Sotsita, were in two beds on the stair landing below the roof.
Afraid of air raids, they had lived for days in a basement in the
town of Samashki. On Oct. 26, they emerged to buy some bread. A
rocket exploded in their yard, they said, and left them with
shrapnel in their hips and sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the previous war, they would warn us about an attack,''
Mallika Adullayeva said. ``Before, the rebels fought back,'' her
sister said, ``but now there are no fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Civilians say that Russian gunships and artillery pound their
villages, which the government denies. Attacks on civilians
occurred in the last war, too, but this time, refugees have only
one exit. Borders to all neighboring states except Ingushetia have
been closed. The Ingushetia border itself was sealed for 10 days,
trapping tens of thousands inside Chechnya until international
pressure on Russia pried it open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war is completely different from the last one,'' said
Leche Ansarov, 40, a resident of Grozny. He was waiting in a
traffic jam at the border to get back into Chechnya in hopes of
retrieving his family. ``Then, there were some kind of corridors.
Now they surround you and want to destroy every living thing in
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   If he gets back to Grozny and finds his house deserted, he said,
``What else can I do but take up arms?''
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Djembulat Asmayev has lost everything he had, twice. His
parents were killed in the last conflict. He and his five siblings
lived with relatives during that war and then entered a Grozny
orphanage. Lately, life had gradually become normal: The children
went to school, the boys played soccer afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sept. 28, the orphanage was evacuated to the Komarov
Young Pioneers camp outside Nazran, a Soviet-era retreat for
children. Russian helicopters patrol the neighboring fields. In one
cabin, the children, dressed in dirty sweatshirts and Nike caps,
gathered around a television, mesmerized by a cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bombed Grozny with rockets,'' Djembulat said. He is small
for his age, with a shock of chestnut hair falling over his eyes.
``I don't know why Russia wants this war. The Russian people aren't
guilty. Everyone is so mixed up. The soldiers aren't to blame
They're ordered to do what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked evenly and quietly, all the while turning a coppery
rifle bullet over and over in his hand. ``We're so angry,'' he
said, his voice barely rising, ``but we don't know at whom _ who's
guilty for all this.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WITTENBERG, Germany _ On March 15, 1960, an 18-year-old German
girl and her younger brother boarded a train here to escape East
German communism for the West. But police were patrolling and the
girl, convinced they could not make it together, pushed the boy off
the train as it started to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police were asking me who I was, where I was going, why I was
traveling, and I realized we were too suspicious as a pair,'' said
Heidi Boettcher, now an American citizen. ``My brother was just 16.
I was sure he would join me later.''
</P>
<P>
   But the nudge that left the boy, Hans Schulz-Netzer, marooned at
Wittenberg station led to permanently divided lives. One was long
lived in the Soviet bloc, the other in rural Missouri. By the time
the Berlin Wall fell a decade ago, Hans and Heidi stood at opposite
poles in the basic post-Cold-War debate of Western societies.
</P>
<P>
   That debate no longer concerns the merits of capitalism, a
system without ideological rival since communism collapsed. Rather,
it centers on the differing European and American views of how far
capitalism should be regulated in order to cushion people from the
harshness of market forces.
</P>
<P>
   A German without job prospects, Hans favors enveloping social
protection. An American with a convert's zeal, Heidi wants ``the
government out of my face.'' Hans sees his sister as ``way over to
the political right.'' Heidi views her brother as the victim of a
German system ``that still assumes people are so dumb they need to
be taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   German unification without German neutrality was a great Western
achievement, but the economic toll was also great. Over the past
decade, the decision to extend state pensions, unemployment
benefits and all West Germany's elaborate social programs to 17
million new citizens has precipitated a crisis in Europe's largest
welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, a once envied ``social market'' model is now
carrying more weight than it can bear. Schulz-Netzer, 56, is part
of the burden. He has been collecting about $825 a month in
unemployment benefits for the past two years. His wife, Karin, 55,
gets another $600. Karin's daughter, also unemployed, receives some
more.
</P>
<P>
   That money has to come from somewhere, free lunches being as
scarce in Germany as anywhere else. The taxes and charges needed to
finance all the social cushioning have pushed up wage costs and so
deterred hiring. Long Europe's engine, Germany has stalled, unable
to dent 10 percent unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   This crisis does not surprise Mrs. Boettcher, 58, who is married
to a farmer in Missouri, a state with a 4 percent unemployment
rate. ``If you want to work, I don't give a damn, you find work,''
she said, laughing. ``But Germans are sheep. Why should my brother
think for himself if money is being thrown at him?''
</P>
<P>
   Having raised 11 children since arriving in the United States in
1961, she has now started a small business _ a day nursery for
infants. Charging a daily rate of $11 a child and on the move from
morning to night, she makes a little more than her brother's family
receives from the German state for doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to see in Mrs. Boettcher's dynamism and her
German brother's passivity facile symbols of American vitality and
German self-doubt, of the vigor of the New World and the late
middle age of the Old. But the divisions of the post-Cold-War era
are more nuanced than that.
</P>
<P>
   Germans in general reject unmitigated ``Americanization''; if
that is the sum of Cold War victory, they tend to say, no thanks.
To the millions of American jobs created this decade, some respond
that Germany has free health care, free universities, smaller
prison populations, streets free of the homeless: capitalism
tempered by equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could benefit a lot by being more American,'' said Norbert
Walter, chief economist for Deutsche Bank. ``We should apply the
market economy instead of being a museum of Western socialism. But
Americans only need to take a look at their inner cities to see
they might also learn a little from Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boettchers had 11 children between 1964 and 1984 on their
100-acre Altenburg, Mo., farm. In Germany, this would have provided
them with something close to a living. The state pays
``kindergeld,'' or child money, for every child regardless of
parents' income. The idea is to encourage child-bearing and support
families.
</P>
<P>
   At a rate of 250 marks per child for the first two children, 300
for the third and 350 for each subsequent one, the Boettchers would
have been entitled to about $2,000 a month from German authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States they received nothing. ``I never could
bring myself to sit in a county office and ask for some handout
like food stamps,'' Mrs. Boettcher said. ``I know where that kind
of thing leads.''
</P>
<P>
   For 16 years after Hans Shultz-Netzer's birth in 1943, he and
his sister grew up in the same Wittenberg home. But they are so
different now, shaped by opposing cultures, that this shared past
seems infinitely remote.
</P>
<P>
   He is full of the caution, the fatalism, the unspoken fears of
Germany; she seems to have been freed of them by a wide-open
continent. ``In God We Trust,'' says the dollar bill, but Germans
have every reason to be suspicious of God's benevolence.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, its traumatic past explains the country's social
safety net. In West Germany, after hyperinflation and Hitler,
social cohesion was worth almost any price. In the East, free day
care centers and regular visits by doctors and dentists to schools
were billed as the gifts of socialism; they also helped secure
compliance to a police state.
</P>
<P>
   But the world has changed. Germany has ceased to be the
treacherous epicenter of the Cold War. It desperately needs more
risk-taking: 8.4 percent of the American adult population has
started a business, against 2.2 percent in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The country's essential difficulty since 1989 has been in
convincing people it might be worthwhile to trade some of the old
and no-longer-affordable security for the rewards of risk.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Schulz-Netzer seems stuck with the old habits. Can-do
is not his motto. For decades he worked in a state company
repairing increasingly obsolete buses. It was dull and repetitive;
it was also absolutely secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get used to things,'' he said, shrugging. ``We had movies,
we had television, we had cars of a sort, and we even had our own
little Florida on the Baltic.''
</P>
<P>
   Was anything missing? He pondered the question for some time.
``Well, we had no incentive to be self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the social line here,'' Schulz-Netzer said. ``In fact,
in many ways, we thought of the old regime as good.''

   Richard Jacobs, who sold the Indians last week to Larry Dolan,
will be remembered as the owner under whom the team underwent a
stunning revival. He will also be remembered as an owner who wanted
a more activist commissioner. When the New York Mets signed Dwight
Gooden to a three-year contract for $13.45 million in 1991, Jacobs
urged Fay Vincent, then the commissioner, to fine the Mets for
giving Gooden so much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm furious,'' Jacobs said when he telephoned Vincent. ``How
can you let that happen? You should fine them. We need a
commissioner who will take action.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year and a half later, Jacobs was part of the
ownership group that forced Vincent out.

   For their meetings this week, the general managers are staying
in $400-a-night hotel suites. ``It doesn't make sense in our
economy to meet where the rate is $400,'' one general manager said.
Added another: ``In baseball, we pay lots of money for pitchers and
hotel rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL ECONOMICS
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin, the Texas general manager, who triggered the
superstar trade action by sending Juan Gonzalez to Detroit last
week, said agents don't want to name a price when they are
negotiating a contract. `` `Market value,' they say,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   So what is market value these days? Is it the $13 million a year
of Mike Piazza, the $15 million a year of Kevin Brown, or the $12.5
million a year of Bernie Williams and Larry Walker? It's not the
last figure, because Jim Bronner, Gonzalez's agent, indicated that
wouldn't do the job, Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps market value has been established by the Seattle
Mariners' offers to Ken Griffey Jr. ($16 million a year for eight
years) and Alex Rodriguez ($17.25 million a year for eight years).
But neither player plans to accept the offers, so maybe they don't
set the market either. Do we hear $20 million?
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners' brain trust meets with Griffey and he
tells them he wants to be traded to a team closer to his home. They
meet with Rodriguez and he tells them he wants to stay, at least
until his contract runs out after next season. That might work for
Rodriguez, but it doesn't work for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't work for the Mariners either: Rodriguez says if
they do trade him this off-season, he won't sign a new contract
with his new team; he'll become a free agent next year. The
shortstop's stance makes it more difficult for the Mariners to
trade him, but they will most likely try.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has taken a different approach. ``If a trade is worked
out, he'll be open-minded,'' said Brian Goldberg, who is Griffey's
agent. ``He's not saying he'll sign right away or test free agency.
But he'll look at it and see how he likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   The line forms to the left.
</P>
<P>
   HE COULD LOOK IT UP
</P>
<P>
   If Pete Rose, as he has said recently, has really never seen the
evidence baseball investigators compiled 10 years ago in their
inquiry into allegations that he gambled on baseball games, the
Internet has just what he's looking for. All Rose has to do is
click on DowdReport.com, and he'll have before his eyes the very
report compiled by John Dowd, the Washington lawyer who was
baseball's chief investigator.
</P>
<P>
   The report has all the evidence Rose would want to see.
``Recently,'' Dowd writes, ``there has been much renewed interest
in the Dowd Report and in Pete Rose's lifetime banishment from
baseball. I am making the Dowd Report and the agreement signed by
Pete Rose and Commissioner Giamatti available in this forum so that
the public may draw its own conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowd's Web site also includes a statement Commissioner Bart
Giamatti read Aug. 24, 1989, the day he announced Rose's
banishment. It undermines a contention Rose has made that he never
had a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``By choosing not to come to a hearing before me,'' Giamatti
said, ``and by choosing not to proffer any testimony or evidence
contrary to the evidence and information contained in the report of
the Special Counsel to the Commissioner, Rose has accepted
baseball's ultimate sanction, lifetime ineligibility.''

TV STAR WILLIAM DANIELS OUSTS INCUMBENT TO HEAD ACTORS UNION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild has elected William Daniels, an
award-winning television star, as its president in an upset victory
over the incumbent, Richard Masur.
</P>
<P>
   The guild announced on Friday that Daniels received 10,008
votes, while Masur received 8,972. A third candidate,
Angeltompkins, who changed her name from Angel Tompkins, making her
the first candidate listed on the ballot, received 2,015 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who acknowledged that he had had little union
experience, will take over one of the nation's most visible labor
organizations, one that has been led by Ronald Reagan, Ed Asner,
Charlton Heston and James Cagney. The guild represents 99,000 film
and television actors.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who plays Mr. Feeny on the ABC sitcom ``Boy Meets
World,'' defeated Masur after a hard-hitting campaign in which both
sides relied heavily on Web sites and in which Masur repeatedly
threatened to sue supporters of Daniels for defamation.
</P>
<P>
   The race split the union, with prominent actors lining up behind
the two top candidates. Several actors attributed Daniels' victory
to frustrations among younger, less-successful actors.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who accused Masur of being a soft toward the industry,
repeatedly charged that actors have been shortchanged during the
entertainment industry's boom and have not shared adequately in the
growth in cable television and foreign sales.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that hit home with many actors was Daniels' assertion
that cable television residuals were too low.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, a 72-year-old Brooklyn native, won two Emmy awards for
playing Dr. Mark Craig on the television drama ``St. Elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Masur, 50, who was seeking his third two-year term, has appeared
in several films, including ``The Man Without a Face,'' ``My Girl''
and ``Six Degrees of Separation.
</P>
<P>
   A little-known actress, Lisa Scarola, 28, was elected president
of the guild's New York City branch, which represents about 25,000
actors, defeating the incumbent, Mel Boudrot.

IN HINDSIGHT, THE BEST AND WORST TRADES OF LAST OFF - SEASON
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-NOTEBOOK) 
(rk) 
 By   MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The off-season had hardly begun when the Texas Rangers traded
Juan Gonzalez to the Detroit Tigers. Last off-season only one
player of that magnitude, Roger Clemens, was traded. The Gonzalez
deal last week could be the harbinger of a whole string of swaps
involving major players.
</P>
<P>
   With general managers convening Sunday in Dana Point, Calif.,
for their annual week of meetings, five weeks ahead of baseball's
winter meetings, talk will be plentiful. Some of it _ maybe much of
it _ will be fanciful. The spiciest topics of conversation will be
Ken Griffey Jr., Shawn Green, Carlos Delgado and maybe Alex
Rodriguez and Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   But before the general managers start tossing too many names and
bodies around, this would be a good time to look back at their
efforts a year ago and see which trades worked well and which
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Trades made during the winter of 1998-99 can be judged on the
impact they had on the teams or on their one-sided nature.
Obviously, when minor-league prospects were included in a deal, it
can't be judged on the long term until the prospects establish
themselves or fail to make it.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of 1999 results, the New York Mets, the Cincinnati
Reds and the Arizona Diamondbacks made the trades that had the
greatest impact on their success. The Pittsburgh Pirates made the
trade that produced the best performance in relation to what they
gave up. The trade that produced the worst results for both sides
involved the Mets and the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were also on the wrong side of the most one-sided
trade, as developments would show. It was made Dec. 1 and was a
three-team transaction between the Mets, Dodgers and Orioles in
which the Mets acquired Armando Benitez and Roger Cedeno and gave
up Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno was a revelation to the Mets, hitting .313 and stealing
66 bases. Benitez, firing his demon fastball past batters, assumed
the closer's role after John Franco was injured and played a major
role in the team's drive, albeit tortured, to the playoffs. Benitez
finished with 22 saves, a 1.85 earned run average, a .148
opponents' batting average and 128 strikeouts in 78 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mets had a $91 million catcher in Mike Piazza, they
sought to shed Hundley. The Dodgers took him. In addition to
Cedeno, they gave up Charles Johnson, a good defensive catcher, in
the trade, and expected a productive catcher to play in his place.
But Hundley batted .207 and struck out 113 times in 114 games. His
24 home runs were not enough to overcome the hitting deficiencies.
His throwing still suffered from an elbow operation in September
1997: opponents stole 107 bases against him in 139 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was put together in just one week, Steve Phillips, the
Mets' general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had talked to a number of teams about Todd,'' Phillips
related. ``It came down to just the Dodgers and the Orioles being
interested in him. A few teams said they had interest but wanted to
wait until spring training. We didn't want to wait until the
spring, when we thought there could be a circus atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked with the Dodgers, Phillips knew they were talking
to the Orioles about Johnson. Knowing the Orioles sought a catcher,
he talked to them about Hundley. They came close to a deal,
Phillips said; in fact, he said, they actually had a tentative
deal. But it fell apart. Back to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to construct the three-way deal,'' Phillips
related. ``First we worked out our deal with the Dodgers, then
turned around and began negotiations with the Orioles to see what
they'd give us for Johnson. We knew we wanted Benitez. We concluded
Hundley for Johnson and then turned Johnson around for Benitez.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' successful trade had its genesis two weeks before
spring training. Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager, gained
permission to add a few dollars to his smallish payroll. He
targeted Greg Vaughn and his $5.75 million salary ($850,000
deferred without interest) and acquired him from San Diego for
Reggie Sanders, an outfielder not in the team's plans, and Damian
Jackson, an infielder in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   Without Vaughn, the Reds would not have had the surprisingly
good season that took them one victory short of the playoffs. He
led he team with 45 home runs and 118 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' successful deal brought them Luis Gonzalez,
who led the team with a .336 batting average and also contributed
26 home runs and 111 RBI. He epitomized the surprisingly strong
Diamondbacks, and all he cost them in the trade with Detroit was a
young outfielder, Karim Garcia, who batted .240 in 96 games.
</P>
<P>
   For offensive production, though, the Pirates made the best
deal. It brought them Brian Giles, and the Pirates got him from
hitting-rich Cleveland for a reliever, Ricardo Rincon. Giles batted
.315, clouted 39 home runs and drove in 115 runs, numbers that
would have been higher had he not lost the last two weeks with a
broken finger.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates made another trade that sent Jon Lieber, one of
their starting pitchers, to the Cubs for Brant Brown, an
outfielder. Brown was a disappointment for the Pirates, and Lieber
compiled a mediocre 10-11 record for Chicago. But those 10
victories made Lieber the Cubs' No. 1 starter.
</P>
<P>
   For absence of achievement, though, no trade came close to
another swap the Mets and the Dodgers made. The Mets gave the
Dodgers Mel Rojas, once a capable reliever; they received Bobby
Bonilla, once a productive hitter. Rojas appeared in only five
games for the Dodgers before they released him. Bonilla remains a
member of the Mets, his .160 batting average testimony to a gamble
gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we talked about at the end of season,''
Phillips said, ``the logic being we needed to add offense. To make
it work within the confines of our payroll, we knew we had to shift
Mel's contract and hope to catch lightning in a bottle. I'm not
sure there was a dissenting voice in the entire group: the people
on the field, in the front office and the owners.''

IN MOTHER'S HOME, POLICE FIND BODY OF GIRL MISSING 20 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 60-year-old woman who neighbors said often
complained of hearing the phantom cries of a baby at night was
arrested Saturday after the police discovered her young daughter's
body in her Brooklyn apartment, wrapped in plastic and hidden in a
footlocker. The woman was charged with murdering the girl, who
disappeared 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Police said officers made the discovery inside Madelyn
Carmichael's apartment around 7:40 p.m. Friday, after a man
approached them with information about the girl's disappearance.
While Ms. Carmichael has no criminal record, police said records
from the Administration for Children's Services showed her to have
a history of child abuse, with two of her other three children
placed in foster care long ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of those children, now a young man who showed up at Ms.
Carmichael's building three weeks ago, was the slain girl's twin
brother, police said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the body of the girl, Latinisha Carmichael, who
appeared to be about 3 or 4, was found in a closet strewn with
incense sticks, air fresheners and baking soda boxes. The body had
been wrapped in a baby blanket, put inside four plastic bags,
wrapped in newspaper from Nov. 4, 1979, and placed in a footlocker
with boxes of mothballs. That locker had been wrapped in cellophane
and put inside another plastic-wrapped footlocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started opening the closet, she became agitated and it
seemed she might be going into a seizure, so we had a paramedic
give her oxygen,'' said Capt. Ray Ferrari, citywide commander of
the Cold Case Squad, which investigates long-dormant homicide
cases. ``My impression was that she realized it was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the building on Rockaway Parkway said they were
stunned to hear of the arrest of Ms. Carmichael, a woman in ill
health who was known for her kindness to neighborhood children but
who had also often complained about hearing babies crying or
children playing when there were none.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carmichael had suffered a stroke, was on a pacemaker and had
recently been found to have bone cancer, they said, adding that she
would often reward children with presents on Christmas or after
they did errands for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the words to express how shocked I am,'' said
Johana Rivera, the building superintendent for 15 years. ``She was
a very nice lady. She would sometimes complain about those noises
but I never thought there would be anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant superintendent Madeline Ramos said Ms. Carmichael
often called her son to get groceries for her and that she herself
had spend a lot of time in the woman's apartment fixing things.
While the one-bedroom apartment seemed to be in perpetual disarray,
with footlockers stacked in every corner and plastic wrapped
knickknacks piled on shelves around every room, she said, there was
no hint that a body might have been hidden among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place never had any odor and there was nothing that seemed
crazy about her,'' she said. ``I mean, we never suspected
anything.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The police investigation began three weeks ago, about the same
time that a young man named Andre showed up at the building looking
for Ms. Carmichael and saying he was her son. Unable to reach her,
Ms. Rivera took the man's phone number and said she would pass it
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he had been adopted many years ago and that he
just wanted to see her,'' she said. Ms. Rivera added that he never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, Andre was Latinisha's twin brother and
one of the two children who had been taken away by officials in the
early 1980s because of complaints that she had been beating them.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth child, an older boy, apparently had remained in her
care and still visited her often, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Ms. Carmichael's husband appeared to have vanished
shortly after Andre and Latinisha were born at another apartment a
few blocks away. They added that they believe Ms. Carmichael killed
the child there and then took the body with her to the new
apartment when she moved nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not say whether Andre had alerted them to the
presence of the body, saying only that Andre and Ms. Carmichael's
living daughter, who was one of the children placed in foster care,
had been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Police took Ms. Rivera with them when they arrived on Friday
night to search Ms. Carmichael's apartment. Ms. Rivera said that
Ms. Carmichael always left a note on the front door saying:
``Please respect the wishes of this tenant. Please don't pound on
the door or knock on this apartment door.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carmichael at first didn't know why the police had come.
``She thought it was about a noise complaint,'' Ferrari said,
adding that when the officers sat her down and explained the search
warrant, ``She ran toward the bedroom where the body was.''
</P>
<P>
   She began to hyperventilate as the officers opened the door and,
according to Ms. Rivera, started yelling. She screamed, ``Please
don't let them take me! I don't want any more suffering! Please
just let me die!'' Ms. Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Carmichael was taken to Kings County Hospital by a
waiting ambulance, detectives slowly peeled open the footlockers in
the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, as Ms. Rivera thought back to her tenant, her
recollections of Ms. Carmichael's kindness and obsessions took on a
more critical tone. Ms. Carmichael had once given her a baby doll
she said had belonged to her daughter, Ms. Rivera said, adding that
the woman made her promise to never give it away.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was their last meeting before Ms. Carmichael's
arrest, when she came again Friday morning to complain about the
constant noise of the baby that no one thought existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said he had been crying all night, that it was screaming
and wouldn't let her sleep,'' Ms. Rivera said. ``But there was only
an old man living above her. There are no babies on that side of
the building.''

AFTER COMPLAINTS BY ACTOR, GROUP WILL SUE TAXI PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three days after the actor Danny Glover protested
that he had been passed by and treated rudely by New York City
cabdrivers, state Sen. David Paterson and the Rev. Al Sharpton said
Saturday that they were organizing a class-action lawsuit charging
the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission with racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a group of minority officers in the New York City
Police Department, 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement, said Saturday
that it had launched a campaign within the department to persuade
officers on the street to devote more attention to the civil rights
of those seeking taxis, and to issue summonses to taxi drivers who
illegally pass by black and Hispanic customers.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in his Harlem headquarters, Sharpton said the
episodes described earlier in the week by Glover reflected a form
of bias that is common among taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Glover had staged a news conference, saying that he, his
daughter and a friend of his daughter's had been ignored by several
cabs, and that one driver who stopped had refused him access to the
front seat of the taxi, even though Glover is more than 6 feet
tall, has a bad hip and is entitled under taxi industry rules to
stretch out in the front.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Sharpton nor Paterson said what penalties and
policy changes they hoped to obtain by filing a lawsuit, they said
they were preparing fliers to be circulated throughout the city,
asking people who feel they have been discriminated against by taxi
drivers to join as plaintiffs in the class-action court filing.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Allan
Fromberg, declined to comment Saturday on either the threatened
lawsuit or the campaign proposed by the minority police group.
</P>
<P>
   But he defended the agency's efforts to root out racial
discrimination by cabdrivers, which include fines and the use of
undercover agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't simply wait until people complain,'' he said. ``We
take pro-active steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the Harlem meeting, a mostly black group of a
little more than 100 people, appeared to agree that bias among taxi
drivers was widespread.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by Sharpton how many in the group could recall
cabbies refusing to be hailed, almost everyone in the room raised a
hand.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Ramona Whaley, a board member of the Taxi and
Limousine Commission, who said in an interview, ``Of course I have
been passed by.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the threatened lawsuit against her own commission ``a
great thing,'' she said its current civil rights regulatory policy
``glosses over'' complaints of racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   Paterson, a Harlem resident who is blind, and who has complained
in the past about his difficulties in hailing cabs, said he had
been ``forced out'' of cabs more than 100 times after he told the
driver that his destination was Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the minority police officers' group, who held a news
conference Saturday in Lower Manhattan, said their proposal to
increase police surveillance of taxi drivers falls within
department guidelines, since any driver who refuses to be hailed
because of a customer's race violates city and federal law, as well
as regulations of the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the Giuliani administration has been successful in
stamping out squeegee men and other types of crime, but has ignored
this problem,'' said Eric Adams, one of the police group's
founders, referring to the administration of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said that officers on patrol would be encouraged to
monitor cabdrivers' responses when they are hailed by minorities,
and if the drivers fail to stop, issue summonses.
</P>
<P>
   Fromberg said the Taxi and Limousine Commission would continue
to employ ``Operation Refusal,'' an undercover tactic in which
agents, many of them black or Hispanic, are dispatched across the
city to hail cabs and pose as customers.
</P>
<P>
   When the cabbies fail to stop, or refuse to drive to the
customer's desired destination, they are fined. In the case of
repeat violators, their taxi licenses are revoked, Fromberg said.

N.T.R.A. IS WARNED BY STRONACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ On racing's banner day of the year, Frank
Stronach took the stage at Gulfstream Park, which he bought last
summer, and issued a warning to the National Thoroughbred Racing
Associations to reform itself or face more defections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketing idea of the NTRA is good,'' Stronach said, ``but
it has veered in so many different directions. And you must have
proper procedures for electing your boards, and not simply
appointing people. Until that is done, I will not give any money to
the NTRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach, the Canadian businessman who has bought five race
tracks in the United States in recent months, has become the most
powerful executive in thoroughbred racing. He paid $87 million this
week to add Golden Gate Fields near San Francisco to his holdings,
which include Santa Anita, Gulfstream, Thistledown in Ohio and
Remington Park in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   His Magna Ventures company started as the maker of automotive
parts, and now employs 60,000 people worldwide. He has been a
successful owner of race horses, too, and he has expanded his
horizons by buying tracks and scouting others.
</P>
<P>
   But he has made threats to the NTRA that he would withdraw his
tracks from membership unless changes were initiated.
</P>
<P>
   The association was set up more than a year ago to unify the
racing business, especially its marketing activities, and operates
as a ``league office'' under a commissioner, Tim Smith, and seven
hand-picked vice presidents. But the association has come under
criticism for its money-raising methods and lately for its efforts
to establish a television gambling hub that some tracks find
competitive with their own betting systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in racing have failed to recognize that racing is
entertainment,'' Stronach said at a news conference before the
Breeders' Cup races were run. ``If Las Vegas had stayed with just
gambling, it wouldn't be here today. We must provide the
environment for families. Of course, simulcasting is important. But
if we ignore live racing, this business would not survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his intentions in yielding his tracks' membership in
the NTRA, he said: ``The NTRA doesn't have the investment that the
tracks do. They must come back to us with clearly defined rules on
electing officers and boards. Unless they do, I will not continue
to give it any more money. And ultimately, my priority is to get
the product right. I don't want to do advertising unless I've got
the product.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Stronach has criticized the association for
spending too much money on overhead. He said Saturday that he
refused to belong to a ``club'' that offered him no choices.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Smith later issued the following statement on Stronach's
remarks: ``This is a day when the focus should be on the
competition and the great champions here to compete. There will be
ample time to address Mr. Stronach's concerns, and we hope to have
further discussions in the coming weeks.''

REAL ESTATE: KEEPING BUILDINGS FRAUD-FREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is one thing that has been proved by the
indictments in Manhattan of more than 200 construction-industry and
management companies and individuals over the last six years, it is
that as long as there are cookies on the counter, there will always
be new hands creeping toward the cookie jar.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau
announced that 24 construction companies and 31 individuals had
entered guilty pleas to charges of engaging in kickback and
bid-rigging schemes in the interior building industry. That was in
addition to 74 guilty pleas after similar charges were filed
against 80 managing agents and four companies in 1995, and to
unresolved indictments in June of 24 management companies and 58
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these scandals, co-op and condominium boards have
been putting increased emphasis on developing methods of keeping
clients out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, you don't get second chances,'' said Errol
Brett, a Manhattan co-op lawyer who has made it his business to
publish the names of all indicted individuals and companies in the
newsletter he circulates to clients. ``And when you plead guilty to
a crime, as far as I'm concerned, you don't get another chance at
bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett said that it was now his practice to have managing agents
and companies serving buildings he represents provide written
warranties that they have not been the subject of any criminal
investigations. Those who cannot provide such a warranty end up on
Brett's ``wouldn't touch them with a 10-foot-pole'' list, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always other firms out there who are willing and
able to handle your business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Greenstein, another Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that
some of his client boards were bypassing middlemen when looking for
vendors and contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my buildings are now going outside management for one
or two references,'' he said. He added that he usually advised
boards to ask the principals of any companies the board is
contemplating hiring whether they have ever been involved in any
criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives
and Condominiums, said that he now required vendors and contractors
entering contracts with his client buildings to include in the
contract a representation that the company has not received or paid
anything to anyone in return for getting the contract.
</P>
<P>
   He also includes a provision requiring the contractor to forfeit
the entire face amount of the contract if it turns out that such a
representation was false.
</P>
<P>
   Such a provision is essential, Saft said, because it seems
inevitable that at least some buildings will end up having to do
business with companies that have been involved in the corruption
scandal _ including some who may have been indicted but have
pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The clock is ticking on next year's deadline for Local Law 11
work,'' Saft said. His reference was to New York City's revised
facade inspection law that requires the inspection _ and perhaps
the repair _ of many building facades that were not inspected under
Local Law 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means you have some sides of many buildings that haven't
been looked at in 70 years that now have to be inspected by the end
of 2000,'' he said. ``And just as we're dealing with that, they
indict some of the more reliable waterproofing contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies whose reputations were unblemished by the
corruption investigation have taken a proactive approach to keeping
them that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken the position that we have to start from ground
zero and create a whole new way of doing business,'' said James
O'Connor, a senior vice president for Insignia Residential Group,
New York City's largest property management company.
</P>
<P>
   He said that among the new strategies his company was employing
to protect client buildings were rigorous new bidding procedures
and a vetting process for eliminating contractors and vendors with
questionable credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've developed a system of using multiple rounds of sealed
bidding with as many prequalified vendors as we can find,'' he
said, adding that names of vendors were solicited from engineers,
architects, co-op and condominium board members, board lawyers and
managers who handle buildings in other parts of the city. ``When
there are too few people involved in the process,'' he said,
``you're creating the opportunity for collusion.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   O'Connor said that the ``prequalification'' process included
conducting a background search of all potential bidders, using
whatever legal means are necessary to determine whether company
officials have been involved in any wrongdoing in the past. ``There
are all sorts of interrelationships out there today,'' O'Connor
said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he noted, many lawyers and managers say some
firms and individuals implicated in the scandal simply closed up
shop for a time and then resurfaced with new company names.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, O'Connor said, Insignia hopes to capitalize on the fact
that those tarnished by the scandal _ but who nevertheless have
reputations for providing quality, on-time work _ may now be
willing to offer those quality services at bargain-basement prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys know that boards are looking at them
sideways and they're now saying: `We've learned our lesson, just
give us another chance at your business and we'll come in at the
right price,''' O'Connor said. ``And while we certainly wouldn't
advance money to these companies as readily as we would have in the
past, it could make sense to hire a bad guy at a good price to get
competent work done in the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, O'Connor said, for large contracts his company is now
recommending that boards hire construction managers to assume the
oversight role typically played by architects and engineers in many
residential construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   For while an engineer or architect may be able to address the
technical aspects of a major construction project, he explained,
they are not necessarily adept at handling purchasing, scheduling
and the tricky relationships among various tradesmen, union
workers, city officials and building residents during a complicated
construction project.
</P>
<P>
   While hiring a construction manager can add anywhere from 5
percent to 20 percent to the cost of a project, O'Connor said, a
responsible manager keeping a careful eye on contractors and
vendors is often the least expensive insurance policy a board with
a major project can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in business today knows that if you screw up now,
after all that's gone on, you're done for good,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>

buildings against fraud and corruption can be found at the Council
of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums' Web site at

ON ONE QUEENS BLOCK, MANY PRAYERS ARE SPOKEN
</HEADLINE>

 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is an ordinary Sunday morning on Bowne Street.
</P>
<P>
   A flock of Hindu worshippers parades down the avenue with the
bust of an elephant-headed deity in tow. Half a block up, joyful
music emerges from a storefront that serves as a Sikh gurdwara, and
across the street, a member of a Chinese evangelical church mutters
disapprovingly about the double-parking proclivities of the
templegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down Bowne Street, the faithful fill their own
sanctuaries, improbably ignorant, it seems, of who worships what
around them. Half a block up, another Hindu temple has been
fashioned out of a lime-green wood-frame house, and a third sits
farther along, opposite a once-bustling Orthodox synagogue that now
rents its parking lot to the Chinese evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Still farther north, English-speaking parishioners of a
150-year-old Protestant church empty out to make room for a
Taiwanese-language service that follows. Nestled in the leafy
blocks in between are a mosque, two Buddhist temples and several
churches, including an African Methodist Episcopal parish that was
once a stop on the Underground Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the heart of Flushing, N.Y., in Queens County, along and
around a street named after John Bowne, the Colonial-era icon of
religious freedom, this is what religious pluralism has come to:
tolerance amid mutual indifference and the occasional dust-ups over
parking.
</P>
<P>
   R. Scott Hanson, a doctoral student who has been studying
religious diversity on Bowne Street, calls it ``one of the most
extreme cases, if not the most extreme case, of religious
plurality'' anywhere. He has found about 40 houses of worship in a
square-mile area around Bowne Street.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Bowne (rhymes with brown) Street tells the story of
faith in Flushing. For much of this century, the neighborhood has
had a typical assortment of churches and synagogues, their pews
filled mostly with people from the area. But in recent years, as
immigrants from Taiwan, Korea and the Indian subcontinent have made
Flushing their home, new churches, temples, mosques and gurdwaras
have sprouted on practically every block, transforming the
neighborhood into a magnet for people of many faiths.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as older white residents have moved out of
Flushing, some have seen their memberships plummet. The Kissena
Jewish Center, for instance, is a shell of what it was in the early
1960s, when Orthodox Jews lived in the neighborhood and could walk
to it. Meanwhile, the Free Synagogue of Flushing, a Reform temple
on nearby Kissena Boulevard, rents out its worship hall to a Korean
Presbyterian congregation on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, immigration has wrought profound changes in the
number and variety of groups. In Queens, the number of tax-exempt
properties held by religious organizations climbed to 2,316 in 1998
from 1,935 in 1990, according to the city finance department.
</P>
<P>
   Religion has always been a vital part of immigrant life. That is
one of the reasons the United States remains one of the most
religious nations in the world, where some 40 percent of the
populace claim to attend religious services, according to scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immigration experience itself is extremely unsettling,''
said Stephen Warner, a sociologist at the University of Illinois
who studies religion in immigrant life. ``Religion is the most
available source we have for answers to the why question.''
</P>
<P>
   There are practical reasons, too, that religious institutions
can be vital to immigrant communities
</P>
<P>
   At churches and temples, newcomers find tips to navigate the new
country. Established immigrants find ways to school their American
children in the rituals of their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this zeal more evident than in Flushing, where there
are more than 100 Korean churches alone. Just off Bowne Street sits
one of the largest: the 3,500-member Korean American Presbyterian
Church.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bowne Street Community Church, the Taiwanese who once
worshipped in a back room of the church now make up half the
congregation, and the Taiwanese clergyman, the Rev. Norman Chang,
is now the senior pastor.
</P>
<P>
   On nearby Geranium Street, the Muslim Center of New York has
grown to 500 families from a clutch of 50 in 1975. It now has a new
$3.5 million mosque, an elementary school serving 100 children and
evening classes on the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Hindu temple that organizes the annual procession
for Ganesha, the elephant-headed icon who is believed to bring
success to his devotees, has grown nearly tenfold since its
inception 22 years ago. The temple draws $2 million in revenues a
year, and an estimated 3,000 worshippers pour into the sanctuary
for prayers, language classes and lessons in Hindu scripture every
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there are even occasional organized efforts to reach
across religious lines, like a nascent interfaith coalition that
has begun among Jewish and Asian-American Christian clergy. For the
most part, says Hanson, the doctoral student studying religious
pluralism, there are those who are content to worship among their
own and leave the others alone. ``Sort of live and let live,'' he
says.

A HIGHWAY THAT SAYS THIS, THIS IS NEW JERSEY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.J.)   (jw)

<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. _ Every car owner eventually meets that one road
in life with a personality that must be confronted or avoided,
cajoled or negotiated on a daily basis. The Long Island Expressway
is like the customer service representative who is supposed to help
but always manages to tie you up in knots.
</P>
<P>
   The Cross County Parkway is like that sweet neighbor who
suddenly turns ugly, then sweet again, without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no road has a personality as widely known as the New
Jersey Turnpike, the service entrance to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The turnpike is the fast lane to New Jersey's inferiority
complex. It is everything everybody else says about New Jersey _
paved, crowded, smelly in the summer, bleak in the winter, a
passage to somewhere more desirable.
</P>
<P>
   When New Jersey was a dumping ground, the turnpike was its
loading dock. When racial profiling was still an official state
secret, the turnpike was its prime hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that the Turnpike Authority's plan to put
the first advertising billboards on turnpike land has caused some
soul-searching. The authority rationally decided that since
billboards on private land were already visible from the turnpike,
why not make money by erecting its own billboards and renting them?
The plan is to build eight two-sided billboards in the stretch
between Elizabeth and the Vince Lombardi service area, hardly the
Loire Valley to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has come and gone over the years. Now that the
authority is soliciting bids to build the billboards, some
conservationists, public officials and drivers are objecting, in a
Jersey kind of way: they see it as the turnpike resigning itself to
the world's mistaken opinion of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a state agency should be looking to enhance an image,
not detract from it,'' said Mayor James Cassella of East
Rutherford, a town with a football team that still won't admit it's
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Maguire, a former New Jerseyan and president of Scenic
America, a Washington conservation group, said the road speaks for
the state. ``It's an industrial state in the north and an
agricultural state in the south,'' she said. ``If you start putting
up billboards, it's a sellout state.'' (She said she had written to
Gov. Christie Whitman, but the governor's picture is already on
anti-smoking billboards overlooking the turnpike from private
land.)
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Barbara Sandford, the president of Scenic New
Jersey, also hates billboards, but understands the turnpike's
limitations. ``It's doing the best it can,'' she said, in a tone of
voice you might hear at a parent-teacher conference. ``It's just
engineered to get you from here to there. It's not supposed to be
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearily, Edward Gross, the executive director of the Turnpike
Authority, defends his road. ``The turnpike is a highway, and it
has a function,'' he said. ``There's a lot of development around
the turnpike, but it's not the doing of the turnpike.'' It is a
safe, vital conduit for people and goods, he pointed out, and will
be enhanced by a $41 million overhaul of its rest stops.
</P>
<P>
   Even that ignores the turnpike's charms. The road has an
unadorned honesty. It isn't trying to be a parkway, like, say, the
Taconic Parkway, a road so manicured that you wouldn't be floored
to see the guy next to you driving a golf cart. On the turnpike,
the guy next to you might be landing a 757 at Newark Airport.
Besides, there's a certain majesty to the great waves of wetland
grass, the dark simplicity of the Pulaski Skyway arching across the
marsh, the mad scientist maze of the Bayway refineries, the mesas
of capped landfills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vigorous, muscular, masculine aesthetic,'' said Angus
Kress Gillespie, a Rutgers professor of American studies.
</P>
<P>
   It can grow on you. Jack Eisenberg, working the parts counter at
Industrial Truck Body off Exit 13A, opposes billboards. ``I'm not
for anything that hurts the scenery,'' he said with a straight
face.
</P>
<P>
   But then, he's from Staten Island and knows about learning to
love one's burden. ``Hey, I live a mile from the Staten Island
dump. There is no bigger blight.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't get him started about the turnpike being ugly. ``Have
you ever seen the Connecticut Turnpike?'' he asks. ``Bridgeport!
This is paradise compared to that.''

REAL ESTATE: AFTER 53 YEARS, A HAPPY DOWNSIZING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For everyone, moving is traumatic. But for pack rats
it may actually be a good thing, providing the necessary pressure
to slim down, throw out, clean up. To begin anew.
</P>
<P>
   For 53 years, Rebecca Cauman lived in an apartment on Lexington
Avenue, at 90th Street in Manhattan, and for 53 years she did very
little to the apartment. It hadn't had a new paint job since the
1950s. And it was home to a lifetime of accumulation, like 50 years
of Life magazines.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Mrs. Cauman's husband, Caleb Cauman, who
worked in advertising, died at age 89 after a long illness, and she
began to think about moving, because the six-room apartment where
they had raised their two children seemed too large.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't want to leave the co-op building, where she has
many friends and a knowledge of its intimate history that allows
her to cheerfully tell tales of past robberies, suicides and even a
murder about 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the doormen in the building seem to make a lot of
fruitful matches. When she was moving in, pregnant with her first
child, they introduced her to another young mother-to-be who became
one of her best friends. And not too long ago, they introduced her
to Jeff Bua, a five-year resident who works for Bellmarc Realty and
has sold several apartments in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Bua took a look at her place and knew what had to be done. He
understood how difficult it would be for Mrs. Cauman, who is 83, to
move _ ``she's like the mayor of the building,'' he says _ but he
believed he could get her a one-bedroom apartment in the same
building.
</P>
<P>
   But first, he would have to help her get rid of things. ``It
looked like a haunted house,'' he says. ``The paint was peeling.''
There were books and magazines everywhere, he says, so that ``you
couldn't walk through the apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   He says this in front of Mrs. Cauman, who seems neither
defensive nor annoyed. ``I'm not the greatest housekeeper,'' she
says. Clearly, her family, friends and job as a social worker
mattered more than decorating.
</P>
<P>
   For buyers who wanted good space for the money, with original
details intact, right down to the double sink in the kitchen, the
apartment would be appealing. Anyone unable to see through the
clutter, or imagine a full-scale renovation, would be scared off.
After just a few showings, they sold it for $580,000 (she had
bought it in 1971 for $20,000, the inside price given to renters at
the time) and he found her a one-bedroom in the same building for
$245,000, with a maintenance of $800, less than half her old
monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Mrs. Cauman in her sunny new apartment, it is hard to
believe that she lived with piles of papers and magazines _ and, by
her reckoning, thousands of books. Her apartment now is well
furnished, with paintings on the wall by various family members,
but not cluttered. As a friend said, the decor is eclectic.
</P>
<P>
   The transition wasn't easy. ``Getting out was really painful,''
Mrs. Cauman says. She even developed heart problems in the middle,
delaying the process. But finally, with help, she got rid of nearly
everything that didn't have some kind of sentimental value. ``I had
to be very aggressive with her,'' Bua says. ``One time, I counted
the chairs. There were 14.''
</P>
<P>
   She moved into her new place in June, and, she says, ``I've been
happier than I ever thought I could be. I think it's because it's
fun. It's like playing house in here. It's little.''
</P>
<P>
   On the table in her living room is a wooden pig made by her
daughter, Anne, now in her 50s, when she was at Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a pewter duck, because most people call her Ducky,
a nickname that stuck when her older sister couldn't say Rebecca
and called her Decca. On the day bed are the velvet pillows from a
couch her parents owned, and an afghan made by a cousin.
</P>
<P>
   There were times, she says, when her husband wanted to move, to
get a house somewhere, perhaps on Long Island, but she very much
wanted to stay in the city. ``I love the city,'' she says, and
despite the occasional need for a cane, she goes out frequently, to
movies, to restaurants, to a volunteer job with the courts, and,
the other day, to the celebratory parade for the Yankees. She grew
up in the city, spending the first three years of her life living
in the Hebrew Orphan Asylum on Amsterdam Avenue between 136th and
138th streets, where her father, a rabbi, was the director. To
please her husband, they frequently rented houses in the summer in
Westchester, and also sometimes house sat. ``We got fancier and
fancier,'' she says. ``It got so I wouldn't do it unless they had a
pool.''
</P>
<P>
   When she moved into the building, she had no idea, of course,
that she would spend so much of her life there. Is there anyone who
ever knows whether a place will be forever or just for a year?
Early on, she thought about replacing the sink in the maid's
bathroom with a shower, she said, but her brother-in-law convinced
her it wasn't worth doing _ ``He said, `You'll never stay.'''

REAL ESTATE: SECOND-HOME BUYERS GO LONGER DISTANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Conn., Mass., Maine, Ga.)  (lb) 
 By MARY McALEER VIZARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sylvia Pollack, a psychologist, travels to her pondside ski
chalet in Madison, N.H., about every six weeks. She and her
husband, Lee, live in Madison, N.J. (the towns' names are just a
coincidence, she said). ``We had no choice about the distance,
because we wanted to be in the mountains,'' she said. To help pass
the time while traveling, she has taken up knitting _ ``and we
listen to books on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   To get away from the pressures of running the New York City
public schools, Chancellor Rudy Crew travels even farther to his
small house in the western lakes region of Maine. Two years ago, he
bought a three-bedroom, one-bath pondside cabin in Greenwood.
``I've loved the area since I was a kid and went to camp near
there,'' Crew said. ``And I never got it out of my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokers from as far north as Maine and as far south as Hilton
Head Island, S.C., say that distance seems not to matter as much as
it once did when people buy a second home. ``For some, it's part of
a long-term retirement strategy,'' said Peter Pinkham, a real
estate agent in North Conway, N.H., whose office covers the Mount
Washington Valley, about a six-hour drive from New York City.
``They invest in a property in a particular area to trade up and
buy a retirement home there later.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, it's the desire to capture a certain bucolic quality
not available closer to home. ``I wanted to be in nature,'' Crew
said. ``I love to fish, bird-watch, and be in an unspoiled natural
environment. Some people like it out on Long Island, and the
Hamptons are beautiful but aren't enough of a buffer for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkham said that buyers coming into his office are looking for
ski houses, ``but more and more they plan to use them all year
long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot of people who aren't tied to where they
work,'' he said. ``They live off their computers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the Pollacks bought their three-bedroom, two-bath
home, with its own beach, they paid $97,500. ``That same house
would now be worth at least $130,000,'' Pinkham said. In other
second-home markets, prices have also been appreciating and sales
are up, sometimes in double-figure percentages, according to real
estate agents.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkham said that the last few weeks have been surprisingly
busy. ``We're busier now than we were in the early part of
September,'' he said. ``People come here for all kinds of reasons,
the skiing being first and foremost. But there are also hikers,
canoeists and outdoor enthusiasts attracted to the White Mountain
National Park. People with second homes are typically using them up
to 20 times a year, even from New York, which is long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Most buyers, however, continue to opt for something within a
two-hour commute to home. As a result, the second-home markets in
the Berkshires, in Connecticut and on the eastern end of Long
Island continue to thrive, according to real estate brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Hirsh and his wife, Mary, considered getting a ski
house in Vermont or New Hampshire before deciding to buy their
first second home in Litchfield County, Conn. ``We realized that as
much as we liked it farther north,'' Larry Hirsh said, ``if we
bought a house there, we'd never use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple now plan to buy a four-bedroom, three-bath Cape Cod
at Woodridge Lake, in Goshen, Conn. Woodridge Lake is a community
of houses, mostly contemporaries, built around a man-made lake,
with prices ranging from $395,000 to $2 million, according to Frank
Moss, managing partner of Landmark Real Estate Co. in Goshen.
</P>
<P>
   Woodridge Lake is a planned community with a marina, a community
house, eight tennis courts and a swimming pool, Moss said. ``A lot
of people, especially with young children, like the planned
community concept,'' he said. ``They feel safe letting the kids run
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken and Anne Green just closed on a five-bedroom contemporary at
Woodridge Lake. The main attraction, Green said, was that ``it was
the only house I could find on the water for under $1 million.''
His house listed for $995,000.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who is a retired investment banker, said he and his wife,
who have two grown children, plan to winter in New York City and
spend most of the summer in Litchfield. ``If we bought anything
farther away,'' Green said, ``we were afraid our kids would never
come and visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss also sells houses in other parts of Litchfield County,
including Salisbury, Torrington and Falls Village. One typical
recent listing was for a four-bedroom colonial on 14 acres in Falls
Village with two fireplaces and a screened porch for $399,000.
``Lately I'm finding that people who have the money to buy a second
home are primarily interested in waterfront acreage, mountaintop
views or something special, and those are getting harder to find,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Berkshire County, Mass., the number of sales transactions is
up 8 percent over last year, said Joseph Carini, president of
Wheeler &AMP; Taylor Realty of Great Barrington. ``Properties are not
reported as second homes,'' Carini said, ``but my sense is that the
market would be even stronger than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Inventory is tight but ``not dire,'' he said, and there is still
a selection in a range of prices from $75,000 to $3 million. One
recent listing was for a two-bedroom, one-bath cottage with a stone
fireplace and wood-burning stove on one acre for $99,900.
</P>
<P>
   On the east end of Long Island, ``everything is selling, from
$200,000 cottages with two bedrooms, one bath on one-third of an
acre, to one house we just sold for $15 million,'' said David Bray,
a partner at Allan M. Schneider Associates, which has nine offices.
</P>
<P>
   One recent listing, in Water Mill, was for a four-bedroom,
four-bath colonial with eat-in kitchen and tennis court and dock
for $4.5 million. ``With the active market, the inventory goes
along with that,'' said Bray, whose office is in Sag Harbor, where,
he said, ``the shortest supply now is in anything on the water for
under $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the ninth year of a sales boom on the east end of Long
Island, said Diane Saatchi, president of Dayton-Halstead, which has
offices in Bridgehampton and East Hampton. ``The number of sales
transactions and sales dollar volume have increased so far this
year by 50 percent,'' Ms. Saatchi said. ``I think it will be up 60
percent by the end of the year.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at the point where if you get a listing, you make the
sale,'' Ms. Saatchi said. ``We haven't really needed to add any new
sales people.'' Average sale prices, she added, have also
increased, between 10 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Allan M. Schneider's nine offices on the east end, sale
prices are also up, ``between 10 to 30 percent, depending on the
property,'' said Peter Hallock, the company president. ``The number
of transactions has also increased,'' he added. ``More properties
than ever are selling at full price.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-home buyers who are skiers will often travel greater
distances to be near the mountain of their choice. Dr. Jeffrey
Markowitz and his family like to ski at Sunday River in Bethel,
Maine ``We started out by renting a trailside condo,'' Markowitz
said. ``Then we saw some construction going on, and we bought a
quarter share in a condo that sleeps eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday River offers quarter shares in condominiums at its two
resort hotels, the Grand Summit and the Jordan Grand. ``We started
the concept at Sugarloaf and it worked so well, we started it
here,'' said Chip Seamans, Sunday River's managing director. ``It
now accounts for 50 percent of our vacation-home business.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarter shares are the equivalent of buying one week a month,
Seamans said. ``It's for people who prefer to live in a hotel-like
atmosphere,'' he added, ``and have all the services included,
including housekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarter shares in a typical one-bedroom with a loft would range
from $70,000 to $80,000, Seamans said. Sunday River also has nine
town-house condo associations, with full ownership. Units are
priced between $45,900 for a studio to $315,000 for a three-level,
three-bedroom condominium.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying at Sunday River, Markowitz and his family looked
around Vermont and ``thought about buying a house with another
family or two with children, because we don't always get to use
it,'' Markowitz said. ``But then we decided that we don't like
Vermont skiing. It's too crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Seasons Realty, on Route 26 in Locke Mills, Maine, is on
the road leading to Sunday River. ``We get a lot of people on their
way to the skiing,'' said Gordon Brown of his office. ``We're the
first real estate office they see.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people who stop want ``the typical three-bedroom log cabin
in Maine,'' Gordon said. One recent listing was for a
three-bedroom, two-bath log cabin with a cathedral ceiling on
Indian Pond for $197,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes if they can't find what they want, they'll buy a
piece of land and build their own house,'' Gordon added.
``Everybody wants the views, either of the water or the mountains
or both.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mount Washington area of New Hampshire, a small
chalet-style house near a ski area can start at around $70,000 and
go as high as $250,000. ``Most are probably around $140,000,''
Pinkham said. ``For that you get three to four bedrooms, two baths,
on three-quarters of an acre.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of his customers want condos, ``where you can get a
lot more for your money, and there's no maintenance and a pool, and
tennis court or both,'' Pinkham said. Two recent listings at the
Attitash ski resort were for a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath
town house, for $159,900, and a two-bedroom, two-bath town house,
for $79,500.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, residential sales in the White Mountains area of New
Hampshire were booming, up 37 percent over 1997, with average
prices up 20 percent. So far this year, sales are up 9 percent, and
sales dollar volume has increased by 12 percent. Average prices,
however, were flat, mainly because of a greater number of
lower-priced properties being sold, Pinkham said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, land gets scarce as you go north toward the
notches, the scenic mountain passes through the national forest,
Pinkham said. ``There's less land so everything sells at a higher
price,'' he said. In Maine, though, there are still vast stretches
of undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
   On a stretch of road with acres of lake water on either side,
Brown of Four Seasons Realty pointed to the mountains above Lake
Christopher, where he is developing a 12-lot subdivision. ``There's
really a lot of building going on around here,'' he said. ``But
Maine is so vast you don't notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   One-acre lots are selling for from $19,000 to the low $40,000s,
Gordon said, depending on whether the lot has a lake view.
``Everyone wants to be south of Sunday River,'' he said. ``A few
miles north of it, and prices drop by 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is starting to get customers from as far south as
Connecticut. They include Thomas and Janet Novak of Old Lyme, Conn.
They have been skiing at Sunday River for years but did not want to
live at the resort. The couple just bought one acre from Gordon, in
Woodstock. ``Our grand design is to retire there in about eight
years,'' said Novak, an engineer. ``In the meantime, we're deciding
what to build on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Retirees and those planning retirement in the near future are
accounting for an increase in the number of customers who buy
second homes outside a comfortable weekend commuting distance from
their primary residence, brokers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people from the New York area vacation here, like it
and decide to retire here someday,'' said Richard Kadesch of
Richard Kadesch Realty in Hilton Head Island, near Savannah, Ga.
``They often buy a place and use it for five to 10 years, and then
when they're ready to retire they sell it and trade up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is one of our biggest markets outside of the local
area, then Ohio and Pennsylvania and places west of there,'' he
said. ``People typically start out with a condominium and move on
to a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices can range from $45,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bath
furnished condominium apartment within 15 minutes walking distance
to the beach, to $3 million for an oceanfront or marina property
with 7,000 square feet of living space, Kadesch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices have been appreciating about 7 percent a year since
1986,'' he said. ``There's still a good selection in properties
from $200,000 to $400,000. The most popular price category for
buyers ready to retire is between $350,000 and $400,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton Head Island's residential sale prices this year have
exceeded 1998's by 15 percent, with an average price in 1999 of
$430,850. And the number of listings is down 15 percent, according
to the multiple listing service.
</P>
<P>
   Kadesch said that for many of his customers, ``the retirement
planning starts early'' since most of his second-home buyers are
``typically in their 40s and 50s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the demographics of the baby boom,'' he said, ``and
the desire of a lot of people to retire by the ocean, we expect
blue skies here in the second-home market at least until the year
2010.''

<P>
   LAWRENCEBURG, Ind. _ In a move to save a significant piece of
the state's urban and architectural history, the Historic Landmarks
Foundation of Indiana is taking on the role of developer.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, the largest private nonprofit statewide
preservation group in the country, with an endowment of $40
million, has spent $1.5 million to acquire 14 buildings in downtown
Lawrenceburg, a town of about 4,700 people on the Ohio River in the
southeast corner of the state. The buildings, all of which are
empty, were formerly owned by the city.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrenceburg, which was founded in 1802, is the oldest of a
string of historic river towns in the area, including Madison,
Aurora, Rising Sun and Vevay. Built on a flood plain caused by the
confluence of the Great Miami and Ohio rivers, the downtown flooded
regularly until a levee was built in the 1930s. Despite the
flooding, the town prospered in the 19th century as a manufacturing
and trading center for what was then called the Indiana Territory.
</P>
<P>
   One specialty was buggies, an industry that persisted here until
the 1960s. When David O. Selznick, the movie producer, needed
authentic buggies for his ``Gone With the Wind,'' he found them in
Lawrenceburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 14 blocks of early Federal style architecture
downtown that are virtually intact,'' said Reid Williamson, the
foundation's president. `It's important that they be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   The downtown is a treasure trove of 19th century building styles
with Federal, Greek Revival, Italianate and Victorian buildings
lining narrow streets. Almost none of the buildings have been
restored and many are empty.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Jackson, a real estate agent in nearby Greendale who is
familiar with the Lawrenceburg market, says the downtown vacancy
rate is about 50 percent. On a recent Saturday afternoon, there
were children riding their bikes and playing games in the middle of
High Street, the main downtown thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime residents of the town, the seat of Dearborn County,
remember a different Lawrenceburg. Back in the '50s and '60s, the
downtown bustled with grocery and dry goods stores, restaurants,
two movie theaters and various professional offices. ``You could
get everything you needed in the space of a few blocks,'' said
Robert Ewbank, the city attorney, whose family has lived in the
area for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   The decline began in the '70s with the construction of a new
highway and the arrival of Wal-Mart and other large discount stores
that chose to set up shop on a new commercial strip south of town.
``It's a common story around the country,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings the foundation has acquired are a mix of one- to
three-story brick and clapboard row houses and commercial
structures. Most are clustered on or near High Street, which
parallels the river. The largest is the former Jesse Hunt Hotel at
the corner of High and Walnut streets. When it opened in 1819, it
was the first three-story brick building in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation plans to restore the buildings at a cost of $2
million by July 2001 and then sell them. ``We have a lot at stake
here,'' said Williamson, who has headed the foundation for more
than 20 years. ``This is the largest single financial commitment
we've ever made and there's no guarantee we'll make our money
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrenceburg project is the latest in a series of aggressive
preservation efforts undertaken by the foundation. Last year, with
funds from William Cook, a billionaire who founded a medical
instrument company, it coordinated the $31 million restoration of
the gigantic West Baden Springs Hotel in the resort town of West
Baden Springs. The foundation is now attempting to sell the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the Lawrenceburg project has drawn praise from
preservation groups. ``The Indiana Foundation really is in a class
by itself,'' said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for
Historic Preservation in Washington. ``They do more in terms of
development and advocacy and education than any statewide group I
know of and they do it better.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason the foundation is taking on the project is a sudden
uptick in the city's fortunes that threatens to obliterate much of
its past.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the state voted to allow riverboat gambling on
the Ohio and awarded one of the licenses to Lawrenceburg. One of
the companies that competed to build and operate the casino was the
Las Vegas-based Golden Nugget Inc. To bolster its candidacy, the
company bought up three blocks of historic buildings along the
river _ the heart of the old downtown and the site of most of the
buildings the foundation intends to preserve _ and evicted the
tenants in preparation for a never-defined redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   The license eventually went to another firm, the Argosy Gaming
Co. of Alton, Ill., which built a large hotel and casino operation
just east of downtown. This put city officials in the position of
having to buy back much of their downtown from Golden Nugget, which
they did a year ago for about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Now the city _ flush with new tax money from the casino _ wants
to build a new conference center and hotel along the river on a
site that includes the old Golden Nugget property. ``I look at
everything in terms of dollars and cents,'' said Mayor Melvin
Gabbard. `It doesn't matter how much history is there. It's more
feasible to tear them down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One man's treasure is another man's junk,'' said Ewbank. ``For
many of the people who live here, these buildings are blighted
properties that are dragging the neighborhood down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Argosy casino gives about $15 million a year in taxes and
fees to a city whose total municipal $4 million. Gabbard has used
some of the money for an extensive upgrade of the downtown
infrastructure. His dream however, is the new conference center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The casino attracts 6.5 million people a year,'' he said. ``If
we could attract just 2 percent of those people to a new
entertainment strip, we'd have a thriving downtown.`
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, city bulldozers ripped through three historic
row houses. At that point, Williamson and the Landmarks Foundation
_ which had earlier placed High Street on its list of Indiana's
most endangered historical sites _ swung into action with a lawsuit
contesting the city's right to use public money in the form of
gambling revenues to tear down historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   After much wrangling and posturing, a settlement was devised in
March. Gabbard gets his conference center and hotel, but they will
be behind the historic buildings. And Williamson gets most of the
historic buildings. (Two commercial structures will be torn down
and four row houses will be moved to a new location.)
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say they are now at peace, though neither can resist
a little sniping. ``There's a boom in the Midwest right now where
every little town is building a convention center and a hotel to go
with it,'' said Williamson. ``It's monkey see, monkey do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they get those old buildings ready for
occupancy,'' said Gabbard, ``the dollar figure will be so high that
they'll either lose a bundle of money or the rents will be so high
no one will be able to afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson acknowledges this may be true. But he says the
foundation will raise funds to cover any losses.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who will ultimately occupy the buildings is
being discussed. ``For the conference center to be a success,''
said Williamson, ``it will need some kind of historic downtown. We
will provide that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a mix of boutiques and amenities for the people who live
and work downtown,'' said Jackson, the real estate agent. ``There
isn't much demand for commercial space downtown currently. But if
the city carries through with its plans, there will be.'' &QL;

were abandoned by international sports promoters, to New York,
where they became celebrated, then disgraced and are now on solid
ground thanks to Martin Luther King Jr. High School soccer coach

Angeles mansion, known as the castle, has turned into a test of
conflicting laws. Saying the plants are for personal use and

Proposition 215, the ballot measure approved by California voters
in 1996 allowing patients to smoke marijuana with a doctor's

Tom Hollis, who was beaten back in September, is one of about 5,800
homeless people in Denver. Hollis says attacks against the homeless
have changed the atmosphere of the once-friendly Denver streets.
Since early September, five homeless men have been found beaten to
death and two others have been assaulted. Like the men attacked,
police say, many of the attackers are homeless, and they often
compete with other homeless men for corners to panhandle on. (Kevin

President Al Gore's campaign staff at their new offices on
Charlotte Avenue in Nashville, where Gore says his campaign will be
``closer to the American people,'' and make him more likely to win
the presidency, as he hopes. The underlying logic of the Gore move
was to shake up a top-heavy, highly paid staff in Washington, and
to do it in a politically polite way, allowing the campaign to
shave the staff without firing anyone. (Christopher Berkey/New York

explaining why she took risks to leave Germany in 1960 and her
brother ended up being supported by the German safety net. A German
without job prospects, Hans favors enveloping social protection. An
American with a convert's zeal, Heidi wants ``the government out of

and crime. Mrs. Riley still takes a morning walk, but on the advice
of a neighbor she has adjusted her route to avoid drug dealers on
20th Street. ``There's some rough spots,'' Mrs. Riley acknowledges.
But she does not focus on the drug dealers any more than she does
on her arthritis. The neighborhood, she says, is not unlike her
life: ``I assume there's going to be rough spots.'' (Andrea

is not a ghetto. This is a place where people worked hard to build
a community,'' says Mrs. Mason of her neighborhood, once so well
tended that even after whites left and factories began to close, it
was known as Upper Society Hill. (Andrea Mohin/New York Times

 &HT;    Pandas adjusting well in new Atlanta home
 &HT;    By Will Anderson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Zoo Atlanta panda cubs Lun-Lun and Yang-Yang spent
Saturday recuperating in their new environs, a zoo official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sleeping a lot, and they have a certain amount of down
time,'' said Rich Sartor, assistant curator of large mammals.
``There's no aggression and no problems. They are buddies in the
new world, and we think that's had a calming influence on them.''
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at Hartsfield International Airport on Friday,
the bears were rushed to the zoo in a convoy of police cars and UPS
trucks. By Saturday, the pandas' keepers were busy helping their
their new arrivals get used to the 13-hour time change.
</P>
<P>
   They offered batches of ``panda porridge'' _ a concoction of
flour, grain, vitamins and ground bamboo _ to the cubs, and they
were eating a moderate amount, Sartor said. The porridge
supplements their normal diet of bamboo and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mixed up a little test batch and tasted it,'' Sartor said.
``It's not bad. Kind of bland, though.''
</P>
<P>
   The pandas will remain quarantined for about a week, and the
public will be allowed to view them beginning Nov. 20. The bears
were still inside their holding facility Saturday, and keepers
planned to introduce them to the whole enclosure, including their
outdoor habitat, in stages. The reason, Sartor said, is to let the
bears get acquainted with the handlers and learn where to find
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to cut them loose out in their yards, and if
they don't know who we are, they may not be inclined to come
back,'' Sartor said.
</P>
<P>
   The bears are separated only at feeding time because the keepers
want to know exactly how much each panda eats.
</P>
<P>
   Sartor, who supervises three other panda keepers, took a crash
course on caring for giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo, which along
with the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., is the other facility in
the country with the exotic black-and-white Chinese bears.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the keepers from Zoo Atlanta spent 10 to 12 days in San
Diego working with the bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it panda boot camp,'' Sartor said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they learned was that pandas are picky eaters, and not
all varieties of bamboo are suitable to them. In fact, the bears,
which devour from 3 to 5 kilograms of bamboo every day, sometimes
like different bamboo varieties, depending on the season. The trick
is to give them what they want, when they want it.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta will get most of Lun-Lun and Yang-Yang's bamboo from
a commercial grower in Savannah. Zoo officials also are negotiating
with local landowners who have bamboo growing on their property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bamboo is a tall order of business,'' Sartor said.

   BUSH-YEAROUT _ AUSTIN _ It's a long time until Election Day, but
it's been a long time since any presidential candidate, save for an
incumbent, enjoyed such an early edge in the race. Texas Gov.
George W. Bush is bolstered by a $60-million-and-growing campaign
war chest and poll numbers that make it news whenever a GOP
challenger climbs within 10 points of him. He also stands to reap
the benefits available to any Republican who wins the nomination,
including a rising tide of GOP governors, growing suburbs bulging
with a Republican-leaning electorate and fresh memories of a
Democratic administration that has slalomed through scandal. A look
at the presidential race a year out, state by state, electoral vote

   KINGSPALD-MAIN _ ATLANTA _ Twice this year, the prestigious King

that had the potential to damage clients. In what appeared to be an
egregious case earlier this year, a judge said the internationally
known law firm obstructed justice by helping client GM withhold
evidence in the lawsuit over the faulty construction of the
Chevette gasoline tank. Such an admonition from a federal judge
would have been bad enough, but then the firm found itself facing
an even larger and more damaging problem: withholding ACOG records
from a congressional committee looking into Olympic bribery
allegations. The law firm turned to its most prominent member _
former U. S. Attorney General Griffin Bell, who still is referred
to as Judge Bell _ to help it save face. Bell told the panel the
firm had made an error in not surrendering records. Looking at
whether the resignation of the managing partner _ which happened
before the revelations about ACOG _ is related to the records
fiasco, and whether all of this has tarnished the K&AMP;S name in the
community. (Rankin-Mantius, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 60.

fines for spreading ``totalitarian ideology'' and former political
prisoners have filed a lawsuit to ban the broadcast. The TV chief
says the show is visual history and the decision to air it was made
to force the country to face up to its past. The debate goes to the
very heart of how this Eastern European country ? now a member of
NATO ? defines its fledgling democracy. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

SYRACUSE MUSTERS UP JUST ENOUGH CONCENTRATION TO DISPOSE OF TEMPLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ At times, the Syracuse players looked as if
they weren't on the same page as the coaches. At times they
executed their plays with aplomb. But on a Saturday afternoon when
many of the Orangemen were concentrating on football for the first
time this week, the Orangemen did enough to get past a hapless
Temple team, defeating the Owls by 27-10 in a Big East Conference
game before 43,970 at the Carrier Dome.
</P>
<P>
   For Syracuse (6-3) the victory soothed a week of emotional pain
that began early last Sunday _ when three of the football players
were stabbed outside of a local bar that the athletes had been
warned about going to _ and it kept alive the Orangemen's
postseason bowl hopes.
</P>
<P>
   For Temple (2-7), the loss was just another exercise in
futility. The Owls did very well with what Syracuse gave them _ a
muffed punt that set up their first touchdown and a turnover that
set up a field goal _ but they were unable to generate any offense
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, Temple managed only 23 yards rushing, while Syracuse
got 59 yards rushing from running back Dee Brown and 52 yards from
James Mungro. Syracuse scored 10 points in the last 1 minute 34
seconds of the game, with cornerback LaTroy Oliver putting an
exclamation point on the victory on a 25-yard return of an
interception at 1:17 that made it 27-10.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a difficult week for the Syracuse football team, and
Temple was the last thing on the players' minds before they took
the field Saturday. Starting cornerback David Byrd and two other
Syracuse players, defensive end Duke Pettijohn and the backup
tackle Giovanni DeLoatch, were among five people stabbed outside of
a local bar during an altercation early last Sunday. The group of
players and their friends from Boston were set upon by a gang of at
least six people wielding knives. Syracuse police are still
investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Pettijohn and DeLoatch were released from the hospital earlier
this week. They wore their jerseys and were on the sidelines for
the game Saturday, but did not play. Byrd was released briefly
Saturday so he could attend senior day at the Carrier Dome, then
was re-admitted to the hospital. Byrd, walking with a slight limp,
waved his No. 22 jersey over his head as he was the last member of
the senior class introduced. His teammates embraced him at the
20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the team trying to come to grips with the attack,
they were also coming off two straight disappointing losses. Two
weeks ago Virginia Tech humiliated the Orangemen in a 62-0 rout,
and last week Boston College defeated them by 24-23. So, they were
reeling when they took the field against Temple, a team they were
supposed to beat by at least two touchdowns. The Owls hadn't beaten
Syracuse since 1983, a stretch of 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game started, members of Syracuse's All-Century
football team were introduced, including Floyd Little, Larry Csonka
and Darryl Johnston. That put a good feeling in the building. But
the Syracuse team still seemed out of sorts when it took the field.
</P>
<P>
   On Syracuse's first punt snap of the afternoon, long snapper
Mike Bennett sent the ball sailing over the head of punter Mike
Shafer. Shafer chased the ball down but was tackled for a 35-yard
loss at the Syracuse 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Temple scored on the next play when quarterback Devin Scott
threw a 5-yard pass to receiver Sean Dillard with 8:53 left in the
first quarter. But the Owls' offense was quiet for the remainder of
the half. They didn't try to attack Willie Ford, who had moved to
cornerback from his starting strong safety spot to replace Byrd.
And the one deep pass that Scott threw that was on target was
intercepted by strong safety Ian McIntosh, who took Ford's place.
</P>
<P>
   By the second quarter, Syracuse's offense had settled down,
although Bennett continued to have trouble with his punt snaps.
Using a 43-yard punt return by cornerback Will Allen, Syracuse
marched from its 48-yard line down to the Temple 1 and scored a
touchdown on a 1-yard run by Mungro to help tie the game at 7-7
with 3:56 to go in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen boosted their lead to 14-7 at 10:06 of the second
quarter when quarterback Madei Williams, who alternates with Troy
Nunes, scored on a 4-yard quarterback keeper. The scoring drive was
set up by a 38-yard punt return by receiver Quinton Spotwood.
</P>
<P>
   Poor clock management stopped Syracuse from taking advantage of
a great scoring opportunity right before the half. McIntosh's
interception gave the Orangemen the ball at Temple's 49-yard line
with 4:28 to go in the half. They were able to move down the field
and were set up on a first-and-goal at the 1 with 40 seconds to
play and no timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, Mungro was stopped for no gain at the goal
line. Then, Williams threw a pass to tight end Stephen Brominski
that fell incomplete. On third down, Williams tried to run it in,
but was stopped by Temple linebacker Taylor Suman. With 10 seconds
to go, the Orangemen tried to run their field goal unit onto the
field, but time expired before they could set up. Temple went to
the locker room thankful to be down by just one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse gave Temple another break in the third quarter when
Nunes was hit by Temple defensive end Calvin Wilkerson and fumbled,
Temple recovering at the Syracuse 20. The Owls converted the
turnover into a 34-yard field goal that cut Syracuse's lead to
14-10. The Orangemen pushed their lead to 17-10 with a 30-yard
field goal at 1:43 of the third quarter.

 &HT;    Falcons aim to jump hurdle
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was nearly impossible Wednesday to miss the extra
pep in the step of several Falcons at practice. It's gotten to
where one victory _ against Carolina, no less _ means that much.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what it would mean if the Falcons (2-6) could run the
Jaguars (6-1) out of the Georgia Dome today, knowing they have a
bye next Sunday, and then games against three consecutive teams
with losing records _ Tampa Bay, Carolina and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you beat a better football team, a team everybody
is picking to be in the Super Bowl, yeah, for us it's huge,'' coach
Dan Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legitimate to say if we don't win this game our chances
are diminishing more and more. They're slim right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Put that one on top of the list of understatements made by an
understaffed team.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can bring back the Falcons' leading rusher from last
season (Jamal Anderson), their leading tackler (Cornelius Bennett)
or their leading receiver (Tony Martin).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this year's leading tackler, strong safety Marty
Carter, might not play because of a sprained right knee.
</P>
<P>
   But depending on who's talking, what remains of last season's
Super Bowl team might be getting its vibe back.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ray Buchanan, said it came when the Falcons trailed
13-0 at Pittsburgh two weeks ago, but didn't cave in before losing
13-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have rolled over, but we kept going after those
guys,'' he said. ``Now, like last year, we're making some plays.
We're getting a lot more enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were indeed more efficient last Sunday against
Carolina, going without a turnover, getting a season high in
rushing yardage, holding the Panthers to a season-low, forcing five
takeaways and getting six sacks.
</P>
<P>
   They still had to hang on, as a 100-yard kickoff return left
Reeves with white knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars don't need big plays like that to win.
</P>
<P>
   They're as good as anybody in the NFL at basic football, rarely
making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons nonetheless claim to believe they can return to
form.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars All-Pro left tackle Tony Boselli, quarterback Mark
Brunell and running back Fred Taylor are less than 100 percent, and
there's a good chance Boselli might not play.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons don't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take wins whenever we can get them,'' tight end O.J.
Santiago said. ``But at the same time, playing against
Jacksonville, which is considered one of the better teams ...
beating them would put us back where we think we should have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalk one up to overstatement.

RED FLAGS WERE FLYING WITH LEAF 
IN HONOR OF WALTER PAYTON 
TAKING ATTENDANCE 
MONEY MATTERS MATTERED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Ryan Leaf gave the San Diego Chargers the
first hint that their franchise quarterback was not exactly a
leader. Leaf was the only player to walk out of the rookie
symposium the NFL holds for its first-year players, leaving several
days early.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said it was because he had a charity function to attend.
The NFL fined Leaf $10,000. Instead of accepting responsibility for
his actions by simply paying the fine, Leaf filed a grievance with
the help of the players union. A settlement was worked out and Leaf
was penalized only $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small signal, but a signal nevertheless, of what was to
come. Unless Leaf's career takes a dramatic turn, the No. 2 pick
overall in the 1998 draft will be thought of as one of the biggest
busts in history. But Leaf's career is also an indictment of the
way some teams will ignore obvious signs that a player may be
trouble because that team is blinded by talent.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a team takes the risk of drafting or signing a player
with a danger sign hanging around his neck, and it can survive that
signing because the player eventually matures. In other instances,
such a signing can prove disastrous, haunting the team for years.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have seen both sides. Several years ago, the team
signed safety Tito Wooten to a long-term contract despite his
history of abuse against women. The team later cut Wooten after
poor performances on the field. New York signed defensive lineman
Christian Peter despite his off-the-field problems that included
violence against women and alcohol abuse. But unlike Wooten, Peter
has worked well, so far, on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with Leaf. Most teams, including the Chargers, knew of
Leaf's college reputation as a party guy. He also had poor work
habits and sometimes did not respond well to coaching or pressure.
Still, to get Leaf, the Chargers traded two players, two
first-round picks and a second-round choice to Arizona to move from
the third spot to the second.
</P>
<P>
   On the April day San Diego drafted Leaf, the Chargers' owner,
Alex Spanos, said of Leaf: ``For the next 15 years, he's our man.
And I can only tell you we're all very, very excited over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf's play caused him to be benched midway through his rookie
year. His troubles were just starting. He was caught on videotape
screaming at a member of the news media. In June, he skipped a
voluntary summer camp without a valid excuse. In training camp he
had to be restrained by team officials from going after a heckler.
Also during camp, Leaf was fined $30,000 for missing several days
without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf has not played since a shoulder operation in late July. He
has shown, on various occasions around the complex, a lack of
respect to teammates and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   An incident that occurred last Monday was typical of Leaf's
behavior. When members of the team's strength and conditioning
staff were working with the quarterback on some exercises and
suggested he do additional work, Leaf told them no, punctuating his
remarks with expletives. The staff pleaded some more, and Leaf
began screaming and cursing at them.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bobby Beathard was alerted to Leaf's tirade and
entered the room, asking Leaf to act like a professional and
complete his exercises. Leaf then screamed and cursed at Beathard.
Leaf concluded by asking for a trade. ``Why don't you get me out of
here?'' he told Beathard.
</P>
<P>
   Yelling at the strength and conditioning staff is bad enough,
but cursing out the one person in the organization who had stuck
with him, and supported him, through all of his problems? Beathard
suspended Leaf for four weeks, and docked him one week's salary,
about $73,000. The league is monitoring the situation, expecting
Leaf to file a grievance, as he did after being fined for leaving
the rookie symposium.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego is stuck with Leaf, for now, because cutting him this
year would be impossible. Leaf signed a $31.25 million contract
that included an $11.25 million signing bonus _ the richest
contract in club history. If the Chargers cut him, $7.5 million of
Leaf's salary would count against the cap. So to release Leaf, the
team would have to cut a half-dozen players and renegotiate the
contracts of others.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers can't fix the situation. If Leaf stays, he is a
disruption. If Leaf goes, he is a disruption.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the near future, maybe next season, San Diego
might tire of Leaf and cut the cord, no matter the repercussions.
For some in the organization, that moment won't come too soon.
</P>
<P>
   In Honor of Walter Payton
</P>
<P>
   A poll was taken among the 200 players from the draft class of
1999, asking to name the greatest NFL player in history. Walter
Payton, who died last Monday, won in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 127 rookies who responded, 64 voted for Payton, more than
three times the number of votes received by the runner-up, Joe
Montana, who got 18. Jerry Rice received 17 votes, followed by
Lawrence Taylor with 15 and Jim Brown with 13.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, the NFL's career-leading rusher who died from bile duct
cancer at the age of 45, was not just popular with young players.
Veteran Marshall Faulk, the St. Louis running back who says Payton
was his childhood hero, wanted to wear Payton's No. 34 Sunday in
honor of the back. The league, however, told him he could not do so
because it would be a uniform violation. Faulk was considering
wearing No. 34 anyway and taking the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chicago Bears' players will wear No. 34 patches on
their uniforms. Also, before every game Sunday and Monday night,
there will be a moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Attendance
</P>
<P>
   Two slightly unusual sightings at last week's league meetings.
</P>
<P>
   First, when league executives were briefing the general managers
about on-field issues like instant replay a number of general
managers were absent. Several general managers who did attend
privately criticized their absentee competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there were more black and female executives who attended
the three days of owners meetings than maybe ever before. The
general managers said this is a sign the league is beginning to
diversify at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Money Matters Mattered
</P>
<P>
   Neil Austrian, former president of the NFL, who was the second
in command under Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, resigned recently to
pursue other interests. Austrian may not have been a people person,
and his blunt, honest style rubbed some the wrong way, but he was a
great businessman who oversaw the explosion in revenue from NFL
Properties and was always heavily involved in the league's
lucrative television deals.
</P>
<P>
   A minor reason Austrian left, some NFL team executives said, was
because he tired of hearing owners complain about properties
issues, despite the massive amount of money the division made.
These executives also said it did not help that the Oakland
Raiders' general partner, Al Davis, sued the league more than a
year ago regarding disputes with how Tagliabue and Austrian handled
various issues. The lawsuit is pending.

 &HT;    N.C. man sought for shooting deaths
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Police issued an arrest warrant Saturday for a
21-year-old North Carolina man in the slaying of an Atlanta woman
and her two young sons Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the man as Kenneth Beamon. They said they also
were looking for the slain woman's niece, Shannon Sizemore, for
questioning. They believe Sizemore is Beamon's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Beamon shot and killed 32-year-old Teresa Shoemaker
and her sons Lamar Shoemaker, 14, and Robert Shoemaker, 12, at
their home on McDonald Drive in southeast Atlanta. They said they
have no motive for the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Lamar and Robert were found side-by-side in one
room of the house, Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley said.
Teresa Shoemaker died of a gunshot to the head.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' father, Charles Shoemaker, 34, also was shot. He was
listed in critical condition Saturday at Grady Memorial Hospital,
but family members said he was alert and talking.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators think Sizemore may have been staying with the
Shoemaker family.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Charles Shoemaker said they knew little about
Sizemore or Beamon.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he was real quiet, the few times I saw him,'' said Jim
McCollough, Charles Shoemaker's uncle. ``He wasn't all that bouncy.
And I didn't really know Shannon. I would just see her over at the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said Beamon had no known address in Georgia or North
Carolina, although he had been previously arrested in Asheville,
N.C., on a fraud charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, there was little activity on McDonald
Street, where there were more abandoned cars than houses.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shoemaker house, a litter of puppies ate from a bowl of
dog food. A toy fire truck sat on the front step.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is a good-hearted person and so was his wife and
children,'' said Mary Kate Williams, Charles Shoemaker's mother.
``They liked to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what had Williams and other family members so baffled
about the shootings. Relatives struggled Saturday to understand why
someone would do such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Family members describe the Shoemakers as hard-working and
caring. Charles Shoemaker's aunt said he drove a garbage truck and
Teresa Shoemaker worked at a local service station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know how to explain it,'' said Betty Shoemaker,
Charles Shoemaker's stepmother, as she fought back tears. ``This
was a good family. A close family. They were going to church. I
don't know why this had to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her stepson woke up briefly Saturday afternoon and was
told what had happened to his family. He asked his two brothers to
go to his house to pick up his dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late. Someone from Fulton County Animal Control had
come by and taken all but one puppy to the pound. The one left
behind just continued to bark.

SAILOR SEEKS AMERICA'S CUP AND MASS APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Cayard's vision for the future of the America's Cup is
simple: he wants it to play in the heartland. With his high school
hoops background and a thorough grasp of the sporting spectrum, he
believes, ``If some guy in Topeka, Kan., is channel surfing and
comes across an American team racing a Japanese team in a windy,
neck-and-neck battle in some scenic location, he's going to get
into it even if sailing isn't his thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard feels the America's Cup needs an overhaul, and he soon
may be in a plum position to do something about it. As the chief
executive and skipper of the San Francisco-based America One
syndicate, Cayard is on a short list of favorites to challenge Team
New Zealand for the cup next February. The second round of trials
in the Louis Vuitton Cup challengers series began Saturday off
Auckland, New Zealand. The three early leaders _ Prada of Italy,
America One and Young America _ all scored easy victories.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the best sailor in the United States, Cayard, a
40-year-old San Franciscan, has the credentials to back up the
assertion. He is a former world champion in the two-man Star-boat
class and was the first American to triumph in the fully crewed
Whitbread Round-the-World race, two divergent feats that could be
likened to a skater winning's a figure-skating crown and the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cayard has won just about everything in sailing he has
set his sights upon _ except the America's Cup. He has come close.
Now on his fifth cup campaign, he captained Italy's Il Moro squad
to the finals in 1992 and was the principal helmsman aboard the
U.S. defender in 1995. But both efforts came up short.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Auckland last week, Cayard said he
has seen the quest for the cup change dramatically since he first
arrived on the scene in Newport, R.I., in 1983, fresh from earning
his degree at San Francisco State in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, we didn't earn a nickel,'' he said. ``There was no
shore team, so we also did all the work on the boats. We spent a
lot of time in bars and chasing girls. It was a nice, summertime
corinthian experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days, Cayard says, are long gone. ``When it's all said and
done, $300 million will have been spent on this regatta,'' he said.
``Our budget is $30 million. I'm in charge of a professional sports
team, which is how we approach things. We're in the gym at 5:30 in
the morning, before we hit the water. And now we have commercial
relationships with corporate sponsors and we sport signage on the
boats.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Cayard said, is that the cup's administration has
not kept pace with the competition's evolution. ``I think we need
to make a pretty big change to move this event into the 21st
century,'' he said. ``We have to make it competitive with other
sports-marketing options in the corporate world, like golf or
tennis. We need to get better at bringing it to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Cayard said ``the natural amphitheater'' of
San Francisco Bay would be an ideal venue to do so. Shortening the
course and organizing the racing into several quick heats _ as
opposed to a daily 18.5-mile race _ would, he said, be another way
to institute more crowd-pleasing action. But location and format
aside, Cayard said, ``The biggest move we need to make is to
separate the management of the event from the competitors and to
get some fresh thinking involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Deed of Gift that governs the racing was established
150 years ago, it was probably a good idea to give the defender so
much power,'' Cayard added. ``But now it's a big-money event, and
getting it paid for is tough. It would be easier if we created more
value, and there are lots of ways to do that. Maybe you'd have an
independent cup commissioner and run the thing every couple of
years, with qualifying events in between. Maybe the cost issue
needs to be addressed. But we need to better justify our
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the cup home to the St. Francis Yacht Club would give
Cayard a strong platform from which to instigate change. But he
said that even challenging for the cup is hardly a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give Prada a slight edge over us and New York's Young
America,'' he said. ``I rate the three of us ahead of the rest of
the challengers. But Prada has twice the budget and they've been
sailing both their new boats since June, so they know them well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's still a long way to go.''

BOARD REJECTS MEDICAL JOURNAL POWER PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After hours of bruising debate, the Massachusetts
Medical Society Saturday resoundingly rejected proposals by editors
of its New England Journal of Medicine and their defenders to give
future editors total control over the marketing of the journal's
name and logo.
</P>
<P>
   But in a concession to journal partisans, the society's House of
Delegates, by a 71-56 vote, set up a formal committee of medical
school and public health deans to arbitrate future disputes between
the New England Journal's editor-in-chief and the physician group's
officers and staff.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal of Medicine, published by the medical
society since 1921, is the most influential such publication in the
world, as measured by the number of times researchers cite its
content in their own reports. The New England Journal is also the
source of the great bulk of the medical society's $73 million
annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, a power struggle over commercial exploitation
of the journal's name and prestige has erupted between the medical
society and the journal that led to the firing of its
editor-in-chief, Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, last summer and mounting
doubt about its future.
</P>
<P>
   After the votes, medical society president Dr. Jack T. Evjy said
in an interview that ``when the dust settles, people will realize
that the House of Delegates has moved a long way in the direction
that they want to go'' in governing the New England Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's debate, at the organization's semiannual meeting,
occurred before 156 delegates. The society's House of Delegates
contains 535 delegates, but most do not attend business meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates' concession, in establishing the deans' committee,
came after an eleventh-hour plea by Dr. Marcia Angell, the interim
editor-in-chief of the journal, in which she warned of ``grave. .
.consequences,'' hinting at ``mass defections'' among the journal's
volunteer editorial advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Morton Schwartz of Massachusetts General Hospital, one of
the journal's unpaid associate editors, told the delegates that
such an ``implosion'' was narrowly avoided last summer only when
the medical society negotiated a contract with Angell that gives
her control over the use of the journal's name.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to extend the
same guarantees to Angell's successor, who is expected to be named
within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the journal's defenders, Dr. Paul Barach of Massachusetts
General Hospital, called the deans' committee ``a small gesture. .
.an olive branch'' to heal fractured relationships, following two
days of debate in which ``hatchets were pulled out of the closet
and lots of inflammatory statements were made.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates passed another resolution, intended to be
conciliatory, which states that the New England Journal's
editor-in-chief shall retain responsibility for ``any print or
electronic publications identified as the New England Journal of
medicine or as coming from the editors'' of the journal.
</P>
<P>
   However, Angell said that resolution side-stepped issues of
using the journal's prestige to market ``other products and
ventures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day,'' Dr. Allan Gorrell, a former medical society
president, said in an interview. ``They don't understand. They
think it's a power struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand perfectly,'' interjected Dr. Joseph Heyman,
another former society president, who was standing nearby. He
charged that journal partisans ``feel that somehow the New England
Journal of Medicine is tainted by its association with the
Massachusetts Medical Society.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Gorrell, noting that when he was president he had been
an enthusiastic proponent of new publishing ventures by the
society, said he had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is looking to us to see if the Massachusetts
Medical Society is going to exploit its treasured publication in an
attempt to maximize its income,'' Gorrell told fellow delegates.
``We can act as `Mass Medical, Inc.' or we can engage in public
policy formation. We can't do both.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a blistering response from Dr. James Kenealy, a
society trustee. ``Three years ago we were told that. . .new
publishing ventures were necessary to advance our educational
mission. I bought it hook, line, and sinker and I believe it to
this day. Now I'm being told I was a fool, that these ventures are
too entrepreneurial.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy over the New England Journal may not be over.
Journal editors said they will carry the debate over the next
editor's prerogatives to a search committee that has been set up to
write a job description and screen candidates. That committee,
which contains some US medical leaders who are not members of the
Massachusetts medical group, reportedly rejected one proposed job
description at its first meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
   In other actions Saturday, the medical society delegates:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ordered, after considerable debate, a feasibility study on how
a single-payer health system might be implemented in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Said that doctors ``should avoid accepting incentives by
pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, and health plans
that could influence prescription writing.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Voted to ``promote activities improving collegiality among
physicians.''

`NEXT TOWN' BROWN STOPS BY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To his coaching disciples, he is Yoda with a deeper and more
competitive wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   To his players, he is Yoda with a mandate that if you go with
The Force, it had better go in.
</P>
<P>
   To moving and storage companies, he is a legend.
</P>
<P>
   To a franchise, he is playoff revenue, a down payment on new
carpeting and a costume upgrade for the team mascot.
</P>
<P>
   To sports columnists, he is the runaway bride of NBA coaches.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, at press time, he is Larry Brown, coach of the
Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   And, with history as our guide, we can mention he's been known
to change his mind at the blistering pace of a kid with limited
toy-store credit.
</P>
<P>
   But we're not suggesting ``Next Town'' Brown is contemplating a
move that would lead to his 10th franchise or university in the
last 28 seasons. No, despite losing his two best post players to
injury and the cryogenic shooting of Jedi guard Allen Iverson,
Brown seems almost at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Brown said of teaching and coaching basketball.
``Especially when we're playing at home. I hate being away from my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when his place was here.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday offered a minor twist on the homecoming theme for
Brown, whose travelogue includes 117 regular-season games (and
back-to-back playoff cameos) as coach of the Clippers. When his
Sixers staggered into Staples Center with an 0-2 record, the
most-successful coach in Clips history represented the last lap in
a 10-day run that saw old relatives Danny Manning, Bob Weiss and
Brent Barry visit the franchise's new venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still kind of hard to see it as really theirs,'' said
Brown, referring to the $350 million building and the Clippers, who
seem like in-laws among Staples tenants. ``But it's long overdue.
Hopefully, the guys will take pride in it. They deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   With that generous sentiment as our theme, we now join Brown's
career highlights, already in progress:
</P>
<P>
   He is the only coach to push six different franchises into the
NBA playoffs. His two on-campus interludes produced a
national-championship game appearance for UCLA and an NCAA crown
for Kansas (1988, with Manning). He joined the Clippers in 1992,
directing 23 wins in 35 games, a feat that - when history is
measured, again - suggests Brown may have been able to reach
Catalina Island on foot.
</P>
<P>
   To the amazement of citizens in the basketball world, things
soured with the Clippers and owner Donald T. Sterling. So Brown
went to Indiana, where he spent four seasons alternately building
and alienating the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's in his third season with the potentially transcendent
Iverson and a brutally ordinary batch 76ers, who mustered a playoff
series victory over Orlando last season.
</P>
<P>
   Now taking the lead in our look at Brown is one of his assistant
coaches, John Calipari, who served as an apprentice at Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't changed a bit,'' said Calipari, a hoop sharpie who
created the UMass basketball powerhouse, drove it to the Final
Four, then bowed to the siren's song of the New Jersey Nets, who
fired him in what seems like a premature jerking of the ownership
knee. ``He's always wanting to know more. He's never satisfied. And
he never compromises what he believes in. If a big star messes up,
he going to hear about it, just like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Brown may sound a bit obsessed, but that could be an
occupational qualification. All that's required to measure his
effectiveness is testimony from his co-workers. Not a discouraging
word is heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great friend and a great mentor,'' Calipari said.
</P>
<P>
   And a pretty damn good coach.
</P>
<P>
   Brown seems content to be defined, simply, as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good living,'' he said. ``It's like stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that we just may be what we eat, Seattle's Gary
Payton and Vernon Maxwell were seen mowing down hot dogs one hour
before tip-off at Staples Center. Now we're wondering if the
Knicks' dressing room can be equipped with jerk chicken. ... Since
reporting that a Chinese national team featuring 7-foot-6,
19-year-old Yao Ming was scheduled to take on UCLA in an exhibition
game at Pauley Pavilion, we've been informed the Chinese team's
visit has been canceled. ... According to coaches and teammates,
the only thing preventing 76ers' sophomore Larry Hughes from
becoming an outstanding player is a huge thing the warrior attitude
toward work. ... Former Clippers assistant coach Jim Brewer, who
was not fired by Chris Ford, contrary to a recent and careless
report in a hoop trade publication, has a scouting gig with nephew
Doc Rivers and the Orlando Magic. Brewer's contract was not renewed
by the Clippers (you may need to sit down for this) as an
owner-inspired commitment to down-sizing.
</P>
<P>
   ... Former Laker, Clipper and Summer Pro League favorite Antonio
Harvey is getting paid by the Portland Trail Blazers as insurance
at power forward, with an occasional tour at center. ``I'm already
getting fitted for my championship ring,'' Harvey said. ... Due to
injury, changes in philosophy and business in Beirut, Lebanon, more
than one-third of the league's opening-night starting centers were
card-carrying power forwards. ... After reports of a noisy
confrontation in a Miami hotel, Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman
were removed from the scene by in handcuffs by police; there was no
indication as to whether or not the handcuffs were present when
officers arrived. ... According to Detroit witnesses who watched
him smoke Indiana's Jalen Rose among others in pickup games, a
college freshman with much game is unheralded University of Detroit
guard Willie Green. ... According to exhibition-season stats,
ex-Clipper Rodney Rogers has been born again in Phoenix. But after
following a 21-point effort on opening night with a 1-point salvo
in Game 2, Rodney seems pretty much the same. ... Clippers owner
Donald T. Sterling now is in the crosshairs of Sports Illustrated
research for a story on his sage basketball maneuvers. But if the
magazine decides Sterling should grace its cover, how will we know
when the dreaded SI jinx kicks in?

FAMILIES GET FIRST LOOK AT EGYPTAIR JET'S WRECKAGE

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ As the Navy seized a brief lull in pitching seas
Saturday to search for the black boxes of EgyptAir Flight 990, the
weary, grieving families of the crash victims received their first
glimpse of the plane's wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Transported in buses to a former Navy facility across
Narragansett Bay, 300 relatives, some of them screaming and crying,
gazed at more than 6,000 shards of wings, fuselage, and other
remnants of the Boeing 767 displayed in two warehouse-size tents at
Quonset Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw cannot be expressed in words,'' said a tearful
Abdelmoneim Abdelmoneim, whose parents perished last Sunday among
the 271 aboard the New York-to-Cairo flight. ``You cannot recognize
anything. It is in small pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us started praying. We accept the will of God,'' said
Wahid Elzoghby, who works for an Egyptian newspaper. ``It was
written it had to happen, unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   For many family members, initially stunned last week that they
would not be able to view the bodies of the victims, the trip to
Quonset Point was a painful affirmation of the total loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt through their hearts and their eyes, yes, it's reality.
It is not any more of a mystery,'' said Ahmed el Hattab, assistant
secretary general of the Islamic Society of North America. ``It was
a smart move to bring people there.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before relatives viewed the wreckage, the USS Grapple
lowered the robot Deep Drone into 270-foot waters 60 miles south of
Nantucket. The remote-controlled device is being used to locate and
retrieve the flight-data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, which
should provide key evidence about the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The drone is believed to have come close to the boxes Friday,
but pitch-black conditions and worsening weather combined to slow
and then halt the search. The boxes' pinging signals were detected
about 15 feet apart on a silty bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, gusting winds and rolling seas diminished enough by 1
p.m. to allow the Grapple to take advantage of tolerable weather
that government forecasters said might not reoccur until Tuesday.
The search continued into the night.
</P>
<P>
   The winds had slowed to 18 knots, and the waves had dropped to 8
feet by early afternoon, weather officials said. Those conditions
are near the limits at which the drone can be operated effectively.
</P>
<P>
   James Hoke, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's marine prediction center, said conditions were
expected to worsen Saturday night, with wind gusts of 30 to 35
knots and ocean swells of up to 13 feet after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said Saturday he is optimistic the black boxes can be
retrieved intact. But after their retrieval, Hall cautioned, the
investigation could be a ``long, long process.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustrating delays and shortened work schedule are not
expected to increase the chances of damage to the black boxes or
other key clues to the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not overly concerned that we're losing information,''
said Lauren Peduzzi, spokeswoman for the NTSB. The black boxes,
actually bright orange containers for the flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder, are shielded by titanium and are designed
to withstand the rigors of deep-sea pressure and the corrosive
effects of salt water.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of the plane itself, which should bear clues about the
crash, should not deteriorate over a few days or even weeks in
which the Navy and Coast Guard tussle with the elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took over a year to get parts of TWA Flight 800, and they
still got information off of that,'' Peduzzi said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Navy and Coast Guard went about their work in the
Atlantic, a senior EgyptAir official defended the airline's
performance record.
</P>
<P>
   Samir el Shanawany, general manager for North America
operations, said the Boeing 767 met all Federal Aviation
Administration requirements. He said all relevant maintenance data
would be turned over to American investigators for review.
</P>
<P>
   Shanawany reiterated his confidence in the crew, including pilot
Ahmed el Habashy, with whom he was personally close during more
than 30 years service with EgyptAir. Shanawany said Habashy, whom
he called ``one of the best 767 pilots when it comes to
competence,'' had logged more than 6,000 hours of flight time on
767s.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir has never had a reverse thruster malfunction in flight,
Shanawany said, referring to a potential contributing factor
mentioned by some aviation specialists. One of Flight 990's reverse
thrusters, used to slow the aircraft during landing, was
disconnected Oct. 28 because EgyptAir mechanics did not have a
spare part to stop a hydraulic-fluid leak.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few family members had left Newport by Saturday evening,
and more relatives were expected to arrive for a memorial service
here Sunday. EgyptAir officials said they anticipate many family
members will depart after the memorial.

EGYPTAIR CRASH MAY REVIVE QUESTION OF UNIVERSAL RULES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ Few industries have more need for
a single set of rules worldwide than aviation, since airlines fly
similar equipment through shared skies, over the homes and offices
of unprotected civilians. The problem, as planes from 185 nations
fly overhead, is who should inspect and enforce the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir crash last Sunday may raise the issue again,
depending on what investigators find in the wreckage and in records
on shore. Even before the crash, it was clear that much of the most
important regulating work was done by governments that the Federal
Aviation Administration has doubts about, in a program that the
National Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge of the
EgyptAir investigation, says is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The question of regulation has been pressed since January 1990,
when an Avianca jet bound for Kennedy International Airport ran out
of fuel over Cove Neck, N.Y., and crashed there, largely because
the crew, unfamiliar with American procedures, did not declare an
emergency. The FAA then began an ambitious effort to monitor the
safety of foreign carriers flying to this country.
</P>
<P>
   But just last week, the National Transportation Safety Board
said that effort was not working. In a meeting scheduled long
before the EgyptAir crash, the board met in Washington on Tuesday
to wrap up work in the 1997 crash of Korean Air Lines 801, a Boeing
747 that flew into a hilltop a few miles short of the runway in
Guam, an American territory. The board mostly cited the crew for
the accident, which killed 226 people, but it also said some of the
cause lay with the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a program instituted after the Avianca crash, the
board concluded, ``The Federal Aviation Administration's
International Aviation Safety Assessment Program is not adequate to
determine whether foreign air carriers operating in to the United
States are maintaining an adequate level of safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's effort has always had problems, not least of which is
that it must step gingerly around an international agreement,
signed in 1944, when governments realized that with World War II
having spawned Boeing's B-29 Superfortresses and Messerschmitt's
jets, there was soon going to be a transportation system that would
rival that of ocean liners. So they established the International
Civil Aviation Organization, which now has 185 members, each
pledging to maintain minimum standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a very long time, it was generally accepted, sort of a
gentlemen's agreement, that everybody would be faithful to the
rules,'' said Barry Valentine, who served as acting administrator
of the Federal Aviation Administration for several years in the
mid-1990s. Avianca, the Colombian airline, he said, demonstrated
that reliance on underdeveloped countries to police their airlines
was not enough to meet safety standards minimally acceptable to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA program is roundabout. It does not actually assess
the airlines, but the ability of foreign civil aviation authorities
_ the FAA's counterparts abroad _ to police their airlines.
</P>
<P>
   There are three divisions: Category 1, countries that meet ICAO
standards; Category 2, countries that do not meet the standards but
had airlines already flying to the United States when the program
began and have been allowed to continue; and Category 3, countries
that do not meet the standards and have the authority by treaty to
fly to the United States but do not.
</P>
<P>
   Since the program was instituted, 14 countries have been
promoted to Category 1 from Category 2. One, Bangladesh, was
reclassified to 2, from 1.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, home to Korean Air Lines, is in Category 1, as is
Egypt. (The cause of the EgyptAir crash is unknown and may not, in
fact, have to do with Egyptian regulation.)
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is not on the list at all, because no treaty allows
its airlines to fly to the United States; Zimbabwe is in Category
3, as are Belize, Congo, Haiti, Honduras, Kiribati, Malta,
Nicaragua, Paraguay, Suriname, Swaziland and Uruguay, according to
the FAA's Web site. In many of those countries, there is no law
giving the civilian agency the authority to regulate airlines, or
the agency lacks the resources to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve countries are in Category 2, including Columbia, Costa
Rica, the Czech Republic and Pakistan; they are allowed to keep
flying, but not to expand frequency or routes, or to use bigger
planes than they fly now.
</P>
<P>
   Prime responsibility for the ``airworthiness'' of a plane rests
with the nation where it is registered. Many foreign carriers fly
American-registered planes because they are leased from companies
based here, but most fly planes registered in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA does inspect foreign planes when they land at American
airports, but with about 200 airlines flying here from outside
North America, inspections are infrequent. Peggy Gilligan, the
FAA's deputy associate administrator for regulation and
certification, asked to characterize her agency's oversight of
airlines like EgyptAir, said: ``I don't like the word `minimal.'
It's a small number of required surveillances.''
</P>
<P>
   When the inspectors do spot checks on foreign airplanes, they
are generally brief, but FAA inspectors sometimes find that those
planes lack equipment that the United States demands but that is
not required elsewhere. One example is aisle-path lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper questions, like whether crew members are trained to work
as a team, are outside the scope of the agency's oversight.

 EDITORIAL: JOHN McCAIN'S MESSAGE 
 (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Much of the recent coverage of Sen. John McCain has focused on
his gains against Gov. George W. Bush and on the question of his
temperament. Both subjects deserve attention, but they should not
obscure another part of the McCain story. One reason his candidacy
has traction is that voters seem to be responding to his
old-fashioned outrage about a campaign fund-raising system that is
simply legalized influence-peddling. In this sense, McCain is
moving his campaign forward with an issue that, according to the
barons of conventional wisdom, holds no interest for voters.
</P>
<P>
   Much of McCain's rhetoric has been aimed at explaining, in
biting tones, how the Republican and conservative agenda has itself
gotten sidetracked by the party's own addiction to the unlimited
corporate contributions called soft money. In New Hampshire, for
example, McCain declared: ``We are all shortchanged by soft money,
liberal and conservative alike.''
</P>
<P>
   On his own campaign-fiance bill, co-sponsored with Sen. Russell
Feingold, a Democrat, McCain speaks with anti-corporate fervor
reminiscent of the old populists: ``Today, special interests and
their unlimited campaign funds dominate Washington. Only by
breaking their chokehold on the White House and Congress can we
lower taxes, eliminate pork-barrel spending and return government
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, McCain has drawn a crucial connection between
campaign donations and bad laws _ showing how subsidies and
benefits for ethanol and the oil and gas industries, direct results
of big campaign donations, have siphoned money that could be used
for a test of school vouchers, or how special tax breaks for
campaign donors block across-the-board tax cuts that could be
enjoyed by all Americans. Cynics are beginning to note that McCain
himself has benefited from campaign donations as chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign contributions at all levels are, of course, a problem.
But the donations received by McCain meet the federal ceilings of
$1,000 for an individual and $5,000 for a political action
committee. His legislation would ban unlimited donations to
political parties by individuals and all such donations by unions
and corporations, often in the range of $100,000 or more, which are
vastly more corrupting.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate debate on the McCain-Feingold bill last month,
Mitch McConnell, the Senate GOP's fund-raiser in chief, demanded
that his Arizona colleague name names or stop using the word
``corruption.'' McCain cannily replied by citing the 1996
Republican Party platform, which accused the Democrats of selling
out to ``special interest groups.''
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats are guilty of corruption because of big donations
from unions and trial lawyers, McCain shot back, why is it not
acceptable to say that Republicans are equally corrupted by
donations from other special interests? Reform is much talked about
in presidential elections, but McCain has a road map to get to that
goal. Surely the upward trend of his poll numbers is testimony that
the voters are listening.

RULING LEAVES MICROSOFT VULNERABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Microsoft Corp.'s stunning legal defeat on Friday, the
world's largest software company suddenly appears battered and
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   But, industry watchers say, the rapid rise of the Internet and
an array of new software products already began eroding the
company's power well before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued
his stern rebuke, labelling Microsoft a monopoly intent on harming
its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives have acknowledged the firm's dominant role
among software makers but have argued that it faces decay or even
destruction in an ever-changing technology world where new
companies seem to arise overnight. While some of Microsoft's
statements undoubtedly constitute public relations spin, the view
of the company as an embattled giant contains more than a little
truth, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the arguments that is sometimes made about Microsoft's
power is that their presence is so intimidating that no one else
could get a toehold,'' says Stephen Margolis, an economist and
coauthor of a book on Microsoft. ``Well, there sure are a hell of a
lot of toeholds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the two years during which the US Justice Department
has pursued its massive antitrust case, the focus of the computer
industry has shifted from the desktop systems where Microsoft
dominates. PCs will be a huge global business for years to come,
but it's a mature market with relatively little room for major
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a surging market in non-PC devices such as hand-held
computers has blossomed, based on software Microsoft doesn't
control. An upstart computer operating system called Linux,
assembled by amateurs in their spare time, is gaining ground once
safely held by Microsoft. And Internet businesses are generating
billions in sales, competing head-to-head against Microsoft's
on-line offerings _ and usually winning.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft became a giant through the success of its Windows
operating systems, the basic software that run computers. But on
the Internet, any operating system will do _ even one built by
basement computer hackers in their spare time. Jackson, in a
``finding of facts,'' found that Microsoft had attempted to expand
its market dominance onto the Internet. Indeed, Microsoft has
developed its own on-line network and a host of Internet retail
services. But aggressive independents like Yahoo, America Online
Inc., and eBay have easily outperformed Microsoft's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has tried to compete in the booming market for
hand-held computers, but devices based on Microsoft's Windows CE
hand-held operating system collect dust on store shelves, while
3Com Inc. sells millions of its Palm Pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would actually argue that Microsoft's relative importance to
the computer industry has already begun to decline, for reasons
that are no fault of Microsoft,'' said Rob Joseph, equity analyst
for State Street Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft trotted out these points at the trial, hoping to
persuade Jackson it has too much competition to be a monopoly. The
judge was unimpressed, saying that Windows still has a monopoly in
desktop computer operating systems and has abused that monopoly to
gain footholds in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hegemony on the desktop still matters,'' said Microsoft critic
Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry
Association. ``The most valuable piece of real estate on the planet
is not in Monaco; it's the Windows desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Microsoft's decision to put a link on the desktop to
its own on-line service, the Microsoft Network, sparked an intense
controversy in 1995. Critics of the company said this policy would
ensure that new computer users would sign up with the Microsoft
Network rather than with rivals such as AOL.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't happen. AOL is by far the biggest Internet
provider in the world, with 20 million users, compared with the
Microsoft Network's 2 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Such facts don't impress Ed Black, president of the Computer and
Communications Industry Association, which represents hardware and
software firms. He says the only reason why Microsoft hasn't
overwhelmed its Internet-based rivals is because it was afraid to
risk the further wrath of the Justice Department. ``They have, in
the course of the trial, pulled back a little bit from some of the
most abusive and destructive practices,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Wasch notes that with its cash hoard of $5 billion, Microsoft is
still buying its way into key positions in many high-tech markets,
such as cable television systems that provide Internet access. With
that kind of wealth and power, Wasch believes it is absurd to view
Microsoft as a company in crisis. ``They maintain control over the
computer manufacturers who need a Windows license to remain in
business,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But for how long? Consider the booming Linux market. This
alternative to Microsoft's Windows operating system was practically
unknown to computer users in October 1997 when the Justice
Department sued Microsoft for antitrust violations. Less than two
years later, 13 percent of respondents to a survey by International
Data Corp. said they were using Linux in their corporate networks.
Most of the world's biggest computer vendors now sell some machines
with Linux pre-installed instead of Windows; most of the world's
biggest software companies are making Linux versions of their key
products.
</P>
<P>
   Every sale of a Linux-based system means one less potential
customer for Windows 2000, Microsoft's product for corporate server
computers. Windows 2000, the biggest and most costly product
Microsoft has ever devised, still languishes in the lab. Due for
release last year, it won't be in stores until next year. And every
day's delay gives Linux more time to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   None of this impressed Jackson, who will follow his findings
with rulings on whether Microsoft used its monopoly power to
violate antitrust laws. He dismissed competition from Linux as
still too feeble to seriously threaten Microsoft's power.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis sees it differently. His objectivity is open to
question; Microsoft subsidized some of his research. But Margolis
also works in the back yard of Red Hat Software Inc., the leading
distributor of Linux. Red Hat went public three months ago, and now
has a market capitalization of $6 billion. Margolis thinks that
every one of those dollars is a bet that Microsoft can't dominate
the operating system business forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says that there are a number of people who do believe that
this is an important market development,'' Margolis said. ``It also
shows that capital markets will fund an enterprise that competes
against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Other challengers loom on every side. Microsoft was caught
unawares by the dramatic success of the pocket-sized Palm Pilot
personal organizer. The company responded by creating a
``lightweight'' version of Windows _ Windows CE _ and persuading
major electronics firms to use it to develop competing pocket-sized
products. But Windows CE has managed to gain only about a quarter
of the market, with Palm-based devices holding most of the rest.
One manufacturer, Philips Electronics, abandoned its Windows CE
machine, the Nino, last month because of slow sales.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also facing a bold challenge from Sun Microsystems
Inc., the same company that is suing Microsoft over control of the
Java computer software system. Java threatens Microsoft because
programs written in Java can run on any kind of computer, not just
a Windows PC. Now, Sun has purchased Star Division, a German
software maker, and has begun giving away the company's office
software suite over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sun hopes to use Star Office to break Microsoft's stranglehold
on office software like spreadsheets, the other business where
Microsoft holds a near-monopoly. Firms such as Cambridge's Lotus
Development Corp. have failed to challenge Microsoft in office
software. But by giving away the product, Sun is borrowing a
classic Microsoft tactic in an effort to cut off its air supply _
40 percent of Microsoft's revenues last year came from its office
software sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sun eventually plans to offer Star's office software suite for
use over the Internet. Instead of having a word processor on each
worker's computer, Sun would contract with companies to store the
software on a server. Workers would run the software remotely as
needed. Under this model, Sun would make its money by providing the
servers that run the software; the programs themselves would be
free.
</P>
<P>
   These challenges didn't exist when the Justice Department sued
Microsoft two years ago. Combined with Microsoft's stinging defeat
in round one of the case, they put the company in an unusually
perilous position. But even staunch Microsoft critics say it will
remain a major corporate power for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ferguson, who sold Cambridge-based software maker
Vermeer Technologies to Microsoft in 1996, thinks Microsoft should
be broken into two companies. But Ferguson thinks the two pieces
would still be key industry players. ``The successor companies to
Microsoft,'' Ferguson says, ``will continue to be important for the
next couple of decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston investment analyst Joe Hosler doesn't think it'll come to
that. But he agrees Microsoft will prosper despite its current
troubles. ``I've never seen a more motivated, more focused group of
people,'' Hosler says. ``To assume this is going to knock them down
_ I don't think it can.''

RULING LEAVES MICROSOFT VULNERABLE 
</HEADLINE>

 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Microsoft Corp.'s stunning legal defeat Friday, the
world's largest software company suddenly appears battered and
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   But, industry watchers say, the rapid rise of the Internet and
an array of new software products already began eroding the
company's power well before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued
his stern rebuke, labelling Microsoft a monopoly intent on harming
its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives have acknowledged the firm's dominant role
among software makers but have argued that it faces decay or even
destruction in an ever-changing technology world where new
companies seem to arise overnight. While some of Microsoft's
statements undoubtedly constitute public relations spin, the view
of the company as an embattled giant contains more than a little
truth, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the arguments that is sometimes made about Microsoft's
power is that their presence is so intimidating that no one else
could get a toehold,'' says Stephen Margolis, an economist and
coauthor of a book on Microsoft. ``Well, there sure are a hell of a
lot of toeholds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the two years during which the US Justice Department
has pursued its massive antitrust case, the focus of the computer
industry has shifted from the desktop systems where Microsoft
dominates. PCs will be a huge global business for years to come,
but it's a mature market with relatively little room for major
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a surging market in non-PC devices such as hand-held
computers has blossomed, based on software Microsoft doesn't
control. An upstart computer operating system called Linux,
assembled by amateurs in their spare time, is gaining ground once
safely held by Microsoft. And Internet businesses are generating
billions in sales, competing head-to-head against Microsoft's
on-line offerings _ and usually winning.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft became a giant through the success of its Windows
operating systems, the basic software that run computers. But on
the Internet, any operating system will do _ even one built by
basement computer hackers in their spare time. Jackson, in a
``finding of facts,'' found that Microsoft had attempted to expand
its market dominance onto the Internet. Indeed, Microsoft has
developed its own on-line network and a host of Internet retail
services. But aggressive independents like Yahoo, America Online
Inc., and eBay have easily outperformed Microsoft's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has tried to compete in the booming market for
hand-held computers, but devices based on Microsoft's Windows CE
hand-held operating system collect dust on store shelves, while
3Com Inc. sells millions of its Palm Pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would actually argue that Microsoft's relative importance to
the computer industry has already begun to decline, for reasons
that are no fault of Microsoft,'' said Rob Joseph, equity analyst
for State Street Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft trotted out these points at the trial, hoping to
persuade Jackson it has too much competition to be a monopoly. The
judge was unimpressed, saying that Windows still has a monopoly in
desktop computer operating systems and has abused that monopoly to
gain footholds in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hegemony on the desktop still matters,'' said Microsoft critic
Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry
Association. ``The most valuable piece of real estate on the planet
is not in Monaco; it's the Windows desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Microsoft's decision to put a link on the desktop to
its own on-line service, the Microsoft Network, sparked an intense
controversy in 1995. Critics of the company said this policy would
ensure that new computer users would sign up with the Microsoft
Network rather than with rivals such as AOL.

 &HT;    Earnhardt Jr. clinches title
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. _ Jeff Gordon took the checkered flag at the
Outback Steakhouse 200 at Phoenix International Raceway, but Dale
Earnhardt Jr. was the biggest winner Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt finished second, which was good enough to clinch the
Busch Grand National title with one race remaining. It is the
second Busch title in a row for Earnhardt, who will move up to
Winston Cup next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we won the Busch championship last year, there wasn't as
much pressure because I was a rookie,'' Earnhardt said. ``This
season, because we were the defending champions, there was
definitely added pressure. Fortunately, we were able to do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   FUTURE IS NOW
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd will drive the No. 28 Ford of Robert Yates Racing
next year, but he is receiving help this season from his future
employer. Rudd put a Yates engine in his No. 10 Ford at Talladega
and finished third. He'll be using the borrowed motors for the last
three races this season, including today's Dura Lube 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to beat up on the engine builders we've had, but Yates is
just a step above everybody else,'' Rudd said. ``If you do have a
car that's at its peak, and it is capable of winning, and you've
got a fifth-place motor, you're probably gonna run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least when you've got a (Yates) motor, you can forget about
that being part of the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd has to win one of the remaining Winston Cup races to extend
his streak of at least one victory per season for the past 16
years. He thinks the Yates engine will help his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what I am counting on,'' Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine ill
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Bodine qualified so well on Friday, earning the No. 3
spot for today's race, that it is hard to believe he is suffering
from flu symptoms. Bodine said he knew he wasn't healthy when he
started vomiting during a flight from Charlotte, N.C., to Las Vegas
on Tuesday night. Bodine went from the airplane to a 2 a.m.
doctor's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 60 Chevy driver spent the next two days in bed, except
for a hospital visit Thursday for another doctor's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine mustered up enough strength to participate in the
first-round of qualifying. He captured the No. 3 position. Bodine
also started third at Martinsville for the NAPA AutoCare 500 and
finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better,'' Bodine said Saturday. ``I've been struggling up
and down. One minute, I feel good and the other moment I don't
quite feel as good. But I feel pretty darn good right now. My crew
gave me some water (after practice on Saturday), and it pepped me
up. So if I can avoid becoming dehydrated, then I should be fine.''

 &HT;    Waltrip proves worth
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. _ Darrell Waltrip made the field for today's
Dura Lube 500 at Phoenix International Raceway, and he didn't need
a provisional.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, who has failed to qualify in four of six Winston Cup
races, stood on his first-round qualifying speed of 130.766 mph for
the No. 30 spot in today's 43-car field. He will be able to save
his last provisional for the Miami 400 or the NAPA 500 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll race good here in the desert,'' Waltrip said. ``This has
been one of my best race tracks through the years. I've got seven
top 10 finishes here (in the past 11 years).''
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying laps have been a disaster for the former three-time
Winston Cup champion. Waltrip has failed to make the field six
times.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford No. 66 driver is retiring after a farewell tour that
has been dubbed ``Victory Tour 2000.'' Waltrip, who has not won a
race since 1992, finds himself constantly on the defensive about
remaining competitive as an aging driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 52,'' he said. ``And if I was to reverse that around and I
was 25, if I don't have the car to get the job done, then it don't
matter who you are or what you've ever done, you just can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pieces to this puzzle that are missing, and the
driver ain't one of 'em. I can drive the wheels off any race car if
it's a good car. I've proven that time and time again. So I don't
feel that it's something personally that I'm not getting the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip and car owner Travis Carter blame the new team, which
was formed at the beginning of this season, for Waltrip's problems.
Carter recently took over the crew chief duties for Philippe Lopez,
who still is employed by the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philippe had too much pressure on him,'' Waltrip said. ``We
were trying to do too much _ trying to build a shop, trying to
build a team, and trying to build cars. And it was driving poor ol'
Philippe crazy. He was smoking eight packs of cigarettes per day.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``And it has helped Philippe, he has been a lot easier to work
with. We've gotten a lot better on our communication and everything
is going great.''
</P>
<P>
   The team relations have appeared to improve, but only after some
heart-to-heart talks between Waltrip and Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, you've got to remember, it's hard to teach an
old dog new tricks,'' Carter said. ``And he's an old guy _ excuse
me, an older guy _ set in his ways. I think he's had to really step
back and say, `You know, maybe the way that I think everything
should be done is not the way it needs to be done today.'''

 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Derek Anderson wasn't fitted for Clipper battle
dress until this season, but he's heard stories around the
campfire.
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories.
</P>
<P>
   Stories about the Clippers' league-record-tying, 17-game losing
streak to open the post-lockout season.
</P>
<P>
   The macabre tales of gruesome basketball made Friday's 91-81
victory over Philadelphia seem more crucial than civilians might
imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was very important,'' Anderson, the shooting guard
acquired from Cleveland in the sign-and-trade of Lamond Murray,
said of his new team's first triumph. ``Each loss makes it tougher
to get that first win. We had to get this one, especially with Utah
(Monday) and almighty San Antonio (Wednesday) coming in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who is averaging a tick under 19 points per game, made
15 of 17 free-throw attempts against the 76ers, who were without
center Matt Geiger and rejection-happy power forward Theo Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have any shot-blockers,'' he said, ``so it was
just a matter of taking it to the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   (sub) Date with Destiny
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate their first victory, Lamar Odom's 20th birthday and
the joy of rested legs, the Clippers had Saturday off.
</P>
<P>
   So how was Odom - who leads after the first round of the NBA's
Rookie of the Year survival test - planning to send off his
teen-age years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just spend the day with my daughter,'' he said of 1-year-old
Destiny. ``Then get ready for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, it should be noted, has been more than ready for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lamar plays the right way,'' Philadelphia coach Larry Brown
said of the Clips' prized rookie. ``He reminds me a lot of Danny
(Manning) when I had him at Kansas. He and (Phoenix rookie) Shawn
Marion are two of the special young players.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who is averaging over 23 points and 9 rebounds in three
games, plans to improve by applying a few lessons learned by a few
of the special older players.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest challenge in his short career was provided in
Portland by Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the league's good,'' Odom said, ``but Pippen is
sooo good. You can tell he was a student of Mister Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   (sub) Fast breaks
</P>
<P>
   Michael Olowokandi has blocked 12 shots in three games, but has
managed just 7 rebounds and 8 points in two games after
opening-night totals of 16 and 6. ``We talked to Michael at
practice and told him that he had to show up,'' Taylor said before
Olowokandi blocked six shots but went scoreless against Philly.
``We need his production.'' ...Tyrone Nesby has been tagged with 16
fouls in 70 minutes. ... Odom is averaging 43 minutes per game, but
said he's looking forward to the demands of an 82-game schedule.
``I'm eating well, sleeping well ... I feel great.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The general managers' meetings officially kick off
today at Dana Point, which means it's time for the Dodgers to lay
the foundation for the moves they wish to make to transform their
roster into something resembling a winning ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Boys in Blue can think about making a run at the
playoffs next season, the focus is the three B's _ balance in the
lineup, bench depth and bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Dodgers' early energy will be spent pursuing Toronto
outfielder Shawn Green, who's a free agent after the 2000 season.
The price tag for Green would be lofty, both in money and players.
</P>
<P>
   And there's competition for Green. The Colorado Rockies have
talked to Toronto general manager Gord Ash about Green, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Green recently turned down a five-year, $50 million contract,
and sources said any deal with the Dodgers would have to come with
Green signing a long-term deal. The Dodgers would, in all
likelihood, have to part with right-hander Ismael Valdes and
outfielder Raul Mondesi in a deal for Green.
</P>
<P>
   While the new Dodgers regime saw the rap on Valdes _ that he
isn't mentally tough enough to be the front-line starter scouts
think he can be _ come to fruition, they aren't sold on moving
Mondesi. Despite a subpar year filled with turmoil and a trade
demand, Mondesi was still last season's first 30-homer, 30-stolen
base major-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   And though Mondesi met with Dodgers officials during the season
and his agent, Jeff Moorad, afterward, the trade demand wasn't
rescinded. However, recently anointed Dodgers chairman and CEO
Robert Daly said he wasn't sold on trading the ultra-talented
Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel any burning desire that we have to get rid of
Mondesi,'' Daly said. ``There isn't anybody in the organization who
says we have to get rid of Mondesi.''
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Dodgers a little more than a week ago, Daly
has bent the ear of general manager Kevin Malone about everything
the club needs to do. Daly gives Malone rein to make moves, but all
deals must be signed off on by Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to do anything to take away from Kevin's
responsibility or (manager) Davey (Johnson's) responsibility,''
Daly said. ``Kevin is going to the GM meetings and talking with the
other general managers. He's our general manager. He's our guy. As
I've said (before), I let people do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The big splash could come from an acquisition the magnitude of
Green. His left-handed bat would break up the Dodgers'
righty-dominated lineup that Johnson spoke about on a near-daily
basis last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson also spent a large portion of last season talking
about the need for strength in the bullpen and on the bench, and
it's imperative the Dodgers don't lose sight of improving those
areas, too.
</P>
<P>
   Production off the Dodgers' bench last season was relegated to
left-hitting pinch-hitter Dave Hansen and an occasional fill-in by
Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen deteriorated quickly. As the season wore on, Johnson
seemed to trust only closer Jeff Shaw and set-up men Alan Mills and
Pedro Borbon in crucial situations. One area in which the Dodgers
need help is left-handed power pitching, and Baltimore free agent
Arthur Rhodes, coming off a dismal season, could find his way to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more options,'' Malone said. ``Last year we had six
outfielders on our 40-man roster. We didn't have any options.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE LONG SEARCH FOR A CIVILIZED WAY TO KILL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ohio, N.Y., Ga., Ala., Neb.)  (rk) 
 By DUDLEY CLENDINEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial observer for Sunday,
Nov. 7:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1923, just eight years before Hollywood made
``Frankenstein,'' about the use of giant blasts of electricity to
jolt life from the dead, that the state of Florida began to
electrocute people who had been tried and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of rural areas like the countryside around the state
prison, in north-central Florida, had yet to receive electric
power. But from Florida oak, inmates at the prison made a chair,
fitted with cables and electrodes, leather cuffs and straps and a
metal hat. Wired to a generator, it delivered 2,300 volts, at high
amperage, directly to the brain when the executioner pulled a
switch on the control panel. The executioners were hooded white
men, paid volunteers. The first five electrocutions were all of
black men, and so were five of the next six.
</P>
<P>
   The state electric chair was supposed to be a humane advance, an
improvement on the habit of hanging people, county by county, in
public squares. But from the beginning, it was also the symbol of
the obliterating power of the state, the instrument of an arbitrary
and biased system, and a violent and sometimes unreliable means to
conflicting political ends. In Ohio, in the late 1870s, electricity
had been used to shock prisoners made to sit naked in pans of
water. It was in New York, in 1887, that a legislative commission
asked Thomas Edison if electricity could provide a more civilized
execution than rope.
</P>
<P>
   Edison was opposed to capital punishment, and he was an
aggressive businessman. He understood, as Hollywood would later,
that this was about image as well as technology, and so, as his
biographer Robert Conot wrote, he persuaded New York authorities
that the equipment of George Westinghouse, his competitor, was
better suited to deliver killing amounts of voltage than his own.
From its very first application in New York in 1890, which killed
William Kemmler with flames and smoke and violent convulsions,
there was a scary, primitive quality about electrocution. ``They
could have done it better with an axe,'' Westinghouse said.
</P>
<P>
   But as electric chairs were built and wired in 26 states, his
company was stuck with the association. Then, in the 1960s and
'70s, capital punishment itself came under attack in the courts. By
the time the Supreme Court struck down all state death penalty laws
as unconstitutionally vague and arbitrary in 1972, Florida had
electrocuted 196 men. Two-thirds were black.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty had always been popular in the South. The
Florida Legislature was the first to redraft its state law to meet
constitutional objections. As the death row population built up
again on R Wing of the Florida State Prison in the late '70s and
spilled onto Q Wing, where the chair was, I won permission to spend
time there as a reporter. It was a strained and distorted world, of
men from adolescent to elderly, polite to homicidal, loquacious to
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Each was kept in a 9-foot-by-6-foot steel and concrete cell. In
July and August, temperatures hovered around 100 degrees. Each man
got a black-and-white TV, two hours in the exercise yard each week,
and one shower. Some of them got drunk on Saturday afternoons on
orange juice fermented with sugar and heat. Others bribed the
guards and got stoned, smoking marijuana cigarettes in the sun in
the exercise yard. Some tried suicide. Others religion.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the new Florida law was found constitutional, and
Gov. Bob Graham signed the first death warrant, in May 1979, no one
could remember how the electric chair worked. The prison system
called Westinghouse, which sent an anonymous consultant in an
unmarked truck. It was in the Florida electric chair, on May 29,
that the first convict was put to death against his will in the
United States in a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   He was John Spenkelink, 30, who had murdered a worse criminal
than he. Spenkelink was handsome, white, polite, and had no issues
on appeal. He had declined to join others on the Row in a lawsuit,
he told me, because one man was homosexual, and another a child
molester.
</P>
<P>
   The homosexual was electrocuted next, the child molester later.
As the list of executions grew, other states began to change, first
to the gas chamber, and then to the even calmer method of lethal
injection, and the Florida electric chair began to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 and 1997, when Jesse Tafero and then Pedro Medina were
electrocuted, blue and orange flames shot out from behind their
masks. Thick smoke billowed around Medina, and white smoke rose
from the right ankle of Judy Buenoano, the first women
electrocuted, in 1998. The prison system that year built a new
wooden chair, but kept the same old wiring.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida attorney general and a majority of the State Supreme
Court urged the state to switch to lethal injection, but Gov. Jeb
Bush supported the chair, and the Legislature voted to keep it
unless the courts decided it was cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after blood flowed from behind the mask when Allen Lee
Davis was electrocuted in July _ and pictures of the bloody scene
went on the Internet _ the Supreme Court has agreed to review for
the first time whether Florida's electric chair threatens such
``physical violence, disfigurement and torment'' as to be cruel and
unusual punishment. It has become the hangman's noose of our time.
Only Florida, Georgia, Alabama and Nebraska still prefer to use it.
But there is a feeling, as the search continues for that oxymoron _
some way to kill people that does not seem barbaric or embarrassing
_ that the time of the electric chair is drawing to a close.

COST OF HORRID SEASON: LOSS OF PRACTICE TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the first time in three years, the UCLA Bruins
can spend the holidays at home with their friends and families. But
what are the disadvantages of not playing in a bowl game?
</P>
<P>
   Financial: The Pac-10 is contracted to play in five bowl games
(Rose, Holiday, Sun, Aloha and O'ahu) and divides the revenue
equally among all schools. After expenses, the Rose Bowl
participant gets the same as the last-place team. The Bruins knew
their postseason split six months ago and it hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting: So far, the October collapse hasn't cost UCLA any of
its 10 oral commitments. As for future recruits, only time will
tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some recruits think they can step in immediately,'' Bruins
coach Bob Toledo said in a bittersweet tone. ``They look at what
you offer down the road. They don't look at what's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so he hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Performance: The greatest effect of an empty postseason is lost
practice time. The Bruins needed the three weeks _ not to prepare
for the opponent but to evaluate and develop players for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like another spring (practice),'' Toledo said. ``We
usually take some (of the practice) time and work with the young
kids. Having more practice opportunities makes you better.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the last month, UCLA needs all the help it can get.
</P>
<P>
   Foster update: Six weeks after spraining his ankle at Stanford,
tailback DeShaun Foster is almost in pre-injury form. He only
rushed twice against Arizona (0 yards) because the Bruins abandoned
the running game once they fell behind.
</P>
<P>
   But against Washington, watch for Foster to carry 12-15 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking better than he's looked in a long time,'' Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tough adjustment: Quarterback Cory Paus was 34-4 in three years
as a starter at Lincoln Way High in New Lenox, Ill. In six games as
a starter at UCLA, he's 2-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely different,'' Paus said. ``It's new to me to
lead the team after losses. I have to figure out how to do it. I
haven't done a good job, so it's time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Things fall apart: The Bruins are without nine players who were
expected to make significant contributions when spring practice
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The starters: cornerback Marques Anderson was suspended for the
fall quarter; guard Mike Saffer (knee) is out for the remaining
games; cornerback Jason Bell (heel) and receiver Brian Poli-Dixon
(wrist) are redshirting; defensive tackle Ken Kocher (ankle) and
tight end Bryan Fletcher (ankle) are doubtful for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The reserves: Defensive end Travor Turner (knee), backup tackle
Josh Webb (shoulder) and No.2 center Tony Ippolito (knee) are out
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate times: To energize his players, Toledo tried the
``Rocky'' approach before the Arizona game. He showed clips from
the movies and played the ``Eye of the Tiger'' theme song.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it for one quarter,'' he said.

WISCONSIN BEATS PURDUE, 28-21  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. _ The stakes were high. Brees vs. Dayne.
The Heisman Trophy on the line. When the out-of-town scores were
announced, a roar erupted from the nearly 70,000 fans who jammed
Ross-Ade Stadium on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota 24, Penn State 23.
</P>
<P>
   For Wisconsin, the game against Purdue suddenly had greater
significance. If it could outscore quarterback Drew Brees, it would
tie the Nittany Lions for the Big Ten lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter and the game on the line running back Ron
Dayne put the Badgers on his shoulders and carried Wisconsin to a
28-21 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's performance (222 yards) probably kept him on the inside
track for the Heisman. His 41-yard touchdown romp in the fourth
quarter enabled him to move past Tony Dorsett into second place and
within 98 yards of the all-time Division-I rushing mark of 6,279
set by Ricky Williams last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brees looked sharp, connecting on 36 of 64 passes for
350 yards and a touchdown, and running 18 times for 85 yards and
two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers outgained the Badgers 494 to 288 yards total
offense, but suffered its fourth league loss in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin took the lead with 11 minutes left in the game. From
the Purdue 41-yard line, Dayne showed off his myriad skills when he
rolled right, steamrolled some Purdue defenders, fooled another
Biolermaker and outran everyone else down the right sideline into
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown gave Dayne 69 for his career, breaking Indiana's
Anthony Thompson's old Big Ten mark, and gave his team a 21-14
lead.
</P>
<P>
   With little under five minutes to go Purdue took over the ball
on its own 12 yard line. Although Brees had moved the ball well all
day, on the third play of the drive he threw the ball toward Chris
Daniels, but the Purdue receiver bobbled the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's Jamar Fletcher grabbed the bouncing ball, and ran it
into the endzone to give his team 28 points, enough to beat the
Boilermakers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Heisman candidates have been on the national radar for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Brees already owns almost every Purdue passing record, and could
well own every significant Big Ten and NCAA mark, too, if he
returns for his senior year. He is already a member of an exclusive
quarterback fraternity _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's Sigma Chi chapter can boast Bob Griese, Mark Herrmann
and Jim Everett as members, and Brees, too. But Brees is the best
of the bunch, and the only one to connect on over 60-percent of his
passes for his career.
</P>
<P>
   Due to Purdue's almost complete reliance on the pass, which
produces three-quarters of its 463-average yards of offense per
game, the Boilermakers have often struggled in the red zone where
passing options are limited.
</P>
<P>
   After the officials called the Badgers for pass interference,
Purdue had the ball and a first down on the two yard line but could
not move the ball, and looked to have stalled again when Brees
fumbled the snap on third down. Thinking quickly, Brees scooped up
the ball, jumped toward the pile of linemen and stuck the ball out
to break the plane for Purdue's first touchdown, tying the score at
seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love the way he keeps his head up and is always looking
down the field,'' said NFL Hall of Famer and ABC commentator Dan
Fouts. ``His ability to find the open guy is amazing. The wild card
is that Brees creates big plays when he runs with the ball in the
backfield, always looking down the field, trying to make a big
play. He doesn't get flustered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most quarterbacks I've played with are cocky,'' said Purdue
wide receiver Randall Lane, ``but Drew is not cocky at all. He's
humble off the field. You wouldn't know who he was if you saw him
on campus because he's so quiet and down-to-earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, on the other hand, would be hard to miss on any campus.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne first reported to Wisconsin at 275 pounds, almost 4 pounds
per inch.
</P>
<P>
   Even after he lost 25 pounds, he was a physical marvel and his
thighs looked as big as Brees' torso.
</P>
<P>
   Given his build, it's not surprising that Dayne gets almost half
his yards after the initial contact with the tacklers. Defending
against Dayne is like playing bumper cars against a freight train.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Madison, the young man did nothing but set virtually
every NCAA record for freshman runners, carrying the ball 325 times
for 2109 yards, a 6.5 average and 21 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, he's never topped any of those numbers in the
three years since, which could present Heisman voters with the
unpleasant prospect of not giving the award to the all-time leading
rusher.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne has, however, run well all four years, and should break
Ricky Williams'' one-year old career rushing record of 6,279 yards
in Wisconsin's last regular season game against the inept Iowa
Hawkeyes next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't necessarily say he's fast, but he's quick,'' said
Purdue linebaker Jason Loerzel. ``When he finds the hole, he hits
it.'' &QL;

CAT THIEF WINS THE CLASSIC  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update with complete race results)   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ On a day when records fell, winning and
losing streaks ended and long shots reigned, the 16th Breeders' Cup
ended with one final surprise on Saturday when Cat Thief won the
$4-million Classic at odds of 19-1 and threw the race for Horse of
the Year into total confusion.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much that Cat Thief won the Classic after winning
only one of his 11 starts this year, but more that Behrens ran
seventh when he stood on the threshold of the title. Meanwhile, Cat
Thief, who ran third in the Kentucky Derby and seventh in the
Preakness, made a double winner of his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, who
also won the Juvenile Fillies with another long shot, the 32-1 Cash
Run.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas scored his record 14th and 15th victories in the Breeders'
Cup series while his rival, Bob Baffert, was shut out even though
Baffert had more horses entered _ eight _ than any other trainer.
They included his undefeated filly, Chilukki, who suffered her
first loss when she ran second to Cash Run; his superfilly
Silverbulletday, who ran sixth in the Distaff; Forest Camp, who ran
sixth in the Juvenile, and General Challenge, who finished 10th in
the Classic, four lengths in front of his stablemate River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great day,'' Lukas said later, seated between
William T. Young, who owns Cat Thief, and Pat Day, who rides him.
``This horse has been a hard knocker all year; he just hasn't
gotten the brass ring. We even agonized over running him in the
Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who made a fortune in peanut butter, added: ``People kept
telling me all year that we were running him too much. But you
can't win unless you run.''
</P>
<P>
   And Day, who rode his 11th Breeders' Cup winner, the most of any
jockey, and his fourth in the Classic, said: ``He was so cool and
confident in the paddock, then he ran a marvelous race. He settled
nicely, grabbed the bit after half a mile, and ran so hard and so
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   All this happened on a warm but windy afternoon at Gulfstream
Park, where horses bred or trained in Europe broke their 0-for-45
Breeders' Cup slump here when Ireland's Daylami won the Turf. And
Jorge Chavez broke a losing streak, too, when he won the Distaff
aboard Beautiful Pleasure and a record-breaking Sprint aboard Artax
after 19 losing rides in the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, this was a day of superlatives for success and
failure, and these were the chief ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   --Three mighty long shots finished 1-2-3 in the Classic: Cat
Thief at 19-1, Budroyale at 25-1 and Golden Missile at 70-1. If you
bet the $2 trifecta on them to finish in that order, you would have
collected $39,031.20, which was hefty but still $60,000 below the
track record. Cat Thief alone returned $41.10 for finishing first.
Budroyale paid $21.20 for second, and Golden Missile paid $30.20
for a $2 bet for third. Total betting on all the races on the
program set a Breeders' Cup record of $93.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Two long shots won the Juvenile and the Juvenile Fillies,
turning upside down any early predictions about next year's Triple
Crown favorites. Cash Run won the fillies' race for Lukas under
Jerry Bailey, who also rode Soaring Softly to her victory in the
new $1 million Filly and Mare Turf race. Cash Run paid $67 for a $2
bet. And in the Juvenile, the runaway long shot Anees came flying
up from last place to defeat Chief Seattle and High Yield, and he
paid $62.60
</P>
<P>
   --Silverbulletday, who had won 10 of her last 11 starts against
fillies but ran seventh in the Belmont Stakes against colts, showed
signs of wear and tear when she could not catch Beautiful Pleasure,
who also outran her in the Beldame last month at Belmont Park. The
result seemed to make the 4-year-old Beautiful Pleasure the queen
of the older fillies, but probably did not disturb
Silverbulletday's claim to 3-year-old honors.
</P>
<P>
   --Chilukki finally lost a race after winning her first six
starts when she was run down in the Juvenile Fillies by Cash Run,
who defeated her by a length and a quarter. The race got Lukas off
to a flying start. His other filly in the field of nine, Surfside,
the second choice to Chilukki, ran third.
</P>
<P>
   --Artax not only dashed to a stunning victory in the Sprint, but
tied the track record and broke the Breeders' Cup record for six
furlongs. His time: 1:07 4/5. Earlier this season, he broke Belmont
Park's records for six and seven furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   And in a wildly inconclusive, but intriguing, footnote, Lukas
equipped his horses with the new nasal strips and scored two
victories for better breathing. Both Cash Run in the Juvenile
Fillies and Cat Thief in the Classic were adorned with the equine
nasal strips, and even Pat Day wore a strip across his nose in the
Classic. Of course, Lukas had won 13 previous Breeders' Cup races
without using strips of adhesive across his horses' noses, and he
made no sweeping claims about the new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see any downside to trying them,'' he said. ``But I
don't think the nose strip beat those other horses. I think Cat
Thief did.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's lost day at the races stood in stark contrast to
Lukas, and deprived him of any chance to overtake Lukas' record of
winning $17 million in one year. But he already had found
consolation before turning his horses loose, when he said: ``We
could win one two or five races. Or, we could get blanked. You
never know what's going to happen. You just have to hope you get
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't, while Lukas did, putting a dramatic climax on a year
that saw him win the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness with
Charismatic and later win election to the racing Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``But going into the Classic,'' he said, ``you can never go and
stick your chest out and say, `Bring 'em on.' We knew he was doing
well this fall, and I thought we'd get one sooner or later. I just
didn't know it was going to be today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief ran the mile and one-quarter in a fast 1:59 2/5, just
two-fifths of a second off the track record. Behind him and his two
fellow long shots, the Classic field finished in strange order.
Chester House ran fourth and Almutawakel was fifth. Then came Lemon
Drop Kid in sixth place and Behrens in seventh. It was a time for
regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' said Scotty Schulhofer, who trains Lemon
Drop Kid, winner of the Belmont and the Travers. ``Speed has been
very dangerous today. He tried, that's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   And James Bond, who trains Behrens, said: ``That's the way it
goes some days. With the pace, we kind of thought he would be a
little closer. What can you do?''

HARD WORK OVERCOMES BAD IMAGE FOR JOCKEY  
(HLW) 
 BY JOE DRAPE  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update with race results)  
 (ATTN: Peru)  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ He was a street kid growing up in Callao,
Peru. He earned nickels where he could _ at a bakery for 50 cents a
day, collecting bus fares, washing cars. One day a friend took
Jorge Chavez to a race track and told him he should try riding
horses.
</P>
<P>
   He was a squat and muscled 4 feet 10 inches and 20 years old,
old by racing standards. Still, he became an exercise rider, a
jockey the next year in 1982 and, by the time he reached South
Florida for a vacation in 1988, the best rider in all of Peru.
</P>
<P>
   When someone suggested Chavez stay in the Sunshine State and
ride, he thought, why not? ``I learned early about hard work and
believing there's nothing you can't do,'' said Chavez, 38.
</P>
<P>
   It was an improbable beginning for a more unimaginable saga of a
New York-based rider whose tack finally is considered good enough
for the best horses in the world. In the 16th annual Breeders' Cup,
Chavez broke his 0-19 Breeders' Cup losing streak by bringing home
Beautiful Pleasure in the $1 million Distaff and followed it with
another victory, aboard Artax, in the $1 million Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting the American Dream now,'' he said after that race.
</P>
<P>
   About the only misstep in a glorious day for the rider was made
in the $4-million Classic where Chavez could not get the favorite
Behrens into the mix. ``He just never picked up his feet today,''
Chavez said after Behrens finished a disappointing seventh. ``I'm
not going to make any excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   In between the streets of Peru and the American Dream, however,
Chavez became notorious for earning 85 days of suspensions in his
first year in Florida. He was given the name Chop Chop for his
aggressive and unorthodox whipping action. He became the hero for
bettors who appreciated his extraordinary effort in even the
cheapest races at Belmont and Aqueduct where he has won multiple
riding titles since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But until the past year, Chavez has a hard time getting on top
horses _ the kind that have a real chance at collecting parts of
the combined $13 million in purses here Saturday. He won the winter
Gulfstream title, as well as the Belmont spring and fall titles.
Now, finally, two Breeders' Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let her do what she want and I knew she was going fast,''
said Chavez of Beautiful Pleasure's front running score. ``I
finally got half my dream. Now I need to win a Kentucky Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top levels especially, articulate and telegenic jockeys
with a flair for finesse riding _ such as Jerry Bailey and Gary
Stevens _ tend to make owners of million dollar horses more
comfortable. Except for an expansive smile, Chavez doesn't easily
fit that mold. He has been able to improve his English, but his
riding style remains closer to wrangling than equine ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been the perception that Jorge lacked polish;
it's made us work hard for opportunities, but once he gets on these
horses he brings home the goods,'' said Richard DePass, Chavez's
agent.
</P>
<P>
   With DePass working the trainer's barns and Chavez working their
horses, the jockey is now third in the national standing, with more
than $13.9 million in purse earnings. James Bond, the trainer of
the horse of the year candidate Behrens, was one of the first
trainers to recognize Chavez's substance over style. For years, he
has ridden Chavez only to have some of his owners pressure him to
replace the jockey with a bigger name for big horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ride him day-in and day-out and you appreciate how skilled
he is,'' said Bond, who now gives Chavez first call for all of his
horses. ``He works hard working horses in the morning and he wins
in the afternoon. He's always made me look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides winning races, jockey and agent needed to rehabilitate
Chavez's reputation and educate trainers about his riding style to
woo the big time outfits such as D. Wayne Lukas, Todd Pletcher and
Nick Zito, that now employ the rider. They began by returning to
Florida for the prestigious Gulfstream meet for the first time
since Chavez had earned his rough-riding reputation. The jockey
made it clear he is a different rider now than the Peruvian street
fighter who made a raucous American debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I was winning races and doing very well down
here,'' he said. ``The other jocks were looking at this new guy and
they started getting aggressive around me. I didn't want to go down
so I went right back at them. It wasn't very mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more troublesome for some horsemen was the Chop Chop tag.
Chavez has short, powerful arms that make it difficult for him to
reach back and whip a horse's hip. To compensate, he has developed
a quick up and down motion targeting the shoulder that he
demonstrated in the deep stretch here Saturday as Banshee Breeze
made a late run. At first the trainers John and Donna Ward winced
at the notion of putting Chavez on Beautiful Pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't like all the Chop Chop stuff,'' said Donna
Ward, who also serves as the exercise rider for the stable. ``So I
watched him ride last year at Saratoga. I didn't find he did that
at all. He keeps them busy, but there has never been a mark on a
horse that he has ridden for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has gracefully waited for his big-time opportunity and
acknowledges he is gratified that he is a fan favorite among the
rail birds in New York. But he also is clearly rattled by the
perception he is hard on horses. ``They are like humans and I
wouldn't beat on them just like I wouldn't beat on a person,'' he
said. ``The horses have taken me along way. I don't know where I
would be without them.''

FOR BAFFERT, CUP RUNNETH ... EMPTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The trademark sunglasses came off before the
Breeders' Cup Classic, Fla. _ The trademark sunglasses came off
before the Breeders' Cup Classic, before General Challenge and
River Keen ran 10th and 11th in the dying light, marking the end of
a horrid day for Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   The TV guys took off even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cameras left me!'' Baffert exclaimed, leaning back against
a rail beside his finish-line box seat at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   While D. Wayne Lukas took bows in the winner's circle below him,
Baffert strained for a wisecrack to sum it all up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a head away from being a bona fide turf trainer,''
Baffert said with a laugh, referring to Tuzla's photo-finish defeat
in the Breeders' Cup Mile on grass, the closest he came to a
victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   His shrunken entourage sat nearby, staring blankly into a gusty
wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get one more inning out of 'em,'' he said
of the horses who'd done nothing but win for him all year.
</P>
<P>
   He finally came up with the right line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this doesn't hurt book sales,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's autobiography just came out, its publisher no doubt
intending to take advantage of fascination with the trainer's
Breeders' Cup record attempt. Chapters include ``On Top of the
World,'' ``Champion of Champions,'' ``Main Man'' and ``High
Roller.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably the second printing of ``Baffert: Dirt Road to the
Derby'' _ if a second printing proves necessary _ will have a new
chapter. Call it ``Empty Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert came to Gulfstream Park 2{ weeks ago with the strongest
Breeders' Cup contingent any trainer has ever had _ eight horses,
four of whom would go off as favorites, one as a second choice.
Baffert was poised to remove any lingering doubt that he and not
Wayne Lukas is the trainer of the decade by breaking his rival's
record for wins on a single Breeders' Cup card (three).
</P>
<P>
   The TV cameras followed him all week and he played to them.
</P>
<P>
   But then the races came and Baffert's horses were beaten soundly
in the first two, the ones in which he'd said he had the best
chances, so that by the time the eight-race afternoon wound down to
the Classic, he was just hoping to salvage something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we won't make a big doughnut run here,'' he had told
a TV interviewer earlier, as railbirds heckled him with cries of
``O-fer!''
</P>
<P>
   A $4 million race offers plenty of opportunity for salvage, of
course. And he thought his flighty 3-year-old General Challenge was
on top of his game, even if his 6-year-old ex-claimer River Keen
was feeling the effects of a foot problem.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge never got into the race, though, after being
slow away from the starting gate. Lukas' Cat Thief ran close to the
pace, on a track that seemed to favor that running style, and stole
away with a 19-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was back there eating that sand (kicked up by the leading
horses),'' Baffert said of General Challenge. ``I'm just so
frustrated with that damned horse. Once he doesn't break (fast), he
just goes up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   While grasping for humor in the situation, Baffert fought the
temptation to make excuses. On that count, he won some and lost
some, better than he did on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday ran a tired sixth in the Distaff. ``I'm
disappointed in (her),'' he said. ``The jock said she was just
flat. . . . She might have bled.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilukki lost for first time in a seven-race career to a Lukas
long shot in the Juvenile Fillies. ``It's a dead speed-biased
racetrack,'' Baffert said. ``As soon as they turn for home and
catch that wind, the leader is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Forestry went evenly to fourth place in the Sprint. ``He got
outfooted from the start by some very good horses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Camp ran sixth in the Juvenile. Baffert said another
horse stepped on one of the 2-year-old's hind legs and cut it. In
any case, he again went too fast early in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Those four were post-time favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Classic and the dying light.
</P>
<P>
   Glib and striking looking, Baffert has been racing's best
publicist since his horses' Kentucky Derby victories in 1997 and
1998. And Saturday, he helped a network audience understand that in
this sport, you can't take anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to do anything different (next time), maybe I
wouldn't come in (to town) so early,'' Baffert said. ``I came here
early to get (the horses) used to the heat. There wasn't any
heat.''
</P>
<P>
   He made a crack about how he was disappointed but wasn't about
to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   Real frustration is coming to the Breeders' Cup with one horse,
losing and thinking you might never come back. Baffert knows he'll
come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed myself,'' he insisted. ``I'd much rather be here
than watching on TV.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Victory creeps up on Cat Thief
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service HALLANDALE, Fla. _ When Cat Thief
<TEXT>
flashed across the finish line Saturday to win the $4 million
Breeders' Cup Classic, it brought a fitting end to an unpredictable
day, and year, of horse racing.
<P>
   The final significant race of 1999 was won by a horse whose
trainer wasn't sure he wanted to enter him, whose jockey had to be
convinced to ride him and whose record of just three victories in
18 career starts had him at odds of 19-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agonized a little about running him,'' trainer D. Wayne
Lukas said afterward. ``Getting Pat (Day) to ride him was a big
part of the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went Saturday at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day when Bob Baffert was supposed to reinforce the
belief he's the world's best trainer. He went winless in eight
tries, including four beaten favorites who didn't handle
Gulfstream's speed-favoring strip.
</P>
<P>
   That left the stage for Lukas, who, despite having dominated the
15 previous Breeders' Cups with 13 victories and more than $14
million in earnings _ more than double anyone else _ went into this
one overlooked. Lukas corrected this perception by winning twice,
including his first Classic on his somewhat reluctant entry. Lukas'
other victory was with long shot Cash Run ($67) in the Juvenile
Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I don't ever show emotion,'' a smiling Lukas said.
``Well, this is the most fun I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a day when horses likes Silverbulletday, Chilukki
and Behrens were expected to state their cases for Horse of the
Year. Each lost. Chilukki was a game second in the $1 million
Juvenile Fillies, Silverbulletday sixth in the $2 million Distaff
and Behrens seventh in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Horse of the Year picture as unpredictable as the
Classic, with Cat Thief ($41.20) finishing 1 1/4 lengths in front
of a 26-1 shot (Budroyale), who was a head ahead of a 75-1 shot
(Golden Missile), who was a half-length in front of a 63-1 shot
(Chester House). Behrens, the Classic favorite, finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   This finish created enough losing tickets to handle a
ticker-tape parade in New York. The biggest winner Saturday _
besides the guy holding the payoff of $692,907 _ might have been a
horse who has been retired for five months.
</P>
<P>
   The Lukas-trained Charismatic, who won the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness but broke down after finishing third in the Belmont
Stakes, has as much right as any animal to be considered Horse of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a vote and that's none of my business,'' Lukas
said. ``I'm sure the voters will do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas admitted he almost did the wrong thing with Cat Thief by
contemplating not running him. Owner William T. Young, a part-time
resident of Gulf Stream, persuaded Lukas to enter Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Wayne, not all votes are equal,' '' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief broke well, but drifted inside and bumped Vision And
Verse soon out of the gate. Day hustled Cat Thief behind
pace-setter Old Trieste with a mile left in the 1 1/4-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't unusual for a colt who has been second or third in
11 of his previous 18 races, but with just three victories. But
Day, who has won 11 Breeders' Cup races and four Classics, found a
way to keep his colt together the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some pressure at the half-mile (pole), and he got down
and accelerated,'' Day said. ``I was concerned he was using himself
so early, then he started coasting around the turn. I knew they
were going to have to get him today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief finally got the lead from Old Trieste with a
quarter-mile left. He kept his nose in front throughout most of the
stretch and gradually pulled away to earn $2.08 million for Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse has been a hard knocker all year who just hadn't
gotten the brass ring,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, meanwhile, said the odds and the fast racing surface
conspired against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you weren't in it right away, you were out of it,'' he
said, referring to the speed bias. ``All year long, things have
been falling in our hand. At the end, I was hoping for one more
inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was the only trainer to win twice, but jockeys Jerry
Bailey and Jorge Chavez got to the winner's circle two times.
Bailey was aboard Cash Run in the Juvenile Fillies and Soaring
Softly ($9.20) in the $1 million Filly and Mare Turf. Chavez, who
failed to win in 19 previous Breeders' Cup mounts, won with
Beautiful Pleasure ($8) in the $1 million Distaff and Artax
($9.40), who tied the track record in the 6-furlong Sprint at
1:07.4.
</P>
<P>
   Other Breeders' Cup winners were Anees ($62.60) in the $1
million Juvenile, Ireland's Daylami ($5.20) in the $2 million Turf
and Silic ($16.40) in the $1 million Mile. Daylami became the first
European shipper to win a Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream in 39 races.

NOVELIST GEORGE HIGGINS DEAD AT 59 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ George V. Higgins, the novelist who brought Boston's
underworld to vivid and unsentimental life in ``The Friends of
Eddie Coyle,'' was found dead Saturday in his home. He was 59.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Higgins's death was sudden, said his daughter, Susan. She
said the writer's family is ``still in shock and not prepared to
make a comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Higgins, who was born in Brockton, Mass., and wrote some 25
books, graduated from Boston College with a degree in English
Literature in 1961, and received a master's degree from Stanford
University in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career as a reporter for the Providence Journal,
then went on to work for the Associated Press in Western
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to law school at Boston College, and in 1967, he was
hired by the Massachusetts attorney general's office, working his
way up from legal assistant to assistant attorney general, before
moving on to become an assistant US attorney in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor, he often handled organized crime cases, in
which he got to know the kinds of characters on whom he would
eventually build his literary reputation.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970, Mr. Higgins had amassed a large collection of
unpublished novels, as many as 14, which he promptly ``dumped'' one
day, according to his longtime friend, Boston University professor
Jon Klarfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Father Francis W. Sweeney, who taught Mr. Higgins during
literature classes at BC and was a mentor to the young writer,
begged him to keep trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `George, don't give up. You have it, and there will be
a time when we hold your first book in our hands,' '' Sweeney
recalled Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That time came in 1972, with the publication by Knopf of ``The
Friends of Eddie Coyle.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was an immediate bestseller. Mr. Higgins had re-created
the lives of petty mobsters as few other writers ever had, giving
them authentic Boston settings and speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole life, I've been a great eavesdropper,'' Higgins told
The London Daily Telegraph in September. ``The nuances of ordinary
speech interest me, but what really fascinates me is the person who
is so caught up in what he's saying that he tells more truth than
he intends to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie Coyle'' was made into a movie directed by Peter Yates
and starring Robert Mitchum and Peter Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   Critics lauded his arrival as a major talent, and his subsequent
novels, including ``The Digger's Game,'' ``Cogan's Trade,'' and ``A
City On A Hill,'' also won plaudits.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Higgins churned out a book almost every year, and though few
of his later novels matched the success of his earlier ones, he
became something of a cult figure for readers.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had become a successful writer, he left neither law
nor journalism far behind. He wrote columns for The Boston Herald
American, The Boston Globe, and The Wall Street Journal between
1977 and 1985. And every year, he hosted a lunch at Locke-Ober for
old colleagues from his days as a newspaperman and lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought together diverse people,'' Klarfeld said. ``I have
friends today and we all met through George, one way or another. He
was an inadvertent matchmaker of lifelong friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George was a wonderfully loyal friend and a ferociously loyal
enemy. I was happy to be in first category,'' said Martin F. Nolan,
former editor of the Globe editorial page, who first met Mr.
Higgins in 1957 when both were freshmen at Boston College. ``When I
started working as a reporter at the Globe, George thought my job
was more fun than studying creative writing. So he switched and
became one of the fastest guns the Associated Press ever hired. Law
and novel-writing came later. His personality seldom changed. The
gruffness concealed a heart bigger and grander than his ego.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he was still writing: his last novel, ``The
Agent,'' was published this year. Mr. Higgins also taught creative
writing at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his second wife, Loretta Cubberley; and two children,
Susan, 31, and John, 30.

GALAXY TRIES TO ELIMINATE DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It has been a long time, or feels like a long time,
since the Galaxy was in this position.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1996, the Galaxy is one victory away
from the MLS championship game. And one victory shy of a possible
rematch with D.C. United in Foxboro, Mass., site of the Galaxy's
devastating, 3-2 overtime loss to United in the inaugural MLS
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But before Los Angeles can prepare for the wind chill in New
England, there's a team that can spoil all this fun. The Dallas
Burn has shown the kind of resiliency needed to keep this series
going.
</P>
<P>
   It took a gift deflection in the 90th minute last week at the
Rose Bowl for the Galaxy to steal a 2-1 victory and 1-0 lead in the
best-of-three Western Conference final series with Dallas. But it
was the Galaxy which trained this week as if it were the team that
needed to make most of the adjustments for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   In today's match at the Cotton Bowl, the Galaxy needs to work
much harder if it hopes to sweep this series and have a couple of
weeks off before the Nov. 21 championship. With a loss, the Galaxy
faces a third and deciding game Thursday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply outworked us the first time,'' said Galaxy
defender Paul Caligiuri. ``And at times we looked sluggish and
fatigued, but we were lucky enough to find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy might not get away with a similar effort in Dallas,
where the Burn is 15-3 overall and 2-0 against the Galaxy this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely need to show up with something more,'' said
Caligiuri. ``They have been coming back on teams all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas is a complete team. They're well balanced and everyone
knows their roles. We need to match their attitude and work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have all the talent in the world, but you have to show
up and put in the work to beat this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' dangerous combination of Jason Kreis, Ariel Graziani and
Oscar Pareja do most of the finishing for the Burn, but Dallas
looked more dangerous when its midfield got involved in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three are a dangerous triangle, but it's the two guys
behind them, Ted Eck and Chad Deering, that get them going,'' said
Caligiuri. ``When (Eck and Deering) get more involved in the
attack, things start opening up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid says his team needs to maintain
possession longer to keep Dallas from finding a rhythm offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally our touch and combination play is much better than it
was last week,'' said Schmid. ``What we talked about is making sure
we do a better job holding on to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``And between (midfielders) Roy (Myers) and (Mauricio)
Cienfuegos, there has to be a little better understanding that they
both went high at the same time in the last game. One of them has
to drop a little at midfield to help get the ball out of midfield
and get us going.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid also talked about getting Cobi Jones and Clint Mathis in
more opportunistic situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get Cobi isolated in a one-v-one and Clint in a
one-v-one,'' said Schmid. ``They need to have the chance to create
opportunities for themselves or break free and set someone else
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mood this week wasn't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to play another game like that and have to win
that way,'' said Schmid. ``But at the same time I think this team
has grown a lot to win a game when things aren't going well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past the Galaxy has been a team that is always known
for playing well but not being able to roll up their sleeves and
fight and battle when they have to. I think showing that we can win
when we had to roll up our sleeves was a good sign.''

WOULD YOU LIKE PAPER, PLASTIC OR A DRAW PLAY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Around here, everybody was born to be play-callers. It's a
God-given gift bestowed only upon this little section of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the cradle, and certainly from a prone position on
the sofa, we can immediately tell you how to beat two-deep zones
and eight-man run blitzes. The guy-next-door, who can't figure out
where to exit on the downtown mixmaster, can whip together an NFL
offensive game plan in either five minutes or two beers, whichever
comes first.
</P>
<P>
   At times, this blessing of ours has been a source of either
great amusement or great concern to such football types as the
honorable Tom Landry, Norv Turner, Ernie Zampese and now Chan
Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, none of them seems to understand this clarion call we
have for football expertise. Even though the game is their life's
work, we are simply smarter at play-calling, due to a gift from
God.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to the mid-'60s, and our forefathers were demanding the
head of Mr. Landry long before he became Canton-bound. Too much Don
Perkins up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Turner came along _ he was a real nobody at the time
_ and it took a couple of Super Bowls before the swing pass to
Moose became even mildly tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese? Your brother-in-law said he predicted every play
Zampese ever called and your brother-in-law can't hold a job wiping
hoods at the car wash. Zampese is only one of the most respected
offensive minds in the NFL, but around here, Ernie was too
predictable. The real truth, of course, was this: Ernie didn't have
our gift.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Gailey, who is obviously confusing politics
with play- calling. Way too conservative. Who does Chan think he
is, Dick Armey?
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, and I frankly don't think over the last 40 years
the combined football IQ of Landry-Turner-Zampese-Gailey would
equal much more than the yardage needed for a first down. Around
here, with our brilliance, all these play-callers were quickly
exposed by the thousands of local offensive coordinators, some of
whom now moonlight on radio talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there does exist a real wacky notion that play-calling
is simply a product of the talent level on the field. Something
about the better the talent, the better the play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   But that's as senseless as that totally foreign concept that
said the Cowboys were beaten by a better outfit last week in Indy.
That no matter what play Gailey called or when he called it, the
Colts won the game because their people, at this particular time,
are better than the Cowboys' people. And actually proved it in the
second half of that game.
</P>
<P>
   How outrageous, huh? Not in 40 years have the Cowboys ever been
beaten by a better club. And besides, it was only yesterday when
the express-lane cashier at Tom Thumb informed me Gailey personally
lost the game to the Colts because of his play-calling. That
12-items-or-less checker is one of us, don't you understand. He was
born with the special gift.
</P>
<P>
   A local Tom Thumb football source is much more reliable than any
NFL scout, but a couple of those were on the phone last week
talking about how they had graded the Cowboys' talent in the Colts'
game.
</P>
<P>
   There was general agreement that outside of Rocket Ismail, there
wasn't another receiver who would be more than a No. 4 on a good
offensive team. And that quarterback Troy Aikman was growing
increasingly hesitant to force balls into receivers, particularly
deep. Aikman, they believed, was showing a lack of confidence in
those receivers, and was not playing well because of it.
</P>
<P>
   In the running game, the scouts viewed Emmitt as still capable,
although not what he once was. And that the offensive line had
Larry Allen and Mark Stepnoski playing well, and everybody else
rated merely average or below.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of tight end David LaFleur in the passing game
was called a mystery. For that, blame Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   And defensively? Forget it. The defensive line was called below
average, and so were the linebackers. In the secondary, time and
too many hits have taken a big toll on a slipping Darren Woodson,
while the other safety spot has been reduced to a who's-healthy,
grab-bag mess.
</P>
<P>
   But the great Nine-Toed Deion? Jerry Jones' $8 million
investment is out of shape and becoming more tentative every game,
said the scouts. And at the other corner, Kevin Smith was praised
for his courage, but described as a mere shadow of his old self.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, these are just NFL scouts. They can't know what
we know. And we know it's all about play-calling. Has been for 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey needs immediate help. He should either call any of
us or visit the nearest Tom Thumb. / nn

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Blacks and whites in Kansas City punch the
same time clock each morning, but they may not feel as if they work
at the same company.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this year by The Kansas City Star and The Kansas City
Call found that outlooks on money and jobs have improved from 10
years ago but still depend greatly on race.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the white residents in the poll, for example, said
blacks have an equal chance at jobs for which they're qualified.
Only a quarter of blacks said they'd expect equal treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the booming economy has increased economic opportunities
for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pie is larger, everyone gets a share,'' said Leo
Morton, a senior vice president at UtiliCorp United Inc. in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the battle for equal opportunity in the workplace has
broadened. While past efforts largely have focused on getting
minorities in the door, they now include giving them a fair shot at
the same jobs, promotions and compensation as whites.
</P>
<P>
   Although blacks and Hispanics have joined the executive ranks,
few have captured core management posts that most influence a
company's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the last areas that blacks and people of
color have been in,'' said Linda Cooper Kee, a Kansas City
diversity consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of race-based jobs in marketing, retailing and other
fields also has left some minority employees feeling pigeonholed.
The minority market is the only market they get to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Hershberger, executive director of Kansas City Harmony,
cautions that achieving equality at work is a continuous process.
Another decade will bring another set of issues not yet envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be the same in your workplace next year as it is
today,'' she said. ``Everyone knows it's not the same as it was
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the job
</P>
<P>
   The poll is identical to one conducted in 1989. The polls asked
area white residents and black residents the same questions.
</P>
<P>
   Both races saw improving prospects for black job applicants to
receive equal treatment, but blacks were far less optimistic than
whites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, 72 percent of blacks thought an employer would choose a
white applicant over an equally qualified black applicant. That
number dropped to 63 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, 32 percent of whites thought the employer would choose
the white applicant compared to 25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree a decade of nearly uninterrupted economic growth
has lifted fortunes of Kansas City's black work force.
</P>
<P>
   Black unemployment in Kansas City has fallen from 10.7 percent
in 1989 to 8.9 percent in 1997, the most recent local figures
available. Nationally, rates also have continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
   All job seekers have benefited from a shrinking pool of
available labor, said Donna Romans, a supervisor in Missouri's
Division of Workforce Development in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The labor shortage has improved chances for job candidates who,
because of their race, have limited educational opportunities or
work histories. Romans said the labor shortage also is forcing
employers to be more receptive to job candidates with disabilities
or different ethnic and racial backgrounds than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear, however, that black workers have not caught up to
their higher-paid and more-often-employed white co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Black unemployment in the Kansas City area is nearly three times
higher than white unemployment, at 3 percent, based on the 1997
numbers. Hispanic unemployment in the area is 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many black workers still face substantial barriers to finding
work.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde McQueen, president and chief executive officer of the Full
Employment Council in Kansas City, points to low academic
achievement and low graduation rates in the Kansas City School
District, where many black students attend classes.
</P>
<P>
   A higher poverty rate among black residents often makes day care
unaffordable and transportation to jobs difficult _ and not just to
jobs in the suburbs, experts agree. Business owner Marilyn Townsend
said transportation problems disqualified potential employees when
she managed a hotel at Sixth and Central streets in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Racial discrimination is another barrier, according to a study
released this year by the Russell Sage and Ford foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial inequality is surprisingly resistant to economic
growth,'' the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Whites are beginning to recognize that.
</P>
<P>
   In The Star's poll 10 years ago, half of whites said less
education was the chief reason black unemployment rates were higher
than white rates. That number fell to a third in the recent survey,
nearly matching the rate at which blacks attributed the gap to less
education.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of whites who said discrimination was the main
cause of higher black unemployment doubled to 12 percent in the new
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is a good sign, Morton said. It means more whites are
setting aside the ``safe answer'' that blacks aren't as qualified
and recognizing that discrimination plays a role, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks still cited discrimination more often than whites at 20
percent in this year's survey. But that's down from 28 percent a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   And for those blacks who are finding jobs, they aren't
necessarily getting the same jobs as whites.
</P>
<P>
   The Sage study showed workplaces remain segregated. It found in
Atlanta, for example, that most black employees work beside other
blacks, although the city's black population is a minority.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, black employment is broadly
concentrated in lower- paying service and laborer jobs, said
Franciena King, a research analyst in the Missouri Department of
Economic Development. About 12 percent of area residents are black,
but almost 21 percent of service workers are black. Nearly 14
percent of laborers are black.
</P>
<P>
   Race-based jobs further divide the work force on the theory that
black customers will react more favorably to a black salesman or a
black-generated sales pitch. That has left some minorities feeling
pigeonholed. A black telemarketer in Birmingham, Ala., and an
Hispanic manager at an employment agency in Milwaukee have sued
successfully on those grounds. Corporate climb
</P>
<P>
   While getting through the door remains an issue for minorities,
moving up the ladder has emerged as a new challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, minority employees find more often than whites that the
only way they can move ahead in their career is to change
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be this corporate climate that minorities think
they cannot navigate as well,'' said Darryck Dean,associate
executive director for Kansas City Harmony. ``So what they tend to
do is jump. That's just human nature. If you can see the
improvement by going over to this other company, why not jump?''
</P>
<P>
   The Society of Human Resource Management reported in May that
such conditions lead minorities to change jobs at rates two to
three times higher than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus DeLeon, a former recruiter who now heads human resources
at Bernstein-Rein Advertising Inc., said the robust economy and
increased focus on diversity have increased job hopping among
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the jobs are there, they're becoming more impatient
and more people are looking for them,'' DeLeon said.
</P>
<P>
   But black workers may be seeing some improved prospects within
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed 32 percent of blacks thought their race hampered
their chances for a raise or promotion in recent years, down from
42 percent who said so in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are important.

MICROSOFT PRESIDENT PLAYS DOWN PROSPECTS FOR A SETTLEMENT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Playing down prospects for any settlement in
his company's titanic antitrust battle with the government, the
Microsoft Corp.'s president, Steven A. Ballmer, on Saturday
explained Microsoft's fight-on strategy by invoking the wisdom of
his 7-year-old son, Sam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking my son to school yesterday,'' Ballmer said.
``Friday is spelling-test day. And so after we practiced
`crustaceous' and `paleontologist,' I mentioned to my son that
there was going to be this ruling today. He said: `Well, I hope
it's good for you, Dad. Dad, if they don't agree with you, you guys
will appeal, right? Because what you did is all right, right,
Dad?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer continued: ``And I said, `That's right, Sam.' I mean,
he's not our legal strategist or anything, but he does understand
our view.''
</P>
<P>
   One day after a federal judge issued a sweeping denunciation of
the company, finding that it was a monopoly that had repeatedly
sought to bully and stifle its competition, the company's message
staunchly remains what it has been through a year and a half of
legal battles: We did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Microsoft's insistence that it would love to resolve
the antitrust case, there was no evidence of any olive branch from
Ballmer. A close friend and college classmate of Microsoft's
founder and chairman, Bill Gates, Ballmer in many respects is more
involved than Gates in the day-to-day running of the software
giant. Saturday, he acted as the company's lead spokesman in
discussing the judge's finding.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a central complaint in the government's case is
that Microsoft stitched its Internet Explorer browser into new
versions of Windows, the dominant operating system for the great
majority of computers around the world, to destroy the market for
its chief competitor, the Netscape Communications Corp., now a
subsidiary of America Online. Ballmer said he could not conceive of
acceding to a demand that the browser be removed from Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows needs to be a great platform for the Internet,''
Ballmer said. ``I mean, to say that the most important software
product is somehow unable to respond to the most important trend in
technology, I wouldn't get that. I don't understand how that could
be good for consumers or businesses anyplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, a burly man with a booming laugh, was somewhat subdued
in an interview at the company's world headquarters Saturday,
across Lake Washington from Seattle. He described himself as
saddened, not angered, by the judge's findings and once lapsed into
an almost elegiac defense of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been, this is, a great company,'' Ballmer said. ``I
love our company, I love the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing a colleague who has been working punishing hours on a
new product lately, he said: ``His energy isn't into some cuckoo
thing, some Machiavellian thing. He's sitting there trying to
figure out, how do I change the world? How do I get people better
information? How do I give them the tools that let them understand
better what's going on? He's giving his blood, sweat, tears energy
into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaking his head at the findings issued by Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson in Washington, D.C., he said: ``I'm sad that none of that
seemed to be obvious, at least in the pages I read.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a different picture of Microsoft was painted in the
207-page findings released on Friday after a yearlong antitrust
trial. Jackson wrote that the company ``has demonstrated that it
will use its prodigious market power and immense profits'' to harm
any firm that challenged it. He said ``the ultimate result is that
some innovations that would truly benefit consumers never occur for
the sole reason that they do not coincide with Microsoft's
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson found the government's case against Microsoft credible
and called the company's arguments specious.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the strong denunciation, Microsoft has a clear
strategy: continue to press for a sympathetic ear in the court of
public opinion, while fighting tooth and nail in the legal arena.
The company has often said it might lose at the trial level only to
be fully vindicated on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the findings and their depiction of Microsoft came as an
undeniable blow.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Silverberg, a former senior vice president who helped
direct the company's Internet software strategy, said: ``Certainly
the rank and file at Microsoft are disappointed but also remain
convinced that they will ultimately be exonerated. It's a sad day
for entrepreneurs. It's a sad day for consumers. It's a sad day for
innovation. I know that's how people feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers, including Attorney General Janet Reno,
hailed the judge's findings as a victory for consumers that could
be an important step in giving them a wider choice of software
products.
</P>
<P>
   In recent e-mails to Microsoft's 30,000 employees, Ballmer
seemed to forecast the bad news to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do our best to tell our story,'' Ballmer wrote on
Tuesday, ``but at this stage we all need realistic expectations.
The antitrust case will be a long process, and we are in it for the
long haul.'' And he concluded, ``let's keep our eye on the ball and
stay focused on our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   That mission was something Ballmer was keenly interested in
talking about Saturday, as he tried to cast the antitrust battle as
an unfortunate irritant over which the company would one day
prevail and on which he spends only a small amount of his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much great stuff coming,'' Ballmer said, warming to
the salesman's pitch and discussing ``exciting announcements'' in
the Web site hosting area'' and new innovations for Windows 2000.
``I'd hate to see customers get sort of defocused. Buy our stuff or
don't buy our stuff, but I'd hate to see the discussion get so
focused around this'' _ the court case _ ``that customers miss out
on some of the things that might improve their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer raised many eyebrows several weeks ago and sparked a
$4.875 drop in the company's stock, to $91.188, when he told a
group of business writers: ``There's such an over-valuation of tech
stocks, it's absurd. And I'd put our company's stock in that
category.'' The drop reduced his personal stake in the company by
about $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts were baffled by Ballmer's remarks, while others
thought it might be a cunning move to depress the price for a large
company buy-back of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Saturday, in light of the judge's finding, whether it
would be wise for investors to buy Microsoft stock when exchanges
reopen on Monday, Ballmer laughed and said: ``I'm probably not the
right guy to ask about that topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, who at age 42 has been with the company for nearly 20
years, said he thought the judge's words might actually boost
morale on the Microsoft campus. ``People will pull together,'' he
said, ``the way you do sometimes when you get news you don't like
from outside a family. The family group pulls together, stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   And he repeatedly cast the company an anxious competitor in the
marketplace, not a predator. ``It's funny, sometimes people will
say in one breath, Microsoft has this incredible position. But in
the next six breaths, they will remind you: Oh my gosh, the
personal computer might not be relevant. Oh my gosh, they're
missing the e-commerce wave. Oh my gosh, Oh my gosh. There's
nothing about past successes that guarantees success in the
future.''

JOB PROSPECTS FOR MINORITIES IMPROVE, BUT THERE'S STILL ROOM FOR

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``Perception is reality in a lot of these
areas,'' said Peter Levi, president of the Greater Kansas City
Chamber of Commerce. ``It's harder to get well if you don't feel
like you're getting well.''
</P>
<P>
   And workplaces have become more diverse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of examples of African-Americans who have
moved up the ladder in the community, if you define moving up the
ladder as having a better house or having a better job,'' Levi
said. ``But there's still a lot of room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say, for example, that blacks have not yet moved into
core management, such as finance, marketing and operations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest concentrations of black professionals is in
personnel, training and labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout my career, I was asked to move to human resources
but fought it because it was thought of as a `black job,' '' said
Morton, the UtiliCorp executive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morton, who is black, is senior vice president of human
resources. He said he accepted the promotion because he also
oversees information technology, which covers the company's
computer network, software and data center.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks occupy about 9 percent of the area's professional
personnel jobs, but only 6.3 percent of accounting or auditing jobs
and 4.7 percent of engineering and architect slots.
</P>
<P>
   Kee said handing core management jobs to someone also means
handing over authority, and too few white managers seem ready to
take that chance on someone of color.
</P>
<P>
   A scarcity of role models is the chief barrier to core
management seats, according to a survey of Fortune 500 companies by
the Society of Human Resource Management.
</P>
<P>
   The study also cited a lack of mentors, racial stereotypes, a
perception that the corporate culture favors nonminorities and an
exclusion from informal networks.
</P>
<P>
   Some local corporations are trying to work on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kennedy, diversity manager at Hallmark Cards Inc., said
his company's mentor program includes an intranet site where
employees and potential mentors can meet. The company also is
including more minorities and women in succession plans and is
holding managers accountable for diversity efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always more work to be done,'' Kennedy said. Getting
paid
</P>
<P>
   Even if blacks get the same jobs as whites, the next challenge
is to get the same pay.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to the strong economy, income gaps between black
and white households have narrowed _ but only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Census data measured the median black household income last
year as equal to 62 percent that of white households. In 1989,
black household income was 60 percent that of white.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and whites in the Star//Call poll saw that change
differently. Whites were most likely to say they thought the income
gap between races was narrowing. Blacks were most likely to say
there had been no change.
</P>
<P>
   And the higher their income, the more pessimistic blacks were.
Those making more than $25,000 a year were twice as likely to say
the gap was widening as those blacks making less.
</P>
<P>
   Glaring income disparities between blacks and whites with
college educations give weight to their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, according to March 1998 figures, black men between
the ages of 35 and 44 with college degrees earned $38,920, about
the same as white men their age who had attended college but did
not earn a degree. White men who completed their degree earned
$53,118.
</P>
<P>
   Incomes aren't the only difference, Kee said. Compensation
packages also can be different in management positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing black counterparts saying that we were so busy
going after the big salary that we were not aware of what that
whole compensation package looked like _ stock options and country
club membership and free tax and financial services,'' Kee said.
``That's the question we have to look at now, what's the
compensation. How many of us blacks are in on those extra things?''
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations for closing economic gaps focus on greater
interaction between workers and employers, blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen said progress depends on opening social and professional
networks and joining new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the whole thing of creating greater opportunities in
the workplace is having a fuller understanding of what other people
bring to that workplace, what turns them on, what turns them off,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said he regularly tells employers to listen more to their
employees, especially minority employees, to figure out what is and
is not working. If a black employee leaves on bad terms or hops to
another firm, call a few weeks later and find out why, Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   Levi said such work needs to happen while the area's relative
prosperity lends a hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't do it when the economy's good, it's going to get
really tough when the economy isn't good,'' he said.

 Philanthropy has changed, and it is changing Kansas City  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As a sign of American Century's home-grown
prosperity, its striking twin towers near the Country Club Plaza
are hard to miss.
</P>
<P>
   But you might not know that the mutual fund giant also embodies
a new generation of civic philanthropy in Kansas City. And no local
project illustrates that new philanthropy better than Union
Station, which is reopening this week after being closed a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's corporations, benefactors and foundations raised
some $100 million for the station's restoration into a Science City
museum. That figure represented the largest fund-raising drive in
the region's history until the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art
surpassed it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Union Station's big-bucks donors read like a Who's Who
of Kansas City's old money: the Nicholses, the Blochs, the Halls,
the Kempers, the Helzbergs. Yet their individual contributions
amounted to less than 10 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Providing much of the rest was the city's new money, in the form
of growing charitable foundations and burgeoning businesses: two
Kauffman foundations, Sprint and American Century, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we've enjoyed a great deal of success, we felt the need
to step up,'' William Lyons, president of American Century, said of
his company's $1 million gift.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of the $85 million collected from the
million-dollar-and-above donors, roughly $64 million _ or more than
two-thirds _ came from pots of money unavailable just 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the community had tried the same extensive Union Station
restoration when the last trains left in the mid-1980s, the same
kind of private commitment would have been highly improbable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth of philanthropy in this community is making these
big ideas that are starting to spring up, like Science City, a
reality,'' said Jan Kreamer, president of another expanding
foundation and $1 million donor, the Greater Kansas City Community
Foundation and Affiliated Trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment and responsibility
</P>
<P>
   The reasons why 23 civic-minded individuals and charities
donated more than $1 million each to save Union Station are varied.
</P>
<P>
   For UMB's R. Crosby Kemper Jr. and Bank of America's Bill
Nelson, it was the station's significance to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just important to get it done,'' said Kemper, chairman
of the board of UMB Financial Corp. and a trustee for two
foundations donating to the station. ``Those are the kind of things
you do to make a great city.''
</P>
<P>
   For Farmland Industries' Harry Cleberg and the family of Johnson
County, Kan., real estate magnate Victor Regnier, it was an
opportunity to enhance education in the nation's largest city
without a science center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I learned Science City would have an agriculture
component, I knew it would be embarrassing to us if there was
something second-class,'' said Cleberg, president of Farmland.
``That's why we committed more to this than we would for some other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   For Helzberg Diamonds' Barnett and Shirley Helzberg and Kansas
City Southern Railway's Mike Haverty, it was sentimental attachment
to the old depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great deal of our heritage is tied to Union Station,'' said
Haverty, president of the railway.
</P>
<P>
   And for Commerce Bank's Jonathan Kemper and J.C. Nichols Co.'s
Miller and Jeannette Nichols, it was a simple matter of civic
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique landmark in Kansas City, and it gives us a
chance to do some redevelopment in the city,'' said Jeannette
Nichols. ``It's one of those opportunities that if you can afford
to, you want to be a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas, no backing
</P>
<P>
   For a quarter-century, from 1968 to 1993, various companies and
developers, governments and politicians proposed recipes _
shopping, offices, even different science museums _ to renovate
Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   All failed because each lacked one chief component: start-up
money.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after Sprint Chairman William T. Esrey was asked to
lead the private fund-raising campaign for Science City earlier
this decade. Whom he chose to approach at first proved pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tapping the town's traditional families, he went
after budding charities. By 1995 he obtained commitments from the
Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the Hall Family and Hallmark
foundations for $45 million. He then had Sprint's foundation kick
in $9.5 million to hire project managers and consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what made the difference from all the other attempts
that failed,'' said David Ucko, president of the Kansas City
Museum, which developed Science City.
</P>
<P>
   None of those four foundations had that kind of money to give
away a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceuticals entrepreneur Ewing M. Kauffman's foundation did
not swell until it included his estate after his 1993 death. The
same was true at Hallmark, where it took several years after
founder Joyce Hall's death in 1982 to get his estate transferred to
the family foundation. And Sprint did not grow into today's
telecommunications giant until it changed its name in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you have these large fortunes, they have taken the
city in a different direction,'' said Jonathan Kemper, Commerce
Bank's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey had originally set a fund-raising goal of $50 million, and
within a year he met that goal. Yet, as the redevelopment's cost
projections climbed and ended up doubling, so did the need for
private-sector pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Hall Family Foundation President Bill Hall and Kansas City Power
&AMP; Light Co. Chairman Drue Jennings took over the fund-raising drive
in 1997. Like Esrey before them, Hall and Jennings sought out more
of the region's up-and-coming business empires and newly created
philanthropic fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   So additional millions of dollars came from the Arvin Gottlieb
Charitable Foundation, partly overseen by Crosby Kemper; the
William T. Kemper Foundation, overseen by Jonathan Kemper; the Bank
of America Trusts, partly overseen by Bill Nelson; plus the Muriel
McBrien Kauffman Foundation and such corporations as American
Century and Western Resources, KCP&AMP;L's merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   William T. Kemper Jr., son of the pioneer of the Kemper family
banking empire, died in 1989. Gottlieb, a real estate investor, and
Muriel Kauffman, wife of Ewing, followed in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the first time we've had a community vision
that's as big as the new assets we have,'' said Bill Hall,
president of the Hall Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Union Station's makeover surpassing $250 million, the
corporate community's $100 million commitment _ including special
tax credits received from the state of Missouri _ nearly matches
taxpayers' $118 million contribution through the bistate sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   And Union Station is hardly alone in this philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelson Gallery raised even more money, while Children's
Mercy Hospital tapped some of the same new sources for its recent
expansion. Next on the fund-raising horizon is the Muriel McBrien
Kauffman Foundation's proposed performing arts center downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of philanthropy,'' said Bank of America's Nelson,
``is one of the major factors changing the face of our city.''

KANSANS HAVE MIXED VIEWS ON RELIGION AND EVOLUTION, POLL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansans overwhelmingly say they believe in
God, but a majority also thinks evolution should be taught in
public schools, according to a Kansas City Star-Wichita Eagle poll.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent of those polled said they disagreed with the
Kansas Board of Education's August decision to adopt science
standards that played down evolution _ the theory that living
things share common ancestors but have changed over time. The
standards are guidelines for what public school students in the
state should learn and be tested on.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two percent said they strongly or somewhat agreed with
the board's decision; the rest were neutral or unsure.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted Oct. 22-26 by The Star's marketing
research department, which questioned 604 Kansans by telephone. The
poll has a margin of error of four percentage points at a 95
percent confidence level. That means that if the study were
repeated 20 times, the results would be within four percentage
points 19 of the 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring results from a nationwide Gallup Poll released in
August, the survey showed that 45 percent of the Kansans polled
believe that God created humans as they are within the last 10,000
years, contrary to evolutionary theory. (Forty-nine percent said
they believed humans evolved, with the vast majority of those
saying God guided the process.)
</P>
<P>
   But 81 percent of respondents said they thought dinosaurs lived
millions of years ago, and 65 percent said they thought fossils
indicated that some sea creatures had developed into land animals.
Both statements reflect the consensus of proponents of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Those answers are not surprising, given how religious Kansans
say they are, said Mark Frankel of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, a group of more than 148,000 scientists.
The group has criticized the Kansas board for its action on
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the poll shows that while Kansans believe God had a role
in human development, a majority accepts that evolution is an
important concept in science, Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   The two concepts are not mutually exclusive, and the results
show that, said Stephen Jay Gould, a Harvard University
paleontologist who has written books and articles on evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever position they have about God, that certainly
shouldn't in any sense impact their view about evolution,'' Gould
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Morris, president of the Institute for Creation Research in
San Diego, said the poll responses clarified what he and others had
been saying since August: Most people do not understand exactly
what the Kansas board did or why.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, a geologist, speculated that numbers showing Kansans
disagreeing with the state board might indicate that people failed
to understand the action the board took _ thinking that the state
board banned the teaching of evolution or mandated that creationism
be taught in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is true. The board's 6-4 vote leaves the decision on
whether to teach macroevolution _ change from one species to
another _ to local school districts, and it takes the theory out of
the state's testing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a strong creationist, if all I knew about what's gone on
there I read in the paper, it would color my view a great deal,''
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway of Shawnee, the chairwoman of the state board,
agreed. She said she did not think that newspaper and television
accounts of the controversy had focused much on the standards
written by a 27-member committee of science teachers and
professors. Those standards, which would have stated that evolution
is a cornerstone of science, were rewritten by three state board
members shortly before the August vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach of the writing committee went along with this
very narrow view of evolution,'' Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the incongruity between the answers to questions about how
animals evolved and whether humans did is not difficult to explain,
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets personal, the answers change a bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found that:
</P>
<P>
   - Seventy-three percent are certain God exists, and an
additional 12 percent believe in God but have some doubts.
</P>
<P>
   - Of those with children under 18 in the home, 48 percent
disagreed with the state board, 38 percent agreed and the rest were
unsure. Of those without children at home, 55 percent disagreed
with the state board, 29 percent agreed and the rest were unsure.
</P>
<P>
   - Fifty-two percent said the Kansas board's decision on
evolution would make them more likely to vote in the next board
election; 64 percent of those who disagreed with the board said its
decision had made them more likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Poll respondents represented each of Kansas' four congressional
districts. Respondents in the 3rd and the 4th districts tended to
disagree with the board more than those in the 1st and the 2nd
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd District includes Johnson and Wyandotte counties and
Lawrence; the 4th District includes Wichita. The 1st District
includes western Kansas, and the 2nd District includes Topeka and
southeastern Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   State board member Bill Wagnon, a moderate from Topeka, voted
against the new standards. He said the poll results validated what
he had thought all along: People are able to segregate issues of
faith from what should be taught in public schools.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``That's exactly what we want to happen, I
think,'' Wagnon said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority's disagreement with the board's decision shows that
Kansans are worried about allowing local districts to decide
whether to teach evolution, he said. He thinks the move will create
disparities in the state's educational system because some students
will learn cutting-edge science and others won't.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the poll also indicates that many people do not believe
humans evolved from lower life forms. That hit home for board
member Harold Voth of Haven, a moderate who voted with the five
conservatives for the new science standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has sure been a contentious issue, much more than I
thought it would be,'' Voth said. ``I've seen overwhelming support,
but I know that people tend to respond to the people they agree
with. That's not a very scientific measure. It looks like this
(poll) is fairly consistent with what I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Voth said the poll should be considered only a gauge of
public opinion, because not every Kansan was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Douglass Brown, a conservative state board member from
Wichita who voted for the standards, said the poll confirmed her
vote, showing that Kansans were split on evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have principals going down to the science department
and saying, `What are you teaching and how are you teaching it?'
This is one of the pluses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Poll participant Carolyn Beaton, 48, of Kansas City, Kan., would
agree. She said evolution had never made sense to her, from the
moment she first encountered it in the seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   She says the theory, which she characterizes as ``life came from
nothing,'' is destroying the public schools. None of her four
children attends public schools. Beaton supported the board's
decision to allow districts the option not to teach evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that evolution is how we came into being,''
Beaton said. ``Evolution is a theory. The schools teach it as true
science. It's the only thing ever taught.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beaton seems to be in the minority of Kansans. According to
the poll, more agree with respondents Donna Saylor of Sabetha and
Joyce Brooks of Norton.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saylor said she did not think humans evolved from lower
life forms, she wanted her four children to learn about the theory
of evolution in school.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor, 52, considers herself conservative. She thinks the state
is, too. But the state board's August decision went too far, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a wise decision, because I think
information needs to be presented to the young people, and they can
make their own decision.''

 -KAN  
 Many business, government workers will spend New Year's Eve
watching for Y2K trouble  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ If you thought the endless drone about Y2K
was the worst of it, consider this: Engineer Dave Rucker will spend
the Party Night of the Millennium by himself, holed up in a Spartan
electric substation waiting for something that may never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Things will be a bit cushier at U.S. Central Credit Union in
Overland Park, Kan. The company sprang for a big-screen TV to tide
workers through the big football weekend. U.S. Central even has
hotel rooms available just in case there are year 2000 computer
problems and weary workers need to crash.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of workers in Kansas City and hundreds of
thousands across the country, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day
will be much like most other weekends.
</P>
<P>
   After spending an estimated $200 billion fixing year 2000
computer problems, American businesses want as many hands on deck
as possible to make sure it's business as usual Jan. 3, a Monday
morning and the first workday of year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a lot of people in the Kansas City area are
going to be working rather than celebrating,'' said Dean
Katerndahl, who heads the Mid-America Regional Council's Y2K
readiness efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to ease the pain a bit, some companies on the East and
the West coasts are serving steak and lobster and raffling off
computers for those pulling Y2K duty. In the Midwest seafood is
less plentiful, but some places still offer perks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Themed'' snack carts will roll at the Federal Reserve, bonus
checks will be written at Missouri Gas Energy, and nonalcoholic
wine and champagne will be served at Hallmark Cards Inc.
</P>
<P>
   And a couple of, er, lucky workers at Lathrop &AMP; Gage will get
fancy dinners and a luxury hotel room that night, but only after
ensuring that Y2K does not turn the law firm upside down.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rucker, a senior engineer for Kansas City Power &AMP; Light
Co., he will be pulling a 10-hour shift New Year's Eve, surrounded
by ``gauges and dials and things that go hum.''
</P>
<P>
   His perch will be a usually unstaffed electrical substation,
where he plans to while away the hours by reading a biography on
Winston Churchill. He will be there just in case the computers that
usually do the job go down.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, utilities are leaving nothing to chance.
</P>
<P>
   At KCP&AMP;L, 1,000 employees will be working 12-hour shifts. Food
will be catered that night, and extra water and food supplies will
be stored at a command center.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 750 employees drawing a paycheck from Missouri Gas
Energy, one-third will be on duty in the wee hours of Jan. 1 and
one-third will be on call, said Craig Daniels, a spokesman for the
utility.
</P>
<P>
   Catered meals and potluck fare will be served, not far from the
backup generators, extra fuel and portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other emergency workers, police Officers Patrick Kelly
and Ron Podrazen will spend New Year's Eve in their patrol cars.
They will be on the job to handle everything from crowd control to
general Y2K angst. Some 830 officers for the Kansas City Police
Department will be working 12-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
   At some companies, strategy for the Night of the Living Y2K
looks more like a military battle plan than a corporate timecard.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark will start its Y2K watch at 5 p.m. New Year's Eve, when
a staff of about 40 will begin methodically shutting down computer
programs. The process is expected to take six hours. Testing those
systems after they are restarted early New Year's morning will
continue through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At Yellow Freight, about 80 persons are to work the weekend. Jim
Cameron, Yellow's Y2K project leader, says he is pretty sure most
will have the weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be able to call the second or third shift and
tell them not to come in,'' Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
   He said some might come in anyway, because ``they want to see
this become a nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   And so much for that whole thing about bankers' hours.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City is
always a busy night _ as many as 3 million checks clear through the
bank that night.
</P>
<P>
   This year a little over a third of the bank's 950 employees will
be working New Year's Eve, said spokesman Barry Robinson. The
central bank will be busy through the weekend so that banks and
other financial institutions can test their connection to the Fed.
The bank plans to bring in catered food and offer baby-sitting for
300 workers expected in Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   On the other extreme is Thomas C. Owens, president of First Bank
of Kansas City, one of the area's smallest financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Owens and his seven employees are satisfied that their computers
will not skip a beat, so they have no party plans set for 39th and
Main streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole Y2K thing is terribly overblown,'' Owens
said.
</P>
<P>
   For those with party plans out of town, two or three employees
at Passport Travel in Overland Park will be working a split shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send the message that we'll be here if any problems
crop up,'' said Mike McGarry, vice president for information
services.

`MILLIONAIRE' SEEKS ANOTHER BIG SHARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
When ABC agreed to pick up Michael Davies' idea for a prime-time
game show for a limited run in August, he set himself a goal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who Wants To Be a Millionaire was already a hit in Britain and
other countries, so Davies, the show's executive producer, hoped
for some measure of success here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my office, I have hanging the research estimate from ABC's
re search department,'' Davies said ear lier this week in a
conference call. ``They forecasted a 9 share. I hung that in my
office as an inspiration to try to do an 11 share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up doing considerably more than an 11 share.''
</P>
<P>
   Try doubling it. So much for re search and predictions.
Millionaire, which returns for a 15-day run starting Nov. 7, was a
huge hit during its two-week run despite never producing a
million-dollar winner.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just a hit. It was water-cooler material, the kind
of phenomenon that spawned ``Did you see that?'' conversations all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really very surprised,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was. But what's not sur prising is that other networks
are now vying to cash in on Millionaire's success. CBS created
Survivor, in which contestants compete to survive on a remote
island (well, survive and win $1 million); it's scheduled for next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Greed, the Fox game show with a $2 million top
prize and perhaps the most honest name ever for a television show _
picture a cannibalistic version of Family Feud. More prime-time
game shows _ remakes of What's My Line?, The $64,000 Question and
Twenty-One _ are set to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Davies welcomes them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think the prime-time television business for too
long has been a sort of triad between the sitcom, the drama and the
newsmag azine,'' Davies said. ``I think it's great to have new
forms of pro gramming.''
</P>
<P>
   By which he apparently means cop ies of previous game shows, or
of shows that have worked elsewhere. But hey, as NBC used to say in
its ridiculous campaign to get people to watch reruns, if you
haven't seen it, it's new to you. Game-show nation is on its way,
for which we have Millionaire to thank, or blame, depending.
</P>
<P>
   Davies took great pains to point out changes that have been made
to Millionaire to address complaints after the first go-round. For
instance, if you watched in August, you got the idea that the only
people inter ested in playing game shows were White guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the thing I'm most un comfortable about _ I'm most
uncomfortable about the lack of women and the lack of minorities on
this program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A toll-free number has replaced the 900 number, for which
callers were charged, a change Davies hopes will encourage a more
diverse group of callers than the apparently overly competitive
White men who called repeatedly before, whittling down their
response times to ridiculously low numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, speed won't be as important. Everyone who
answers the questions correctly within 15 seconds will be entered
into a pool; contestants will be chosen randomly by a computer for
a telephone-play off second round.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Davies said he's loath to do anything that would
take away from the ``blind'' aspect of selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't say you have to have this great game-show personality
to be on Wheel of Fortune,'' he said. ``We don't say you have to
pass a multiquestion trivia test and a per sonality test in order
to be on Jeopardy! We simply take people who pass our phone test.
We never meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that aspect of the program. I don't think we would have
selected these great contestants we have, had we been meeting them
first. I think we might have selected other people. And that would
have been sad because we got such great, real people that the
American public related to.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies has also taken measures to ensure that there will be no
repeat of the August flap in which a con testant who answered a
question correctly was booted for giving the ``wrong'' answer. (He
was allowed to return.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We triple-sourced every single ques tion,'' Davies said.
``We've now decided to quadruple-source.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that definitely won't change: goofy, charming, Kathie
Lee-free host Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings that passion that makes you totally involved in it,
totally sells it, totally understand what makes it tick,'' Davies
said. ``He is a fire starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in August, Millionaire went up against repeats and
summer sludge. This time around, it's going head to head with
November sweeps programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps I don't expect to do quite as well as we did in the
summer,'' Davies said. ``But you know what? A 14 share, 15 share
(is) still pretty incredible to us.''
</P>
<P>
   And to anyone. So what's the secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the greatest thing I've ever learned about these
shows, to quote Monty Hall, is that every great game show has one
moment where the contestant can win everything or lose
everything,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   True enough. And with Monty Hall in your corner, how wrong can
you go?

REGULATOR FACES MERGER SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
A $1.8 billion deal to create one of the largest natural-gas
utilities in the nation has run aground amid a criminal
investigation, a civil lawsuit and allegations that an Arizona
regulator tampered with the deal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the center of the case, which involves the attempted takeover
of Southwest Gas Corp., is Arizona Corporation Commissioner Jim
Irvin and his former aide and confidant Jack Rose.
</P>
<P>
   A $750 million civil racketeering law suit filed in federal
court alleges that Irvin and Rose, among others, en gaged ``in a
secret campaign of deception, corruption, misrepresen tations'' and
``underhanded deal ings'' to influence regulatory officials.
</P>
<P>
   To back those claims, the suit points to sworn testimony from
regulators in California and Nevada, who say Irvin and Rose visited
them in March to lobby in favor of an Oklahoma company, Oneok Inc.,
seeking to purchase Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the meetings, Rose was negotiating a contract
with Prudential Securities, a Wall Street firm that sought to
finance the takeover. Rose didn't tell the out-of-state regulators
about his dealings with Prudential.
</P>
<P>
   If the Southwest-Oneok merger went through, Rose ultimately
stood to make more than $4 million, docu ments show.
</P>
<P>
   Rose never collected. Oneok's deal ings with Prudential
dissolved after the lawsuit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   The suit came from a spurned suitor of Southwest, Southern Union
Co., which alleges that Rose and Irvin conspired to advance the
offer from Oneok (pronounced One-oak) and undermine Southern
Union's bid by spreading false information about Southern.
</P>
<P>
   An amended complaint filed last month by Southern alleges
racketeer ing, fraud and other claims against Southwest, Oneok, and
numerous individuals, including Irvin and Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has said the lawsuit is without merit, and Oneok has
said the allegations are misleading and draw on ``hearsay and
innuendo.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's claims, however, also are being investigated by the
FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Mari copa County Attorney's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oneok's bid to create the largest stand-alone gas
distribution company in the nation is at a standstill, and
Southwest's stock price has dropped from a 52-week high of 29{ per
share in May to 23 7/16 per share on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger went through, Oneok, a Tulsa-based natural-gas
distribution company, would double in size, with 2.6 million
customers in five states. Right now, Las Vegas-based South west
serves about 685,000 customers in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The merger has been approved in Nevada and is pending in
California.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal also faces regulatory approval in Arizona, where at
least one commissioner, Carl Kunasek, has voiced concerns about the
actions of Rose and Irvin. A hearing on the merger has been delayed
until Febru ary.
</P>
<P>
   In August, in a letter to Oneok Chief Executive Officer Larry
Brummett, Kunasek wrote, ``(I)t's highly irregu lar for a sitting
commissioner to become an advocate for one suitor over another
during the course of acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunasek also said Irvin's actions were ``even more alarming''
because no official commission hearings have been held on the
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Irvin, 47, declined to address specific
allegations, citing pending litigation, but said he was the victim
of a ``political witch hunt'' and had done nothing illegal or
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Irvin has been driven by Kunasek and his top
aide, Jerry Porter. Kunasek and Irvin are political foes, and Rose
has been the target of Kunasek's ire in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said the charges leveled by Porter are based on innuendo
and supposition.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said he has nothing to hide, but ``this can't be tried in
the press.'' He said he has taken no position on the
Southwest-Oneok merger.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion to dismiss Southern's initial complaint in the case,
Irvin maintains he was acting in his ``official capacity'' as a
corporation commissioner in meeting with out-of-state officials.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rose said Irvin had done his own research and
wanted to make sure the company that took over Southwest Gas would
have the financial stability to fund expansion and maintain a good
safety record.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two sides to every story,'' Rose said. ``There are a
great number of so-called facts floating around which are not
truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   The amended complaint describes a letter hand-carried by Irvin
to regu lators in California and Nevada in March, the month before
the South west board would select a merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents, Irvin wanted to send the letter to the
Southwest board with signatures from other regulators. Richard
Bilas, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission,
agreed to sign the letter but reneged after fellow commissioners
objected.
</P>
<P>
   A Nevada regulator said Irvin told her that the letter was
designed to help Oneok emerge victorious over Southern Union, an
Austin-based natural-gas distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Irvin said that the way that the letter was written . . .
it was designed to point to Oneok, but we couldn't say so in so
many words because that would be improper,'' testified Judy
Sheldrew of the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the letter was intended to be positive for Oneok,''
added Sheld rew, who headed the Nevada com mission at the time of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Though the letter bears Irvin's signa ture, a previous draft is
linked to a law firm that represents Oneok. Officials from Oneok
maintain that Irvin simply asked their company to comment on the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, court documents re leased in the past few weeks have
buttressed claims that Irvin sought to influence the deal in favor
of Oneok:
</P>
<P>
   -When the out-of-state regulators refused to sign the letter,
Irvin sent it under his own signature, claiming that regulators in
California and Nevada ``share my concerns.'' The letter went to
Southwest Gas CEO Michael Maffie and Thomas Hartley, chairman of
the Southwest board.
</P>
<P>
   -Irvin either told regulators or gave the impression that Rose
was a commission consultant. Rose, however, was negotiating with
Prudential, which sought to finance the Southwest-Oneok deal.
</P>
<P>
   -Irvin did not seek reimbursement from the state for his
California trip, leading to Southern Union's claim that he sought
to hide his activities.
</P>
<P>
   -Explaining his California trip, Irvin was quoted in the Wall
Street Journal as saying that he just happened to run into Rose
while in San Francisco. But records from America West Airlines show
that Rose and Irvin flew back and forth on the same flights, and
sat near or next to each other.
</P>
<P>
   As the case continues, so do the merger attempts.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Southwest board ac cepted Oneok's offer, though it
was $108 million lower than Southern Union's. Southwest cited fears
that Southern Union would have diffi culty getting regulatory
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest spokesman Lewis Phelps said the company had legitimate
concerns about service complaints about Southern in Missouri and a
lengthy approval process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between Southern Union and the Missouri
(Public Service) Commission has been con tentious,'' Phelps said.
``And even absent that, the Missouri commis sion had a demonstrable
record of moving very, very slowly on merger applications.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Sheldrew, of Ne vada, and a California
regulatory official, Harvey Morris, both indi cate that Irvin was
arguing in favor of Oneok.
</P>
<P>
   They both said they didn't know Rose stood to gain financially
from the Oneok transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, an attorney with the Califor nia commission, said in a
sworn deposition that Irvin and Rose were lobbying in behalf of
Oneok when they met with him March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Morris testified that the discussion ``involved Commissioner
Irvin and Jack Rose explaining why they be lieved Oneok would be a
much better company to merge with Southwest Gas than Southern
Union.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, rather than coordinate the timing of merger applications
or other things, it became more of a lobbying campaign by
Commissioner Irvin and Jack Rose telling us why they believed
Southwest Gas would be better _ would be much better for ratepayers
to merge with than Southern Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he was given the impres sion that Rose was working
as a consultant to the Arizona commis sion, though no such
arrangement existed.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rose had resigned his job at the Arizona commission in
Decem ber 1998, a March 16 sign-in sheet at the California
commission lists ``ACC'' as his affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldrew said that Irvin and Rose went to her office March 24,
and Rose told her that he had investi gated both Oneok and Southern
Union and concluded that ``Oneok was by far the superior merger
candidate for a number of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin also introduced Rose as some one who was working with the
Arizona commission as a consultant on the Oneok deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said allegations that he signed in at the California
commission as a representative of the Arizona com mission and then
misrepresented himself as a commission employee are ``simply
untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the charges will be ``thor oughly disproven'' when the
matter reaches court.
</P>
<P>
   As for the letter Irvin carried to out-of-state regulators, it
did not mention either Oneok or Southern Union. Instead, the letter
presented a list of factors _ beyond stock price _ that the
Southwest board should consider if the merger was to receive
regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Sheldrew, who called Irvin's conduct ``very
unusual,'' ulti mately refused to sign the letter. She later
testified that ``I thought it was inappropriate for us to tell the
board of directors what to do as far as which merger partner to
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Irvin and Rose met with Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a
former chairman of Southwest Gas. At that meeting, according to an
affidavit by Guinn's chief of staff, Pete Ernaut, Rose was
appearing ``on behalf of Oneok.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Union's lawsuit alleges that on March 30, Guinn faxed a
copy of the Irvin letter to Maffie, of South west.
</P>
<P>
   ``On information and belief, shortly after Gov. Guinn sent the
draft letter, he called Maffie to say that the Southwest board
`better pay atten tion' to the letter when they received it, and
`better read between the lines,' '' the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Guinn has denied trying to influence the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Southern maintains that the letter was tailored to dovetail with
nega tive information being circulated about Southern by Irvin and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Such allegations are key to Southern Union, which alleges in its
lawsuit that Irvin and Rose made numerous false statements and
engaged in fraud to undermine its bid. They also accused Irvin and
Rose of making negative comments about the compa ny's
debt-to-equity ratio, safety re cord and community record. &QL;

CAT THIEF MAKES LUKAS' DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. -- The big winners of Breeders' Cup day were
Cat Thief, Frankie Dettori, one longshot-loving pick-six player,
and the manufacturers of those goofy-looking nasal strips for
horses.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest winner Saturday, towering above all the rest
once last time in the '90s, was D. Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, the Hall of Fame trainer who said in May that his time
had passed -- and then proceded to win the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness -- came up with another improbable triumph when Cat Thief
and jockey Pat Day scored a surprisingly tenacious victory at 19-1
in the Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief's win was Lukas' second on a day that supposed to
belong to his rival Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert drew a blank, stunning the Gulfstream Park crowd of
45,124, which helped to make his horses favorites in half of the
eight Breeders' Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas dominated, also winning the Juvenile Fillies with 32-1
Cash Run, and seeing his horses ring up a single-Breeders' Cup
record $2,728,400 in purses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most fun I've ever had, right here,'' the
64-year-old said shortly after winning the $4 million Classic with
Cat Thief, the 3-year-old son of Storm Cat who'd won just once in
11 starts in 1999 and three times in 18 starts in a career of
near-misses before this. ``I've been accused by ABC and NBC of not
showing enough emotion when I win. But ask my wife -- she's
probably got bruises from where I squeezed her arm today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You too,'' Lukas said, turning to William T. Young, Cat
Thief's owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we don't look that strong on paper,'' he told
reporters after winning the Classic for the first time to extend
his record Breeders' Cup win total to 15, ``when they hang it
(money) out there, we're going to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief, running second to the rail side of pacesetter Old
Trieste for much of the 1 1/4 miles, stuck his head in front on the
turn and then held Cinderella horse Budroyale at bay to win by 1
1/4 lengths in 1:59.52, the third fastest time in 16 runnings of
America's richest race. His only other victory this year came in
the Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park in July.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief probably was helped by the track condition and a gusty
wind blowing roughly up the stretch, which combined to help
front-running horses hold on in most of the races.
</P>
<P>
   He might -- emphasis on might -- have been helped too by the
nasal-strip breathing aids that Lukas and a few other trainers
affixed to their horses for the first time Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the eight Breeders' Cup winners were among 27 horses
wearing the strips, the third being 30-1 stretch runner Anees in
the Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   But Lukas was slow to give credit to a little piece of tape,
saying, ``Cat Thief won that race. I don't think the nasal strip
won it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if they want to offer me some money, I'll change that
testimonial,'' Lukas said of the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale (26-1) held second in a photo with Frank
Stronach-owned Golden Missile (75-1), and Bobby Frankel-trained
import Chester House (63-1) finished fourth. Cat Thief paid $41.20
to win, the exacta $1,209.60, the trifecta $39,031.20 and the
superfecta $692,907.
</P>
<P>
   All of which looked like horse feed to the Kentucky resident --
a video cameraman working at Gulfstream Saturday -- who cashed the
only perfect pick-six ticket for $3,058,137.60 after linking Cat
Thief with Anees, generously-priced Mile winner Silic ($16.40) and
three more obvious horses.
</P>
<P>
   Far back at the Classic wire were leading Horse of the Year
contender Behrens (seventh) and candidates Lemon Drop Kid (sixth),
General Challenge (10th) and River Keen (11th), the last two from
the Baffert barn.
</P>
<P>
   Their defeats, combined with the results of earlier races,
turned the whole Horse of the Year discussion upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's 3-year-old filly Silverbulletday suffered her second
straight sound defeat, running a tiring sixth behind Distaff winner
Beautiful Pleasure. Baffert's 2-year-old filly Chilukki couldn't
keep up with Cash Run and was beaten for the first time in a
seven-race career in the Juvenile Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I kept telling people, `I just hope I win one,' ''
Baffert said after going winless with eight horses on the day he
might have threatened Lukas' Breeders' Cup record of three wins on
a card.
</P>
<P>
   The results could swing the Horse of the Year election back to
Lukas' Charismatic, the Derby and Preakness winner who never raced
again after being injured in the Belmont in early June.
</P>
<P>
   Or the voters among the press and racing executives might take a
long look at Artax.
</P>
<P>
   Artax won the Sprint on Saturday by half a length over unlucky
Kona Gold, matching Mr. Prospector's 26-year-old track record and
breaking Elmhurst's two-year-old Breeders' Cup record by speeding 6
furlongs in 1:07.89. It's his third track record of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Artax provided the second of two wins for New York jockey Jorge
Chavez, who had won the first Breeders' Cup race of his career with
Beautiful Pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Also riding two winners was Jerry Bailey, aboard Cash Run and
Soaring Softly in the Filly and Mare Distaff.
</P>
<P>
   But neither loved it as much as Dettori, who rode Daylami to
victory over Royal Anthem in the Turf -- European-prepped horses
had been 0 for 38 in Breeders' Cup races in Florida -- a year after
the jockey was blamed for Swain's third-place finish in the 1998
Classic at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people tried to bury me,'' said the Europe-based
Dettori. ``But I'm back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, too. Then again, he never really left.

   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ A Kentucky resident working as a video
photographer at the Breeders' Cup will share a $3,058,137.60 payoff
after putting together the only winning pick-six ticket Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's believed to be the biggest payoff in U.S. racing history.
</P>
<P>
   G.D. Heironymous said he made the selections for a ticket
costing $196, although it was his brother who suggested including
19-1 Classic winner Cat Thief. He said fellow employees at Hammond
Communications Group and others working on the Breeders' Cup
Newsfeed had shares of the ticket, but not his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Breeders' Cup officials guaranteed a $5 million pool for the
pick-six, and fans wagered $5,436,691.
</P>
<P>
   Favorites won two of the six races. Anees (30-1 in the Juvenile)
was the day's other longshot winner.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets linking five winners were worth $5,996.20. &QL;

BUSH, MCCAIN IN DEAD HEAT; BRADLEY MOVING UP, POLL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES AND CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
As Arizonans look ahead exactly one year to casting their votes for
the first president of the new millen nium, the front-runners in
the GOP field are locked in a statistical dead heat, according to
the Arizona Poll.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush leads Arizona Sen. John McCain, 40 per
cent to 36 percent, with publisher Steve Forbes in third place with
7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the Democratic nomina tion is nearly as tight, with
dark horse Bill Bradley cinching up what was once a wide gap
between himself and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore garnered 46 percent support to Bradley's 35 percent,
according to the Arizona Republic-sponsored sur vey of 812
registered voters con ducted Oct. 20-26 by Precision Research of
Phoenix. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also indicated that:
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans want presidential candi dates and members of Congress
to focus their attention on education, health care, crime and
Social Secu rity.
</P>
<P>
   A significant number, 12 percent, were registered as
Independents.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 42 percent consider themselves to be ``middle of the
road'' politically, while 37 percent called themselves conservative
and 21 percent said they were liberal.
</P>
<P>
   If the choice for the presidential election were Gore and Bush,
37 percent would want a third-party candidate to run.
</P>
<P>
   The results augur an increasingly competitive primary season in
Ari zona, as McCain and Bush slug it out for for the lead and as
Forbes, who won Arizona's primary in 1996, tries to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   `I think we're looking at a three-horse race here,'' said Mike
Min naugh, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's surge against Gore was particularly striking,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
   The last poll conducted by Arizona State University pollster
Bruce Mer rill on the Democratic race had Gore with a comfortable
lead over Bradley at 42 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fleisher, chairman of the Ari zona Democratic Party, said
the numbers reflect Bradley's growing appeal in the West and among
voters who believe he has the best shot at beating Bush in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people see the vice president as having done a
bad job, they just believe that Bradley can energize people and
bring new peo ple to the party,'' Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush and McCain are in a statistical deadlock,
considering the poll's margin of error, the results indicate that
McCain's Arizona cam paign has lost some momentum over the past few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The last poll of Republican voters, taken by Merrill, had McCain
ahead of Bush, 39 percent to Bush's 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A representative for McCain said the candidate will regain
primacy in the coming months, particularly if his poll numbers
continue to rise in states such as New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``As John McCain continues to move up in the polls in the early
primary states, you are going to continue to see Arizonans who sup
ported him in five consecutive elec tions come back to him for the
primary in February,'' said Dan Schnur, a McCain spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush said the numbers reflect the Texas
governor's growing popularity here and his decision to focus
heavily on the state's early primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is taking nothing for granted, and he will continue to work
hard to earn the support of the people from Arizona,'' Scott
McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Forbes suggested his campaign isn't paying much
heed to voter surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope our opponents be lieve this poll,'' said Bert
Coleman, Forbes' Arizona campaign director. ``It would certainly
make our job much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dennison, a retired Air Force major, said McCain won't get
his support for several reasons, includ ing McCain's involvement in
the ``Keating Five'' savings and loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a history, and so he can look good on the surface,
but if you look a little bit deeper, I'm not sure what we're
getting there,'' Dennison said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is leaning toward voting as an independent because he
has grown weary of the GOP and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Republicans have been doing a respectable
job, and of course I hate the Democrats because they lie so much.
But I think the Republicans have been telling some tales, too,''
Dennison said. ``The system is busted. It's not working.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Wolford, a Lake Havasu City writer who gives her age as
``over 65,'' said she backs Bush for presi dent because, for one
thing, he is electable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be elected, and it's awfully important we get the
socialists out,'' Wolford said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolford said she's against McCain because he would restrict
campaign contributions, which she thinks is a restriction of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   She's also concerned about what she's read about McCain's
explosive temper, especially because of the war powers he would
have as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who can't control his temper, he's apt not to be able
to control his finger on the button,'' Wolford said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, like McCain for his independent streak.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Balzano, 41, a Prescott Real tor, said she thinks McCain
``just seems to be able to stand on his own, seems to be more of
his own man.''
</P>
<P>
   Balzano also thinks that McCain might be able to win over
conserva tive Democrats, something she thinks Bush probably can't
do.
</P>
<P>
   Adolph Browning, 81, of Green Valley, likes McCain's maverick
atti tude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he marches lock-step with the rest of the
Republicans,'' said Browning, an Independent. ``He's his own man.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters were equally split between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bonny Sands, an adjunct professor of linguistics at Northern
Arizona University, said she supports Gore, despite criticism that
he is boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if the guy is dull or ugly as long as he or she
works,'' Sands said.
</P>
<P>
   But Emile Moses, 71, of Tucson, said Bradley has outperformed
Gore on the stump so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are just too turned off by Gore,'' Moses said.
``They see him as wooden and stiff. He's done a good job (as vice
president), he's just not my man.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Runyon, 52, a data processing consultant who lives in the
Tucson area, also favors Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Though Runyon sees Bradley as fairly close to Gore on the
issues, he believes Bradley is simply more attractive as a
candidate: seasoned, erudite and balanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has good reasons why he does things and he's not part of
Bill Clinton's administration,'' Runyon said.
</P>
<P>
   Though conservative activist Gary Bauer was selected as the top
choice for the GOP nomination by only 1 percent of those in the
survey, he has a strong backer in Tambra Bartholo mew, 35, a
homemaker who lives in St. Johns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because of his pro-family, pro-life stand,'' said
Bartholomew, the mother of four children. ``I've always seen him
stand up for the right.'' &QL;

NOVELIST GEORGE HIGGINS DEAD AT 59 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAD WRITETHROUGH-BOS  
 (Eds: Clarifies location of home in lede)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ George V. Higgins, the novelist who brought Boston's
underworld to vivid and unsentimental life in ``The Friends of
Eddie Coyle,'' was found dead Saturday in his home in Milton, Mass.
He was 59.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Higgins's death was sudden, said his daughter, Susan. She
said the writer's family is ``still in shock and not prepared to
make a comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Higgins, who was born in Brockton, Mass., and wrote some 25
books, graduated from Boston College with a degree in English
Literature in 1961, and received a master's degree from Stanford
University in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career as a reporter for the Providence Journal,
then went on to work for the Associated Press in Western
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to law school at Boston College, and in 1967, he was
hired by the Massachusetts attorney general's office, working his
way up from legal assistant to assistant attorney general, before
moving on to become an assistant US attorney in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor, he often handled organized crime cases, in
which he got to know the kinds of characters on whom he would
eventually build his literary reputation.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970, Mr. Higgins had amassed a large collection of
unpublished novels, as many as 14, which he promptly ``dumped'' one
day, according to his longtime friend, Boston University professor
Jon Klarfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Father Francis W. Sweeney, who taught Mr. Higgins during
literature classes at BC and was a mentor to the young writer,
begged him to keep trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `George, don't give up. You have it, and there will be
a time when we hold your first book in our hands,' '' Sweeney
recalled Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That time came in 1972, with the publication by Knopf of ``The
Friends of Eddie Coyle.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was an immediate bestseller. Mr. Higgins had re-created
the lives of petty mobsters as few other writers ever had, giving
them authentic Boston settings and speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole life, I've been a great eavesdropper,'' Higgins told
The London Daily Telegraph in September. ``The nuances of ordinary
speech interest me, but what really fascinates me is the person who
is so caught up in what he's saying that he tells more truth than
he intends to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie Coyle'' was made into a movie directed by Peter Yates
and starring Robert Mitchum and Peter Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   Critics lauded his arrival as a major talent, and his subsequent
novels, including ``The Digger's Game,'' ``Cogan's Trade,'' and ``A
City On A Hill,'' also won plaudits.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Higgins churned out a book almost every year, and though few
of his later novels matched the success of his earlier ones, he
became something of a cult figure for readers.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had become a successful writer, he left neither law
nor journalism far behind. He wrote columns for The Boston Herald
American, The Boston Globe, and The Wall Street Journal between
1977 and 1985. And every year, he hosted a lunch at Locke-Ober for
old colleagues from his days as a newspaperman and lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought together diverse people,'' Klarfeld said. ``I have
friends today and we all met through George, one way or another. He
was an inadvertent matchmaker of lifelong friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George was a wonderfully loyal friend and a ferociously loyal
enemy. I was happy to be in first category,'' said Martin F. Nolan,
former editor of the Globe editorial page, who first met Mr.
Higgins in 1957 when both were freshmen at Boston College. ``When I
started working as a reporter at the Globe, George thought my job
was more fun than studying creative writing. So he switched and
became one of the fastest guns the Associated Press ever hired. Law
and novel-writing came later. His personality seldom changed. The
gruffness concealed a heart bigger and grander than his ego.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he was still writing: his last novel, ``The
Agent,'' was published this year. Mr. Higgins also taught creative
writing at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his second wife, Loretta Cubberley; and two children,
Susan, 31, and John, 30.

CAVALIERS HAVE GIANT SHOES TO FILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ You want to know the real wild card in the East?
It's not the Celtics or the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   It's IBM. As in Injured Big Man.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than four giants have been felled, while another has
apparently retired. All five fellows lead playoff-aspiring teams,
and you can make a case that their teams will suffer _ some more
than others _ as long as they stay on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have the early edge to overcome the loss of Patrick
Ewing, simply because they know how to play without him. The Nets
need Jayson Williams, but they probably need alleged point guard
Stephon Marbury to have fewer nights than the one he had Wednesday
(25 shots, 1 assist). The Pistons already have forgotten the
retired Bison Dele; they also lost to Orlando Wednesday. Matt
Geiger is out for another month for Philly, which also is missing
Theo Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Z. You could make a case that none of the above
teams' success is so utterly dependent on one big player as the
Cavaliers' is on Zydrunas Ilgauskas. With him, they are a playoff
team and a potentially decent one. Without him, it's time for GM
Jim Paxson to pick out his best TV-friendly suit and get the
cheapest fare for a May trip to Secaucus and the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Ilgauskas has a stress fracture in the navicular bone in his
left foot. It hasn't healed the way everyone had hoped, and he's on
the shelf for another couple of months. He played only five games
last year because of the same injury. Hint: If it didn't mend from
May to October, is that a problem? (Bill Walton has already said
NBC won't hire Ilgauskas because he's seen the X-rays.)
</P>
<P>
   While the Cavs were in Orlando two days ago, Ilgauskas and
Paxson flew to Washington, D.C., to confer with three foot
specialists. The 7-foot-3-inch center, still only 24, already has
seen at least two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hasn't healed,'' Paxson said before making the trip.
``What we hope to have is some sort of game plan in a couple weeks.
We're trying to be cautious. We're going to wait and see if it
heals on its own. If it doesn't . . .''
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to go there, although some people in the Cleveland
camp are concerned that the injury is degenerative. While Paxson
admits he thinks about the worst-case scenario ``only every
night,'' agent Herb Rudoy, who represents Ilgauskas, says he's not
concerned. (Ilgauskas is into a six-year, $71 million deal.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He had three operations on the other foot,'' Rudoy said, ``and
that foot is fine, solid. It hasn't given him any problem. This
thing will take some time. He has weak feet. Maybe he came back too
soon. That's something you can't fake. But I think we're going to
be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson, of course, is praying for just that. He has a team built
on inside-out movement, with Shawn Kemp and a healthy Ilgauskas
down low and snipers such as Wesley Person, Lamond Murray (also
hurt), and rookie Trajan Langdon. He's got slashers in Brevin
Knight, Bob Sura, and Cedric Henderson. It's an interesting mix.
It's going to stay merely interesting as long as Andrew DeCler &UR; cq
 &LR; is the main man in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't replace a guy like (Ilgauskas),'' Paxson said.
``We're doing it in the short term, but you can't wait. You still
have to play the games. We can only hope that we can get him back
on the floor for a legitimate period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilgauskas did play briefly before camp, and that's when the foot
acted up again. He also was bothered by an infection. But the scary
thought is that if he rebroke the foot this fall, it must be right
out of the Walton/Royal Doulton Consistency School. If he didn't,
it didn't heal. Neither of those scenarios is appealing to the
Cavs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to get as much information as we can and
decide from there,'' Paxson said. ``We all want him out there on
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Celtics decided to sign Adrian Griffin, they called the
league and got a salary figure. It was for the NBA minimum. But the
figure, $385,000, was the minimum for a second-year player, and
Griffin had not played a single second in the NBA. However, under
the rules, if a player signs an NBA contract of any kind, excepting
a 10-day contract, he automatically is credited with a year of
service. Griffin joined Miami after the lockout ended last January,
spent about a week there, and was cut, even before any exhibitions.
Miami not only signed him, but guaranteed him $100,000. That's not
bad for a week's work. ``I probably needed more time to fit into
their system, and they felt they had to go with the guys who knew
the system,'' Griffin said. ``There's always an opportunity to show
what you can do. It was the first time I was ever in a veteran
camp. I learned a few things.'' Marty Conlon was also in the Heat
camp, and he said he was quite surprised when the Heat let Griffin
go. ``I thought he played really well,'' Conlon said . . . Here's
one reason why Mitch Richmond may look a little out of sorts. ``My
defense,'' he says, ``is way ahead of my offense right now. That
says a lot right there.'' Richmond missed much of the Washington
exhibition season with a sore hamstring. To get back into shape,
he's been working out twice a day. ``I've got to get my wind and my
rhythm,'' he said. ``The season is not going to wait.'' . . . Glad
to see everything is still the way it was in Chicago. The Bulls
amassed 74 points in their season-opening loss at home to the
Knicks. Toni Kukoc was a stylish 1 for 14 _ the starting five was
12 for 46 _ but the even more telling stat was at the free throw
line: Chicago outshot the Knicks by an astonishing 40-9 count and
still lost, by 10 points, at home. The Bulls made 29 free throws
(they had only 21 field goals) . . . The Rockets saw their home
sellout streak snapped at 176 opening night against Milwaukee. They
weren't alone in the empty seat department. Of the 13 Tuesday
openers, only two sold out: the always-sold-out Knicks and the
almost-always-sold-out Jazz, who were playing the Lakers. (Utah did
not sell out for its second game against Houston, and San Antonio
doesn't really have a sellout figure.) Two teams opening new
buildings, the Nuggets and Clippers, drew big but not full houses.
The Nets had only 13,051 for their opener against Indiana.
Charlotte not only couldn't sell out its opener, it also couldn't
sell out against the Pacers Thursday, a big early-season game. In
addition, Cleveland, Orlando, and the Lakers did not sell out their
home openers Wednesday, while Atlanta (new building) and Seattle
did not have full houses Thursday. The Lakers, incidentally, have a
larger sellout figure than the Clippers, even though they inhabit
the same domicile (Staples Center). Must be for Shaq's entourage .
. . As for Houston, not only did it not sell out, it also lost to
the Bucks Tuesday. ``No disrespect, but let's be realistic: They're
not going to win anything,'' Charles Barkley said. ``It's going to
be a long year if we can't beat the Milwaukee Bucks.'' The Rockets
also saw a new arena vote go down the tubes that night. They have
three years left on their lease at the Compaq Center (nee Summit),
and you can expect to read about interest from New Orleans,
Nashville, and even Las Vegas, although commissioner David Stern
doesn't want to see a team in a city where people can legally bet
on basketball. With the Oilers gone to Nashville and the Astros
moving into a baseball park, isn't it ironic that the Astrodome,
the building that started all the now-obligatory non-sport nonsense
(exploding scorebards, etc.), will have no pro tenant? Meanwhile,
the Spurs' arena referendum _ also known as ``Keep Tim'' _ passed
easily, despite covert opposition, ballot stuffing, voter
intimidation, and laundered money, all believed to have come from
the Orlando and Chicago areas.

   The Mavericks, meanwhile, drew 12,848 for their home opener
against Golden State, the smallest such crowd since 1992. They also
learned then that their first-round draft pick, Leon Smith, had
decided after all to join the team. This did not come as good news
for the Mavericks, who (1) never should have drafted the kid (he
was out of high school), and (2) once they did, should have simply
renounced his rights. Instead, they gave Smith a qualifying offer
and he accepted it, even though the sides had apparently agreed
Smith would benefit the most by playing this year in the IBL or
CBA, albeit at an NBA wage. This way, he'll sit on the bench, get
some practice time, and basically waste the year. Smith was one of
two high schoolers taken in the first round. And Celtics scout Leo
Papile reports there are three high school seniors who, if they
come out, could all be top 10 picks. That raises two questions: (1)
Are the collegians that bad? (2) Why couldn't Kevin Garnett have
stunk? . . . One of the better comeback stories is taking place in
Orlando. Monty Williams, the onetime first-round pick of the Knicks
(1994) who played six minutes in the NBA last season (with Denver),
has hooked up with the Magic. He and Orlando coach Doc Rivers are
tight from their San Antonio days (1996), and Rivers wanted him for
his youngish team. Williams had 12 points and 7 rebounds in the
Magic's home opener, and he is taking time from last year's
promising rookie, Matt Harpring. Williams, by the way, is one of 16
Williamses in the NBA register, ranging from Aaron to Walt . . .
The Knicks didn't waste any time wrapping up Latrell Sprewell for
five years and $62 million. Just think, if he had skipped all of
training camp instead of just the two-a-days in Charleston, he
might have gotten another guaranteed year . . . The same night that
Denver beat Phoenix in Denver, a horse owned by Nuggets coach Dan
Issel won a race _ in Phoenix. Issel's debut in Denver was a
double-overtime win . . . How long before Tracy McGrady gets his
wish and starts? Not long, insists coach Butch Carter. McGrady was
not pleased about coming off the bench against the Celtics, mainly
because he had started at point guard during the exhibition season.
``It's a better scenario not to have him starting now,'' Carter
said. ``But he's going to.'' Carter felt he'd be putting too much
pressure on the 20-year-old McGrady if he started him out of the
box. McGrady is up for a big hit at the end of this season. ``I
don't care about his contract,'' Carter said. ``He's a better
player than he was last year. Extremely better. And I'm going to do
everything I can to make him an even better player.''

MARINO: NHL SHOULD BE THINKING CAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Kevin Paul Dupont  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the end, a waiter didn't arrive at his table, check
tucked away in a fine leathery binder, a 15 percent tip factored
into the final amount.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the mind-boggling charges came bite by bite, dollar
after dollar, over the course of 30 months.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Marino's total losses during 2 1/2 years of owning the
Pittsburgh Penguins: $45 million. Ownership has its privileges,
right? By the calculations of the affable Marino, cofounder of
Hopkinton-based EMC Corp., the Penguins cost him about $50,000 a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, I miss it dearly,'' said Marino, who was left
with no reasonable alternative but to place the team in bankruptcy,
ultimately leading to a new ownership group led by former Penguins
star Mario Lemieux. ``It was challenging, and I like a challenge,
but some big changes have to take place in the sport, financially.
It's tough for one person to think about owning a hockey team. And
when you've got 20 of the league's 28 teams losing money, hey, that
can't go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   When the NHL's Collective Bargaining Agreement expires following
the 2003-04 season, the plight of the Penguins will be front and
center in its argument with the players for a financial overhaul.
By then, there undoubtedly will be at least one more club or two
that, at the very least, will be flirting with bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Pittsburgh put everyone on alert,'' said New
Jersey Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello. ``You see what
happened there, and you see what other teams are going through, on
the Island, and in Calgary, Edmonton, and Ottawa. It's scary when
you're in those boardrooms and see how close Pittsburgh came to
folding.''
</P>
<P>
   The contentious lockout in the fall of '94 did not create a true
drag on player salaries, and there is little doubt that league
owners will shut down the shop again in '04 in an attempt to win a
salary cap. The last lockout created an escalating cap for
entry-level players and gave owners some creative tools to slow
down salaries. But most if not all of the owners say something
dramatic has to change for them to achieve a true salary slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have four of five clubs that won't behave themselves,''
Marino reflected. ``They just keep spending and spending. Listen,
it's pretty simple. If you're running a business, your expenses
can't exceed 100 percent of your income. ``Is there a salvation? I
think there is, and it has to be a shift in the attitude of some
owners who will pay (outrageous) amounts in hopes of winning the
Stanley Cup. The shift has to be in those clubs' taking a
responsible position.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Marino agreed, that will lead to the league
bargaining for a salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some form of it,'' he said, ``and the more firm, the better.
It can't work the way it is. I don't know what they accomplished in
'94.''
</P>
<P>
   All that said, and the steep financial cost to him factored in,
Marino said he'd like to be an NHL owner again if the economic
picture changes. This isn't a guy who backs away from a challenge,
no matter how daunting the debt might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, if things were fixed, I probably couldn't afford
it because the price of the teams would go up too much,'' he said.
``An NFL team? I don't have the wherewithal for that, unless I
mortgaged my family, and that's not something I'd ever do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly did enjoy my two years _ the challenge of it. Now, if
you'd told me I'd have a good time and that it would cost me $45
million, sure, I would have said, `No thanks, I'll pass that up.'
I'm not crazy. At least I don't think I'm crazy. But would I do it
again? Absolutely. It's that old thing, you know, it's the things
in life that you don't do that you regret.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Revere-born and -raised Marino continues on
with other ventures. The latest thing to catch his eye is the movie
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' he said, laughing at the prospect of producing
films. ``I understand that you can lose a lot of money, so I'll
look into that. I've always been a film buff, so I'm looking
around, getting numbers together. I can't just sit around. I'm too
young for that.''
</P>

   Weird goings-on in Chicago. Just a week ago Friday, reports had
it that Blackhawks general manager Bob Murray had agreed to pay
holdout Bo Mironov $9.6 million over three years, which would have
given the team a badly needed shot at the point, where the hefty
JumBo hammers a heavy slapper. Later in the day, however, Murray
rang back Mironov's agent, Paul Theofanus, with news that club
owner Bill Wirtz had reneged on the deal. Reason: The pay for the
last year of the pact _ $3.4 million _ was too high. Can you
imagine Boston owner Jeremy Jacobs giving thumbs-down to a Harry
Sinden deal? Once the owner begins taking the GM's pen out from
under him, look out. The next line change undoubtedly will come in
the front office. Murray later stated Mironov had been saying for
two days he would turn down the offer of $9.6 million. If Murray
gets the gate, look for Mike Smith, ex- of the Winnipeg and Toronto
front offices, to be one of the first Wirtz considers for the job.
Smith is on the Vineyard these days, consulting for NHL clubs.
``More than one and less than 28,'' said Smith, who helped shape
the Leafs into contenders . . . The vote came out big-time Tuesday
for the Coyotes, and they'll get their badly needed new rink,
possibly as early as the 2001-02 season (remember, desert weather
allows for year-round, 24-hour-a-day construction). The $180
million arena will be part of a publicly backed $535 million
redevelopment of the dilapidated Los Arcos Mall in Scottsdale,
Ariz. Meanwhile, former Bruins assistant coach Bob Francis got the
Desert Dogs off to their best start in franchise history (8-3-3 in
the first 14 games). One key: Travis Green, acquired from the Ducks
at the June draft, has helped shape two legitimate scoring lines
and added significant depth on the power play. Green was the 23d
pick (Islanders) in the '89 draft and most recently was seen
playing a defensive role for the Ducks. Cast in a different role,
he's beginning to blossom as an offensive force (10-5_15 in 14
games) . . . Ex-Bruin Wes Walz, who played in Switzerland the last
three years, had an eye on an NHL return when he signed with Los
Angeles (IHL) this season and was off to a great start (4-3_7 in
six games) with the Ice Dogs. But when his old European club (Zug)
came calling early last month, Walz found the lure of the hills and
the offer of money too much to turn down . . . Claude Lemieux asked
out of Colorado, which led to his trade last week to New Jersey for
Brian Rolston. Lemieux makes just under $2.5 million this season
and will be an unrestricted free agent next July 1. Informed that
Avalanche GM Pierre Lacroix wouldn't be interested in re-signing
him _ just as Lacroix had passed on Theo Fleury, Valeri Kamensky,
and Sylvain Lefebvre _ the aging agitator asked to be moved and was
given permission to talk to Devils GM Lamoriello.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, where ex-Bruin Bryan Smolinski won the league's
most recent Player of the Week honors, the Kings have seen a jump
of some 25 percent in attendance since moving to their new
building. They averaged 15,582 through their first five games. More
significantly, they were showing greater than a 50 percent jump in
scoring and were projected to finish the season with 98 more goals
than their 189 in 1998-99. Troubling news in La-La Land on Friday,
though: Top-scoring Luc Robitaille will be sidelined 2-6 weeks with
a broken foot . . . According to Boston-based Bob Caporale, whose
Game Plan LLC is fielding offers to buy the Ottawa Senators, club
owner Rod Bryden ``would sell today if the right deal came along.''
At the moment, however, all Canadian-owned clubs face a variety of
onerous taxes, some provincial and some federal, that make it
difficult not only to set a price, but to find a suitor. ``In one
instance,'' said Caporale, ``we have one individual who is able and
willing to move quickly.'' But until/unless some of the tax
entanglements get resolved, the Senators are far more likely to be
sold to a US-based owner who'll bring them south, a la the Jets
(Winnipeg to Phoenix) and Nordiques (Quebec City to Denver).
Bryden's preference is to keep the club in Ottawa . . . The
Senators set Monday as their drop-dead date for self-exiled Alexei
Yashin to come back and honor the $3.5 million deal he has in place
for this season. Midnight will strike, and Yashin will remain in
Switzerland, where he's training, waiting for the Senators to deal
him. The three most likely clubs to get in the bidding: (1) the
Rangers, (2) the Red Wings, and (3) the Panthers. How about a deal
that would see Yashin land in Detroit and Sergei Fedorov get bumped
to South Florida, where he could be the much-needed setup guy for
Pavel Bure? . . . The Canucks remain impressed with former
University of Maine captain Steve Kariya, now on a line with Andrew
Cassels and Alex Mogilny. ``He doesn't have the explosive first
step that his brother (Paul Kariya, with Anaheim) has,'' said
Vancouver GM Brian Burke. ``But overall, he has excellent speed,
and the thing that I try to impress on our media out here, this is
a true, character player we've added.''. . . After a couple of
strong games out of the gate, Tampa Bay goalie Daren Puppa is
hurting again, and last week the Bolts put him on waivers. They'll
move forward with Dan Cloutier and Kevin Hodson . . . Phoenix
rookie defenseman Radoslav Suchy began his career with No. 63 on
his back, but he recently moved to a more conventional No. 15.
``Because race cars have 63,'' explained Suchy, ``not hockey
players.'' . . . The Nov. 12 edition of The Hockey News has Bruins
bench boss Pat Burns ranked fifth overall on the coaching pay
scale, with a salary of $850,000 this season . . . The Thrashers,
here Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, thought two older Czechs, 27-year-olds
Vladimir Vujtek and Martin Prochazka, could help highly touted
rookie Patrik Stefan ease into NHL life. Stefan is still here, but
both of his countrymen have been bought out, neither one showing
any spark in their brief stints as Thrashers. The irony, pointed
out GM Don Waddell, was that Stefan, after a season-plus playing
for Long Beach (IHL), arrived in Atlanta acting and sounding more
North American than Czech . . . Disconcerting news out of Detroit:
Gordie Howe has skin cancer on his left shin and will undergo
surgery Nov. 29 in Toledo, where his oldest son, Murray, is the
head of radiology for three hospitals. Mr. Hockey, now 71,
initially thought the small growth was caused by a scratch received
while swimming near coral in Florida . . . Trade rumors are
bubbling in Chicago, where the Hawks are believed to be looking for
someone to take the old-and-slow Wendel Clark off their hands
(hello, Calgary?). In Buffalo, the versatile Dixon Ward could be on
the market. If the Sabres could move him, say, for a draft pick,
they might consider going out and signing unrestricted free agent
Ray Sheppard (last seen in Carolina). If superstar goalie Dominik
Hasek is ostensibly done for the year with his torn groin muscle, a
substantial portion of his $7 million salary should be picked up by
insurance, thus allowing GM Darcy Regier to go out and do some
shopping . . . Byron Dafoe's new deal here in the Hub will bring
him a prorated $2.9 million this year, $3.15 million next year, and
$3.4 million in 2001-02. His agent, Ron Salcer, would not comment
when reached Friday by the Globe. Dafoe said last week he had
discharged Salcer prior to signing the new deal with the Bruins.
``I haven't been able to speak to Byron,'' said Salcer, ``and until
I do, I have nothing to say.''

THERE ARE LIMITS TO IOC REFORM PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It may not be the radical reform some critics had
demanded after the Salt Lake bidding scandal, but the proposals by
the special IOC 2000 commission are the most sweeping in Olympic
history. If the full body approves them as expected next month, the
IOC will have an age limit of 70 for new nominees, renewable
eight-year term limits, a larger executive board (from 11 to 15),
and a more diverse group of members.
</P>
<P>
   The new committee would include 15 active athletes, 15
presidents of international sports federations, and 15 members of
national Olympic committees or continental associations. The
remaining 70 members would be elected individually with a selection
panel screening the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved, though, is the issue that caused controversy
in the first place _ letting IOC members visit bid cities. The
commission has suggested either a complete ban or allowing only a
small, tightly supervised group to make the trips. Another sticky
issue is the president's tenure: one eight-year term or
eight-plus-four? Juan Antonio Samaranch has held the job for nearly
two decades. And one thing the reforms won't do is clean out the
incumbents. All current members can serve until they're 80.
</P>
<P>
   The US Olympic Committee, meanwhile, has nearly completed its
corporate evolution. Its board recently voted unanimously to
endorse changes that would make its executive director the CEO with
full day-to-day power and would turn the president into the board
chairman. The fact is that the USOC, with its nine-figure budget,
its 550 employees, and its nearly two dozen committees, is too
complex to be run by a volunteer. So it has hired a headhunter to
find a CEO by February to replace Dick Schultz, who'll focus on
fund-raising for the remainder of his contract. And president Bill
Hybl will step down when his term ends at the end of next year. Top
candidates to succeed him are vice presidents Paul George, the
Wellesley attorney who was chef de mission of the US team in Nagano
last year, and Sandra Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why did the USOC choose San Antonio over Raleigh-Durham as the
bid city for the 2007 Pan-American Games? Diversity. The Texas city
is heavily Latino, which is the dominant flavor of the hemisphere.
The last American host was Indianapolis in 1987. The 2003 Games
will be held in Santo Domingo _ finances and hurricanes permitting
. . . The short list of candidates to succeed Tony DiCicco as US
Olympic women's soccer coach: essentially assistants Lauren Gregg
and Jay Hoffman. Any college coaches would have to abandon their
teams in-season, since the Summer Games don't begin until
mid-September. Gregg, a Wellesley native and former Harvard
assistant who has been with the program for a decade, would be the
first female to be the team's head coach. Whoever gets the job
won't have much transition time. The Americans resume play in early
January with a tournament in Australia . . . Terrific achievement
by Lawrence's Jimmy Pedro, who became the first US victor in a
dozen years (and only the third ever) at the recent world judo
championships in England. The 28-year-old Pedro, who decided to
hang in for another quadrennium after winning the Olympic bronze in
Atlanta, is now the favorite in the 73kg class for Sydney. Fall
River's Joe Felton, the ex-Detroit Lion, was also supposed to
compete but withdrew because of an injury . . . As expected, no
Americans made the podium at the recent world gymnastics
championships in China, but Blaine Wilson came agonizingly close,
missing the bronze in the all-around by a thousandth of a point. If
he'd just had a decent rings routine (instead of his 9.325), Wilson
would have become the first Yank in 20 years (since Kurt Thomas) to
take a world medal. Rough go for the inexperienced US women, who
placed sixth (just as the men did) and had Vanessa Atler and
Kristen Maloney pull out with injuries before the event finals. The
Chinese men and Romanian women each won their fourth straight team
titles, and Russia's Nikolai Krukov and Romania's Maria Olaru
claimed the all-around crowns. The US did come home with a
consolation prize, at least. Both the men and women qualified for
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No US cycling medals at the recent world championships on both
road and track. The Yanks thought they had a silver from two-time
victor Marty Nothstein, but an official changed the order of the
finish and dropped him to sixth. Best showings were a fifth from
Chann McRae in the men's road race and a sixth from Erin Veenstra
in the women's points race. The French ruled the track with seven
golds in 12 events, including two apiece by Felicia Ballanger (her
fifth straight match sprint and fourth straight time trial) and
Marion Clignet. The Lithuanians topped the road table with three
medals in four races . . . Good showing by the US wrestlers, who
won three medals and earned Olympic slots in six of eight weight
classes, at the recent world freestyle championships in Turkey. The
Americans, who got a gold from Stephen Neal (286 pounds), a silver
from Lincoln McIlravy (152), and a bronze from Les Gutches
(187.25), finished second to the Russians in the team event . . .
US Olympic sailors have already been decided in three classes _
Mike Gebhardt and Lanee Butler in Mistral, Paul Foerster-Bob
Merrick (Portsmouth, R.I.) and JJ Isler-Pease Glaser in 470, and
Jonathan and Charlie McKee in 49er. All but Merrick and Glaser have
been to previous Games. Trials in the remaining classes will be
held next year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why is the US sending a full team to this month's world
weight-lifting championships in Athens? Because Olympic slots
depend on the results. Best chances ride with the women, who have
legitimate medal hopefuls in Tara Nott (48kg), Robin Goad (53kg),
and Cara Heads-Lane (75kg). The host Greeks figure to rule the
men's event again, with the Chinese and Taiwanese favored in the
women's . . . After breezing past the Brazilians, Australians, and
Poles in their September tuneup events, the US women's basketball
team is barnstorming college campuses for a dozen games this month
and next against NCAA tournament teams, including champion Purdue
and runner-up Duke. The Americans face Tennessee Sunday, which will
be a homecoming for Nikki McCray and Chamique Holdsclaw . . . With
the addition of skeleton sledding, women's bobsled, and new events
in short-track speedskating, cross-country, Nordic combined, and
the biathlon, the program for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake
City will be the biggest in history _ 78 events, 10 more than
Nagano . . . Irish swimmer Michelle Smith de Bruin won't have her
26 national records stripped after all. Swim Ireland had said it
would throw out the record book (which is 100 percent Smith) Jan. 1
because it considered her records tainted by doping. But when Smith
threatened to go to court, the federation backed down. Which means,
given the weak level of women's swimming in Eire, Smith's marks
might last another millennium . . . By reaching the finals in three
events at the last-chance Olympic qualifier in Miami, the US gets
to send a full tae kwon do team to Sydney after all. Both Barb
Kunkel and Jason Torres won their events, and Steven Lopez was the
runner-up . . . Why did the IOC suspend Afghanistan's Olympic
Committee? Because the Taliban (Sunni Muslim) regime has taken it
over and bans women from competing. Afghan athletes will still be
able to go to Sydney, though. The Lords probably will make up a
country for them (like Independent Olympic Participant), as they
did for the Yugoslavs when their country was banned . . . Cold
consolation prize for synchronized swimmer Bill May, who can't go
to the Olympics because the international federation bans men. The
US federation named him athlete of the year instead.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 By KRIS MAYES AND CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Candidates aspiring to win Arizona's state presidential primary
would be wise to turn their attention to education, health care,
crime and Social Security, according to the Arizona Poll.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those issues topped poll respond ents' lists of their
high-priority con cerns, according to the Arizona
Republic-sponsored survey of 812 registered voters conducted
Oct.20-26 by Precision Research of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Education was by far voters' top issue, with 79 percent saying
it should be a high priority for Con gress and the president to
deal with in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of money . . . but the quality of our kids'
education doesn't seem to be significantly better from year to
year,'' said Barry Runyon, 52, a data processing con sultant who
lives near Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Health care also appeared promi nently on voters' radar screens,
with 68 percent suggesting it should be high on politicians' lists.

<P>
   ``I can't understand, as wealthy as this country is, why (the
price of) getting medicine and going to the hospital is so high,''
said Louise Getzwiller, 69, a retired bar owner with chronic
pulmonary disease who lives in Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Olivas, 46, a Tucson educa tor, said he also is focused
on health care issues. Although Olivas said he's satisfied with the
care he's gotten from his HMO, he believes the HMO system needs to
be tweaked to allow patients to choose physicians from outside the
HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the HMOs need a little more regulating,'' Olivas said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of crime and drugs con cerns Veronica Pickering, 24, a
Phoe nix insurance adjuster. Of the poll respondents, 66 percent
rated crime and drugs as a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering suggested that government could do more to head off
crime by sponsoring youth programs, after-school programs and
social pro grams in the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a problem of society in general,'' Pickering
said. ``I think they should be doing more about getting at the
heart of the problem rather than just going after criminals,
because by that time, it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Balzano, 41, a Prescott Real tor, pegged Social Security,
Medi care/Medicaid and campaign finance reform as her top issues.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security was rated a vital concern by 65 percent, Medi
care/Medicaid reform by 58 percent, and campaign finance reform by
37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Balzano said campaign finance re form is important to her
because she thinks money has too much to do with who gets elected
to office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy your way in,'' Bal zano said.
</P>
<P>
   Emile Moses, 71, a retired Honeywell employee who lives in
Tucson, said Social Security and Medicare are among the items that
are engaging his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should quit using the (Social Security) surplus in the
budget,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the surplus should be used to shore up Social Security
and Medicare because ``a lot of people are depending on that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who responded to the poll also want political
leaders to focus on the nation's ``moral crises.'' Of those
surveyed, 56 percent said the issue should be a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Tambra Bartho lomew, 35, a homemaker who lives
in St. Johns.
</P>
<P>
   Bartholomew feels tax money is often wasted on such things as
funding programs for the National Endowment for the Arts, and be
lieves morality is key to a good life for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel when we finally get our morals together . . .
everything else will fall into place,'' Bartholomew said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of taxes, often an atten tion-grabber in past
elections, was rated as a high priority by fewer than half the poll
respondents. But some of those who rated it high harbor deep
feelings about cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're taxed too much,'' said Margaret Shepper, 73, of
Scottsdale, a retired technical librarian. ``When it (taxation on
all levels) takes half of what a wage earner earns, that's too
much.'' &QL;

A FIGHTING CHANCE FOR A CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thursday was the beginning, not the end, for boxing. Of
that _ and not much else _ you can be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors made that clear when International Boxing
Federation president Bob Lee, his son, Bob Jr., and two associates
were indicted on 32 counts of accepting or soliciting bribes in
exchange for manipulating the IBF ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The three crime families that have run boxing into the ground _
the IBF, the World Boxing Council, and the World Boxing Association
_ have long considered themselves bulletproof. They broke careers,
manipulated fighters, and extorted money and favors from managers
and promoters _ some of them willingly _ in exchange for the pieces
of plastic they call world title belts.
</P>
<P>
   Their abusive demands and often absurd mandatory title fights
have embarrassed network television to the point where it has
effectively left the sport behind and forced cable giants HBO and
Showtime into airing events.
</P>
<P>
   So bold have these organizations grown that in the last few
weeks, even knowing the government was breathing down their necks,
the IBF demanded that Oscar De La Hoya pay a $450,000 sanction fee.
When he refused, the IBF sued him even though it had just been
revealed that it has been running a for-profit shadow organization
based in Oregon while claiming to be a nonprofit organization based
in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said he never wanted the IBF welterweight title that
Felix Trinidad held and was fighting only for the money and the
chance to make himself the undisputed welterweight champion. So he
refused and was preparing to countersue and demand a list of the
IBF's unknown stockholders when the government pinched Lee &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   A green plastic belt was of no importance to De La Hoya, but it
is to plenty of lesser fighters. To many, it is all they'll get out
of boxing, so they struggle to win one, believing that if they just
work hard enough, it's all on the level. But those belts are all
Lee's organization has to sell. That and its ratings, according to
the government, which has spent millions and kept a grand jury
impaneled for two years trying to get an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Seven promoters and managers and 23 fighters were allegedly
involved, although none was named and most will not be indicted.
One promoter has already privately appeared before the prosecutors
and refused to comment publicly on the events, but he had this
answer when asked if he had anything to fear for paying money to
the IBF:
</P>
<P>
   ``That depends on your definition of extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Well put.
</P>
<P>
   Have managers and promoters bought their fighters' way to title
shots? Do they have to breathe to stay alive?
</P>
<P>
   But as one promoter said, ``You think I send these guys $15,000
to help them with one of their dinners because I got nothing better
to do with the money? You know better than that. You do it to stay
in business.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is not extortion, it will be interesting to learn what
is. Lee, of course, denied what he called ``these outrageous
charges.'' He'll have more trouble explaining how people like Frans
Botha and Tony Tucker ever became No. 1-rated heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   As Arizona Sen. John McCain said from Washington Thursday night,
``It is a fact that the ratings system in professional boxing has
less credibility among athletes and their fans than any other
ratings system in professional sports.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is right about that. For years, the one sure thing in
boxing was that when a champion was forced to meet his No. 1
contender, he had a lot less to worry about than with most other
opponents, especially when those No. 1s were coming from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Who could ever forget the desperation of the hopelessly
overmatched Patrick Charpentier as De La Hoya took potshots at him
in El Paso? Given a firearm, Charpentier would have had great
problems. Limited to the use of his own arms, it wasn't a fight. It
was assault and battery.
</P>
<P>
   This was not HBO's fault, nor was it that of De La Hoya or his
promoter, Bob Arum. It was the fault of the WBC, which mandated the
match when Charpentier was no more the top-rated welterweight in
the world than I was.
</P>
<P>
   Such stories are endless and they can be found in all three
organizations. At one time or another, they all play the same
cynical game, usually for chump change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taken aback,'' Arum said from Las Vegas. ``We all knew
about the bribes. What we didn't know is the IBF was masquerading
as a nonprofit organization when they were a for-profit company
with stockholders. Where did all those sanctioning fees go? To
whom?
</P>
<P>
   ``For so many years, these organizations have acted almost as if
they were above the law. What they did with De La Hoya is the most
chutzpah I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ratings have been so absurd for years it was almost
funny. It was Mad Hatter time. It's the reason boxing is in the
state it's in. When the other sports have a controversy over a call
like they had in the American League Championship Series, the
public has no reason to believe the officials are on the take. In
boxing, the public knows a lot of crap is going on, so they suspect
everything. Nobody is simply able to make a mistake. There's no
presumption of innocence or honesty, like in the other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get the benefit of the doubt because people have been
fooled for so long they have no doubt left. They have cynicism now.
We have to do something about that, which is why this could be a
good thing if it leads to federal receivership for the IBF and the
installation of someone competent to run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also think this is just the first rock that's being
turned over. The worst allegations are yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   WBC president Jose Sulaiman said from Mexico City that the
indictment was ``indeed shocking'' and claimed he had heard of such
bribery attempts but he, of course, had never seen it in his
organization. He said this only days after declaring that his
longtime friend Julio Cesar Chavez would remain the WBC's No.
1-rated junior welterweight in the world _ and thus retain his
scheduled title shot against champion Kostya Tszyu _ despite having
been badly beaten by journeyman Willie Wise last month. Sulaiman's
explanation was that it was an over-the-weight fight and thus
shouldn't count.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to Wise, because HBO senior vice president for
programming Lou DiBella didn't want to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I'd love to use Kostya Tszyu, we will never put on
a title fight between him and Chavez after that,'' DiBella said.
``We'll put on Willie Wise first.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the situation has become and as dark a day as it will
be when Lee is squirming on the stand, many saw Thursday as a
bright day for boxing. If the government can get convictions and
stiff penalties against the IBF and perhaps others, it could lead
to a new day for boxing. A new dawn, perhaps with McCain in the
forefront.
</P>
<P>
   Long a fight fan and in recent years a crusader for boxing
reform legislation in Congress, McCain well knows the sport's ills
and the need for the same kind of organizational structure and
protections like those that exist in major league team sports.
After years of fighting it, some of today's top promoters now
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for this but it's still shocking when it
happens,'' said Dan Goossen, president of America Presents and
promoter of David Reid, Mike Tyson, Bernard Hopkins, and other
fighters. ``We need to mirror our industry with the other sports.
We need a commissioner with the power to suspend people and enforce
contracts and expel people if he has to.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said last week that he had contemplated suicide because
of his nasty divorce and business problems. ``At times I've wanted
to end my life, leave all this, but I never did it because of my
kids,'' Chavez told TV Azteca in Mexico. ``I'm not happy.'' Chavez
is considered one of the greatest Mexican fighters in history. He
has a 102-4-2 record and has won world titles in three weight
classes. Yet he reportedly is nearly broke and last month was
beaten badly by a journeyman. Last year, Chavez faced 30 lawsuits .
. . Emanuel Steward claims WBC heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis is
more interested in knocking out Evander Holyfield than Steward is.
``Lennox Lewis the fighter wants a knockout,'' Steward said. ``Not
Emanuel Steward the trainer. In the first fight, it was the other
way around.'' Steward believes Lewis should have stopped Holyfield
in the first fight and that Lewis can do it this time but worries
he may take risks to accomplish that, which could derail him when
the two square off Saturday at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las
Vegas . . . Johnny Tapia's retirement didn't last long. Tapia now
says he's coming back in January to fight Jorge Eliecer in El Paso
for the World Boxing Organization bantamweight title. Tapia is
46-1-2, his only loss coming last June to Paulie Ayala, which cost
him the WBA bantamweight title. Longtime friend and part-time rival
Danny Romero may appear on the same card. Although their
relationship soured in the months leading up to their showdown in
Albuquerque that cost Romero his title and much of his confidence
two years ago, they have recently rekindled their friendship . . .
Zab Judah looks as if he's finally going to get a shot at the IBF
junior welterweight title held by Terron Millett. A purse bid is
scheduled and Judah is the IBF's No. 1 contender and hence in the
mandatory position. He's one of the few No. 1s who actually
deserves to be there.

TAKING MEASURE OF PATRIOTS' EX FACTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Teams wrestle with offseason personnel decisions.
Sometimes they regret them. Sometimes they wish they could have
done a little more tweaking with their salary cap. Sometimes they
are haunted by players lost through free agency or poor management.
Sometimes the hard decisions allow them to flourish and be even
more productive with new and younger players.
</P>
<P>
   Last offseason, the Patriots lost center Dave Wohlabaugh and
punter Tom Tupa to free agency, elected not to re-sign linebacker
Todd Collins and defensive tackle Mark Wheeler, and released safety
Willie Clay and cornerback Chris Canty.
</P>
<P>
   Through eight games of the season, they could make a case that
they made the right decisions. Their record (6-2) is better than it
was at this time last year with the players they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlabaugh signed the richest deal in history for a center
(seven years, $26.5 million with the Cleveland Browns), and while
the Patriots miss his experience and steady play, they feel they've
more than adequately replaced him with Damien Woody. Collins was a
favorite of one and all, a gutsy player who had a great feel for
the game. But Tedy Bruschi has replaced him more than adequately
and proven he is an every-down player. The Patriots replaced Tupa
with Lee Johnson, and Canty with Tebucky Jones and Kato Serwanga.
The one position where they have struggled is Chris Carter for
Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a closer look at three ex-Patriots who moved on to
greener pastures:
</P>
<P>
   TODD COLLINS _ Kurt Warner isn't the only one performing
miracles in St. Louis. Collins receives alternative therapy from a
woman who practices Eastern massage and acupuncture in the St.
Louis area. He has two sessions per week, one after games and one
before games, and he no longer takes the pain medication that he
took religiously for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds crazy, I know,'' said Collins from his home in St.
Louis. ``But I feel 10 years younger. I wish I'd discovered this
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had pain in my Achilles' and ankles for three years that
I haven't been able to get rid of. I took a steady diet of
anti-inflammatories throughout my career in New England, and now I
take no medication and I feel incredible. It used to be I was stiff
and sore after games, and now I go see her and I feel great on
Mondays and then I go to her either on Friday or Saturday before
the game and I feel so good. I'm doing things I've never been able
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins misses his Patriots friends and stays in contact with
Ted Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of my best friends in life and he'll always be,''
said Collins, who has talked to Johnson about coming back too soon
from his biceps injury. ``I told him it's his career and he has to
come back when he feels he's 100 percent. As it is, he'll probably
be wearing one of those big braces and that's going to be awkward
for him. I think in the end he'll do what he thinks is right, and
not what everybody else wants him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins was stunned at first when the Patriots didn't try to
re-sign him, but he has come to an understanding about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've spent seven years of your career in one place, you
figure you're going to be there forever,'' he said. ``But the
reality of it is that it's a business and there's nothing you can
do about it. They had a very good player in Tedy Bruschi and I knew
Tedy could do the job. I could see the handwriting. Sometimes
things work out for the best for everybody and I think that's the
case with me and the Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins has played for Dick McPherson, Bill Parcells, Pete
Carroll, and Dick Vermeil and said all are completely different,
though Vermeil, he says, is most like Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick just turned 63 recently, but I think what he's done this
year is he's adjusted to the times he's in,'' said Collins. ``Some
of the guys here told me last year's practices were brutal. Now
they're more realistic. We work hard. We have high-energy practices
a lot, like we did in New England, but we don't pound on each other
all week. I think that's going to pay off for us in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick isn't as much hands-on as Pete was. He lets his coaches
coach, but one thing he does is he makes sure you're taken care of
off the field. He's very concerned about you as a person and he
does everything he can to help you out if you need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he sometimes can't believe his good fortune. He
never expected the Rams to be as good as they are, but the feeling
around the team is one of total confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kurt, it's almost like it used to be with Drew
(Bledsoe),'' he said. ``Whenever he takes a hit, everybody holds
their breath because he's meant so much to this team. He's made the
offense work.''
</P>
<P>
   WILLIE CLAY _ It is never enjoyable being 1-6. But the page has
turned for Clay, and he is beginning to cherish every day he spends
in the NFL. Six weeks after signing with the New Orleans Saints, he
is a starting safety again, beating out Rob Kelly for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the game a lot more now,'' said Clay. ``Standing
on the sidelines and watching is quite an education. You pick up
things that when you're out there playing every play are hard to
see. I think I've become a better player having experienced that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay, who was one of the leaders of the Patriots' defense the
past three years, said, ``My tackling has gotten a lot better.
That's something I'm really proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   That was something he was often criticized for. Some said he
missed too many tackles, which offset his big-play capability.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots weren't winning as they are, the deficiencies of
Clay's replacement, Carter, would stand out more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard much about that,'' said Clay. ``I speak to
Lawyer (Milloy) and Ty (Law) from time to time. The team is winning
and I'm happy for those guys. There are guys I miss there. It's a
good team, and when they're healthy like they are now, they can do
some damage. You come to appreciate guys more when you're away from
them. I look at what Drew can do and it's amazing how much better
he is than everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay said the New Orleans experience has been unlike anything
he's ever been through. For one thing, he has never had to win a
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be patient with it,'' said Clay. ``It was out of my
control. I just had to prove myself, and I think I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay wishes things could have worked out differently in New
England, but he reasons, ``This is for the best. When you look back
at all the things that were said about me, it can be frustrating.
That's why I don't look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a situation here where our offense is struggling, but
we have good players. This team is capable of a lot more than it's
shown.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS CANTY _ First-round bust? The Patriots eventually admitted
as much. When we last left Canty, the 29th player taken in the 1997
draft, he had come down with an infection in his leg and was
heading back home to Kansas. After he left, he had little contact
with the Patriots, who claimed that they couldn't reach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had all my numbers,'' said Canty. ``They knew where I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby Grier had had enough by then, and he cut his losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching ESPN one night,'' said Canty, ``and I saw my
name as being released by the Patriots. That's the first I'd heard
of it. Then a little while later, someone from the Patriots called
to tell me. Nobody ever told me the reason why I was cut. I still
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Canty thought he was often misunderstood in New England. His
gyrations on the field after making a play rubbed people the wrong
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff was completely overblown by the media up there,''
said Canty. ``Everybody said I was celebrating, but nobody ever
asked Chris about it. People just wrote whatever they wanted to
write.''
</P>
<P>
   Canty was signed by the Seattle Seahawks and currently plays in
their nickel package, alternating with veteran Merton Hanks. He has
one interception, and Seattle observers say he has played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed an opportunity,'' said Canty. ``You need people
behind you. I feel like a different person out here. I feel like
I'm learning a lot from some of the veterans here like Willie
Williams and Merton Hanks. I think this is something I needed.
There's more of winning-type atmosphere here. Mike Holmgren is a
great coach who has the respect of everyone here.''
</P>
<P>
   Canty, who still stays in touch with Carter and Vernon Crawford
(``my friends for life''), had more of his share of disruptions in
New England. He was cited by Attleboro police for having an open
container of alcohol in his car and driving without a license. He
reportedly tore up his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Those things are now thousands of miles away. And, right now,
that's the way he likes it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The way fans and media treated Ben Coates's one outburst in nine
years was the perfect example of why athletes often don't put
Boston atop their list of cities to play in. Do you think San
Francisco fans tried to run Jerry Rice out of town after he
criticized the team for his diminished role in the offense last
year? The answer is no. They cut him slack because he's the
greatest player ever at his position and was frustrated because he
wasn't touching the ball _ which is what made him great. The 49ers,
like the Patriots now, were winning at the time. Great players want
the ball. It's that simple. The reaction to Coates brought to mind
something a star baseball player (someone currently in the news)
said a few years back. When asked about possibly playing in Boston,
he said that while he was treated well by most of the people he
dealt with here, there were more ``mean-spirited'' people in Boston
than in other cities he visited, and he wouldn't subject his family
to that . . . On the flip side of Rice and Coates is Ryan Leaf.
Here's a guy who has never accomplished anything as a professional
football player acting childish, swearing at Chargers general
manager Bobby Beathard and threatening to fire his agent, Leigh
Steinberg. Who laughed louder when he made his trade demand,
Beathard or Steinberg? Leaf says he will never play for the
Chargers again. We hear the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena League
have an opening. It's the Leafs of the world _ not the Coateses _
who should incur the wrath of the fans . . . Parcells said at his
midweek press conference that a decision on his future would not be
swayed by this year's record. ``If I feel it's time to go, the
record wouldn't have any bearing on it,'' he said, ``but I wouldn't
like that.'' Parcells was referring to leaving the game on a losing
note . . . Curtis Martin's boyhood idol was the late Walter Payton,
whom he tried to mimic during street games in Pittsburgh as a boy.
``He's the only person I've ever considered an idol,'' said Martin.
``I loved the heart he played with. He wasn't a big guy, but you
could tell how determined he was.'' . . . Packers players have
rallied behind rookie punter Josh Bidwell, who was diagnosed with
testicular cancer. The team is making payroll deductions of
$10,000-$15,000 per player to put toward Bidwell's medical costs.
Packers executive Andrew Brandt, who gathered the team to explain
Bidwell's plight, said, ``The outpouring of support from the
players and the staff and the Green Bay community was remarkable.
I've never seen anything like it.'' Brandt explored Bidwell's
insurance options when he was first diagnosed. ``I came up empty
everywhere,'' said Brandt. Bidwell was a week away from making the
roster when he had surgery. He is now undergoing chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi, who could be a highly sought free agent in the
offseason, plans to represent himself in negotiations. Many players
try to do that until the process becomes a bit overwhelming. Such
was the case with Adam Vinatieri, who had an offer from Cleveland
before he decided to turn matters over to agent Neil Cornrich.
Bruschi, however, appears adamant that he will go through it on his
own . . . ``Boring Ball'' is the new buzz phrase that some fans and
media in Miami are using to describe the Dolphins' offense now that
they're trying to run the ball in the absence of Dan Marino. The
Dolphins have held the ball an average of 36 minutes the past two
games. Though the big question is when Damon Huard will become a
liability, with the way the Dolphins are currently set up, the
answer may be never . . . For all the criticism Tom Coughlin has
gotten in Jacksonville for not getting the Jaguars to the Super
Bowl yet, he may have the best-equipped team in the AFC. The
Jaguars lead the league in rushing for the first time. Couple that
with Mark Brunell and his speedy receivers, and the Jaguars have an
excellent offense. But it is the defense, under Dom Capers, that
has really been dominant . . . Looking back, it's interesting to
wonder whether the Patriots made the right choice by moving up to
draft Kevin Faulk instead of fullback/H-back Rob Konrad, who was
taken by the Dolphins. Konrad, recently voted the ``prototype''
fullback in a poll of NFL scouts, is becoming a dominant player . .
. Faulk's name has surfaced in connection with a scandal at LSU. A
man Faulk calls a longtime friend, Randall Menard, was arrested and
charged with bribery and violations of sports agent laws for
offering money to an assistant coach and an academic counselor.
Menard is suspected of trying to steer college players toward agent
Tank Blank, who represented Faulk in negotiations with the
Patriots. Faulk has acknowledged taking thousands of dollars in
gifts and cash from Menard while he was at LSU but said it was not
meant to influence his choice of agents. Faulk's parents also said
they received $5,000 from Menard . . . Lee Johnson is a close
friend of Steve Young, with whom he played at Brigham Young. When
the Patriots played in Arizona, Young came down from San Francisco
to visit the New England punter. Asked whether Young would heed the
advice of many and retire because of concussions, Johnson said,
``Steve is a very bright guy and I know he'll do what's best for
his well-being. I just know he will make the right choice as much
as he loves the game.'' . . . Former Northeastern and New England
quarterback Jim Murphy is being pursued by Albany of the Arena
League. It could be a way for Murphy to get to the NFL, as Warner
has done . . . Thurman Thomas, who hurt his liver in an exhibition
game, learned last week that he'll probably not be able to play
until the final four games of the season. Until this year, he had
never missed more than two games in a row. The nine-year veteran is
contemplating retiring after the season, but he doesn't want to go
out this way. ``If I had known this was going to happen,'' Thomas
told the Buffalo News, ``I would have retired after last year.''

MAY HAS SHOWN MIGHT ON EUROPEAN TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ His passport is as essential to his livelihood as his
set of Pings, and he is more than accustomed to language barriers,
time zone changes, a variety of currencies, and culture shock.
</P>
<P>
   Manicured courses and ideal weather conditions? Well, not quite.
</P>
<P>
   It's life on the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fun tour to be on,'' said Bob May. ``The only thing is, it's
not home.''
</P>
<P>
   Home being the United States (Las Vegas, to be exact), which is
where May will be heading _ first for rest, then for serious
competition _ after he completes this weekend's American Express
Championship in Spain. He qualified for a piece of this $5 million
purse by virtue of a breakthrough year, a Top 15 finish on the
Order of Merit, and at 31, there is evidence that May is fitting
into the pro golf world as some would have predicted at the start
of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   He was a collegiate force, helping Oklahoma State to the 1991
NCAA championship, and later that summer May's star really shined.
He teamed with the likes of Phil Mickelson and David Duval to help
the United States beat Great Britain and Ireland, 14-10, in the
Walker Cup, and he lost in the finals of the British Amateur after
beating Duval in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   An easy transition into the pro world seemed next, but little
did May know that it would be nearly eight years before he would
step into the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in early September of this year, at the British
Masters, and May broke through in style. He came from three strokes
back, shot 67, and overtook his final-round playing partner and the
tour's best player, Colin Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   May watched Montgomerie edge closer with birdie putts at 16 and
18 but settled matters with a testy two-putt par at the closing
hole. And no, it did not send the Scot into a lather.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very nice to me,'' said May.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Montgomerie wasn't treated very well by
American Ryder Cup fans at The Country Club, a reality that was
unsettling to May, who possesses a keen perspective of European
golfers and the game as it is accepted by fans overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf isn't like football or baseball where spectators can
holler whenever you like,'' said May. ``We don't need that in golf
and we need to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   May's faith in the game's spirit was restored the week after the
Ryder Cup, at the German Masters, when ``(Andrew) Coltart, Jose
Maria (Olazabal), and others who played in the Ryder Cup came up to
me and were nothing but great to me. They didn't hold me
responsible for the fans' behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   May, whose start in professional golf received financial backing
from actor Joe Pesci and Los Angeles radio personality Rick Dees,
has enjoyed nine Top 10 finishes in addition to his victory this
year. With more than $500,000 in earnings, he ranks 11th on the
Order of Merit, a serious improvement in this, his fourth year in
Europe. (He ranked 133d in 1996, then 109th, and 72d last year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my US card in 1994 and played in Asia in 1995,'' said
May, who credits his wife, Brenda, for pushing him toward Europe.
For which he is thankful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it. There is a camaraderie over here. We travel
together, we go to the airport and it's always the same airline, so
we all fly together. And there are a lot of very good golfers here.
I can't complain at all about the European Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lure of home is strong, so May will take advantage of
an exemption into the final stage of PGA Tour qualifying and head
to Doral in Miami Nov. 17-22. May has not attempted the American Q
School the last two years, but he feels ready.
</P>
<P>
   A cautious preparation, you could call it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence, but I'm not expecting to make it,
either, so I'm not getting my hopes up,'' he said. ``I'm going in
with the attitude that if I play good I'll get my card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to lose, everything to gain. I have a place to
play for two years (his European exemption for winning), but this
is a chance for my home tour.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently got reacquainted with American competition by
accepting a spot in the 90-hole Las Vegas Invitational. Through 54
holes May was tied for the lead at 22 under par with Jim Furyk and
Harrison Frazer, then an earthquake shook the desert, the winds
kicked up, and May got blown down the leaderboard with a 78. He
closed with a 72 and finished 13th. Still, the $50,000 check was
nearly double what he made in 1994 when, in his only American PGA
Tour season, May made just seven cuts in 24 starts and earned just
$31,079.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that his decision to try to regain US
playing privileges is based solely on finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has become so big in the game,'' said May, ``I think
some perspective has been lost in the game to some of the younger
players.''
</P>
<P>
   What also enters the equation is a desire to make things easier
for the family (May's 1999 schedule took him from Australia to
South Africa to Malaysia to Dubai to Qatar and to more than a
half-dozen European countries _ no wonder he got to spend only
about seven weeks with Brenda and son Trenton). Then there is the
competitive spirit that drives most pro athletes, the desire to
test one's skill against the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great year. I feel like I'm getting back to where
I once was,'' said May, who will get his chance to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods's memories of the dastardly 17th at Valderrama _ a
hole designed with the 15th at Augusta National in mind _ are not
pleasant. This is the par 5 that he reached in two during the 1997
Ryder Cup, only to stroke his downhill eagle attempt quite strong.
It rolled past the hole, down a severe slope, and into the water
that fronts the green. In Thursday's first round of the American
Express Championship, Woods hit a 320-yard drive and a 209-yard
7-iron (digest that slowly: 7-iron, 209 yards) to set up a two-putt
birdie. Woods was unable to hit such a mammoth drive in 1997
because of a cut of rough that European captain Seve Ballesteros
had designed through the middle of the fairway about 290 yards from
the tee. The rough was conveniently taken out as soon as the
Americans left two years ago . . . Speaking of Woods, with three
straight victories and seven on tour this season, it is hard to
believe that just three months ago we were being teased with that
showdown nonsense with Duval. For now, and for the foreseeable
future, let them have those head-to-head matchups to determine Nos.
2, 3, and 4, because Woods has no equal. Those who feel otherwise
probably confuse Shemp with Olivier . . . Seven wins? Even more
impressive when one considers the list of those players who went
winless in 1999: Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard, Davis Love, Phil
Mickelson, Mark O'Meara, and Steve Pate . . . If Dave Eichelberger
doesn't win this weekend's PGA Senior Tour Championship, it will be
as much a disappointment to a New York City limousine driver as to
the golfer. When his flight couldn't get off the ground because of
a storm Tuesday night, the reigning US Senior Open champion had to
rent a ride from LaGuardia Airport to Myrtle Beach, S.C. _ a $1,800
fare, since he had to pay for both ways. Not wanting to miss his
pro-am tee time Wednesday (which would have led to a DQ from the
main event), Eichelberger opted for a most expensive trip and got
to the golf course just in time. He tipped the driver $500, but
promised more if he won . . . The PGA Tour has called it a season,
which means your interest will have to shift to tournaments
throughout the world. After Valderrama this weekend, things move on
to the Johnnie Walker in Taiwan, where Woods makes it four events
in four weeks in three countries (it will be six in six in four
after he plays in the World Cup in Malaysia and the PGA Grand Slam
in Hawaii). Later this month, it's the Dunlop Phoenix Tournament in
Japan, which will feature Greg Norman. Surely you remember him. It
used to be that no big event was complete unless he was in it.
Times have changed, however, and other than his spirited run at
Augusta, it has been a most quiet campaign for the magnetic
Australian. Defending champ Lee Westwood, Sergio Garcia, Darren
Clarke, Retief Goosen, Thomas Bjorn, Olazabal, and Kyoung Ju Choi
are also entered. Kyoung Ju Choi? Why, the leading money winner on
the Asian Tour, of course . . . Bernhard Langer conceded that Mark
James's decision to bypass him for the Ryder Cup was tough to take.
James shocked no one by taking Jesper Parnevik with one of his two
captain's picks; he stunned nearly everyone with Coltart instead of
Langer, a nine-time Ryder Cup participant. ``That hurt a lot,''
Langer told reporters in Valderrama. ``It really hurt. I had been
looking forward to Brookline.'' Langer qualified for this week's
event in Spain thanks to his ability to stand up to pressure, which
would have made him a perfect Ryder Cup pick; at the Volvo Masters
last weekend, he needed to finish no worse than fourth to make the
field and he came through with a tie for second . . . Parnevik, by
the way, wasn't the only big name to bypass Valderrama, though
unlike Norman (golf cuts into his business ventures), Duval (he's
fishing), O'Meara (the game is way off, so why bother?), and Fred
Couples (he didn't like it in 1997, so why go back?), the
34-year-old Swede's absence is for health reasons. He apparently is
concerned about an irregular heartbeat . . . Jack Kasper of
Scituate finally won bragging rights at Green Harbor GC. A starter
at his home course in Marshfield, Kasper nailed his first
hole-in-one when his 5-wood from 173 yards found the bottom of the
cup at the 17th . . . Lorie Kane proved again why she is such a
class act. During the Nichieri International in Japan (US LPGA vs.
Japan's LPGA), Kane made a hole-in-one to earn a bonus of 1 million
yen (roughly $8,500). She shared the prize with playing partner
Janice Moodie and their caddies.

RULING LEAVES MICROSOFT VULNERABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Microsoft Corp.'s stunning legal defeat Friday, the
world's largest software company suddenly appears battered and
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   But, industry watchers say, the rapid rise of the Internet and
an array of new software products already began eroding the
company's power well before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued
his stern rebuke, labelling Microsoft a monopoly intent on harming
its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives have acknowledged the firm's dominant role
among software makers but have argued that it faces decay or even
destruction in an ever-changing technology world where new
companies seem to arise overnight. While some of Microsoft's
statements undoubtedly constitute public relations spin, the view
of the company as an embattled giant contains more than a little
truth, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the arguments that is sometimes made about Microsoft's
power is that their presence is so intimidating that no one else
could get a toehold,'' says Stephen Margolis, an economist and
coauthor of a book on Microsoft. ``Well, there sure are a hell of a
lot of toeholds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the two years during which the US Justice Department
has pursued its massive antitrust case, the focus of the computer
industry has shifted from the desktop systems where Microsoft
dominates. PCs will be a huge global business for years to come,
but it's a mature market with relatively little room for major
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a surging market in non-PC devices such as hand-held
computers has blossomed, based on software Microsoft doesn't
control. An upstart computer operating system called Linux,
assembled by amateurs in their spare time, is gaining ground once
safely held by Microsoft. And Internet businesses are generating
billions in sales, competing head-to-head against Microsoft's
on-line offerings _ and usually winning.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft became a giant through the success of its Windows
operating systems, the basic software that run computers. But on
the Internet, any operating system will do _ even one built by
basement computer hackers in their spare time. Jackson, in a
``finding of facts,'' found that Microsoft had attempted to expand
its market dominance onto the Internet. Indeed, Microsoft has
developed its own on-line network and a host of Internet retail
services. But aggressive independents like Yahoo, America Online
Inc., and eBay have easily outperformed Microsoft's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has tried to compete in the booming market for
hand-held computers, but devices based on Microsoft's Windows CE
hand-held operating system collect dust on store shelves, while
3Com Inc. sells millions of its Palm Pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would actually argue that Microsoft's relative importance to
the computer industry has already begun to decline, for reasons
that are no fault of Microsoft,'' said Rob Joseph, equity analyst
for State Street Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft trotted out these points at the trial, hoping to
persuade Jackson it has too much competition to be a monopoly. The
judge was unimpressed, saying that Windows still has a monopoly in
desktop computer operating systems and has abused that monopoly to
gain footholds in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hegemony on the desktop still matters,'' said Microsoft critic
Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry
Association. ``The most valuable piece of real estate on the planet
is not in Monaco; it's the Windows desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Microsoft's decision to put a link on the desktop to
its own on-line service, the Microsoft Network, sparked an intense
controversy in 1995. Critics of the company said this policy would
ensure that new computer users would sign up with the Microsoft
Network rather than with rivals such as AOL.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't happen. AOL is by far the biggest Internet
provider in the world, with 20 million users, compared with the
Microsoft Network's 2 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Such facts don't impress Ed Black, president of the Computer and
Communications Industry Association, which represents hardware and
software firms. He says the only reason why Microsoft hasn't
overwhelmed its Internet-based rivals is because it was afraid to
risk the further wrath of the Justice Department. ``They have, in
the course of the trial, pulled back a little bit from some of the
most abusive and destructive practices,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Wasch notes that with its cash hoard of $5 billion, Microsoft is
still buying its way into key positions in many high-tech markets,
such as cable television systems that provide Internet access. With
that kind of wealth and power, Wasch believes it is absurd to view
Microsoft as a company in crisis. ``They maintain control over the
computer manufacturers who need a Windows license to remain in
business,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But for how long? Consider the booming Linux market. This
alternative to Microsoft's Windows operating system was practically
unknown to computer users in October 1997 when the Justice
Department sued Microsoft for antitrust violations. Less than two
years later, 13 percent of respondents to a survey by International
Data Corp. said they were using Linux in their corporate networks.
Most of the world's biggest computer vendors now sell some machines
with Linux pre-installed instead of Windows; most of the world's
biggest software companies are making Linux versions of their key
products.
</P>
<P>
   Every sale of a Linux-based system means one less potential
customer for Windows 2000, Microsoft's product for corporate server
computers. Windows 2000, the biggest and most costly product
Microsoft has ever devised, still languishes in the lab. Due for
release last year, it won't be in stores until next year. And every
day's delay gives Linux more time to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   None of this impressed Jackson, who will follow his findings
with rulings on whether Microsoft used its monopoly power to
violate antitrust laws. He dismissed competition from Linux as
still too feeble to seriously threaten Microsoft's power.
</P>
<P>
   Margolis sees it differently. His objectivity is open to
question; Microsoft subsidized some of his research. But Margolis
also works in the back yard of Red Hat Software Inc., the leading
distributor of Linux. Red Hat went public three months ago, and now
has a market capitalization of $6 billion. Margolis thinks that
every one of those dollars is a bet that Microsoft can't dominate
the operating system business forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says that there are a number of people who do believe that
this is an important market development,'' Margolis said. ``It also
shows that capital markets will fund an enterprise that competes
against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Other challengers loom on every side. Microsoft was caught
unawares by the dramatic success of the pocket-sized Palm Pilot
personal organizer. The company responded by creating a
``lightweight'' version of Windows _ Windows CE _ and persuading
major electronics firms to use it to develop competing pocket-sized
products. But Windows CE has managed to gain only about a quarter
of the market, with Palm-based devices holding most of the rest.
One manufacturer, Philips Electronics, abandoned its Windows CE
machine, the Nino, last month because of slow sales.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also facing a bold challenge from Sun Microsystems
Inc., the same company that is suing Microsoft over control of the
Java computer software system. Java threatens Microsoft because
programs written in Java can run on any kind of computer, not just
a Windows PC. Now, Sun has purchased Star Division, a German
software maker, and has begun giving away the company's office
software suite over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sun hopes to use Star Office to break Microsoft's stranglehold
on office software like spreadsheets, the other business where
Microsoft holds a near-monopoly. Firms such as Cambridge's Lotus
Development Corp. have failed to challenge Microsoft in office
software. But by giving away the product, Sun is borrowing a
classic Microsoft tactic in an effort to cut off its air supply _
40 percent of Microsoft's revenues last year came from its office
software sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sun eventually plans to offer Star's office software suite for
use over the Internet. Instead of having a word processor on each
worker's computer, Sun would contract with companies to store the
software on a server. Workers would run the software remotely as
needed. Under this model, Sun would make its money by providing the
servers that run the software; the programs themselves would be
free.
</P>
<P>
   These challenges didn't exist when the Justice Department sued
Microsoft two years ago. Combined with Microsoft's stinging defeat
in round one of the case, they put the company in an unusually
perilous position. But even staunch Microsoft critics say it will
remain a major corporate power for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ferguson, who sold Cambridge-based software maker
Vermeer Technologies to Microsoft in 1996, thinks Microsoft should
be broken into two companies. But Ferguson thinks the two pieces
would still be key industry players. ``The successor companies to
Microsoft,'' Ferguson says, ``will continue to be important for the
next couple of decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston investment analyst Joe Hosler doesn't think it'll come to
that. But he agrees Microsoft will prosper despite its current
troubles. ``I've never seen a more motivated, more focused group of
people,'' Hosler says. ``To assume this is going to knock them down
_ I don't think it can.''

CAVS BEAT KNICKS, 102-93  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The reality of the situation was unfolding painfully
for the Knicks in the fourth quarter as Larry Johnson sat helpless
on the baseline while Kurt Thomas was probably still huffing like a
steam whistle in some corner of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was isolated from the Knicks' fall to earth, and yet very
much a part of the team's first loss of the year, 102-93, at the
Cavaliers' Gund Arena Saturday night. Thomas was the one who was
supposed to ease the loss of Johnson for the night after the
Knicks' leader came down with back spasms. But Thomas' first start
of the season was short-lived due to a temper that got him ejected
late in the first half, an outburst directed at an official that
eventually left the Knicks to wilt under attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Knicks seemed to thrive on their first brush with
adversity to take a brief lead in the third quarter, foul trouble
and the Cavs' flurry of offense wore them down in the end. A quick
double-digit lead built in the first three minutes of the fourth
quarter held up for the Cavs (3-1). The Knicks (3-1), who beat the
Cavs on opening night at Madison Square Garden, were led by Latrell
Sprewell (20 points), Allan Houston (22 points) and John Wallace,
who became the emergency forward for the night and responded with
18 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs were led by Shawn Kemp's 25 points and 18 points from
point guard Brevin Knight. But the statistic most pivotal to the
outcome was visible at the free-throw line: The Cavs ended the game
with 44 free-throw attempts to just 19 for the Knicks, who let
their aggression get the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were trying to dig out whatever resolve they had to
play their fourth game in five days, needing to lean on their
reserve of adrenaline and healthy bodies in an attempt to complete
a perfect first week of their season.
</P>
<P>
   But these were imperfect circumstances. Johnson, the team's
calming influence, vocal leader and major post presence in Patrick
Ewing's absence, was trying in vain to loosen up his chronically
bad back, which had tightened after spasms in the fourth quarter of
the Knicks' victory at Detroit on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to deal with,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said before the
game. ``We run our offense through him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the crush of the offensive burden was on Houston and
Sprewell. But scoring was not the issue in the first half. Staying
out of foul trouble and remaining calm were the main problems.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when Van Gundy nearly tugged his jacket over
his head as he watched Kemp set up house at the free-throw line in
the first quarter. Kemp, drawing fouls from a variety of Knicks,
hit an eye-popping 13 of 14 free throws to put the Cavs ahead by
37-26 after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thomas, who started in Johnson's place, Marcus Camby
and Chris Dudley were in instant foul trouble, the Knicks, down by
as many as 14 points early in the second quarter, started playing
smarter. They started giving themselves a chance against the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Houston, Sprewell and Wallace, Thomas was a big part
of the Knicks' 16-8 run that cut the Cavs lead to 3 points with  &QC; 1
minute 33 seconds left in the half. Then he hurt his own team by
losing his cool. After picking up his third foul with 1:19 on the
clock, he turned and complained to the referee, Ron Olesiak.
Apparently using some offensive language, Thomas was called for a
technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas began to approach Olesiak again when Van Gundy yelled
toward his team, ``Get him away from him,'' begging someone to
separate Thomas from Olesiak. They did not hear Van Gundy in time.
Thomas picked up another technical and was ejected from the game.
The Cavs took advantage of the depleted Knicks and ended the half
ahead by 55-50.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Knicks were in a dire predicament. They had taken care
of the Cavs in their season opener. But with no Ewing, no Johnson
and no Thomas, pulling off the trick a second time in the same week
was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Knicks' first brush with adversity in the infancy
of this season. Until now, every game had been an uninterrupted joy
ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the type of games we need to win,'' Van Gundy said.
``You can't just play your best when you feel your best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks could deal with the situation or collapse with a good
excuse. They chose to take the challenge and came out in the third
quarter with an inspired look in their eye, particularly Houston
when he hit a jumper to give the Knicks their first lead of the
night, 62-61, with 6:35 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   There were six lead changes from there. If Brevin Knight popped
out and hit a jumper, Wallace slid inside the paint for a layup.

   Without Johnson and Thomas, Wallace had the burden of being the
go-to man in the post, and he responded well in the third quarter.
But the Knicks, weighed down with foul trouble, physical wear and
follies with officials, could not quite keep up with the Cavs at
the end of the third quarter. The Cavs went on a 10-2 run and ended
the quarter ahead, 77-70.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Oct. 30 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

DON'T BLAME COWBOYS COACHES FOR PLAYERS NOT MAKING THE PLAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEION SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deion Sanders' column, as told to staff writer Clarence E. Hill
Jr., appears every week in the ``Fort Worth Star-Telegram''.
</P>
<P>
   What is an excuse? Well, Webster's dictionary defines this word
as ``to ask for forgiveness or pardon for oneself; to grant pardon
or forgiveness; to over look or accept; to apologize for; to
justify.''
</P>
<P>
   I like what Emmitt Smith said last week: ``Excuses are monuments
of nothing that build bridges to nowhere. And those that use these
tools of incompetence are masters of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   To me an excuse is blaming something or someone for what you
should have done or taken care of yourself. I've never been one for
excuses or one to blame someone or something or some situation.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that when a child repeatedly makes bad decisions
society faults the parents? Or when a young adult is struggling
through life he blames it on a sixth-grade teacher who said he
would never amount to anything?
</P>
<P>
   Blaming your failures on your parents is the easy way out and
placing blame on someone from your childhood is just plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
   My biological father was a drug user, and my stepfather abused
alcohol, but I never had a desire for drugs or a thirst for
alcohol. I made a decision I was going to be better and smarter
than the examples I had in my life and my hood.
</P>
<P>
   A principal at a high school I attended also said I wasn't going
to amount to anything. But instead of living to prove him wrong, I
concentrated on proving me right. I always believed what my mind
could conceive I could achieve no matter what anybody said.
</P>
<P>
   And this brings me to the matter at hand _ me, the Cowboys, our
play as of late. Why would we blame the coaches, as many of you]
are, for our playing poorly?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't blame Coach Switzer, and I don't blame Chan. Besides,
the only coach I know of that tried to make a play during a game
was Woody Hayes, and he got fired for truly trying to make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Players win games. That's why we make more as players than the
coaches _ well, at least coaches, not named Jimmy Johnson and Bill
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   It really disturbs me when I see a player blaming our failures
on the coaches. \RDefensive coordinator Dave\S Campo didn't get
beat for a touchdown last week. I did. And \Rspecial teams coach\S
Joe Avezzano didn't return a punt 76 yards. I did.
</P>
<P>
   Our staff plays a very important role in preparing us and
coaching us, but when the whistle blows it's no excuses.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches coach, and the players play. No matter what you
think of Switzer he was right on the money about that.
</P>
<P>
   We the players haven't made the plays. That's why we have lost
three out of our last four games. Yes, we miss Michael Irvin badly.
I said way back last summer before the injury when they were
talking about getting rid of Mike that our offense would be
devastated without him. We haven't been the same.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is that we may not get him back. We don't
know what's going to happen. So we've got to play on. We miss him.
We need him. But that's not the reason we are playing poorly. The
coaches are putting us in good position. We just have to make the
plays. All of us.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to tell you about someone. He's a 5-foot-3, 115-pound
freshman at Quapaw High School in Oklahoma. His name is Lee Nowlin.
A birth defect left Nowlin with one leg and no hands. But he plays
three sports _ football, basketball and baseball _ with the aid of
prostheses. He plays safety and receiver in football.
</P>
<P>
   But just imagine what he has to overcome just to get through
every day, let alone try to play sports against healthy athletes.
But he refuses to use his handicap as an excuse. He won't let you
give him an excuse either. He just gives it all he has and enjoys
himself.
</P>
<P>
   I learned about him through a newspaper article, in which he
stated that I was his favorite athlete. Well, I'm here to tell you
that I'm not too old to have heroes. His story is certainly an
inspiration to me.
</P>
<P>
   A toe, a concussion and now a hamstring don't even compare to
what that kid overcomes. He makes no excuses. I'm not making any
excuses, and our team is not going to make any excuses. We have a
tough road ahead starting with Randy Moss and the Vikings tomorrow
night. But we are just going to play, just like Nowlin. No excuses.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Jesus loves you!
Ask Deion ``Deion Sanders will answer one question every week.
E-mail your questions to cehill &LR; star-telegram.com.'' You played a
role in defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman's signing with the
Cowboys. What do you think about his play so far? DS: Alonzo
Spellman has been as much a blessing for us as we have for him. He
has his life together. He has the Lord. If this were baseball, he
would be the comeback player of the year.

COWBOYS GUARD LARRY ALLEN RULES DEFENSIVE LINES ACROSS THE NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ They call him ``Big L.A.,'' which for Larry
Allen serves as a nickname and a grim reminder of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' All-Pro left guard grew up in South Central Los
Angeles and survived the mean streets of a Compton neighborhood
during the late '70s and early '80s to become arguably the best
offensive lineman in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rough,'' said Allen, a man of few words.
</P>
<P>
   How rough? Allen had friends who were murdered. His father and a
grandfather were gunshot survivors. As a youth, Allen was involved
in fights almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before moving to Northern California with his mother,
Allen, then 10, was stabbed a dozen times about the head and neck
by a knife-wielding 12-year-old neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to protect my little brother,'' Allen recalled.
``I picked up a broom. The other kid picked up a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in his sixth year with the Cowboys, Allen is approaching the
halfway point of his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl season as he
prepares to go against the Minnesota Vikings tomorrow night. Allen
has never missed a game.
</P>
<P>
   Of today's NFL elite offensive linemen _ Jacksonville's Tony
Boselli, Minnesota's Randall McDaniel, Pittsburgh's Dermontti
Dawson and Allen _ only Allen has made the Pro Bowl at more than
one position: guard (1995-97), offensive tackle (1998) and again at
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Allen is playing well, evidenced two weeks ago when Washington's
Dana Stubblefield was manhandled in the second half by Allen, then
last week when Indianapolis' Ellis Johnson was at times thrown to
the turf by Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is the best in the league ... maybe the best in the last
20 years,'' said Cowboys offensive line coach Hudson Houck, who has
coached Bruce Matthews, Marvin Powell and Jackie Slater. This is
Houck's 17th NFL season, and before that he spent 10 years at the
University of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' Houck said, ``Larry Allen is playing at a
level that, if he keeps it going, would land him in the Hall of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   That would put Allen, in his sixth year, in the company of
former Cowboys Bob Lilly, Roger Staubach, Tony Dorsett, Randy White
and Mel Renfro, and likely with Emmitt Smith, Troy Aikman, Michael
Irvin and Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll start to get a big head if I think about all that,'' said
Allen, who tries to avoid the limelight. ``If I do good, I do good.
That's all I want to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has run behind Allen for 7,475 of a career 13,174
rushing yards and 83 of a career 133 rushing touchdowns since 1994,
is impressed as much with his teammate's approach as his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the way Larry is thinking right now, I like that,'' Smith
said. ``You need to keep yourself humble.''
</P>
<P>
   But even against his will, the 1994 second-round pick from
Sonoma State has created a thick dossier of superlatives. Consider
Houck's laundry list of Allen's attributes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Outstanding athlete, tremendous strength, great explosion,
good reaction, good balance, outstanding quickness and speed, good
study habits, student of the game, and he's a tenacious worker. He
bench-presses 600 pounds ... but he does it without living in the
weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that Larry would just take care of himself but
he's at the point now that he speaks up in the classroom, brings up
questions that may imply to players other than himself. This is a
very smart man, very aware, very focused. And he's inquisitive. He
wants to know about how the other team sets up its defense, what's
the best way to block it, and then goes out and practices it, every
play, full-speed, 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys right tackle Erik Williams, a three-time Pro Bowler,
said that Allen would be the best in the game at any of the four
non-center positions on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is just the best, period,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to games, Allen can be found sitting in front of his
locker, wearing headphones and letting the sounds that only he can
hear keep him more reclusive than normal.
</P>
<P>
   The headphones also keep him from expending energy by thinking
about what NFL offensive linemen have to think about before a game:
the precise execution, the split-second decisions, the violent
collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, as it turns out, is as musically diverse as he is
professionally dominating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to Al Green ...,'' said Allen, pausing as his
interviewer scribbled down a rare quote on a notepad. ``I listen to
rap ... just depends on what mood I'm in at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Next subject.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Allen, his answers are over almost before they begin,
sort of like one of his pancake blocks on an opponent who is taken
under L.A. Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry's quiet, but he does like to sing in the locker room
before games,'' Cowboys center Mark Stepnoski said. ``He seems to
be singing whatever he's got going inside his headphones.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he loud?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he good?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   On the team plane, Allen sits next to Emmitt Smith near the
front. They usually play cards. Gin rummy is their game, although
it's not necessarily Allen's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmitt beats me,'' admitted Allen, adding an easy laugh.
``Emmitt cheats.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing what Allen was saying about him eight lockers away,
Smith howled: ``Puh-lease. Larry will be getting trashed when we
play. Saying that he beats me unless I cheat is really his way of
saying he knows he doesn't win at all.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cowboys' bye week in September, Allen went to Las
Vegas. He enjoys the casinos. With a job that demands such a high
sense of order, execution and exactness, there's a side to Allen
that enjoys a good game of chance once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, Stepnoski has found that ``Larry really makes it
easy for me. He controls his guy to the point where I really don't
have to even think about helping him. In passing situations, the
other team will be running a `game' \Rtwo defenders
criss-crossing\S to try to pick me, but it doesn't happen because
Larry won't let that first guy get in. He'll punch him. He'll keep
him off the line of scrimmage, and that gives me time to read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys linebacker Darren Hambrick recalled how one of his
earliest lessons in the NFL came during his 1998 rookie training
camp when he talked trash to Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knocked me down about six times,'' said Hambrick, who was a
fifth-round pick from South Carolina. ``I did talk trash. I kept
saying, `Man, I'm going to beat you today,' and he would just shake
his head. He never did say anything. To me, Big L.A. is the kind of
guy who just files it away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a guy like Larry, I don't hear a lot ... I see it,''
Cowboys receiver Ernie Mills said. ``You can see it in his eyes,
that look of dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the notorious Sonny Liston look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total dominance. I see it a lot in Larry,'' said Mills, who
wondered aloud how it must feel to have to line up opposite this
guy for an entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Mills cackled under his breath. ``With Larry, you'd better be
ready.'' \Ntagtop:Ray Buck, (817) 390-7096

BASS-TOURNAMENT ORGANIZERS TRY TO MOVE SPORT INTO MAINSTREAM

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTER HAVEN, Fla. _ Forrest Wood walked quietly among
yesterday's throng of spectators who sat on bleachers and on grassy
slopes to watch anglers weigh in their fish in the world's richest
bass tournament, then nodded toward a television camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ought to let a lot of people see just how big bass
fishing has become,'' said Wood, founder of the Ranger Boat Co. and
a bass tournament pioneer. ``This certainly will bring the
attention bass fishing deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   A sport that began as small gatherings of club members in the
1930s approaches Super Bowl proportions today, when 20 anglers
compete for more than $1 million on live television.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are banking on the Ranger Millennium MI Tournament
(3:30 p.m., KDFW//Ch. 4) to lure more exposure, more sponsors, more
spectators and more money to their growing sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though competitive bass fishing has been around since the
1960s, the time was right to take the sport to the next level with
respect to the marketing of it and building a national awareness of
it,'' said Irwin Jacobs, who came up with the idea for the
Millennium and the owner of Operation Bass, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept looking at the numbers. There are 55 million people who
fish every year in this country. These people are also consumers of
every type of product imaginable. The fishing market was
promotionally untapped by marketers and, therefore, it presented an
enormous opportunity, not just for bass tournaments, but for all
kinds of other products, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium paid off for sponsors. Among the equipment
competitors are required to use include:
</P>
<P>
   A Ranger Comanche series model boat, purchased after July 1,
1996.
</P>
<P>
   A new Ficht-powered outboard motor, purchased from an Evinrude
dealer after July 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Participants also must have purchased a total of $1,000 in Citgo
Cash cards, $500 of Watkins products and $500 of Garmin products.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium also attracted sponsorship from Wal-Mart, Black &AMP;
Decker, Chex Mix, Hamburger Helper, Wheaties, Uniroyal and
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there's enough corporate and spectator interest to
sustain tournament fishing remains to be seen. For example, today's
tournament has been called the Super Bowl of bass fishing, but
there are no plans for another Millennium tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that question has an answer yet,'' said Bobby
Standifer, of Fort Worth, a Ranger Boat official. ``But they are
saying there will be another one. Maybe not next year or maybe so.
But they are saying they have plans for more like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob said he realizes the size of the prize money is what
attracted Fox's coverage of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we created the Wal-Mart-FLW \RForrest L. Wood\S Tour, it
was our goal to elevate the sport of fishing to the levels of
prestige and national recognition attained by other professional
sports,'' Jacobs said. ``I have always believed that America's
anglers deserve the opportunity to compete for significant cash
awards equal or greater than those found in other sports. Providing
the opportunity for anglers to compete for $1 million is the
realization of one of my dreams.''

EDITORIAL: CONFLICTING VOICES FROM IRAN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Iran's conservative clerics tried to use Thursday's 20th
anniversary of the seizure of American hostages in Tehran to whip
up renewed hostility toward America, to discredit Iran's political
reformers and to mock the vision of a more tolerant Islam advocated
by President Mohammad Khatami. They did not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Iran resists easy categories. It cannot be reduced to
the fundamentalist fervor of 1979 or to Khatami's reassuring
reformism. It has elements of both, in uneasy coexistence, with
neither side now strong enough to prevail. Parliamentary elections
next year will help decide the outcome of the contest between
Khatami and his conservative opponents, and will thus be an
important factor in deciding whether the United States and Iran can
begin rebuilding their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The 444-day hostage drama was the emblematic event through which
Iran's Islamic revolution defined itself to the world. By storming
the embassy compound and imprisoning the American diplomats they
found there, militant students declared symbolic war on the United
States, which they blamed for its steadfast support of the shah's
dictatorship. The hostage taking also marginalized more moderate
and secular elements in the revolutionary coalition, handing total
power to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his fundamentalist allies.
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade, official pronouncements bristled with
hostility to the Great Satan, America. But Iran, with its 65
million people and 2,500 years of recorded history, is too complex
and diverse a country to be summed up by cartoonish slogans. After
Ayatollah Khomeini died in 1989, the fanaticism of Iran's political
leadership began to moderate. But Iran will remain a pariah in
American eyes until it renounces terrorism, abandons nuclear
weapons development and accepts peace negotiations between Israel
and Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There has been encouraging progress on these issues since
Khatami, a reform-minded cleric, became president two years ago.
But while he is Iran's highest elected official and immensely
popular, Khatami is subordinate to the country's religious leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a conservative who seems reluctant to move
beyond the simplistic refrains of 1979. Khamenei recently led
students in chants of ``Death to America'' and ``Death to Israel,''
and condemned clerics, politicians and journalists who seek
reconciliation with Washington. But an officially sponsored march
Thursday commemorating the hostage-taking drew at most 7,000
participants. Many, as The New York Times' John Burns reported,
seemed to bear no personal antipathy to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Washington can take no decisive steps to rebuild relations with
Iran until Iranian leaders give a clear message that they want
American friendship. Right now, the message from Tehran is
characterized by confusion and conflict.

CAT THIEF, LUCAS STEAL SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-CLASSIC-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Cat Thief _ Cat Thief! _ crossed the finish
line in front, Pat Day as always getting the last bit of horse from
his mount in the yards that count, and Bob Baffert stood in his
owner's box and could not move.
</P>
<P>
   Can a race called the Classic symbolize and epitomize all the
Mt. Everest highs and submarine lows that is horse racing? For, as
Baffert could only stare, his nemesis, D. Wayne Lukas, was racing
across the tarmac down by the track, jumping and hopping and
skipping and waving _ and racing to the winner's circle at
Gulfstream Park Saturday as few 64-year-old men have ever done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most fun I've ever had,'' said Lukas. ``I've been
accused by NBC and ABC and everybody of not showing any emotion,
but I'll be the first to tell you that my wife's got bruises on her
arm.'' She got them from her husband during the madcap stretch run
of Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   And Baffert could only stare at all of this, his body immobile
for minutes before he managed to say, ``I got dusted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Classic was just that.
</P>
<P>
   The finish of the Classic was a classic finish.
</P>
<P>
   Four horses giving their all, as each and every step brought
them closer to the finish line. The horse with the strongest legs,
yes, but also with the most heart, would win out.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the names of these four horses that shocked the
Classic as the Classic had never been shocked.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief, paying $41.20 to win; Budroyale second at 26 to 1;
Golden Missile third at 75 to 1, and Chester House fourth at 63 to
1.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, the 2-1 favorite, was nowhere, and neither were
Baffert's General Challenge and River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that the tote board guarding that quiet pond in
Gulfstream's infield seemingly exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The trifecta paid more than $39,000. The superfecta paid
$692,307. Surely there were numbers that never before had been
posted at any race track anywhere. As were Gulfstream's numbers,
bettors setting a record for the Breeders' Cup by wagering
$93,781,593.
</P>
<P>
   And Baffert, shut out for the day, could only stare and say, ``I
got dusted. It seems every other year (in the Breeders' Cup), I get
dusted.'' Indeed, he had been shut out when some thought he might
win four races and he thought at least his Chilukki and
Silverbulletday would win in the female races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much is made of me,'' said Baffert, standing in the
emptying owner's box at the Gulfstream finish line and
free-associating in his misery. ``Maybe I've got to spend more
money (for horses). I think it's harder for a guy who comes here
with only one horse and he's not sure if he'll ever be back here.
Don't worry, I know I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, for his part, has had a most remarkable year, being
elected to Racing's Hall of Fame, winning the first two legs of The
Triple Crown with Charismatic, a reformed claimer, and now this,
beating Baffert's Chilukki with Cash Run ($67 to win) in the
Juvenile Fillies and then winning the Classic, bringing to 15 his
Breeders' Cup winners. Lukas had told all who would listen that Cat
Thief had never been better, that Cat Thief had an excellent chance
to win. But few, if any, had listened.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem, said Lukas, refueling his long feud with
the media. Newspaper writers make the favorites in racing by whom
they choose to feature, he said, ``and the American people are just
like sheep. They just follow you like sheep, follow what you write.
Except Sunday morning, you're not accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, even before the Classic, this was a wonderful Breeders' Cup,
full of long shots (Anees, $62.60 in the Juvenile, and Cash Run)
and all the emotions of the Breeders' Cup encapsulated so fully in
one man, jockey Frankie Dettori.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 100 yards, I was feeling joy, tears, happiness, and
sadness,'' said Dettori, who vindicated himself with a flawless
ride aboard Daylami ($5.20) in the Turf after a flaw-filled ride
aboard Swain in last year's Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is intense in the Breeders' Cup, and Dettori was a true
example. In the first yards of the 1 1/2-mile Turf, the jockey was
``praying to God that God would give me a good path. I knew all the
press were on me. They were waiting for me to (expletive) up.'' And
after the path had opened up and Dettori coasted home aboard the
world's best grass horse, the Italian shouted and shouted, ``Mamma
mia, mamma mia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Classic was no less dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours earlier, in The Distaff, the extreme importance of
the Classic became even more pronounced. That's because
Silverbulletday, Baffert's talented filly, saw her gas tank finally
run dry after (a) a grueling year and (b) a too-fast workout of 57
2/5ths seconds Monday. Only Silverbulletday was any competition for
Horse of the Year to the top horses in The Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she was ready,'' said Baffert. ``But she just didn't
get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knew at the time the fillies and mares were placed in the
starting gate for the Distaff that the track surface was typical
for Gulfstream in the winter. On this surface, early speed,
especially speed on the inside, is so dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   And when Silverbulletday (the 8-5 favorite) broke in the middle
of the pack, her nemesis, Beautiful Pleasure, was able to bound
along on an easy lead and all was lost for Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great position all the way, but three quarters of the
way through the race, it was pretty evident she wasn't going
anywhere,'' said jockey Jerry Bailey. ``She was flat at the crucial
point I had to make the move.''

   With Silverbulletday gone from consideration, the Classic was
supposed to decide Horse of the Year. But this Classic decided
nothing, as even Mr. Ed might get a few votes. All that was learned
was that horse racing can bring one so high and horse racing can
bring one so low.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas's dancing to the winner's circle and Baffert's staring
into nothingness for at least five minutes were proof enough of
what horses can do to humans.

DAYLAMI GIVES EUROPEANS FIRST CUP TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ It is now safe for the Europeans to race in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Daylami, a true talent who dominated the $2 million Turf at
Gulfstream Park Saturday, became the first horse based in Europe to
win a Breeders' Cup race here in three tries. The Europeans pitched
a shutout in 1989 and 1992, and had been winless again until
Daylami came storming down the stretch, drawing away to a victory
of 2 1/2 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by the Godolphin Stable of Sheik Mohammed of Dubai, and
trained by Saeed Bin Suroor, Daylami was sent away as the 8-5
choice ($5.20) and completed the 1 1/2 miles over a grass course
labeled ``good'' in 2:24 3/5. Buck's Boy, the defending champion
under Garett Gomez, led past the eighth-pole but faded to third, as
Daylami and Royal Anthem, who was second with Gary Stevens, roared
by.
</P>
<P>
   Daylami was ridden by Frankie Dettori, who has been bitter since
being criticized for losing last year's Classic at Churchill Downs
when his mount, Swain, bolted nearing the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about me?'' shouted Dettori. ``I'm glad I put Swain behind
me. Daylami saved my year. What about Swain? What about Swain?
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenge is a cold plate, and my plate is freezing. It took me
six months to get over Swain. Everybody tried to bury me, but I'm
back. Daylami was a machine today. They can kiss my backside.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of the $1 million Juvenile did little to cast light
on next year's Kentucky Derby picture, as little-known Anees came
from last to first to capture the race. Anees, a son of 1990
Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled, had won just one race prior to
Saturday, a maiden affair at Del Mar. He was easily bested by Dixie
Union and Forest Camp, who finished far behind him in the Juvenile,
in the Norfolk Stakes last month at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by The Thoroughbred Corp. of Prince Ahmed Salman of Saudi
Arabia, trained by Alex Hassinger, and ridden by Stevens, Anees was
off at 30-1 ($62.60 to win) and came flying from 14th place to
tally by 2 1/2 lengths in 1:42 1/5. He was successful against the
grain of the track, which favored speed. Chief Seattle, ridden by
Edgar Prado, ran very well to be second, battling it out from the
rail all the way, but he was no match for the winner. High Yield
and Jerry Bailey were third.
</P>
<P>
   ``This colt moved along with every race,'' said Stevens. ``He's
got a great kick to him. I'm already thinking about next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Artax clinched the Eclipse Award as the best sprinter in the
country with a dazzling triumph in the $1 million Sprint, tying the
6-furlong track record of 1:07 4/5 set by the legendary Mr.
Prospector in 1973. Ridden by Jorge Chavez, Artax followed the
rapid pace of :22 for a quarter, took over around the far turn, and
roared to the wire a half-length in front of Kona Gold, with Alex
Solis, who charged up the rail. Big Jag and Jose Valdivia were
third.
</P>
<P>
   Trained by Louis Albertrani, Artax was off at 7-2 ($9.40) and
authored his record-tying run in glue-on shoes, which are becoming
increasingly popular among horsemen whose charges have foot
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Kona Gold coming,'' said Chavez, who was born in Peru.
``I was just trying to get to the wire first. I'm living the
American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Cash Run, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, took advantage of the fast
surface to battle on the pace all the way, upsetting the $1 million
Juvenile Filly field at 32-1 ($67 to win). Nicely handled by
Bailey, Cash Run stayed right on the rail, shook off a bid by 3-2
favorite Chilukki, who stuck her head in front with 6 furlongs to
go, and hit the wire 1 1/4 lengths in front.
</P>
<P>
   Chilukki finished second with David Flores, and Surfside, who
was far back early, got up in time to be third under Pat Day. The
time for the mile and one-16th was 1:43 1/5. The victory was the
fourth for Lukas in this event (Twilight Ridge, 1985; Open Mind,
'88; Flanders '94) and his 14th overall in the Cup, which began in
1984. He later added No. 15 when Cat Thief won the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas equips all his horses with nasal strips, which are new to
racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what nasal strips will do, and I'm sure they'll
get a lot of credit,'' said Lukas. ``But when you send a well-bred
filly (Cash Run, a daughter of Seeking the Gold, was a $1.2 million
yearling) out to win a $1 million race, and nasal strips are the
reason, we'd better get out of the buisness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of concerned about Chilukki,'' said Bailey. ``But
when she didn't get by her at the quarter-pole, I knew I had a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Silic, a French-bred who has been in the United States for a
year, proved best in the cavalry charge that was the $1 million
Mile, tallying by a neck with Corey Nakatani. Tuzla earned the
place by a head, over Docksider, a European, and Stevens. The time
for the Mile, over the turf, was 1:34 1/5.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special horse,'' said trainer Julio Canani. ``He has
a big kick. I knew he could run.''
</P>
<P>
   Soaring Softly, the 7-2 choice ($9.20 to win), sustained a long
rally to take the inaugural running of the Breeders' Cup Filly and
Mare Turf by three-quarters of a length under Bailey, who rode his
second winner on the card. Coretta finished second with Jose
Santos, and Zomaradah, a European, was third with Dettori. Trained
by James Toner, Soaring Softly covered the 1 3/8 miles in 2:13 4/5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to take whatever spot opened up,'' said Bailey. ``I just
tried to keep her in the clear.''

NEBRASKA DOMINATES, BLANKS TEXAS A&AMP;M

 A&AMP;M-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH

<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ A Texas A&AMP;M football team that began the season
with plans to contend for a national championship will spend the
next three weeks playing out the string as also-rans in the Big 12
South Division.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st-ranked Aggies dissolved under a Big Red tidal wave
yesterday in Memorial Stadium, failing to score a point for the
first time in 11 years and falling to No. 9 Nebraska, 37-0.
</P>
<P>
   The loss eliminated A&AMP;M (6-3, 3-3) from any chance of repeating
as Big 12 champions and opened the door for No. 11 Texas (8-2, 5-1)
to succeed the Aggies as South Division participants in the Dec. 4
title game if the Longhorns defeat Texas Tech (5-4, 4-2) on
Saturday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska (8-1, 5-1) remains in control of its destiny in the
North Division race heading into Saturday's showdown with No. 6
Kansas State (9-0, 6-0) in Lincoln, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers dominated every statistical category, along with
both lines of scrimmage, in handing A&AMP;M its first shutout in 11
seasons under coach R.C. Slocum. Until yesterday, the Aggies had
not been blanked since losing at LSU, 27-0, in 1988 _ a string of
142 games dating to the Jackie Sherrill era.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies couldn't run and quarterback Randy McCown
couldn't hide against a Nebraska pass rush that collected eight
sacks, the most by an A&AMP;M opponent this season. A&AMP;M produced a
paltry 118 yards total offense (1.7 per snap) and crossed the
Nebraska 36-yard line just once under its own power.
</P>
<P>
   That drive ended in one of two blocked field-goal attempts
suffered by A&AMP;M kicker Terrence Kitchens, giving him seven this
season. For the game, the Aggies finished with more turnovers (5)
than rushing yards (2). McCown threw a season-high four
interceptions and connected on a season-low 36.6 percent of his
passes (11-of-30).
</P>
<P>
   ``We played horrible offense,'' Slocum said. ``We were very
inept. We couldn't run the ball. And when we tried to throw, we
couldn't protect long enough to get the ball off. I've got a lot of
respect for their defense ... but we should have performed better
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Aggies thrust the burden of proof on to the
shoulders of its ``Wrecking Crew'' defense, which held the
Cornhuskers out of the end zone the first five times Nebraska
crossed the A&AMP;M 20-yard line. Eventually, the A&AMP;M defense cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska scored touchdowns on four of its last six possessions
and lost a fumble in the A&AMP;M end zone on another. The Cornhuskers
racked up 288 of their 430 yards in the second half, when they
turned a squeaker at the half (6-0) into a laugher down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just wore down as the game progressed,'' said Nebraska
quarterback Eric Crouch, who rushed for a game-high 137 yards and a
touchdown. ``We came at them harder and harder until we finally
finished them off.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's five turnovers led to 20 Nebraska points, but the
Cornhuskers also tacked on scoring drives of 45, 36 and 36 yards
that had nothing to do with Aggies' miscues. Instead, they could be
traced to field position gained from a Nebraska defense that kept
A&AMP;M in long-yardage situations all day.
</P>
<P>
   Until the final minute of the third quarter, A&AMP;M had snapped the
ball 16 times on first down and gained nine yards (0.5 per play).
That figure did not improve until the Aggies began an all-out
aerial assault while trying to rebound from a 23-0 deficit in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Even that proved to be of little avail. A&AMP;M never took a snap
inside the Nebraska 36 in the second half. In fact, A&AMP;M's first
snap of the game _ after recovering a fumble at the Nebraska
11-yard line _ proved to be the closest the Aggies would get to the
Cornhuskers' goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should apologize to the university and to our fans for
being shut out,'' said fullback Ja'Mar Toombs, who gained a
team-high 46 yards on 10 carries. ``That really hurts. I never
thought that could happen to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did. Now, the Aggies are reduced to playing for pride and
bowl position instead of championships. Linebacker Brian Gamble
said he knew how he would handle the disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go home and cry,'' Gamble said. ``We came to this
university to win big ballgames and championships. This season, it
just hasn't worked out. It's been very, very disappointing.''

   &UR; LOVE UNDETECTABLE: Notes on Friendship, Sex, and Survival &LR;  By
Andrew Sullivan. Vintage, $13. The former editor of The New
Republic reflects on the cultural implications of the
transformation of AIDS from a death sentence into a manageable
illness, and his own struggle with religious faith. ``He wants to
see same-sex love fully accepted as a dignified form of human
relations,'' Andrew Delbanco wrote in The New York Times Book
Review in 1998. ``This book can only help the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MASTER GEORGIE &LR;  By Beryl Bainbridge. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $11.95.
This historical novel, set in the 19th century, is organized around
a series of disturbing photographs, some of which picture the newly
deceased. The plot centers on a mysterious surgeon and amateur
photographer, and the motley collection of characters _ among them
a lovestruck foundling and a libidinous geologist _ who follow him
from Liverpool to the battlefields of the Crimean War. ``Perhaps
what's most striking about the book ... is its companionable
alliance between wry, deadpan humor and nightmarish horror,''
Francine Prose wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST AND WEST: China, Power, and the Future of Asia &LR;  By
Christopher Patten. Times Books/Random House, $15. The last British
governor of Hong Kong blends memoir and maxim as he defends his own
record and assails the notion that authoritarian government suits
the Asian character better than democracy. ``Eloquent, compact and
far-reaching,'' his account ``is a must for anyone who wishes to
understand the forces that will shape the world of the 21st
century,'' Jack F. Matlock Jr. wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CHAN'S GREAT CONTINENT: China in Western Minds &LR; , by
Jonathan D. Spence (Norton, $14.95), is a history of the West's
encounters with an enigmatic land that has transfixed and obsessed
observers for seven centuries. ``Spence brilliantly demonstrates''
how the many (often contradictory) perceptions of China over the
years continue to find expression today, Stephen Greenblatt wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLINDNESS &LR;  By Jose Saramago. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14. A
plague of contagious blindness in an unnamed city culminates in a
Hobbesian struggle for power and survival among the growing number
of victims crowded into an asylum. This ``fascinating novel'' by
last year's Nobel laureate in literature is informed by rich
allegorical ambitions and ``a powerful sense of the folly and
heroism of ordinary lives,'' Andrew Miller wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOY &LR;  By Naeem Murr. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13. This
first novel about a man's search for his foster son, and the
charismatic Messiah-Satan figure he eventually discovers, explores
the damage that can blight the relationship between parent and
child. Last year the reviewer Margot Livesey admired Murr's ``dark
energy, his sharply intelligent prose, his genius for the
unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A DANGEROUS PROFESSION: A Book About the Writing Life &LR;  By
Frederick Busch. Broadway, $13. The novelist recounts his labors in
a tough and thankless line of work, and those of brother sufferers
from Dickens to Melville. ``Read this book if you are a beginning
writer who wants the assurance that others, too, have ... been
rejected over and over again,'' Elizabeth Hanson wrote last year.
``Read it if you are an established writer and want to see the
continuing doubt and despair of those who have produced great
books.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; ON BECOMING A NOVELIST &LR; , by John Gardner (Norton, $12), the
acclaimed novelist, who died in 1982, offers practical and
spiritual advice for aspiring writers, stressing above all hard
work and discipline. In 1983 the reviewer Peter Engel called this
``a testament to his belief that great novelists are not born but
made.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AN ICE-CREAM WAR &LR;  By William Boyd. Vintage International, $14.
Set in East Africa during World War I, this ambitious novel
explores the effects of the conflict on British and German
colonialists buffeted and bewildered by the force of historical
circumstance. The result is a tale ``rich in character and
incident, about the waste and absurdity of war,'' Michael Gorra
wrote in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLAWED GIANT: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961-1973 &LR;  By
Robert Dallek. Oxford University, $18.95. The final half of a
two-part biography takes issue with recent Johnson-bashers,
providing a nuanced portrait of an often misguided but hardly
monstrous figure. ``Dallek conveys an abiding ambivalence about the
man'' while managing to ``revivify Johnson the vulgarian, statesman
and political wizard,'' Sean Wilentz wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JACOB'S HANDS &LR;  By Aldous Huxley and Christopher Isherwood. St.
Martin's Griffin, $11.95. This unproduced film treatment written by
the two English authors in the 1940s is about a ranch hand with
healing powers and a strong sense of morals, who is slowly
corrupted by those around him. The result is a ``brief but moving
story,'' William Ferguson wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RING AROUND THE MOON &LR;  By Mary Burnett Smith. Quill/Morrow, $13.
In this novel, a black woman looks back on her childhood near
Philadelphia and the meltdown of her parents' marriage. ``Smith's
strength as a writer lies in the relaxed complexity of her
characters,'' Maggie Galehouse wrote earlier this year.

BODY OF CHILD MISSING 20 YEARS IS FOUND IN MOTHER'S HOME  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite throughout; added details about dead baby, and to
make clear that Carmichael is in custody)   By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Night after night, Madelyn Carmichael claimed to hear
the sound of a wailing baby, even though the building
superintendent repeatedly assured her that no children lived
anywhere near her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said he had been crying all night, that it was screaming
and wouldn't let her sleep,'' said the superintendent, Johana
Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   The police, too, had heard about a baby, and when they arrived
at Ms. Carmichael's Brooklyn apartment on Friday evening, they
found a chilling discovery: the body of an infant girl entombed in
blankets, plastic wrap, and yellowed newspaper dated Nov. 4, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was Ms. Carmichael's daughter, Latanisha, who
detectives say she killed and then hid 20 years ago when she was
about 3. Even when she moved from another apartment in 1980, Ms.
Carmichael took the body of her daughter with her, packing it
inside a set of lockers with mothballs, incense, air fresheners,
and boxes of baking soda.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Ms. Carmichael was in police custody awaiting
arraignment on second-degree murder charges for killing Latanisha,
who would have turned 23 on Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Daniel D'Alessandro, who helped unwrap the body, said
it was one of the most horrifying sights he had ever seen,
describing it as ``nothing more than a skull with hair and flesh,
and a child's outline.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Carmichael has no criminal record, the police said she
has a history of child abuse, and two of her three other children
were sent into foster care long ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those children, Andre, who helped authorities
discover the body of what he later learned was his twin sister.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted and raised by another family, Andre went to the building
at 94-01 Rockaway Parkway three weeks ago looking for his birth
mother, a woman he had never met. She was not home at the time, and
Ms. Rivera, the superintendent for the past 15 years, took his
phone number and promised to pass it along. ``He said that he had
been adopted many years ago and that he just wanted to see her,''
Ms. Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   During the search for his mother, Andre had also learned about
an aunt, who then sked him whether he had looked up his twin
sister. Confused, he asked his older sister, who broke down and
told him that she believed his twin was dead and that the body
might still be in their mother's home.
</P>
<P>
   Andre and his sister then called the police, who sent officers
from the Cold Case Squad, which investigates long-dormant homicide
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Ray Ferrari, commander of the squad, said he knocked on
Ms. Carmichael's door at 7:40 p.m. on Friday and explained that he
had a warrant to search her apartment. According to Ms. Rivera, who
accompanied the police in an effort to calm down Ms. Carmichael,
Ms. Carmichael immediately dashed toward the closet where the body
was and began to scream: ``Please don't let them take me. I don't
want any more suffering. Please just let me die.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari said that as the officers opened the closet, she began
to hyperventilate and then collapsed. A paramedic administered
oxygen and Ms. Carmichael was then taken to Kings County Hospital
by ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression,'' Ferrari said, ``was that she realized it was
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind a closet door that had been bolted shut, the officers
found a locker that was wrapped in cellophane. Inside the locker
was a bundle meticulously wrapped with a baby blanket, four plastic
bags, newspapers, and cellophane. The entire package was then
placed inside a smaller locker that was also encased in plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives believe that Latanisha was probably killed around
Nov. 4, 1979, the date of the newspaper used to wrap her body.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Ms. Carmichael described her as kind and caring,
if eccentric. She would often give presents to neighborhood
children during Christmas or after they did errands. But she also
talked about crying babies that they had not seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would sometimes complain about those noises but I never
thought there would be anything like this,'' Ms. Rivera said. ``I
don't have the words to express how shocked I am. She was a very
nice lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, her health had taken a turn for the worse. She suffered
a stroke, had a pacemaker installed, and was recently diagnosed
with bone cancer, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   The building's assistant superintendent, Madeline Ramos, said
Ms. Carmichael often called her son to buy food or take out the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   While the one-bedroom apartment seemed to be in perpetual
disarray, with footlockers stacked in every corner and
plastic-encased belongings like tennis rackets piled on shelves
around every room, she said, there was no hint of the secret the
apartment was hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place never had any odor and there was nothing that seemed
crazy about her,'' she said. ``I mean, we never suspected
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Latanisha's fate apparently went unnoticed
over the years because all but one of Ms. Carmichael's children had
long lived elsewhere and she kept to herself.
</P>
<P>
   She had always told relatives she was too poor to take care of
them, the police said, telling anyone inquisitive enough to ask
that she had sent Latanisha ``to live down South.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fourth and oldest child, Gregory, apparently had remained in
her care and still visited until recently, when he went to prison
for robbery, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonora Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Administration for
Children's Services said she was troubled by the case _ which would
have come when the agency was called Special Services for Children,
an agency under the Human Resources Administration. ``ACS will
continue to investigate to find out what happened 20 years ago,''
she said, noting that if a parent under supervision by her agency
ever made statements similar to those given by Ms. Carmichael, ``we
would immediately contact the agency in that state and locate that
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carmichael's husband apparently vanished shortly after Andre
and Latanisha were born.
</P>
<P>
   In recalling the years she has known Ms. Carmichael, Ms. Rivera
said on Saturday that in retrospect, much of her behavior was odd
and inexplicable. She would rarely let people into her apartment
unless Ms. Rivera accompanied them, and put a note on her front
door that said: ``Please respect the wishes of this tenant. Please
don't pound on the door or knock on this apartment door.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carmichael had once given Ms. Rivera a baby doll she said
had belonged to her daughter and made her promise to never give it
away, she recalled. Then there was their last meeting before Ms.
Carmichael's arrest, when she came again on Friday morning to
complain about the constant noise of the baby that no one thought
existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was only an old man living above her,'' she said.
``There are no babies on that side of the building.''
