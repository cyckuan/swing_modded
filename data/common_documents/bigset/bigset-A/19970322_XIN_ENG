<HEADLINE> Ukrainians to Pay for Medical Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainians did not have to pay
formerly for medical care at the state-run health facilities under
the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
But they have to pay now, at least for 52 kinds of medical
services ranging from a doctor's visit to a blood pressure check.
This is because the government has cut 4.2 billion U.S. dollars
from the proposed six billion-dollar budget of the Health Ministry
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The health budget cuts will eliminate 20 percent of the
country's 500,000 hospital beds and force 250,000 people in the
health industry out of jobs.
</P>
<P>
"The hardest hit will be the nation's 1.2 million people with
mental illnesses, its 740,000 cancer patients and 1.5 million
invalids," said Valery Bidny, head of the Kiev City
Administration's health care department.
</P>
<P>
Things will be worse for rural residents.
</P>
<P>
More and more rural people will give birth to their babies at
home, and most of the countryside will be denied basic dental and
obstetric care.
</P>
<P>
Previous health care cuts had already left 27 of the country's
rural hospitals without a single doctor, said Health Minister
Andry Serdyuk.
</P>
<P>
He promised this year's spending cuts would not affect rural
health facilities, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The health minister went on to say the government was forced to
cut the health budget and even the richest countries in the world
could not afford free health care for all.
</P>
<P>
"If the 1997 budget allocates just two percent of the gross
domestic product for health spending, medical care will not
improve," said Yuri Spizhenko, chairman of the Parliamentary
Health Care Commission. "Some services must be paid for by
patients."
</P>
<P>
A cash crisis has left workers unpaid for months and gross the
domestic product down 10.4 percent in January compared to the same
month last year.
</P>
<P>
But not all news is bad.
</P>
<P>
Some doctors will waive some fees for those too poor to pay.
</P>
<P>
"For 90 percent of my patients, access to medical care has been
cut significantly by the new rates, so I mostly don't charge for a
consultation if I see tears in the eyes of a patient," says Olga
Grabovskaya, a doctor at Polyclinic No. 2 in Kiev's Obolon
district.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Moves for New Arrangement with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government will
continue its negotiations with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), trying to move from the existing Standby Arrangements (SBA)
to the medium-term Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
Under the new direction, the government would concentrate on
structural reforms, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said here today
at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that loans to be released under the ESAF would be on
a very soft term of 0.5 percent per annum against money provided
under the SBA on around six percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
The fund, he said, endorsed the government's desire to move
decisively to take radical measures for the reform of taxes and of
tax administration as well as for accelerated privatization and
the revival of the industrial and the agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that negotiations for the new arrangement could
begin immediately after successful implementation of this policy.
</P>
<P>
"Our main purpose is to advance the ESAF without waiting for
the budget," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Minister said that before the implementation of the
ESAF arrangements, the SBA would remain under suspension and this
gap could be considered as a transition period.
</P>
<P>
The amount which was to be released under the SBA worth 130
million U.S. dollars would now be adjusted under the ESAF, he
continued.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about the problems to be faced in the
absence of the tranche under the SBA, he said that the government
has already collected an amount of 143 million dollars under the
Debt Retirement Program, while another 60 million dollars was
pledged and would be realized soon.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of around 210 million dollars was
significantly more than the loans of 130 million dollars which was
to be released in two tranches under the SBA, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government held comprehensive policy discussions
with the IMF mission which welcomed its intention to move forward
on a bold program of structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The policy package, Aziz said, when implemented fully, would
lay the basis for a transition to the negotiation of a medium term
ESAF.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Starts Humanitarian Aid Shipping to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has started the first
shipping of humanitarian supplies to Iraq under the
U.N. supervision, a senior official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel told reporters that
part of the planned 10,000 tonnes of edible oil has been
transferred to the Iraqi authorities at Habur on the
Iraqi-Turkish border.
</P>
<P>
Turkey took the action in accordance with the U.N. Security
Council resolution 986 which took effect on December 10, 1996, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of foodstuffs under the United Nations
oil-for-food program has arrived in northern Iraq Thursday,
according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
About 16 tonnes of chickpeas and 109 tonnes of vegetable oil,
part of contracts for 2,000 tonnes of chickpeas and 10,000 tonnes
of vegetable oil, were carried by eight trucks and crossed into
Zakhu in northern Iraq from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It is the first consignment to enter Iraq since the imposition
of U.N. sanctions on Iraq in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Akbel said that the Turkish government supported the
U.N. humanitarian decision to allow Iraqi to export limited oil
to buy food, medicine and other badly needed daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has taken concrete measures to guarantee the
effective implementation of U.N. resolution 986, he added.
</P>
<P>
This resolution, called oil-for-food deal, is aimed at help
the Iraqi people who have suffered a lot from the U.N. trade
sanctions imposed on Baghdad in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under this deal signed between Iraq and the U.N. in May
1996, Iraq was allowed to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
for an initial six-month period.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly sufferred huge economic losses from the
U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq, which is estimated at 25 billion
dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
Helsinki, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The 11th summit between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin
today ended without any breakthrough on NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. officials said that progress has been made in
other subjects on the agenda of the summit. Five statements will
be made by the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
The talks are going on "very well", the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said that three of the documents deal with arms control,
one on Europe's security issues and one on bilateral economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Clinton are expected to hold a joint press
conference at 6:45 pm local time.
</P>
<P>

White House spokesman Michael McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents spent two-thirds of the two-hour
"substantive conversation" on Europe's security, and one third on
the arms control, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot report to you at this point they have reached
agreement because this is a discussion that will evolve as the day
goes on," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions on both of those will continue this
afternoon," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Clinton and Yeltsin reiterated their
positions on the issue of the NATO expansion. Neither side make
any concessions over the issue.

<HEADLINE> NATO Decides to Create Strategic Reserve for Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Permanent Council has
approved on Wednesday during their weekly meeting the concept of
creating a "strategic reserve" for Bosnia, a NATO official said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
This strategic reserve will be made available to the SFOR,
stabilization force, when it begins to gradually reduce its troops
a few months from now.
</P>
<P>
"The existence of the reserve means that you can draw down SFOR
towards the end of the year and in 1998 and without diminishing of
deterrence," the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, these reserve forces will be kept
outside Bosnia, and it will be possible to mobilize and transport
them rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The reserve of "several thousand" soldiers could be made up of
units from NATO members and partner countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it is not designed to take over from SFOR,
whose mandate will end in June 1998, in the event that the
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not sufficiently normalized by
that time.
</P>
<P>
The actual deployment of the strategic reserve force in Bosnia
is expected to be approved by NATO's Permanent Council, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
He said General George Joulwan, Supreme Allied Commander in
Europe, who presented the "strategic reserve" concept, was
authorized by the Council to exercise and train that force.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls on World Leaders Against Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) called on world leaders here today to support its new
strategy to treat tuberculosis which ravages millions of people
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
"The World Health Organization calls on political and
community leaders, medical and health officials, doctors and
nurses, to use DOTS more widely," Dr Hiroshi Nakajima,
Director-General of the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases could fall
rapidly if DOTS -- the Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course
-- was used to treat seven out of every 10 patients, instead of
the current one out of 10.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said DOTS could cost just 100 US Dollars per patient
for an entire course of treatment but said investment was needed
to get the strategy up and running.
</P>
<P>
Eight to 10 million people are suffering from Tuberculosis,
particularly in Africa, the Indian subcontinent and eastern
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Minister Lauds Good Relations with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and China enjoy very good
bilateral relations and both countries will open more areas for
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by th Nigerian Minister of Transport,
Major-General Ibrahim Gumel, here this afternoon. The minister is
to leave for a week-long visit to China tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian ministry and China signed a contract in December
1995, under which a Chinese company will be engaged in the
rehabilitation of the 3,020-km railway network of the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
The minister and his delegation will be in China to launch the
locomotives and passenger coaches produced in two Chinese
factories.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to see with my own eyes the products I have
confidence in," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The railway rehabilitation project has opened more areas of
economic cooperation and bilateral relations between Nigeria and
China far more than what used to be before," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister described the 520-million-dollar railway project,
undertaken by the China Civil Engineering Construction
Corporation (CCESS), as "the key to open more areas" between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He cited as example the visit to China of a delegation led by
the Nigerian Minister of Work and Housing, Major-General
Abul-Karim Adisa, who will travel to Beijing with him in the same
flight tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Work and Housing signed a memorandun of
understanding with CCECC last October on cooperation in housing
construction in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the document has been widely observed as
setting the stage for the Chinese company to come to rescue the
embattled National Housing Program aiming at providing residence
for low-income Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
It is also an evidence of close cooperation ties between China
and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
As for the railway rehabilitation project, the minister
expressed his confidence that once all the materials are
prepared, it can be finished on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The project is billed for completion on September 30, 1998, a
date coincides with Nigeria's general elections for the
installation of the civilian government.
</P>
<P>
According to the military government's transition program, a
civilian president will be inaugurated on October 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Currently, preparations for the railway project is in full
swing and more than 300 Chinese engineers and experts have been
in Nigeria for the project.

<HEADLINE> 30M People Will Die of TB in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) today said 30 million out of the 300 million
people infected with tuberculosis (TB) will die of the disease
across the world during the coming 10 years.
</P>
<P>
At a panel discussion on the application of direct observed
treatment short-course (DOTS) in connection with world TB day to
be observed next Monday, Dr. Pieter Teenstra, WHO medical advisor
on TB, said most of the victims of TB are adults from the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said among infectious diseases TB is the leading killer of
adults today and is a serious challenge to international public
health work.
</P>
<P>
The most effective way to stop the threat of TB is to detect
the infectious patients in an early stage of the disease and to
cure them, Teenstra said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, ''the best curative method for TB as recommended by
WHO is called DOTS in which health workers ensure that TB
patients take their full course of medicine by watching them
swallow each and every dose during the intensive months (2
months-duration) of the treatment which in total takes eight
months.''
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report from the WHO, Africa will face
10 million new cases of TB during the next five years, of which
as many as 3.6 million people will die during the same period.
</P>
<P>
World TB day will be marked throughout the world on March 24.

<P>
HARARE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today accused some members of his ruling ZANU (PF) of
being too ambitious and hit out at indiscipline among the party
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 29th ordinary session of the ZANU (PF) Central
Committee, Mugabe said there were many people in the party who
wanted to immediately become president or vice-president.
</P>
<P>
''My belief, derived from a long process of observation, is
that there is more indiscipline at our own leadership level, that
of the Central Committee than at the lower echelons of the
party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, ''this unbridled ambition then leads some among
us to nefarious and clandestine organizational tactics for
support and ultimately creates divisions within the party.''
</P>
<P>
He also cited drunkenness, moral turpitude, foul language and
belligerence which he said continued to mar the image of the
party.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also called for a speedy solution to the party's
registration exercise, which he said was taking too long to
complete.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''let us please be serious on this matter if we mean
to see our party well organized, well run, well disciplined and
performing effectively and efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
He added he wanted to see the land question finally resolved
because it was the key to the success of Zimbabweans.

<P>
Helsinki, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today condemned the bombing in Tel Aviv, which killed three people
and injured 47.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference here with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, Clinton urged the Palestinians to take
all possible steps to help erase terror from the peace process
once and for all.
</P>
<P>
"There is no place for such acts of terror and violence in the
peace process," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"There must be absolutely no doubt in the minds of the friends
or of the enemies of peace that the Palestinian Authority is
unalterably opposed to terror and unalterably committed to
preempting and preventing such acts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The blast was claimed by the Islamic Resistance Movement
(HAMAS) as a response to Israel's decision to build a new
settlement in annexed Arab east Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: It Is Africans' Turn to Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Africa, unfortunately
troubled with various kinds of acute contradictions and bloody
conflicts, used to be heavily relying on mediation from
non-African states, but now things are appearing different with
the current Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations, who is
visiting South Africa, pointed out on Thursday that African
countries would have to play their part in peace-keeping
operations on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The days when African nations and troops were excluded and
outsiders were brought in were gone, Annan stressed at a press
conference in Cape Town, the legislative capital of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"They (non-African states) will work with us. They will play
their part, but Africans must play their part as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts believe that the call which Annan has made is
no longer a simple political slogan, because it is actually
becoming a voluntary action of African states.
</P>
<P>
A remarkable example to identify the tendency is that many
African states are doing their best to solve the current Zairean
crisis, which erupted last October.
</P>
<P>
Although the Zairean crisis is still going on, these African
states, including South Africa have never given up their efforts
to mediate between the warring sides.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela is apparently one of
African leaders who have been trying to play a positive role in
solving the crisis in the Great Lake region.
</P>
<P>
Following Mandela's invitation, Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko's envoy Honore Nzambo, Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila
and his representative Bizima Karaha came to South Africa one
after another for talks with Mandela and his top aides on the
Zairean issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Annan and Mandela expressed belief that despite
strong offensive by rebel forces, there is still hope for a
peaceful settlement in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Annan said if the U.N. Security Council decided to set up a
monitoring mechanism in the event of a cease-fire being brokered
in Zaire, "then we would welcome the participation of as many
African countries as possible".
</P>
<P>
Will African countries be able to take part in the
peace-keeping action? The African countries are giving their
positive answer.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that South Africa, a military power in Africa,
has trained two battalions of troops to be ready for
multi-national peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The South African government is willing to contribute up to
1,000 soldiers to any peace-keeping operation in the world, local
press quoted top officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides, South Africa and other Southern African Development
Community (SADC) member states are reportedly due to hold joint
military exercises in April, in preparation for any peace-keeping
operation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Local observers have noticed that it will be the first of
several peace-keeping operations planned by Southern African
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Try, try, never say die." This has become a faith for African
countries in mediating all kinds of disputes and confrontations.

<HEADLINE> One in 20 Britons Alcoholic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Alcoholics in Britain now
outnumber drug addicts by two to one, according to a survey
released here today.
</P>
<P>
One in 20 Britons is addicted to drink, with nearly two
million men and women regularly downing dangerous amounts.
</P>
<P>
Misuse of alcohol costs British industry 2 billion Pounds (3.2
billion US dollars) a year, with a further 150 million Pounds (240
million US dollars) in NHS bills.
</P>
<P>
The situation is almost certain to worsen, due to the huge
numbers of young people taking up strong drink, warns Alcohol
Concern.
</P>
<P>
The survey entitled Measures For Measure, found that while
drugs attract publicity, drinking is a far worse problem.
</P>
<P>
One in 45 people are dependent upon drugs--including Ecstasy,
cannabis, cocaine, heroin, LSD, tranquilisers and sleeping pills.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the report claims that 1.3 million men and
500,000 women drank at "very risky" levels--more than 50 units of
alcohol a week for men, equivalent to 25 pints of beer, and 35
units for women.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a government-coordinated national strategy on
alcohol, the report reveals that last year there were 33,000
alcohol-related deaths and 28,000 hospital admissions.
</P>
<P>
Donald Acheson, the former Government Chief Medical Officer,
said: "Alcohol misuse not only causes a great deal of unnecessary
ill-health but remains at the root of the greater part of violence
in our society."

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Arranges Consultation for African Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) said today it has
concluded arrangements for African Regional Consultation on
higher education early next month.
</P>
<P>
The consultation, to be held in Dakar, Senegal, will be aimed
at brainstorming on the issues of higher education in the 21st
century, a prelude to the world conference scheduled for next
year in Paris, the News Agency of Nigeria reported, quoting a
UNESCO official.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Deputy Director of UNESCO in Paris, Da Costa, said
here today that the consultation would offer a timely opportunity
to revive deliberations on higher education in a world
characterized by continued progress in information and
communications technologies.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of frontier-free learning and the notion of
equity, merit, responsibility and partnership should, from now,
be considered during the formulation of policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Dakar African Regional Consultation, which will take place
between April 1 and 4 this year, would discuss the relevance of
higher education, quality of higher education, managing higher
education and strengthening intra-African and international
cooperation in higher education.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNESCO official, the participants will come
from all the main partners of higher education in Africa,
universities, non-governmental organizations, U.N. specialized
agencies, students and lecturers.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Clinton Differ on NATO Expansion, but Agree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helsinki, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton today failed to agree on the
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) but
agree to sign a document to define NATO-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed that NATO Secretary General Solana
and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will try to complete
negotiations on a NATO-Russia document in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
"It would demonstrate that a new Russia and a new NATO are
partners, not adversaries, in bringing a brighter future to
Europe," Clinton told a joint press conference after the summit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin reiterated that Russia opposes the alliance's eastward
expansion. It was "a mistake, even a serious one," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "progress, very considerable
progress" has been made during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the summit has opened "a new phase" in the
U.S.-NATO relations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the document to be signed between the
16-member NATO and Russia should be binding to all the parties.
</P>
<P>
Since it would take several months for parliaments to ratify
the document, "signatures of the leaders will be enough" for the
binding document which is to be signed before NATO's special
summit in July in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone will sign this, all heads of state of all 16 members
of NATO," Yeltsin said. "This is a very principled issue."
</P>
<P>
Five separate joint statements by the two presidents have been
issued on European security, chemical weapons, economic relations,
future reductions in nuclear forces, and the anti-ballistic
missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
They agreed on guidelines for START III and negotiations will
each cap at 2,000 to 2,5000 the number of strategic nuclear
warheads.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. promised to help Russia join the Organization of the
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and play a bigger role in the Group of Seven.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in one of the statements that NATO have "no
intention, no plan and no reason" to deploy nuclear weapons on the
territory of new members.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA's Management to Be Overhauled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Zambia
Railway Authority (TAZARA) Council of Ministers has decided to
overhaul TAZARA's management with immediate effect in order to
improve efficiency and save it from total collapse.
</P>
<P>
The council of ministers, announcing the decision during a
one-day council's meeting held at the TAZARA headquarters in Dar
es Salaam today, said that the management had proved a failure.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Deputy Minister for Communications and Transport
Gilbert Mululu, who chaired the meeting on behalf his minister,
said the management had failed to collect debts totalling 7
million U.S. Dollars from various customers being charged for
cargo handling and transportation.
</P>
<P>
"The Board of Directors had been instructed to restructure the
management of the authority in order to improve the authority's
performance and efficiency," said Mululu.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian deputy minister said the management overhauling
should be effected immediately to save the authority from total
collapse. He said TAZARA was under serious financial crunch due
to a total failure on the part of the management.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA is a patient and it needs surgical operation to save
it from total collapse, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Mululu said the council of ministers was not interested to see
TAZARA collapsing.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that the Council of ministers also had
rejected the Authority's Development Report ending 1995 on
grounds that it was poorly prepared by the management.
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is just a mere historical background of
about the authority and is of no use to the Council," charged
Mululu, adding that the TAZARA board of directors had been
directed to prepared a fresh and comprehensive one and submitt it
to the council on May 2, this year.
</P>
<P>
At the council of ministers meeting, the government of
Tanzania was represented by Minister for Communications and
Transport William Kusila and the Ministry's Principal Secretary
Salim Msoma, and Deputy Minister for Finance Khatib Abdisalaam.

Commerce and Trade Ackim Nkole, Deputy Minister for Finance
Godfrey Simasiku, Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of
Communication and Transport E.M.C. Kazembe, Zambian High
Commissioner to the country J.K. Chitafu and TAZARA Managing
Director Antisne Mwemba.
</P>
<P>
When Minister for Communications and Transport Kusila
delivered his speech at a function to mark 20th anniversary of
TAZARA last August, he said changes in trade patterns increased
competition and declined performance of the hinterland economies
of Tanzania and Zambia and as a result contributed to sharp
decline in TAZARA's freight traffic performance over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, TAZARA Board Chairman Salim
Msoma predicted that under the commercialization program,
TAZARA's total market share of traffic would shoot up to 77
percent by the 1999/2000 from 69 percent attained in 1995/1996
financial year.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Annan's Visit to S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan today wrapped up his four-day visit
to South Africa after extensive talks with leaders of his host
country on issues such as Zairean crisis, Angolan peace process,
peacekeeping operations on the continent and the UN reform.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to fly to Angola later today to continue his
African tour, the first official visit to the continent since his
inauguration in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Describing South Africa's victory over apartheid as a sign of
hope for all humankind, Annan pledged UN's continuing support to
the country's democratic transformation confronting the legacy of
the post-apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Annan said South Africa was a shining example to other
countries such as Zaire and Angola on how to resolve their
political conflicts and could play a major role on the
international stage, particularly in peacekeeping operations and
in seeking a long-lasting solution to the conflicts on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
On Zairean crisis, the UN Chief said he was optimistic the
conflicts between Zairean government and rebel movement would be
finally settled through peaceful negotiations, as no one in Zaire
was demanding secession or the breakup of the country.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with the host President Nelson Mandela, Annan
spoke highly of South Africa's mediation efforts in helping
solving the on-going crisis in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped the Nairobi summits by the heads of state in the
Great Lakes region and the scheduled summit by the Organisation
of African Unity in Lome, Togo on March 26 would bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Angolan peace process, the UN Chief believed the
planned inauguration of Angola's new government of national unity
next Monday was a culmination of the painstaking efforts by both
the concerned sides of the worn-torn country and the
international community as well.
</P>
<P>
Peacekeeping operations on the strife-ridden continent,
however, also topped Annan's agenda during his tour to South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Annan said African countries, including South
Africa, would have to play their role in peacekeeping missions in
the troubled countries on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction that a group of African leaders
had come together to this effect and were working very hard to
resolve the Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
The UN Chief also threw his full weight behind the United
States initiative, which had been cold-shouldered by African
states, of creating an African crisis intervention force to
prevent the conflict and provide, in case, the necessary
assistance to civilians in troubled areas on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Annan ensured Mandela and other African leaders not
to worry about the prospect of being sidelined in the move to
create such a force.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the planned UN reforms, Annan said
increasing the number of the Security Council would mean electing
five new permanent members with non-veto powers. Two would
probably be called from the northern industrial countries and the
others from Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
As for South Africa becoming a permanent Security Council
member, the UN Chief said it was likely the UN General Assembly
would have to vote on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Sri Lanka's Ruling Party Wins Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's ruling People's
Alliance (PA) has won a major victory in local elections held on
Friday after taking most of the councils.
</P>
<P>
The local elections were scheduled to be held in 1995, but
postponed twice due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Friday's polls were held only in 17 districts in seven of the
nine provinces as the turmoil in Northern and Eastern provinces
was not conducive to polls.
</P>
<P>
About 7.52 million of 9.73 million eligible voters had cast
ballots at 8,248 polling stations on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Twelve political parties and 136 independent groups contested
the 3,567 seats in the 238 local government councils, of which 12
are municipal councils, 31 urban councils and 195 village
councils.
</P>
<P>
However, the main battle had been fought between the PA and the
opposition United National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Commission here today, the PA had won
194 of the 238 local councils, including seven municipal councils,
20 urban councils and 167 village councils.
</P>
<P>
While the UNP only retained 43 councils out of the 193 it won
at the 1991 local polls, including five municipal councils, 11
urban councils and 27 village councils.
</P>
<P>
Two political parties the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (People's
Liberation Front) and the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (People's
United Front) were able to win a few seats in some councils.
</P>
<P>
The election was regarded as a test for the PA since it has
been in office for two and a half years. The PA's main plank
during the election campaign has been allegations of 17 years of
misrule by the previous UNP government.
</P>
<P>
The election results also showed majority of the voters have
favored the present PA government's policies.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Criticizes US Veto of UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Egyptian Shura
Council's Arab and Foreign Affairs Committee Mofeid Shehab today
denounced the second U.S. veto in two weeks of a U.N. Security
Council draft resolution that bars Israel from implementing a new
settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "Good Morning Egypt" T.V program, Shehab
said that the U.S. was "mistaken" to use the veto twice on the
resolution that demanded Israel to stop building 6,500 housing
units on Har Homa in East Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want
to establish their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Following a veto of the U.N. draft resolution on March 7, the
U.S. Friday vetoed again the European-sponsored U.N. resolution
against the Israeli settlement plan, saying that it opposes the
project and that the Israelis and Palestinians should work out
their problems without "interference from the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
But the Egyptian official dismissed the U.S. excuse and argued
that the U.N. was actually established to settle international
disputes, whatever minor they might be.
</P>
<P>
"If the Security Council is not concerned with the building of
settlements in the occupied Arab territories which impede the
peace negotiations, then what is its concern?" he asked
rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, security of the region is being threatened,
therefore, the U.S. pretext on vetoing the draft resolution is
groundless, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shehab said he believed that the peace negotiations are in a
more critical stage than ever before.
</P>
<P>
"It not only stumbled, but came completely to a halt. Armed
violence and clashes have erupted," he said.
</P>
<P>
The failure to issue an international resolution denouncing
Israel has already led to tension in the West Bank cities of
Ramallah, Nablus, Hebron and the Gaza Strip where confrontations
between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian stone-throwers are rife,
Shehab told the Egyptian T.V. program.
</P>
<P>
Friday's vote coincided with a suicide bombing attack at a Tel
Aviv cafe, killing at least three people and wounding 47. The
militant Muslim group of Hamas has claimed responsibility for the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the attack, Shehab said that "any escalation of
violence will have its own reasoning and no one in particular
could be blamed... But Israeli security precautions or repressive
measures will not stop violence."
</P>
<P>
When the Palestinian people lose hope for a bright future, some
of them turn to violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Political Advisor to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak Ossama el-Baz cautioned the Israeli government against the
use of force on Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
After the bombing attack, Israel has clamped a closure on the
West Bank and Gaza and is expected to take other severe measures,
barring travel between Palestinian villages and blockading
Palestinian-ruled cities in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Baz refuted Israeli claims that the Palestinian Liberation
Organization was encouraging Hamas to carry out violence, saying
the charge was "void and unconvincing."
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in
1979, but bilateral ties have deteriorated since Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu took power last June.

<HEADLINE> Albania Says Berisha Ouster Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Albania's presidential spokesman
today dismissed calls for embattled President Sali Berisha to
quit, saying it was unacceptable to force a legally reelected
president to resign.
</P>
<P>
In response to fresh calls by rebels in southern Albania that
Berisha should resign, Genc Pollo said Berisha was reelected by
parliament and it was unacceptable to force the president to
resign with a gun pointed at his head.
</P>
<P>
Berisha was re-elected unopposed to a second five-year term by
a parliament dominated by his Democratic Party early this month.
But he is facing the worst unrest of his rule.
</P>
<P>
Trouble first erupted in the south of Albania after shady
pyramid investment schemes, in which thousands of families
invested their life savings, collapsed.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of demonstrations by people who blamed Berisha for
their misfortune, the protests turned violent. Angry Albanians
looted thousands of guns from army depots and took control of
their towns. They have demanded that Berisha resign.
</P>
<P>
Berisha last week agreed to set up an interim government for
national reconciliation until new elections in June and appointed
Bashkim Fino from the opposition Socialist Party as prime
minister. But the president has refused to quit.
</P>
<P>
Pollo was speaking a day after rebel leaders from 14 towns in
southern Albania issued a fresh call for Berisha to resign but
drew back from their earlier threat to set up a rival government.
</P>
<P>
The rebels met in a southern town on Friday after Berisha
ignored a Thursday deadline they set for him to quit. The
president says he will step down if his party loses elections in
June.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia's Shepherds Saying Good-bye to Oil Lamps </HEADLINE>

<P>
HOHHOT, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Electricity has made the rooms
brighter and the evenings more colorful for 100,000 shepherd
households in the Xilin Gol Grasslands of northwest China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The people there have bid farewell to oil lamps and have begun
to use electricity, and can now watch television in the evening.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, more than 40 percent of the 145 townships of Xilin Gol
League, which covers an area of 200,000 square kilometers and has
a population of 900,000, did not have electricity.
</P>
<P>
The area began to encourage the construction of electric power
plants in 1996 and has made electricity available in 41 townships
within a year, at a total cost of 14 million yuan (about 1.7
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
To date, 86 percent of the townships in the area have
electricity.
</P>
<P>
The 50th anniversary of the founding of the region is May 1
this year.

<P>

SHANGHAI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's First Prime
Minister Norodom Ranariddh today met visiting Chinese State
Councillor and Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan and
pledged to stick to the "one-China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said his government has always considered Taiwan as a
province of China, and vowed that his country will maintain its
"one-China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Luo expressed his gratitude for Cambodia's stance, describing
it as valuable support for the grand task of China's national
unification.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to further consolidate and develop
Sino-Cambodian friendship.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that though China's economic strength is limited, it
will never hesitate in extending assistance to Cambodia without
attaching any political preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said Chinese assistance and support are of great help
to the Cambodian peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Luo and Cambodian Second Deputy Prime Minister and
Interior Minister Sar Kheng attended a ceremony marking the
agreement of free Chinese economic aid to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to King Norodom Sihanouk, Ranariddh said Cambodia
appreciates what the Chinese government has done in treating his
father's disease.
</P>
<P>
The king has a brain tumor and thrombosis and received
treatment in Beijing last year.
</P>
<P>
Luo said the king is an outstanding leader of the Cambodian
people and founder of Sino-Cambodian friendship.

<HEADLINE> China's Upsurge in Water Control Projects (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide water-control
campaign in China is going ahead full steam to prevent big
flooding and to have another good grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Water Resources, 32.2 billion yuan
has been spent on water conservation projects from last winter to
this spring, more than for the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
East China's Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui and Fujian
provinces allocated more than 20 billion yuan last year. Jiangxi
Province, a major rice producer, repaired 1,160 reservoirs in the
past few months. The amount of government funding for
water-control projects this year will be 20 percent more than for
1996, said Liu Zhengmin, director of the provincial department in
charge of water conservancy.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000 reservoirs in east and south China protected 1.3
million ha of land and tens of millions of people from floods last
year.
</P>
<P>
The water conservation construction in various parts of China
reflects a sensible attitude by the Chinese government, says a
water conservancy expert. China built 84,000 reservoirs with a
combined water storage capacity of 470 billion cubic meters from
the 1950s to the 1970s. But, because they haven't been repaired
for a long time, some cannot store the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
And at the same time, a flood peak is expected when one
considers the historical rule that there is a big flood every
seven years, one water conservation expert says.

He warned that it is quiet possible that there will be floods
in several big rivers during the rainy season this year, posing a
serious threat to China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
From an agricultural production perspective, acreage of
irrigated land in China shrank by one million ha over the past 15
years and investment in water facilities decreased. As a result,
the national grain output hung around 450 billion kg until a
record of 480 billion was hit last year.
</P>
<P>
This year will see an upsurge in water conservation
construction. The Central Government has earmarked 3.1 billion
yuan for a special fund for key water projects. Local governments
are also expected to come up with 3.9 billion yuan for the fund.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi has allocated six billion yuan for work on Boyang Lake
and to renovate 12 water control projects. The money accounts for
60 percent of total spending on water projects over the past four
decades.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is expected to work on Taihu and Hangjia Lakes, to
reinforce embankments along the Qiantang River, to reclaim a total
area of 18,600 ha., and to provide 193,300 ha of arid land with
adequate irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Shandong plans to build 10 large reservoirs and repair damaged
river banks.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts predict that there is a possibility for
China to break its grain production record with improved water
conservation projects.

SHIJIAZHUANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
has taken a big step forward in controlling pollution, which the
provincial government has listed as one of its key tasks.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 95 percent of the pollution-causing
enterprises had met government standards, and more than 14,000
small enterprises with heavy pollution problems had been closed.

<HEADLINE> HK's Provisional Legislature Meeting Opens to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yoh Wen set out at 6:30
this morning from his home at Tsing Yi in the west of Kowloon; two
and half hours later he arrived at the Huaxia Art Center in
Shenzhen, the meeting venue of the Provisional Legislative Council
(PLC) before June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chen was among the first batch of 26 visitors at the meeting of
the PLC, which for the first time opened its public gallery. The
interim legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) did not receive members of the public at its two previous
meetings for limit of space.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the Tsue Wan District Board for nine years, Chen was
eager to see how the provisional legislature operates. When he
learned from the newspaper that the PLC would open to the public
this time, he applied to the PLC Secretariat for admission to the
30 seats arranged for the public.
</P>
<P>
Chen said: "China had no choice but to form the PLC because
Britain had made it impossible for the current Legislative Council
to go on thorough train with the so-called political reform
package." He wanted to tell what he saw and heard today at the PLC
meeting to 17,000 voters in his district. The majority of voters
showed sympathy to the establishment of the interim legislative
body, he said.
</P>
<P>
As Chen did, Tang Fook Hing spent three hours getting to the
PLC meeting venue from Lantau island, an outlying island in the
west of Hong Kong. Having been engaged in village affairs for many
years, Tang wanted to see with his own eyes how the PLC meeting
was going on.
</P>
<P>
Because space is limited, the PLC Secretariat can receive only
30 public figures each time. Out of the 30 successful applicants,
26 were present at the meeting today. The PLC will hold its
official meetings in Shenzhen, the city bordering Hong Kong before
June 30, 1997.

BAGHDAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the Iraqi
Drilling Company Ibrahim Abdul-Karim said the recently-set up
Iraqi-Russian joint venture for drilling and oil reclamation will
play a significant role in Iraq's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
"The new firm is a joint venture between the Iraqi Drilling

Suffering from U.N.-imposed economic sanctions over the past
six years, Iraq is now striving to conclude more deals with
friendly countries.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Annan's Visit to S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan today wrapped up his four-day visit
to South Africa after extensive talks with leaders of his host
country on issues such as Zairean crisis, Angolan peace process,
peacekeeping operations on the continent and the UN reform.
</P>
<P>
Annan, a Ghanaian and the first African to head the world
body, is expected to fly to Angola later today to continue his
African tour, the first official visit to the continent since his
inauguration in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Describing South Africa's victory over apartheid as a sign of
hope for all humankind, Annan pledged UN's continuing support to
the country's democratic transformation confronting the legacy of
the post-apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Annan said South Africa was a shining example to other
countries such as Zaire and Angola on how to resolve their
political conflicts and could play a major role on the
international stage, particularly in peacekeeping operations and
in seeking a long-lasting solution to the conflicts on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
On Zairean crisis, the UN Chief said he was optimistic the
conflicts between Zairean government and rebel movement would be
finally settled through peaceful negotiations, as no one in Zaire
was demanding secession or the breakup of the country.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with the host President Nelson Mandela, Annan
spoke highly of South Africa's mediation efforts in helping
solving the on-going crisis in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped the Nairobi summits by the heads of state in the
Great Lakes region and the scheduled summit by the Organisation
of African Unity in Lome, Togo on March 26 would bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Angolan peace process, the UN Chief believed the
planned inauguration of Angola's new government of national unity
next Monday was a culmination of the painstaking efforts by both
the concerned sides of the worn-torn country and the
international community as well.
</P>
<P>
Peacekeeping operations on the strife-ridden continent,
however, also topped Annan's agenda during his tour to South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Annan said African countries, including South
Africa, would have to play their role in peacekeeping missions in
the troubled countries on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction that a group of African leaders
had come together to this effect and were working very hard to
resolve the Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
The UN Chief also threw his full weight behind the United
States initiative, which had been cold-shouldered by African
states, of creating an African crisis intervention force to
prevent the conflict and provide, in case, the necessary
assistance to civilians in troubled areas on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Annan ensured Mandela and other African leaders not
to worry about the prospect of being sidelined in the move to
create such a force.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the planned UN reforms, Annan said
increasing the number of the Security Council would mean electing
five new permanent members with non-veto powers. Two would
probably be called from the northern industrial countries and the
others from Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
As for South Africa becoming a permanent Security Council
member, the UN Chief said it was likely the UN General Assembly
would have to vote on the issue.

Lagos, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha said on Friday Nigeria supports the decision of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to hold a special summit in
Lome, Togo next week to disscuss events and development in the
Great Lakes area.
</P>
<P>
The current armed conflict in Zaire is dishearterning and
dangerous to the peace and security of the African continent as a
whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha made the remarks during a meeting with Kofi
Panou, foreign minister and special envoy of the president of
Togo in Abuja, the Nigerian capital on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to General Abacha, the existing machinery for
conflict resolution on the continent should be effectively
utilized in order to seek purely African solutions to Africa's
peculiar problems.
</P>
<P>
It is wise to bring all parties of the dispute to the
conference table to find a way out of the present dilemma in
Zair, he said, adding that the lingering nature of the conflict
is capable of undermining the stability and security of the
entire continent.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese foreign minister is in Nigeria to brief General
Abacha on preparations being made for the summit which will take
place on March 26.
</P>
<P>
He said the presence and active participation of Nigeria would
help find lasting solutions to the armed conflict in Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Production of Vanilla Increases in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The production of vanilla has
increased very quickly in last six years in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Wu Fatian, managing director of
Chinese- Ugandan joint venture, Sietco- Chambco Uganda Limited
today, reliable statistics show that Uganda's production of
vanilla dried beans had increased from two tons in 1991 to 12
tons last year, representing a five fold increase in six years.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Uganda had worked out measures to develop
vanilla production, planning to produce 50 tons of dried vanilla
beans per year in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Vanilla is a creeper crop usaully grown under coffee or banana
plantation. It is used in manufacturing spices.
</P>
<P>
It was in the 1940's when Asians began to develop vanilla
plantation in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Much progress was made in the 1960's after Uganda's
independence in 1962. However the production had been at a
standstill in the 1970's and 1980's due to the political turmoil,
its production in the country started resuming since then.
</P>
<P>
At present, 90 percent of the world's vanilla demand estimated
to be between 1,600 and 18,000 tons per year is met by
artificially produced vanilla, which sells at less than ten
percent the price of natural vanilla. Natural vanilla has been
badly in need in the international market since the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Minister Warns More Violence Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Minister of Justice
Freih Abu Medein warned today that a deadlock in the peace process
could invite more violence.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Voice of Arab radio, the
minister said Friday's suicide bomb attack in Tel Aviv was a
reprisal for Israel's bid to build a new Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
While expressing deep sorrow over the attack, which killed four
people, including the bomber, and wounded 46 others, the
Palestinian official held the Israeli government responsible for
"the wave of anger that dominates the Palestinian street."
</P>
<P>
"I expects even wider explosion in the situation if there was
not any virtual progress in the peace process," he told the radio.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bomb attack came a week after a Jordanian soldier
shot dead seven Israeli schoolgirls at the Jordan river.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian fury ran high when Israel Tuesday sent
bulldozers to the construction site for a 6,500-unit new Jewish
neighborhood in Har Homa, known also as Jebel Abu Ghneim to the
Palestinians, in East Jerusalem, where Palestinians want to
establish their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians said Israel violated Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords that leave the status of Jerusalem open for future
negotiations, while the Israelis claims sovereignty over the Arab
part of Jerusalem seized in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
So far, international diplomacy has failed to discourage Israel
from the new housing plan, especially as the second U.S. veto
Friday aborted the U.N. Security Council resolution barring
Israel's settlement activities on the occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
Even before the Friday attack, Israeli security officials had
warned that violence including possible suicide attacks could
erupt this week to revenge the Har Homa construction.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat has
condemned the bombing, and his aides are quick to pin the blame on
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In return, Netanyahu said that Arafat had given Islamic
militants the green light to carry out attacks in Israel and the
peace process could not continue, at least at this moment.
</P>
<P>
In another interview with the Egyptian radio today, Leader of
the Democratic Arab Party in the Israeli Knesset (Parliament)
Abdel Wahab Al-Darawsha also attributed the Tel Aviv attack to
"the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied Jerusalem and other
occupied Arab territories."
</P>
<P>
As for Netanyahu's proposal to speed up the final stage of
negotiations with the Palestinians over the future of Jerusalem
and the Palestinian statehood this year, two years ahead of
schedule, both Abu Medein and Al-Darawsha told the radio that the
proposal is no good at all.
</P>
<P>
"It rather aims at torpedoing the peace process and satisfying
the Israeli extremist right," Darawsha said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have turned down the offer, fearing it might
mean bypassing the 1993 interim autonomy deal which spells out a
three-phrase Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan to Bring Forward Pensions Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan is to implement its
pension reforms this year rather than next year because of growing
nationwide protests over pension arrears.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform plan, the country will set up a special
retirement pension fund, to which citizens who are able to work
are obliged to contribute so that they can receive a pension from
the fund after retirement.
</P>
<P>
The new pension system is different from the current system
approved five years ago, under which pensions are paid by
employers. The government believes the new system is more
suitable for a market economy.
</P>
<P>
The media here reported that the number of pensioners in the
central Asian country has increased by more than half a million
over the last few years to 2.81 million.
</P>
<P>
Each pensioner is supported on average by 1.8 people in the
working population compared with three people in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Security Measures Taken at Maputo Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Security measures are being taken
at the Maputo international airport after the reserve generator
at the control tower was robbed.
</P>
<P>
According to Noticias report today, one of the measures is to
resettle the residents residing near the wire enclosures within a
specified time. The Maputo municipal council has therefore
designated a piece of land in the Laulane district on the
surburbs for building new houses.
</P>
<P>
The second measure is to build brick and stone enclosing walls
to replace the wire enclosures. In the past, airport director
Felismino Chalas said, residents nearby often entered the airport
for walks, grazing or picking wild fruits. Some even embarked on
the runway and evolved the idea to steal the aluminium rings for
the pilot lights.
</P>
<P>
Even the new wire enclosers were cut and stolen by residents
for making bird cages and enclosures of their own houses, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The reserve generator and the aluminium rings and pilot
lights were stolen on March 17 and taken out of the airport
with vehicles by the robbers.
</P>
<P>
This shocked the capital city and caused worries to
authorities concerned.
</P>
<P>
The reserve generator for the control tower was found at a
resident's home on the same day the incident was brought to
light.

<HEADLINE> Fund Established in China To Assist Creative Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A fund was established in China
today to help middle school students and those who return to rural
areas after graduation to work on science and technology projects
with creative ideas and market potential.
</P>
<P>
The "Maple Leaf Creativeness Fund" was set up with a
five-million-yuan (about 60,000 US dollars) donation from the
Dalian Maple Leaf International School. The project is jointly
sponsored by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League
of China (CYLC), and the All-China Students' Federation.
</P>
<P>
The fund is part of a national project to support science and
technology among middle school students, according to Sun Jinlong,
member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the CYLC. He
said that the project is also an effective measure for encouraging
middle school students, especially those in rural areas to improve
themselves, and to get involved in "education through practice".
</P>
<P>
The fund is expected to support 400 science and technology
projects each year over the next five years. Projects that have
good results will be given the "Maple Leaf Cup" award.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the fund will help improve students' ability to
use their hands and will turn them into people of knowledge,
ethics, pioneering ideas, and creative power," said Sherman Jen,
chairman of the board of directors of the Maple Leaf International
School.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Resume Demonstrations In Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred Palestinians
took to the street in Hebron today in continued protest against
Israel's building of new Jewish settlement, according to a
report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators gathered near the Jewish area of Beit
Hadassah in the largely Palestinian self-rule city, burning
Israeli flags and carried out a funeral for the 28-year-old Hamas
activist who committed suicide bombing in Tel Aviv Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian protesters hurled stones at Israeli border
policemen guarding Jewish settlements, lightly wounding one of
them. The soldiers forcibly dispersed the crowds by firing
rubber bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 people were injured, including four Palestinian
policemen and two journalists, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian policemen prevented the protesters from approaching
the Jewish quarter.
</P>
<P>
Today's anti-Israeli demonstration is the second in two
days-running. During a Friday after-prayer demonstration, some 30
Palestinians were injured from tear gas fired by Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of violent protest were triggered off by Israel's
groundbreaking Tuesday for the construction of 6500 housing units
for Jews in East Jerusalem. However, Israel blamed the Palestinian
National Authority for the suicide bomb attack in Tel Aviv, which
killed four people and wounded 46 others.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has rejected the accusation and held the
hardline Israeli government responsible for the heightened
tension.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Must Bring Down Drugs' Price: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Health
Minister Nkosazana Zuma has vowed to bring down the cost of drugs
in the country, local daily Saturday Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Legislation to cut the cost of drugs is being checked by state
law advisers, and Zuma intends putting it to parliament this
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by the Department of Health show that some
medicines sell in this country for up to 4,000 percent above the
world average.
</P>
<P>
The over-expensive medicine include drugs used to treat
tapeworm infestations and against hypertension.
</P>
<P>
The price of some malaria prophylatics is 880 percent above
the global average, while drugs for bilharzia, which is endiemic
in some parts of South Africa, cost about 1,575 percent more than
the world average, the official survey said.
</P>
<P>
Zuma was quoted as saying that South Africa rated in the top
five most expensive countries in the world for medicines, while
being far from one of the top five richest countries.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that dispensers should issue the most appropriate
medicine rather than the most expensive, saying that her ministry
would not license dispensers if profit were their sole motive.
</P>
<P>
On her campaign to encourage the prescription of generic
medicines, Zuma said there seemed to be a reluctance in this
country to do so because of a belief that generics were inferior.
</P>
<P>
She said prescription of generic medicine in South Africa, at
16 percent, lagged behind that in countries such as the United
States, at 48 percent, and Britain at 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
Referring to measures to curb price of drugs, Zuma said there
should be one "exit price" for medicines, with no differences
between that charged to doctors or pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the minister also said that the government would take
measures to expand the program of immunization in a bid to improve
public health care and reduce the cost of patients.

<HEADLINE> Stamp Rush Brings Big Money to HK Post Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China
this July has set off a desperate rush for special-issue stamps,
which is expected to bring a huge amount of 700 million HK dollars
(89.74 million US dollars) to the Hong Kong Post Office.
</P>
<P>
Today's Hong Kong Standard reported that this sum is six times
more than that of the office's fiscal year 1995-96 when sales
brought in more than 113 million HK dollars (14.49 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Post Office controller Au Wai-bing was quoted as
saying that the rate of return on the Post Office's trading fund
this year would be more than 10.5 percent of its fixed net assets,
compared to its target of 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Au said the profit would improve the postal service through the
purchase of new machines and computers.
</P>
<P>
"The money could be used to subsidize the postal fee in future,
to avoid a significant fee rise," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Post Office has issued a series of special stamps
and philatelic items in relation to Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, and it also has planned to issue special stamps on
July 1 to commemorate the event.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Families of Blind, Disabled People to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will
repatriate more than 1,000 families of blind and disabled people
from Lusaka to their home villages because of insufficient
resources.
</P>
<P>
The move will see the transer of social service support for
eligible recipients from Lusaka to the districts closer to the
village resettlements, the Zambia Daily Mail today quoted
community development and social welfare deputy minister Jane
Chikwata as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Last week the government rejected a condition by the disabled
and blind that they could only be weaned off the state if they
are paid upkeep allowance of 150,000 kwacha (about 115 U.S.
dollars) each per month or offered employment.
</P>
<P>
Unemployed disabled and blind people will start registering
from next Monday to be taken to their destinations, the local
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's budgetary allocation for social service support
has been sharply reduced this year to four million kwacha (about
3,000 dollars) from seven million kwacha last year, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Chikwata had to seek police protection before she
could address the blind and disabled who accused her of delaying
settlement of their rent bills.
</P>
<P>
Chikwata said that the ministry would with effect from this
month stop paying house rent, currently pegged at 20,000 kwacha
per individual.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer maintain these people on meager resources
and this is why we want them to go to their villages to start
more productive lives there," Chikwata said.

<HEADLINE> MANILA, MILF to Discuss Ceasefire in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiators of the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
will meet tomorrow to forge a general ceasefire agreement that
will end all hostilities in the Maguindanao area, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will be held in Simuay, Maguindanao, was
confirmed by Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman for political
affairs, in Cotabato today, according to a Philippine News Agency
report.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said he and government chief negotiator Fortunato Abat
agreed to conduct the meeting to lay the groundwork of the general
ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also tackle the function of an independent
group formed earlier to monitor ceasefire violations.
</P>
<P>
The government and MILF reached a ceasefire in Buldon,
Maguindanao, in January. But on March 15-16, the two sides traded
mortar shellings in Buldon, killing 11 civilians, wounding three
government soldiers and displacing hundreds of families in the
area.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Abat called for the immediate resumption of
negotiations with MILF before the third round of peace talks
scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar failed to give details on other topics that will be
discussed at tomorrow's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF became the country's major rebel group
after the government and the Moro National Liberation Front signed
an accord for peace in Mindanao last September. The Muslim rebel
group has rejected the peace accord and is fighting for an
independent state in Mindanao, the Southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Cremation Encouraged in South Korea to Save Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 22,(Xinhua)-- Cremation has been gradually
popularized in recent years in South Korea, a country with a long
history of burying the dead.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 23 percent of the dead were cremated, according to
statistics issued recently by the Ministry of Health and Welfare.
</P>
<P>
A country of 99,000 square kilometers, South Korea has a
population of more than 45.5 million. In recent decades, the fast
increasing population and high-speed economic growth have placed
great pressure on land use and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
For instance, graves have almost taken 1,000 square kilometers,
about one percent of the country's territory, or 1.6 times of the
size of Seoul or three times of the lands occupied by the
factories nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government started to realize the seriousness
of the problem as early as the 60s and 70s and has ever since
encouraged cremation by both education and media drive. In the
past 20 years, cremation got popularized rapidly, with its rate
climbing from 7 percent in 1971 to 20.5 percent in 1994, and 22
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Now in large cities like Seoul, as high as 30 percent of the
dead are cremated and 10 percent in the mountainous areas with
smaller population.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and Welfare is also planning to raise 3
billion Korean won (one U.S. dollar is about 880 Korean won) to
build houses for the cremated remains, and modify regulations on
funeral matters to further push up cremation practice among
residents.
</P>
<P>
As an official from the Ministry emphasised:" it is necessary
to take all these measures, but it is more important for the
leaders and citizens to change their idea on the cremation."

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir praised today the efforts by the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) to stabilize the situation in his country.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan welcomes the initiative of UAE President Sheikh Zayed
Bin Sultan al-Nahyan on establishing reconciliation among
difference factions and maintaining the territorial integrity and
stability of the country," al-Bashir told reporters here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his talks with his UAE counterpart al-Nahyan
Friday focused on the initiative and that he briefed the UAE
leader on the Sudanese crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese question has three aspects, he said, namely, the
disagreement between the government and the northern opposition
forces, the conflict between the government and the southern
rebel movement and the external "aggression" by neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of a government-opposition dialogue
on the discrepancy, al-Bashir said the opposition can be divided
into two sides, the first is the political parties and the second,
the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the political parties, "both the government and
these parties are unanimous on the Islamic orientation, the
territorial integrity and the federal governance of the country,"
the Sudanese president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, the government and these parties disagree on the
issue of the multi-party system, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the rebel movement, he said that there is a peace
initiative launched by some African countries and that may evolve
into a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir, who arrived here Friday on a stopover on his way to
Islamabad, Pakistan, where he is scheduled to attend an
extraordinary summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference to
be held Sunday. He will leave here later today.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population
Fund (UNPF) has increased its funding to Uganda to 24 million US
dollars from 14 m dollars, reported the local daily " the New
Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Francois Farah, UNPF representative in Uganda was quoted as
saying that this will be for a four year program starting 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said, out of 24 m dollars, 70 percent would be spent on
strengthening reproductive health, 10 percent on advocacy and 20
percent on population development strategy and strengthing
planning in the districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the media to educate the masses on
population issues. He challenged them to stop enphasising the
population number but to strongly advocate for their quality.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan government has in recent years paid much attention to
population control, in a bid to raise the quality of life for the
majority of people in the country. The annual population growth
rate in the country has declined from high of 3.8 percent through
the 1960s to an average of 2.5 percent in recent years.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Senior Israeli and
Palestinian security officials met in Tel Aviv Friday night to
further coordinate their efforts against Islamic extremist
attacks in the wake of the suicide bomb attack in the city,
the state-run Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Israeli General Security Service (GSS) Ami
Ayalon conferred with heads of Palestinian Preventive Security
Service Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan on the current
situation Friday night. The atmosphere was described as good.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai called for renewal of contacts between
the security establishments between the two sides. Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat agreed.
</P>
<P>
The contacts had been suspended by Israel as the tension
heightened with the start of the construction of Har Homa
settlement in the Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Palestinian police had re-arrested a leader
of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) released last week.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon demanded that all Hamas members recently released
should be imprisoned again. He also called on the Palestinian
side to launch a campaign to smash what he called the
infrastructure of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the autonomous
areas.
</P>
<P>
Four people, including the bomber, were killed and 46 others
wounded in the Tel Aviv suicide bombing. The suicide bomber was
identified as a 28-year-old Hamas activist from a West Bank
village still under Israeli occupation. His name was barred from
publication by the authorities. A curfew was imposed on the
village and reporters were banned from entering the area.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bomb attack, the first of its kind since last
spring, took place on the eve of Jewish holiday Purim. Tel Aviv
police Friday night stepped up alert after intelligent warnings of
more attacks. Road blocks were set up at some key points of the
city. Security measures have also been intensified to protect
Purim celebrations which will go ahead despite the bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities imposed a total closure on
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip immediately after the suicide
attack Friday afternoon and the closure is continuing in force
today.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) has been reeling lower in the past two weeks as a
result of clear lack of buying support in the absence of local
fundamental news while the second board scaled new heights over
three consecutive days on speculative play.
</P>
<P>
This week, the benchmark Composite Index (CI) fell 29.53
points to close at 1,212.94, the broader Emas Index eased 9.30
points to 355.28 while the Industrial Index eased 48.42 points to
close at 2,275.93.
</P>
<P>
The second board was up most of the week on speculative
interest with the index scaling new highs on three consecutive
days, hitting its highest level on Wednesday at 680.25 points when
US program buying took the market to new heights.
</P>
<P>
However, as the buying was limited to some 26 million ringgit
(about 10.4 million US dollars), its impact was only felt for a
day and share prices turned easier the following two remaining
days of the week on heavy profit-taking activity.
</P>
<P>
Losers led gainers 511 to 123 with 109 other counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The week also saw two counters making its debut on the
exchange namely Widetech (M) Bhd and PNE PCB Bhd.
</P>
<P>
Among the week's 10 most active stocks were Kuala Lumpur
Industries Holdings which shed 35 sen to 4.90 ringgit on a
turnover of 72.398 million shares, Aokam Perdana up 10 sen to 6.20
ringgit (67.718 million shares traded), Pilecon dropped 40 sen to
6.00 ringgit (59.857 million shares traded), Selangor Dredging
firmed 43 sen to 2.57 ringgit (52.917 million shares traded),
Sinora added 40 sen to 17.70 ringgit (38.957 million shares
traded), Berjaya Industrial lost 42 sen to 3.64 ringgit (31.149
million shares traded), Pilecon-Engineering Bhd-Warrants gave up
24 sen to 2.37 ringgit (28.489 million shares traded), Innovest
erased 30 sen to 9.10 ringgit (27.796 million shares traded),
Pengkalen Industries Holdings Bhd jumped 80 sen to 9.80 ringgit
(27.147 million shares traded) and Trenegy lost 20 sen to 9.30
ringgit on a turnover of 25.514 million shares.
</P>
<P>
On the main board, turnover rose to 1.789 billion shares worth
11.955 billion ringgit (about 4.782 billion US dollars) against
last week's 2.160 billion shares valued at 12.485 billion ringgit
(about 4.994 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Second board volume increased to 390.047 billion shares valued
at 4.506 billion ringgit (about 1.8024 billion US dollars)
compared with 280.660 million shares worth 3.486 billion ringgit
(about 1.3944 billion US dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Off-market deals increased to 232.763 million shares valued at
2.432 billion ringgit (about 972.8 million US dollars) from
222.919 million shares worth 1.893 billion ringgit (about 757.2
million US dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that share prices in the first half of next
week would remain jittery with investors remaining on the
sidelines nervous over the outcome of the U.S. Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) meeting, which would most probably raise US
interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The local market however seems to have priced in the 25 basis
points hike, which analysts say would ultimately result in the
risk of only a slight pullback.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian National Bank's report due out on March 28 , the
analysts say, would actually determine the immediate direction of
the local stock market which is currently centering its attention
on what the Bank will do to tackle the country's growing money
supply and their target projections for Malaysia's current account
in 1997.

return a counter-attack and missed five straight top-spin attacks
to lose 15-21.

"a fully open and transparent" policy on the investigation in
the pending case of the gold trade.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Pledges Continuing Support for S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has pledged continuing support to
South Africa as the world moved into a new millenium, said a
source here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the South African Institute of International
Affairs at the University of the Witwatersrand Friday evening,
Annan said as someone whose own moral education and political
development was greatly influenced by events in South Africa, "I
pledge to provide whatever support you might wish to ask of me as
the dramatic, inspiring saga of your country continues".
</P>
<P>
Annan, accompanied by his wife Nane, was currently in the
country for a four-day visit to South Africa at the invitation of
President Nelson Mandela. This was also Annan's first visit to
Africa since his inauguration in January this year.
</P>
<P>
In his speech titled South Africa and the United Nations,
Annan said he placed great "personal and symbolic" importance on
strengthening the existing close ties between the UN and the new
democratic South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship was forged during the long struggle to
eliminate apartheid," said the UN Chief, adding the fight
embodied the struggle of all Africans, and all people, for
emancipation and liberation from colonization, oppression,
tyranny and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Describing South Africa's victory over apartheid as a sign of
hope for all humankind, Annan said the enormous economic and
social disparities created by apartheid, however, posed a major
challenge to the country's stability and long-term development.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relationship between South Africa and the UN,
Annan said the struggle against apartheid had brought the people
of South Africa into sustained, intimate and ultimately fruitful
contact with the international community.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the UN Chief stressed that South Africa had much
to offer the world community and respond in kind to the needs of
the global society just as the international community rallied
around them in their hour of need.
</P>
<P>
"The fate and future of Africa lie in Africa's hands, but the
UN has a deep and abiding commitment to the well-being of the
continent," added Annan.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Education Stressed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
pledged to made environmental education a principal subject in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by education minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye
during the World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-sponsored Zambia
Environmental Education Program (ZEEP) open day in Lusaka on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that in striving to improve living standards, people
are destroying their environment, therefore, every citizen must
have knowledge of the environment.
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye noted, "education is the most effective means
through which people can be empowered to prevent further
environmental degradation."
</P>
<P>
The sources of environmental damage are from industrial
pollution, land degradation caused by overgrazing and poor
farming methods, desertification caused by burning of bushes and
cutting of trees for charcol, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye said that his ministry is working with
non-governmental organizations like the WWF and other ministries
like environment and tourism on various environmental programs to
curb further damage to the nature.
</P>
<P>
Environmental damage is getting gravious in Zambia. It was
reported that the country loses 300,000 hectares of forests every
year, causing land degradation all over the country.

<HEADLINE> German Government Turns Tough on Tax Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The German government Friday took on
a tough stand on its tax reform plans as Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said he saw no reason to resume high-level talks with the main
opposition party Social Democrats (SPD).
</P>
<P>
Kohl rejected a SPD demand that tax reform talks be resumed at
the highest levels, agreeing only to make Finance Minister Theo
Waigel available for talks.
</P>
<P>
Since February 24, Kohl's ruling coalition and the SPD have
held two rounds of talks to seek a compromise on tax reform, an
initiative of the German government to stimulate investment, boost
domestic demand and to cut unemployment which now stands at a
post-war record high.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the SPD boycotted the third round of
negotiations, due to be conducted at working group level, in
protest against the government's plan to cut federal subsidies to
the coal-mining industry.
</P>
<P>
After the government backed down from its original plan to cut
coal subsidies under the pressure of striking coal miners, the SPD
offered to resume the talks but insisted that it should first be
conducted at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
Describing SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine's request for talks with
Kohl as "a diversionary manoeuvre," Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union party (CDU) said Friday that after the solution of the coal
subsidy crisis, there is nothing now standing in the way for
further tax talks.
</P>
<P>
"If the SPD continue to boycott the working-group-level talks,
they should shoulder the full responsibility of delaying the tax
reform," CDU General Secretary Peter Hintze said.
</P>
<P>
Under its proposed tax reform package, the government plans to
cut income taxes to 15 percent for low-wage earners and 39 percent
for people with high incomes instead of the current marginal rates
ranging from 25.9 percent to 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to government estimates, the income tax cuts, along
with other cuts in corporate tax rates, would leave a shortfall in
state revenue of 44 billion Deutsche marks (26.3 billion
U.S. dollars), which the government wants to reduce to 30 billion
marks (17.9 billion dollars) by raising the 15 percent value-added
tax (VAT) to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the SPD rejects any VAT increase and has also said that
while it backs cutting income tax for low-wage earners, it wants
to leave the 53 percent rate intact for the rich.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the SPD wants the entire tax reform package to be
implemented in 1998, instead of 1999 as favored by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government needs to strike a compromise with the SPD if the
reform plan is to survive the upper house of the German
parliament, Bundesrat, where the SPD controls a majority.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of their talks would mean that the tax plan would
begin wending its way through parliamentary committees without
prior approval from the SPD, raising the fear that politicians and
interest groups will water down the plan and diminish its ability
to increase investment and hiring.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also fear that the tax reform would be used by the
political parties as a leverage to stymie each other and thus to
promote themselves in the 1998 national election.

<HEADLINE> Italy Adopts New Decree to Create Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Italian cabinet today adopted a
decree to bring down the country's unemployment rate as required
for joining the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decree calls for the streamlining of approval procedures
for some job-creating public service and environmental protection
projects, so as to facilitate their early implementation.
</P>
<P>
It also earmarks one trillion lire (about 5.9 billion
U.S. dollars) for the construction of infrastructure works at the
country's relatively under-developed regions.
</P>
<P>
Other measures introduced include the extension of unemployment
benefit for six more months, incentives for using private fund in
repairing historic sites and local fund in housing construction.
</P>
<P>
While the average unemployment rate is 12.2 percent in Italy,
jobless people account for 21.3 percent of labor force and 55.5
percent of young adults in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Recognized as a hurdle for Italy to be among the first group of
European nations joining the EMU, the high jobless rate has
prompted the cabinet to adopt the decree for creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
Following some politicians' endorsement of the decree, trade
unions of the country have expressed their satisfaction over the
government initiative.

Corrientes in northeast Argentina with the Sao Paulo city in
Brazil, the local press quoted oil authorities as saying.

CARACAS -- Venezuelan international reserves decreased by more
than 250 million dollars during the second week of March as
compared with the same period of the previous month.
</P>
<P>
One of the factors that prompted the drop was the stabilization
of the exchange rate, which required the Central Bank to
disburse money to sustain. Another factor was the drop in the
price of Venezuelan crude oil on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Besides these factors, domestic labor conflicts have caused
foreign investors to lose confidence in bringing their capital to
Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Indian Doctor Ready for Fresh Pig-Heart Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A controversial cardiac surgeon
in India's Assam state is ready to carry out a second pig-heart
transplant after his first patient receiving such a treatment died
within one month of the transplantation in January this year, The
Indian Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
This time his patient is a 26-year old from Andhra Pradesh,
South India. The patient is expected to arrive in Guwahati, Assam,
where the transplant is supposed to be carried out, next week.
</P>
<P>
The doctor, Dhani Ram Baruah, told The Indian Express that the
patient's problem, ventricular septal defect (VSD), was detected
in March 1990, but no hospitals had been so far able to help him.
</P>
<P>
Baruah, who is facing charges for the January pig-heart
transplant and is out on bail, said the patient's heart and lung,
both of which were in irreparable condition, would have to be
replaced by a pig's organs.
</P>
<P>
He said he will seek permission from the Indian Medical Council
(IMC) and the patient will seek permission from the Guwahati High
Court for the transplant.
</P>
<P>
The court had ordered last month that Baruah will have to get
clearance from the IMC in case he wanted to carry out any further
operations.

Garuda officer said.
</P>
<P>
Arif Hartanto, head of the airline's business relations, said

<HEADLINE> First Shipment of Italian Aid Arrives in Tirana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The first consignment of the
Italian assistance for Albania's Interior Ministry arrived in
Tirana today, a spokesman for Albania's Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The shipment, as part of the European Union (EU) aid program,
included uniforms and bulletproof vests for the special police
force to be established by the Albanian Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Albania's police, along with the military, suffered heavy
losses in the armed unrest that swept the country this month after
the collapse of pyramid savings schemes in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The national reconciliation government, formed last week, has
decided to rebuild the police and set up a special police
contingent to effectively maintain the country's social order.
</P>
<P>
Bashkim Fino, prime minister of the new government, has asked
the EU to help restore order and provide food and medical relief.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy's Defense Ministry has denied persistent media
reports of impending Italian military intervention in Albania,
while the EU has indicated it will not back large-scale military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, informed sources said an operation
could begin early next week to air lift medicine and sanitary
equipment into Tirana, followed by food aid missions.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10 million U.S. dollars in basic medical
supplies and 10,000 tons of wheat flour are urgently needed. The
United Nations' food aid agency, the Rome-based World Food
Program, on Thursday sent a one-week mission to Tirana to assess
relief needs.

<HEADLINE> hke - U.S. to Send Troops to Africa for Possible Evacuation Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States has decided
to send several hundred of troops to West Africa for a possible
evacuation of U.S. citizens from Zaire, Pentagon said in a
statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Defense has directed the U.S. European
Command to deploy enabling forces, consisting of several hundred
personnel, as part of contingency planning for a possible future
evacuation from Zaire," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, this deployment does not represent a U.S. commitment
to any particular course of action, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Defense Secretary William Cohen said that U.S.
officials were monitoring the chaotic situation in Zaire day by
day, even hour by hour, to assess whether to evacuate U.S.
citizens.
</P>
<P>
A 30-member U.S. military team is in Zaire to help determine
what action might be necessary to evacuate Americans. But by the
time when the statement was released, no request for evacuation
had been made.
</P>
<P>
According to Pentagon sources, Pentagon ordered to move up to
250 men and women, primarily coming from an army airborne unit
based in Italy, as part of a "joint task force," which will be
commanded by Major General Edwin Smith.
</P>
<P>
Gabon and Congo, located to the north and west of Zaire, could
be used as staging points for any kind of evacuation, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said 35 dependents of
U.S. government employees were expected to leave Zaire by the end
of Friday.
</P>
<P>
Only seven dependents of U.S. government employees in Zaire
were expected to remain there after Friday.
</P>
<P>
Political and security situation in Zaire has become uncertain
and there is possibility for potential unrest throughout the
country as the rebels seized the key city of Kisangani over the
weekend.

<P>
SAN JOSE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican courts have made
more charges against former deputy Leonel Villalobos who was
captured on February 27 with 1.5 kilograms of cocaine bound for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Villalobos was a deputy of the Social Democratic National
Liberation Party during 1984-88 and a member of a special
parliamentary commission that investigated the influence of drug
trafficking in the country. His political career was ended when he
was charged with having relations with persons linked to drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Villalobos was arrested after denounced by Costa Rican drug
trafficker Ricardo Alem who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in
the United States, and was found guilty after 267 telephone
conversation recordings with the Alem group were analyzed.
</P>
<P>
The Special Narcotics Unit of the Public Attorney Office today
summoned 10 persons of a group which trafficked cocaine to Europe
and was linked to a cocaine manufacturing laboratory discovered
here 10 years ago.

<HEADLINE> India Moves to Improve Air Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- In order to improve air safety,
the Indian government has decided to make Airborne Collision
Avoidance System (ACAS) mandatory for all aircraft and ban the
import of aircraft without such warning mechanism, the Hindustan
Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The ACAS alerts pilots if two planes move dangerously close to
each other. In November last year, a Saudi Airline Boeing 747
collided with a Kazakh IL-76 cargo plane over India's Haryana
state, killing 350.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, no aircraft with the capacity to
carry more than 30 passengers or three tons of cargo could operate
in the country without ACAS after December 31, 1998. Such aircraft
cannot be imported without ACAS after December 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
ACAS would be mandatory for even aircraft with capacity lower
than 30 passengers or payload of three tons after December 31,
2003. Such planes can not be imported without ACAS after December
31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual dates of implementation of the decision
would be finalized next month after consultations with civil
aviation authorities of neighboring countries, domestic scheduled
air taxi operators and international scheduled operators who have
operations in India.
</P>
<P>
According to Indian Civil Aviation Minister C.M. Ibrahim,
airlines have already been informed of installation of ACAS for
planes having a seating capacity of more than 30 passengers. The
current decision to ban the import of aircraft without ACAS has
also been approved by the International Civil Aviation
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia, Chile Start Political, Economic Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Bolivia and
Chile, which have had their diplomatic ties suspended for 18
years, started a round of political and economic talks today.
</P>
<P>
The talks, presided over by Chile's Vice Minister of Foreign
Relations Mariano Fernancez and his Bolivian counterpart Jaime
Aparicio, took place in Chile's northern city Iquique.
</P>
<P>
Discussions there will focus on the two neighboring countries'
cooperation in transport, customs, mining and other fields, said
sources close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Other topics on the agenda include the settlement of a dispute
over the use of the Silala River, which starts in Bolivia and runs
through Chile.
</P>
<P>
Chile has agreed to pay 6 million U.S. dollars to Bolivia for
the use of the river, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Chile and Bolivia suspended their diplomatic relations in 1978
over the issue of Bolivia's access to the Pacific Ocean, which
Bolivia lost in defeat in the Pacific War between 1879 and 1883.
</P>
<P>
However, the two countries have maintained consular, economic,
and commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
Prospects of renewed diplomatic relations grew after 1993, when
the two countries concluded a comprehensive trade agreement and a
number of cooperation treaties, and started negotiations on border
demarcation, communications and anti-drug trafficking efforts.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chile exported to Bolivia 200 million dollars worth
of products, and imported from the neighboring country 40 million
dollars of goods.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economic Growth Expected to Go Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economic growth rate
will continue to decline unless the government makes serious
changes in its export and import policies immediately, an
economist said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anwar Nasution, a famous economist of the University of
Indonesia said here Friday that the country's non-oil and gas
exports had been stagnant and that the government should issue
another deregulatory package in the trade sector.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for National Development Planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said on Thursday the country registered a 7.82
percent growth rate last year.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the figure was satisfying although it was lower
than the revised growth rate of 8.21 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Anwar predicted that this year's economic growth will drop from
last year's, unless the government issues proper policies
immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should go ahead with its plan to
deregulate both the domestic investment and trade sectors to
attract more domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
He note that illegal levies and complicated and lengthy
bureaucracy in the trade sector had an adverse impact on the
competitive edge of the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
However, Ginandjar said, "the slowing down of economic growth
was in line with the cooling down of the economy as a result of
the decrease in domestic demand last year."
</P>
<P>
The growth of household consumption dropped to 9.2 percent last
year compared to 9.73 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Capital development slowed down to 12.17 percent last year as
compared to 13.96 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the agriculture sector's contribution to last
year's growth decreased to 16.3 percent from 17.16 percent in
1995, while the industrial sector's contribution totaled 25.16
percent, and that of general services 41.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
On Indonesia's per capita income, Ginandjar said the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) has increased from 1,039 US dollars
in 1995 to 1,140 dollars in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- David Reid, the only
U.S. boxer to win an Olympic gold medal in Atlanta, opened his pro
career with a solid victory over Sam Calderon in Atlantic city on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to open against somebody who wants to fight," Reid
had said of why he picked Sam Calderon, who had a 10-0 record, as
his first pro opponent.
</P>
<P>
29-year-old Calderon came to fight but Reid had too much power
and speed and scored a unanimous four-round decision Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Reid knocked down Calderon with a right hand-left hook 46
seconds into the fight. Calderon got up at four and was hurt again
by a right to the head at 1:09.
</P>
<P>
Reid's pro debut was delayed by operations to realign his left
eyeball and correct a droopy eyelid.
</P>
<P>
23-year-old Reid plans to campaign as a junior middleweight,
which has a 70-kilogram limit.

DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The two-day national council
session of Bangladesh's ruling Awami (people's) League, scheduled
for March 28 and 29, has been deferred once again and shifted to
May 7 and 8, according to a press release of the party.
</P>
<P>
The Working Committee, the AL's policy-making body, in a

Addressing the meeting of the Working Committee, Sheikh Hasina
asked her party leaders to remain vigilant against the subversive
activities across the country, meeting sources said.
</P>
<P>
Since the holding of the last party council in September, 1992,

<HEADLINE> Banana Exports Drop in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Panama's banana exports
dropped by 3.4 percent during the first two months of this year,
compared with the same period of 1996, an official of the Panama's
Commerce and Industry Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Banana exports declined from 1996's 5.22 million boxes to the
present 5.04 million boxes, Euclides Diaz, director in charge of
banana matters in the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In January, exports increased by 400,000 boxes, but in February
it went down by half a million because of a cold spell.
</P>
<P>
Total banana exports in 1996 was 36 million boxes, a reduction
of six million boxes or 30 million U.S. dollars in revenue from
1995.
</P>
<P>
Banana industry makes up for three percent of Panama's gross
domestic product and 32.1 percent of its total exports, producing
some 16,000 jobs, Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
Panama used to sell 50 percent of its banana exports to
Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. But it drops to 19 percent
now.

<HEADLINE> One-Third Married Women in Nepal Denied Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one-third of married
women in Nepal still have no access to family planning programs
though they do not want more children, according to a national
survey on family planning.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Family Health Survey, based on an analysis of
interviews with over 8,000 married women across the country, was
released at a seminar here Friday to disseminate the findings to
policy makers and family planning workers.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that on average a married woman in Nepal has
more than four children, and five-child families are common in the
country's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
If needs for family planning are to be meted out, the
contraceptive prevalence rate will double from the current 29
percent to 60 percent among married women in the country, the
survey report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, many Nepali women die from
pregnancy-related causes every year and maternal deaths accounted
for 27 percent of all deaths of women aged between 15 and 49
during the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that a majority of Nepali women
consider three or less to be an ideal number of children,
indicating that a small family size norm has become widespread in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister R. K. Mainali said at the seminar that the
government laid emphasis on reducing population growth by making
high-quality family planning services easily accessible to
couples.

<HEADLINE> Kuchma: Ukraine Takes Steps Toward West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's foreign policies have
taken positive steps towards the West in 1996, but problems with
Russia remained thorny, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said
today in his State of the Union Message to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has given up its nuclear weapons ahead of schedule and
formed strategic partnership with the United States, Kuchma said.
And relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
have become an important factor in maintaining Europe's security.
</P>
<P>
"To enhance integration with Europe and trans-Atlantic
organizations, Ukraine has been gradually promoting ties with the
European Union, NATO, the Western European Union and organizations
in Central Europe," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Ukraine last year failed to sign political
treaties with Russia, to promote bilateral trade based on equality
and mutual respect and to start negotiations on border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma singled out the issue of the Black Sea Fleet and its
home base of Sevastopol as a major obstacle to the normalization
of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Russia have long been at loggerheads over the
division of the Black Sea Fleet, a heritage of the former Soviet
Union, and Russia's use of the the military port of Sevastopol, a
naval base on the Crimea peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Major targets of Ukraine's foreign policies in 1997 are to
protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity and to
strengthen relations with Europe, Kuchma said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Kuchma Blames Economic Crisis on Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
today acknowledged the mistakes leading to an economic crisis and
pinned the hope of an economic upturn on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Union Message to the parliament, Kuchma
said the national economy is still struggling in the depth of
crisis and he would not shrug off his responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
However, the president noted, there was nothing wrong with his
economic policies and the mistakes in implementing the policies
should be responsible for the deterioration of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The parliament and provincial governments should also be
blamed, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a way out, Kuchma suggested that the hope to revive the
ailing economy lies in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
But while there are few big domestic investors, Ukraine takes
in the least foreign investment among all its East European
neighbors and former Soviet republics, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Policies to attract foreign investment have been chained by
endless artificial obstacles," he said, adding that "the major
obstacle is corruption in state organizations."
</P>
<P>
Although foreign businessmen have proposed to pour in large
investment to help Ukraine's industry, the cabinet has failed to
map out any policy to attract their investment in the past three
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the parliament to revise land laws in favor
of foreign investors, and allow foreign businessmen to invest in
Ukraine's agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The president, government and parliament should be cooperative
partners in constructing the nation, he said. "We can have
different political opinions, but we should unite together for the
sake of our national interests."

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Behind James Lilley's Anti-China Hysteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Some pro-Taiwan authorities
forces in the U.S. have launched an adverse current against China,
capitalizing on rumors fabricated by some judicial and
intelligence officials with the U.S. government that China was
involved in the "political donation" dispute and attempted to "buy
policy influence."
</P>
<P>
James Lilley, a former U.S. ambassador to China, is a
particularly active one stirring up the anti-China current. He
stood out as one of the leading rumor-mongers. In an article
published in the "Washington Times" on March 17, he wilfully
heaped slanders upon the Chinese government, saying it had poured
a huge sum of money into the U.S. election, and undertaken
economic espionage activities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official viciously attacked some of China's diplomats
working in the U.S. by name, and even clamored to give China a
"lesson."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has strongly criticized the
ill-motivated anti-China words as groundless. But James Lilley,
who is following the tenet that rumors, if repeated, might become
truth, has picked on the anti-China rubbish.
</P>
<P>
Lilley's disgusting performance cannot but arouse righteous
indignation among people who care for and support the development
of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Why is James Lilley so hostile towards China and the Chinese

<HEADLINE> Russian Prime Minister Prioritizes Wage Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin singled out today the crisis in wage and pension
arrears as a priority task for his reorganized government.
</P>
<P>
One of the main tasks now, he told the State Duma, or the lower
house of parliament, is "to restore order in paying wages and
pensions and normalizing the system of payments."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also stressed the need to push forward housing and
public welfare reforms, saying: "It will be difficult, it will be
painful but we cannot let fortunes leak into sewage."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the welfare reform would take place in stages
and would include security measures for the poor.
</P>
<P>
Another task of the government is to deal with the monopoly in
the natural gas, electricity and rail transport sectors. But he
noted that Russia's energy sector would remain in state control.
</P>
<P>
On the government reshuffle, Chernomyrdin said the personnel
change would end up early next week and would not include the
"power ministers" -- defense, interior and the head of the Federal
Security Service.
</P>
<P>
He added that the heads of ministries and departments having
not been reorganized will keep on working on their posts, while
new nominations will be discussed only for vacancies.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin explained that the personnel and structural
changes in the government were called for by new tasks of economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
They were prompted by the need to concentrate efforts on
several sets of problems, including financial and budget issues,
timely payment of salaries and allowances, normalization of all
aspects of industrial development, regional policy and integration
in the Commonwealth of Independent States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin tried to dispel deputies' worry about the possible
merging of the ministry of economics with the ministry of industry
and the State Committee for Defense Industries.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the intention to form "an efficient commission on
defense industries" within the framework of the centralized
ministry of economics, which would "keep all the valuable
personnel of the reorganized ministry."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fate of the ministry of industry, Chernomyrdin
said "there should not be intermediaries between those who form
the economic policy and the private producers that make 93 percent
of all enterprises."

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Behind James Lilley's Anti-China Hysteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Some pro-Taiwan authorities
forces in the U.S. have launched an adverse current against China,
capitalizing on rumors fabricated by some judicial and
intelligence officials with the U.S. government that China was
involved in the "political donation" dispute and attempted to "buy
policy influence."
</P>
<P>
James Lilley, a former U.S. ambassador to China, is a
particularly active one stirring up the anti-China current. He
stood out as one of the leading rumor-mongers. In an article
published in the "Washington Times" on March 17, he wilfully
heaped slanders upon the Chinese government, saying it had poured
a huge sum of money into the U.S. election, and undertaken
economic espionage activities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official viciously attacked some of China's diplomats
working in the U.S. by name, and even clamored to give China a
"lesson."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has strongly criticized the
ill-motivated anti-China words as groundless. But James Lilley,
who is following the tenet that rumors, if repeated, might become
truth, has picked on the anti-China rubbish.
</P>
<P>
Lilley's disgusting performance cannot but arouse righteous
indignation among people who care for and support the development
of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Why is James Lilley so hostile towards China and the Chinese
people? We can get the answer from a glimpse of his past. Lilley,
now director of the Institute for Global Chinese Affairs at the
University of Maryland, used to be in close contact with the
Taiwan authorities during his stay there.
</P>
<P>
Lilley was the U.S. ambassador to China in the late 1980s, and
normally he should do something conducive to the improvement of
Sino-U.S. relations.

and masterminds Taiwan's scheme to return to the international
arena. But his moves are despised by anyone responsible and
concerned about the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
It is no coincidence that James Lilley rushed out into the open
at this moment and fell into an anti-China hysteria. Behind, there
is profound political background.
</P>
<P>
As the initiator of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, China always respects sovereignty of other countries
and has never interfered with other nations' internal
affairs. China resolutely opposes any attempts to poke nose into
other nations' domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Only the Taiwan authorities, James Lilley and his like are
"masters" of money diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
It is still clearly remembered that as early as in the 1950s,
the Taiwan authorities spared no money to bribe U.S. congressmen
and politicians to form the "China Lobby."
</P>
<P>
After the establishment of diplomatic relationship between
China and the United States, they refused to face up to the fact
of the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations and poured more money
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
With the money, they lured a handful of people to advertise
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in Washington, making the
"Taiwan Lobby" a "champion" in the United States capital.
</P>
<P>
It has been already an open secret in Washington that James
Lilley himself is one of the politicians heavily bribed by the
Taiwan authorities into barking for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, it was exposed that the Taiwan authorities has
been carrying on money politics in the United States.
</P>
<P>
To cover it up, some people were too impatient to try to lead
public attention to the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
James Lilley is a stereotype of these people whose groundless
attacks on China not only aim to defame the image of China, to
poison the atmosphere of Sino-U.S. relations, but also to cover
their scandalous business with the Taiwan authorities.

to decide in the basic interests of two countries, and hence it is
impossible for any anti-China force to thwart it.

GUIYANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
province, an economically underdeveloped area in the country, has
listed more than 1,100 projects for overseas investors this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the local government, the province will make the
best use of the chance created by the opening of the Longdongbao
Airport the coming May to launch a series of fairs and tourism
activities.
</P>
<P>
The 1,100 projects cover a wide range of sectors, such as
tourism and real estate, as well as energy, raw materials and
processing sectors.
</P>
<P>
A group of firms with poor management are also selected for
reshaping.
</P>
<P>
The province, with abundant natural resouces, has a great
potential for development with investment from domestic and
overseas, said the local government.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of transport and telecommunications
facilities, the province has seen increasing arrivals of business
people from all over the world. So far, investors from more than
30 countries and regions have come to the province to set up more
than 1,000 foreign-funded firms with a total investment of more
than two billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Finds High-Grade Cobalt Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China, for the first time,
discovered a dressable independent high-grade cobalt mine in its
Jiangxi province.
</P>
<P>
The mine, with average ore grade five times of the mining
standard, was found by the Jiangxi Geological Prospecting Bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, the mine, with a controllable reserve
of 2,000 tons, is expected to become a medium one.
</P>
<P>
It also says that the mine is easy to develop because of the
shallow ore body.
</P>
<P>
Cobalt is in short supply in China. Though taking a lead in the
world in the respect of Cobalt reserve, China lacks high-grade and
independent cobalt mines. Most Cobalt mines are associated with
other minerals and of low-graded, which make them difficult to
develop, says the bureau.

BANGKOK, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai border patrol police (BPP)

theft gang was planning to smuggle stolen vehicles into Cambodia.

At about 2 a.m. two cars with seven armed men on board sped
past. They refused to stop when asked to by police officers and
instead opened fire with AK-47 assault rifles.

The gun fight lasted about half an hour before the gang
retreated into Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Potter Believes Civilization Started With Pottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Human civilization started with
pottery-making, says a potter whose works can be seen in the
prestigious Palace Museum in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The museum, which stopped its modern pottery collecting 100
years ago, made an exception in the case of Xing Liangkun, when it
showed 11 of his pieces.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Xing, who comes from northeast China's Liaoning
province, says that many cultures originated with
pottery-making. Written language, for example, developed from
symbols inscribed on pottery to mark its maker, says Xing, and
that ownership of pottery probably served as a basis for the
formation of families and tribes.
</P>
<P>
One person who agrees with Xing on this point is Li Huibin, a
research fellow at the Palace Museum and a leading historian of
pottery, who notes that pottery-making marked the demarcation line
between savage and civilized eras.
</P>
<P>
He says that this idea can be found in the works of Friedrich
Engels, co-founder of scientific socialism. "Where there was
civilization, there was pottery," Li says.
</P>
<P>
A widely held view is that pottery's prototype was probably a
woven water container, such as a basket, whose holes were stopped
up by clay, on reason, perhaps, why a basket pattern was popular
in early pottery.
</P>
<P>
Pottery was developed when early human beings found that clay
that was exposed to fire became very hard after a rainfall and an
attempt was made to bake clay for containers.
</P>
<P>
The earliest pottery in China dates back nearly 10,000
years. It is roughly-made red pottery that was found in Zhengxing
in central China's Henan Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Friday that Pakistan would further cement
Pak-Iran relations and boost up bilateral economic co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made the remarks when he met visiting Iranian Foreign
Minister Akbar Velayati who arrived Friday on an official visit to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations were particularly focused on during the

The two sides also emphasized the need for closer co-operation
within the framework of the Organization of Islamic Conference
(OIC) and Economic Co-operation Organization (ECO).
</P>
<P>
And the two sides further resolved to co-operate on the Afghan
issue.
</P>
<P>
Velayati delivered a written invitation from Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani to Sharif to participate in the eighth regular
OIC summit conference to be held in Tehran in December 1997.
</P>
<P>

mandate he received in the February 3 general elections.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Preparing for PATA Chapter Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
metropolis, is preparing for the 97 Chapter Conference of the
Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) to be held in Shanghai
between April 16 and 18.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1952, PATA is a non-governmental tourism
organization with 77 chapters composed of over 18,000 government
institutions and enterprises from all over the world as their
members.
</P>
<P>
The China National Tourism Administration joined PATA in 1993,
and 35 other Chinese agencies, including tourism bureaus from
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and China International Travel
Service, followed suit later.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Tourism Bureau applied for hosting the PATA
chapter conference and got the approval from PATA in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To be well prepared for the event, a preparatory committee
headed by Shanghai's deputy mayor Gong Xueping was set up.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 130 representatives from 25 countries and regions
have confirmed to attend the conference.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Makes Progress in Urbanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Dachen is a small town of 2,000
permanent residents in Yiwu City, East China's Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
But the town is home to 450 garment factories where more than
12,000 people from outside Dachen make 400,000 pieces of shirts
daily. The shirts are sold on domestic and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Dachen is just one of 965 small towns Zhejiang has built so
far. These small towns have a combined population of 14 million,
accounting for one third of the province's total, according to
local sources.
</P>
<P>
East China leads the country in the development of rural and
township industry. The small towns collect 60 percent of the
province's total number of workers working with rural and township
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
These small towns have all constructed industrial zones
consisting of factories, residential quarters built in a planned
way, and have also built many stores of general merchandise,
banks, posts and telecommunications offices, hotels, farmers'
markets, cinemas, karaoke dance halls, and teahouses featuring
local characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Like urbanites in big cities, old people here go to farmers'
markets to buy fresh vegetables or have a cup of tea in nearby tea
houses in the morning, while young people bike to work in
factories.
</P>
<P>
Night life is no longer a "privilege" for residents of big
cities and here cinemas, karaoke dance halls, and eateries are
doing the same bustling business as their counterparts in big
cities.
</P>
<P>
Longgang Town of Cangnan county, dubbed as "the first town of
Chinese farmers", generated 1.5 billion yuan of gross domestic
product (GDP) and did 2.6 billion yuan of commodity transactions
on markets last year. The per capita income of the town amounted
to 6,200 yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the town's 18 residential quarters and farmers of
12 administrative villages under it have become urbanites under a
unified household registration system since late last year, which
is considered as a decisive step toward industrialization and
urbanization of rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, Canada, U.S. to Speed up Tariff Reductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Mexico, Canada and the United
States have agreed to accelerate the reduction or elimination of
tariffs for a series of products contemplated in the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The commerce ministers of the three countries announced the
decision during the 4th annual meeting of the NAFTA Commission,
which ended in Washington on Thursday, according to a news
dispatch received in this Mexico capital today.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to conclude the first round of tariff reductions
and apply new tariffs for about 50 categories of products starting
from June 1 this year, earlier than what the NAFTA agreement
initially established.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also decided to start negotiations on the second
round of tariff reductions among NAFTA countries on May 1 and end
the talks before December 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
To provide technical support to the free trade commission, a
secretariat will be set up in Mexico City in September, they said.
</P>
<P>
During the annual meeting, the top trade officials also
discussed cross-border transport services, telecommunications
standards in Mexico and labor and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the NAFTA agreement in 1994, trade
among the three countries has increased by 45 percent from 300
billion U.S. dollars in 1993 to 400 billion dollars in 1996.

BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Defending men's team
champion China will have few serious rivals in its group
competition at the World Table Tennis Championships to be held in
Manchester, London, from April 24 to May 5.
</P>
<P>
China is bundled with Yugoslavia, Italy, Croatia, Chinese
Taipei and Slovenia in Group A, according to the draw made in
March 19.
</P>
<P>
To top the group won't be a problem for China. Croatia,
expected to be led by European top player Zoran Primorac, is the
best of the rest of group. However, the depth of the Croatian
team could hardly match that of the star-studded Chinese squad.
</P>
<P>
Group B has 1995 world championships runner-up Sweden, Belgium,
Austria, Romania, Belarus and Slovakia, while Group C includes
South Korea, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, Hong Kong and
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
In the women's team draw, defending champion China, Japan,
Russia, Belgium, Canada, Australia are in Group A and South Korea
is in Group B with Hungary, England, Lithuania, Ukraine and

<HEADLINE> Birthplace of Household Contract System Seeks Cooperation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province, which led China's
use of the rural household contract responsibility system two
decades ago, has seen rapid growth of voluntary co-operatives and
other profesional economic bodies in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To date, the number of such corporatives and economic bodies in
 Anhui, east China, has grown to 3,000 which cover a wide range of
activities like cultivation of grain, vegetables and fruits,
aqua-culture, and livestock farming and processing. More than one
million farmers have voluntarily joined economic cooperatives and
other economic bodies in various trades.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for a single family to survive all by itself
in fierce market competition. We must combine our efforts," said
Chen Donghai, president of the largest peanut association in Anhui.
</P>
<P>
"I used to suffer setbacks in peanut growing like many other
single-handed fellow villagers due to the lack of market
information," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Chen got several hundred people in his own and
neighbouring townships to launch a peanut association which
unified seed supply, field management and peanut sales. At the
year end, each member earned more than 1,000 yuan from peanut
production.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to make use of modern agronomy to achieve common
prosperity," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
People are prone to seek allies with a pillar industry as the
backbone. For instance, many rural households in Shexian county
joined an association featuring the cultivation of pearl orchids,
a key ingredient for making essence. The association helped its
members to raise product quality and output, promote sales and set
up a pearl orchid processing plant.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we worked on our own. A dull market and excessive
supply in 1993 compelled us to dump 100,000 kg of flowers into a
local river," a member said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Another form of cooperation is to combine production
resources. Some 200 farmers in Yonggu Township built a collective
farm on their contracted plots.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation has raised the per unit output by 30 percent
compared to plots cultivated by an individual family," a farm
member said.
</P>
<P>
"Unified supply saved me a lot of worry and labor," another
added.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation was entirely voluntary, said Wang Zhaoyao,
vice governor of Anhui, reiterating that the existing government
policy of the household contract responsibility system will remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
An agricultural expert said these economic organizations had
linked individual farm households closely with market operation
and paved the way for the integrated development of agriculture,
industry and trade, described by Deng Xiaoping as the "second
great leap" in rural economic development.
</P>
<P>
China has made great progress in implementing the household
contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to the
household in rural areas, deemed as the "first great leap".
</P>
<P>
The new type economic cooperation will facilitate intensive and
large scale farming and speed up the process of agricultural
modernization in China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that 70 percent of the farmland in Anhui are
being cultivated by farm machinery. The acreage of rice fields
applying dry farming and sparsely-planted technique expanded by
866,600 ha last year, 3.5 times of the previous year's amount.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that economic corporations in various forms have
sprung up in many other Chinese provinces.

<P>
TIANJIN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The total income volume in the
hi-tech park in Tianjin, the largest port city in north China,
grew by 40.5 percent in 1996 from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The national-level hi-tech industrial park, set up in 1991,
covers an area of 21.85 sq km. There are now over 2,700
enterprises in the park, more than 300 of which are
foreign-funded, with a total investment of two billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Continued technical upgrading is an important reason for the
rapid economic development of the industrial park, members of the
park management committee say.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 hi-tech commodities are produced in the park, in
electronics, information science, photo-electronics,
bio-engineering, new materials, and new energy resources, and 22
of them have sales worth more than ten million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
The hi-tech industrial park has become a research base for the
city, with 75 percent of the city's scientific research programs
that were approved by the State Science and Technology Commission
last year carried out in the park.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and overseas entrepreneurs are welcome in the
industrial park and are given preferential treatment in services,
land use, and tax payment, officials with the management committee
say.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Former world No. 1 Monica
Seles of the United States had to go the distance in her opening
match at the WTA Lipton tennis tournament in Key Biscayne,
Florida, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Seles, playing her first match since November because of a
broken finger, beat 45th-ranked Naoko Sawamatsu of Japan 6-3, 2-6,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
Seles struggled early but recovered to win the first set. Then
the Japanese broke Seles in the second, fourth and eight games to
pull even.
</P>
<P>
The former world top player broke Sawamatsu in the first and
third games and served out to win. She is to face fellow American
Amy Frazier or Germany's Barbara Rittner.
</P>
<P>
World No. 2 Martina Hingis also struggled in her 3-6, 6-3, 6-2
victory over 59th-ranked Patricia Hy-Boulais of Canada in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Swiss girl, unbeaten so far this year and
cruising at the world No. 1 ranking, has extended her winning
streak to 24 matches.
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf, who won the past three Lipton titles, is not
playing this year because of a knee injury and she is not expected
to return until next month's Hamburg event.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Hingis is certain to take over from Graf as world
top player before the end of this month, no matter how she plays
in the Lipton tournament.
</P>
<P>
Hingis now takes on either 16-year-old American Venus Williams
or former teenage star Jennifer Capriati.

</P>
<P>
Maskhadov was quoted today by an Itar-Tass news agency report
as saying that the formal appointment would be made after the

</P>
<P>
Movladi Udugov, Akhmed Zakayev, Kazbeck Makhashev and

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- For the second time in two
weeks, the United States on Friday vetoed a U.N. Security Council
draft resolution calling upon Israel to call off its plan to build
6,500 Jewish housing units in Jabal Abu Ghneim, east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen members voted in favor of the draft resolution which
was sponsored by the Arab countries. The United States cast the
lone negative vote. Costa Rica, a non-permanent member of the
council, abstained.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Al-Kidwa, the permanent observer of Palestine to the
United Nations, harshly criticized Washington for vetoing the
draft in the aftermath of Israel's actual commencement of the
building of the new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to accept that this veto has been cast to
protect the peace process," he said in the council meeting,
referring to the American aguement that the council will add to
existing tensions in the region by approving the draft.
</P>
<P>
"The bitter reality is that this veto has been cast to shield
Israel from the will of the international community and to exempt
Israel from the provisions of international law and the Charter of
the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations
Wang Xuexian said that at present circumstances it is necessary
for the council to send Israeli government a clear and unequivocal
message to call upon it to cease immediately the settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
"Despite repeated appeal of the international community, Israel
persisted in carrying out its plan on the new Jewish settlement in
east Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This will undoubtedly create obstacles for the ongoing
negotiations between Israel and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the Israeli government again to cease immediately
its settlement activities in east Jerusalem," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Enter World Of Computers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Computers have just discovered
another potential market in China's rural areas, as farmers come
around to thinking that, yes, this "lump of iron" can in fact help
them have better harvests.
</P>
<P>
In the courtyard of Li Hanqun's place in Mengcheng county in
east China's Anhui province, a dozen farmers are standing around
asking a barrage of questions about how to deal with hard soil or
how much fertilizer to apply, as spring farming season arrives.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is a farmer himself, presses a few keys on his personal
computer and answers to their questions appear on the screen in
seconds, by tapping into a system installed by agronomists.
</P>
<P>
At first, Li was skeptical about the "lump of iron", as he
called it, when a research fellow with the Hefei Computer
Institute came around a few years ago to introduce his system. "If
this toy knows farming, then what do we farmers do?" Li very
sensibly asked, shrugging off the suggestion that his land needed
only 600 kilograms of nitrogen fertilizer per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he went ahead and put on 1,500 kilograms -- and got a
painful lesson when he had a much lower wheat output than other
households.
</P>
<P>
So, he closely followed the program spit out by the computer in
1993 -- and doubled his output to 6,000 kilograms per hectare. He
was so amazed that he went out and bought a computer on his own,
and is now so crazy about it that he lectures other farmers on it.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Fanlun, the system's designer, is a staunch advocate of
computerized agro-science. "Farmers called me a fortune-teller at
first, but now they call me 'land doctor'," he says. He has
developed more than 40 different agronomy systems over the past 10
years, and his computerized agro-science technology is said to
cover 4.7 million ha, and has helped farmers add more than two
billion kilograms of grain and 1.9 billion yuan in output value.
</P>
<P>
Li was not the only skeptic when it came to applying advanced
technology in backward areas. But, successful use of the
agronomist's system in Yunnan province has removed doubts.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaolan, who lives in the poor Lahu Autonomous County,
used to get 350 kilograms of corn from her half ha of land, but
now gets 1,750 kilograms from the same tract.
</P>
<P>
The county had increases of from 80 to 400 percent in corn
output in its experimental fields, assisted by computer experts in
1992, compared with those planted using traditional ways.
</P>
<P>
The system is user-friendly and can be understood by farmers
after a brief training period. It has even become fashionable in
some remote counties and has become a God of Wealth in some
farmers' eyes. "Now farmers are very responsive to high
technology," Xiong Fanlun says.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Enter World Of Computers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A profound change is taking place in China's agriculture thanks
to computers and biology and other technology. Liu Jiang, China's
Agriculture Minister, attributes last year's record grain output
of 480 billion kilograms largely to scientific advances, which he
says contributed 38 percent to the growth, which was five
percentage points higher than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
That figure is expected to climb to 50 percent by the end of
the century, close to that in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese agronomists have developed over 1,500 new strains since
1985, and major crops have been replaced by improved strains
across the country, according to the State Science and Technology
Commission.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), improved
strains increased China's per-unit grain yield by an average of 8
percent, covering about 117 million ha. New grain increases were
45.93 billion kilograms, adding 73.23 billion yuan to the economy.
</P>
<P>
China leads the world in hybrid rice development. Yuan
Longping, an agronomist, has long been called the father of hybrid
rice, and his successes are said to have blazed a trail of grain
production in China.
</P>
<P>
China faces possiblel grain shortages as its population
grows. Yuan's new strains have been widely accepted in rural
areas, and used on 160 million ha, adding 240 billion kilograms of
rice over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Now he is at the head of a select committee working on a newer
hybrid rice strain, which large-scale use in Hunan and Anhui
provinces has shown to have great potential by adding an averaged
of 10 percent in per-unit rice yield. This means another 10
billion kilograms of rice if the new strain is used on 6.66
million ha by the end of the century, a move that could halt the
fluctuations in south China's rice production.
</P>
<P>
Standardized advanced growing techniques have been applied, and
have added 25 percentage points to the country's multiple cropping
index, the equivalent of adding some 26 million ha of farmland.
Improved production conditions make it possible for more than half
the farmland to be cultivated by machines.
</P>
<P>
The minister of agriculture says that agriculture departments
at all levels will give top priority to increasing the use of
agro-science and importing 1,000 international agricutural
techniques in the next five years, in an effort to promote China's
agricultural modernization. In all this computers have their
role.  enditem

<HEADLINE> China's First BOT Water Plant Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China's first water plant
officially approved through BOT (build, operate adnd transfer)
channel will start assessing potential bidders' credentials in
April or May.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission gave the BOT nod in January to
China's second phase of the No. 6 Water Plant in Chengdu, Sichuan
province, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Project developers will be chosen among foreign investors via
international bidding.
</P>
<P>
The water plant is designed to supply 400,000 tons of tap water
daily, with 27-kilometer-long pipelines and facilities able to
take in 800,000 tons of water and purify 400,000 tons of water
daily.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent tap water shortfall of 200,000-300,000 tons
a day in Chengdu, the capital of Chian's most populous province.
</P>
<P>
The daily estimated the plant will cost a bit more than one
billion yuan and about two and a half years to build.
</P>
<P>
China has moved since last year to pipe more foreign capital
into its infrastructure by stepping up BOT applications in the
energy, communications and urban water supply sectors on a trial
basis.
</P>
<P>
So far, five candidate projects have been chosen and two of
them are still waiting for final approval by the State Council,
said the paper.

<HEADLINE> Bargor Street Becoming Tibet's Major Business Center (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Bargor Street, which snakes its way
around the Johkang Monastery in Lhasa, has become the most
important business center in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The street took its shape in the seventh century when the
Johkang Monastery was built during the reign of the Tibetan Tubo
ruler Songtsan Gambo.
</P>
<P>
He married Wencheng, a princess from a Tang Dynasty (618-907)
imperial family, and it is said that the site of the monastery was
chosen by her. There is a statue of Sakyamuni, the founder of
Buddhism, inside the temple.
</P>
<P>
Bargor Street became a sacred place for Tibetan Buddhists, and
every day, about 50,000 people from all over, follow it around the
Johkang, reciting Buddhist scriptures to show their piety. During
religious festivals, the number of people is even bigger.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics from the local industrial and commercial
administration show that there are 1,053 businesses of various
kinds along the 1,113 meter street, about one per meter. The daily
business volume is more than 330,000 yuan (39,700 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
There are also hundreds of stores in the 35 streets radiating
out from Bargor Street in the urban area.
</P>
<P>
The incredible array of goods includes daily necessities,
tourist souvenirs, religious items, clothing, perfume, and other
commodities, which are produced in Tibet and other parts of China,
and in the countries bordering Tibet: India, Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, Bargor Street has become a window of Tibet's opening
to the outside world," said Lobsang Gyaincain, director of the
Lhasa Industrial and Commercial Bureau. "The market economy has
brought prosperity to Lhasa."

There are 200,000 people in Lhasa, more than 20,000 of whom are
engaged in commerce or service trades, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsongje has been selling Tibetan jewelry on Bargor Street for
several years. She said that many tourists, particularly foreign
tourists, like her jewelry very much. After so many years of
business, she is proud to announce that she can make a deal with
foreigners in English.
</P>
<P>
In addition to native Lhasa residents, many business people
come from Gansu, Qinghai, Zhejiang, and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Hada (a strip of silk fabric) made in a silk plant in Chengdu,
the capital of Sichuan Province, is very popular along the
street. In front of the gate to the Johkang Monastery, there are a
dozen stands selling hada, which are often used to present to
Buddhists or to someone one respects.
</P>
<P>
"Each day we have to come here before daybreak, because people
will come and visit the monastery from early in the morning," one
stand owner named Li said, explaining that he can sell as many as
20 hada on religious days.
</P>
<P>
Li rents living space from a Lhasa resident. "We are on good
terms, and the rent is not too high," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the businessmen, some come from Nepal, like 55-year-old
Bulga, who has been in Lhasa for years. "Now competition is
fierce," he says, "but I still like to do business here. Bargor
Street is my second home, and I'm living a harmonious life with my
neighbors."

<HEADLINE> IAAF Drops Four Years Ban in Some Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 21 (Xinhua) -- World track and field ruling body
IAAF has decided to accept two-year drug bans in countries which
refuse to apply four-year penalties on steroid use.
</P>
<P>
The Council of the International Amateur Athletic Federation
said in Turin on Friday that it would rather reduce the ban to two
years in these countries than risk costly law suits.
</P>
<P>
Civil courts in several countries, especially in Europe, have
ruled that four-year bans are excessive and infringe on an
individual's right to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
"The current situation creates legal and judicial problems,"
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said. "The main reason was the
(court) cases and the millions of dollars they cost. This decision
recognizes exceptional circumstances in some countries and so
allows for reinstatements."
</P>
<P>
Reineri said the countries which do not accept four-year bans
include Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Spain, Germany, Austria, France
and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Intergovernmental Conference on Africa's Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A two-day Intergovernmental
Conference of Ministers on Language Policies in Africa closed
here tonight after adoption of the Harare Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and delegates from 50 out of the 54 African
countries attended the conference which highlighted the use of
African languages as the best way of ensuring participation of
Africans in the society as well as in the planning and management
of development projects.
</P>
<P>
The Harare Declaration recognized the richness of the
linguistic diversity in Africa and its potential as a resource
for all types of development.
</P>
<P>
It convinced the necessity and urgency of African states to
adopt clear policies for the use and development of mother
tongues as well as community languages, national, inter-African
and international languages.
</P>
<P>
It said the optimal use of African languages is a prerequisite
for maximizing African creativity and resourcefulness in
development activities.
</P>
<P>
The declaration pointed out that the language policies
introduced since independence had generally favored the colonial
languages by setting up language structures that conferred a
monopoly of official status to the languages of the former
colonial powers.
</P>
<P>
It said most of the recommendations previously made to correct
this situation have not been implemented.
</P>
<P>
On guidelines for policy formulation, the declaration stressed
all African language policies should be those that enhance the
chances of attaining the vision of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Each country should produce a clear language policy document,
within which every language spoken in the country can find its
place, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It said guidelines for policy formulation should be sanctioned
by legislative action. Every country's policy framework should be
flexible enough to allow each community to use its language side
by side with other languages while integrating with the wider
society within an empowering language policy that caters for
communication at local, regional and international levels.
</P>
<P>
A language policy formulating and monitoring institution
should be established in each country, it says.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also appealed to all the parties concerned in
Africa and throughout the world to engage in a clear and
forthright cooperation with respect for the integrity of African
identity and the harmonious promotion of human values and dignity
as given expression in African languages.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece's current accounts deficit
reached a record 4.75 billion U.S. dollars in January-November
1996, compared to 3 billion dollars in the corresponding
eleven-month period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the Bank of Greece, the
record deficit was due to a 5.7 percent increase in the trade
balance, resulting from a 872 million dollar rise in imports
against a 32 million dollar drop in exports, compared to 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the same period of 1996, invisible revenue also fell by
812 million dollars, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: US Troops to Stay in Bosnia as Pledged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States will keep
its troops staying in Bosnia until June 1998 as promised despite a
congressional call for withdrawal by the end of the year, said
Defense Secretary William Cohen today.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he had told U.S. NATO allies the difficulties for
the U.S. troops to stay in Bosnia with the congressional call, but
it was "achievable to ensure that the United States stays until
June of 1998 as NATO has pledged, as the United States has
pledged."
</P>
<P>
House National Security Committee Chairman Floyd Spence, Budget
Committee Chairman John Kasich and some other members introduced a
bill Thursday calling for a pullout of the U.S. troops from the
Balkan nation by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"It recognizes that there is a disagreement on the Hill on the
part of some members but I think that has been known for some
time," Cohen said. But he indicated that the opponents would not
be able to have a majority needed in both the House and Senate to
order the U.S. troops out of Bosnia earlier than pledged.
</P>
<P>
Cohen restated that the 8,000 U.S. troops will leave Bosnia
when the present NATO peacekeeping mission ends in June 1998 and
any further peacekeeping after that should be done by European
allies.

Museba said appropriate steps should be taken to check
deforestation and minimize environmental degradation because
forests form the basis of the national survival, according to the

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Undersecretary
Yiannos Kranidiotis today held a telephone conversation with
Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino over the relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a Foreign Ministry announcement, the discussion
was particularly friendly, with both men agreeing that "the small
diplomatic misunderstanding which arose is considered to be over
by both sides."
</P>
<P>
Albania lodged a demarche with the Greek embassy in Tirana
Wednesday, protesting a series of meetings between Kranidiotis and
representatives of insurgents in southern Albania. The demarche
noted that the rebel representatives had no institutional
competency for such meetings, and that Kranidiotis' visit should
not have taken on such a nature.
</P>
<P>
Athens reacted to the demarche, saying that the Albanian
government had been informed about the undersecretary's visit to
southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
During their telephone conversation today, Kranidiotis and Fino
stressed the close cooperation between their two countries and the
uninterrupted progress in Greek-Albania relations, the Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Within this framework, Greece is to support efforts by the
national unity government in order for Albania to overcome the
current crisis, it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- United States First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton said today true democracy depends on the full
integration of women into society when they get equal access to
education, health and sources of finance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. First Lady, who arrived here on the third leg of her
goodwill mission to six African countries, was speaking at a
roundtable discussion with Zimbabwean women from various
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
She said women across the world have similar problems which
could be solved better by working together.
</P>
<P>
''Democracy depends on full integration of women into society
in which women have equal access to tools of empowerment such as
education, health, legal and political participation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Clinton said after the fourth world congress on women in
Beijing, women needed to work together to make micro-credit and
health care facilities more accessible.
</P>
<P>
She said it is important for continued dialogue around the
world so that when it comes to issues of economic and political
empowerment, there would be more access to information.
</P>
<P>
The First Lady was commenting as guest of honor at the
roundtable meeting where women in politics, business, law and
other pressure groups briefly outlined the problems they
encountered and the achievements made so far.

Mrs. Clinton has already visited South Africa and Senegal and
she is scheduled to go to Tanzania, Uganda and Eritrea. She is
accompanied by her daughter Chelsea during the visit.

<HEADLINE> US Monitoring Zaire in Case of Evacuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States is assessing
the chaotic situation in Zaire to decide whether it is necessary
to evacuate U.S. citizens in that war-torn country, Defense
Secretary William Cohen said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the preparatorial stage to make sure we can act if
action is called for," Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said evacuation of U.S. citizens from Zaire "depends on a
day by day assessment," even "an hour by hour assessment."
</P>
<P>
A 30-member U.S. military team is now in Zaire to help
determine what action might be necessary to evacuate Americans
living there, but no request for evacuation has been made,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Thursday that the
military team is "scoping out a wide range of possible outcomes"
in the event the situation in Zaire suddenly worsens.
</P>
<P>
Both Bacon and State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns have
said no order has been issued to evacuate for non-essential U.S.
employees.
</P>
<P>
But Pentagon sources said American forces based in Europe have
been notified to be ready in the event they might be needed for a
sudden operation.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Zaire's rebel forces seized the third city of
Kisangani and vowed to topple Zaire's ailing President Mobutu Sese
Seko.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu left France, where he had undergone cancer treatment,
for home today in an effort to salvage control of the country.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels' leader Laurent Kabila rejected a call for a
cease-fire and then peace negotiations. He demanded, "Negotiate
first."

UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
