<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a grand pageant of political might, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas rolled out the 10 members of his
presidential exploratory committee Sunday, an ethnically and
ideologically diverse tableau of some of the Republican Party's
biggest names and most promising stars.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully choreographed juggernaut was intended to convey a
sense of inevitability about Bush's presidential quest, a move that
could help him lock up crucial financial and political support in
the next few months. With each speaker offering a crisp testimonial
explaining why the governor was destined for the White House, the
accolades sounded as if they were for a beloved leader who was
about to be handed his gold watch _ not a man who had never been
elected to any office until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The assemblage, which Bush introduced as ``the best of the
Republican Party,'' included George P. Shultz, secretary of state
under President Ronald Reagan; Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas, the
first Mexican-American Republican elected to the House; Condoleeza
Rice, the provost of Stanford University who was a national
security official for President George Bush; Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of
Oklahoma, a conservative who is the only black Republican in
Congress, and Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, who, unlike
Governor Bush, supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   For added heft, Bush's advisers distributed a list of elected
officials backing the governor, including 72 House members and six
senators.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring was all the more striking because Bush has yet to
stake out public stands on pressing matters that his rivals are
already debating. Questioned by reporters at the event about issues
ranging from whether he favored a tax cut to what he would do in
Kosovo to the economic crisis in Asia, Bush offered the same
answer: that he would not articulate his positions until he
formally declared his candidacy, which would be in June, after the
state Legislature adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't have specific remedies or specific suggestions until I
start moving around the country,'' Bush, in a common refrain, said
when asked about Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Haley Barbour, a former Republican Party chairman who is one of
the heavyweights in the party, said no candidate _ not even Reagan
in 1980, or Richard M. Nixon in 1968, after toiling for years in
Republican politics _ had assembled such an early powerhouse of
support when they sought the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can ever remember there being such a
widespread interest in a candidacy that hasn't even been decided or
announced yet,'' said Barbour, a member of the Bush steering
committee.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is not expected to formally declare his candidacy
until June, he is dominating the polls. This announcement of his
committee to raise money drew such attention, even in the foreign
press, that it had to be held in a large ballroom at the convention
center here. As Bush and his wife, Laura, sat on a stage lined with
Texas and American flags, members of his committee, one by one,
spoke emphatically about his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But the scene offstage was perhaps as significant. As many as
three dozen financial and political advisers flew to Austin to
lunch with Bush and offer counsel. Among them were three of the
party's most successful fund-raisers, Wayne L. Berman, Heinz C.
Prechter and Mel Sembler. Sembler is supposed to be uncommitted
because he is finance chairman of the Republican National
Committee. He insisted, with a smile, that he has not signed on
yet.

FISHER'S HOT HAND LEAVES UTAH SINGING THE BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SALT LAKE CITY _ When the Lakers at last ended their five-game
funk against the Utah Jazz, it was supposed to be on the back of
Dennis Rodman's rebounding and confounding defense against Karl
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it was on Derek Fisher's jumpshots and Elden Campbell's
turnaround jumpers and !ital!his!off! defense of Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, the Lakers' starting point guard the first nine games of
the season before being demoted behind veteran Derek Harper,
provided 20 points in his best performance since last year. His
11-point second quarter keyed the run that staked the Lakers to a
game-high 14-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' coach Kurt Rambis said of Fisher's breakout.
</P>
<P>
   He started slowly, with a couple of buckets to close out the
second quarter, then came furiously, scoring 11 straight, including
a three-point play and two 3-point shots, in a span of three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When did he know the numbers were coming?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first shot,'' Fisher said. ``I could just tell the way I
let it go, I was in the flow of the game. I knew I wanted to have a
good game mentally, I just had to go out physically and put it
together.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished 6 for 8 from the field and 6 for 7 from the foul
line, adding three rebounds and a big, diving steal to ignite a
fast-break basket and three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harp (Derek Harper) was telling me, `Stay aggressive.' I knew
in my mind that I wanted to stay aggressive, but priority one for
me has always been doing what's best for the team, trying to get
other guy the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Just another win:!off! Beating the Jazz certainly doesn't
solve all the Lakers' problems, but coming as the seventh win in
seven games, it certainly makes for a strong argument that the
Lakers are on the right track. And perhaps not in need of the Eddie
Jones-for-Glen Rice trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely feel like it,'' Fisher said when asked if the
team had enough weapons to win. ``The one thing we've recognized
lately is what we control is how we play when we're on the
basketball floor. I think once we start to focus on that,
everything else fell by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kobe Bryant of the trade, which will happen this week, if
at all, ``I don't think we can think about that, honestly. We're
playing some excellent basketball right now. It's important to
concentrate on that.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one was about to place too much significance on one win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good step, it's a confidence booster,'' Rambis said,
``but we still made a lot of mistakes tonight.''

LONGHORNS WOMEN `ECSTATIC' OVER NCAA INVITATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas coach Jody Conradt couldn't help it. With only 16
victories, she resigned herself to the fact that the Longhorns
might miss the NCAA Tournament for a second consecutive season. If
asked, she said her team would play in the Women's National
Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But with 75 percent of the field announced, the Longhorns were
seeded 12th in the East region and will face fifth-seeded Auburn
(19-8) on Friday in Blacksburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   While Conradt was pleasantly surprised, there was no suspense in
selecting the top four seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, Purdue, Louisiana Tech and Connecticut are the top
four seeds. Only UConn's (27-4) selection, which came over
higher-ranked Colorado State and Old Dominion, was surprising. CSU
and ODU earned No. 2 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is absolutely ecstatic right now,'' Conradt said of
her 16-11 team. ``There is a renewed excitement among the players.
They are so fired up right now that they probably could fly into
Blacksburg right now on their own power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns tied North Carolina State with the fewest number
of victories for any at-large selection. Only Appalachian State
(14-14), which received an automatic bid by winning the Southern
Conference tournament, won fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Texas deserves to be in the NCAA, no doubt about it,''
said Nebraska coach Paul Sanderford, whose team is the 11th seed in
the West. ``If \Rthe Big 12\S can't justify sending five teams to
the NCAA Tournament, then how can the SEC get seven or eight?''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into this past weekend, the only Lone Star state team
thought to be a tournament lock was No. 9 Texas Tech. After winning
the Big 12 regular-season and conference tournament titles, the Red
Raiders earned the Midwest's second seed and will play host to
first- and second-round games.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen F. Austin (17-11) surprised everyone by winning the
Southland Conference tournament, earning its 12th consecutive NCAA
Tournament appearance. The 15th-seeded Ladyjacks face the Red
Raiders (28-3) at 8:30 p.m. Saturday on ESPN 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the NCAA makes everything better,'' said Royce
Chadwick, whose team overcame injuries, more losses than in any
other season this decade and the death of a former teammate. ``We
haven't played well until this weekend and we are just excited to
be playing good basketball at this time of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   SMU was the final selection from Texas. The Mustangs (19-10)
stunned fourth-ranked Colorado State in the Western Athletic
Conference title game to earn their fifth appearance in the past
five seasons. The 11th-seeded Mustangs play sixth-seeded Toledo
(25-5) at 5 p.m. Saturday in Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed in our seed,'' said SMU coach Rhonda
Rompola. ``I thought we'd be higher than that after our win over
the No. 4 team in the country. I don't think we are getting the
respect we deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   No other team from the WAC made the field. Last season the WAC
had a record five teams entered but none advanced beyond the second
round. New Mexico and Utah, thought to be strong candidates, did
not receive bids.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Lady Vols (28-2), the three-time defending NCAA
champions. prepare to defend their title as the top seed in the
East. It's the 11th time in 12 seasons that the second-ranked Lady
Vols have been a top seed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last season, they aren't ranked No. 1 and they aren't
going in with the burden of being undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting \Rthree consecutive titles\S in perspective is hard,''
said Tennessee coach Pat Summitt, who seeks her seventh title. ``My
biggest concerns are not to get overanxious and quick-shoot the
ball. We can't get behind early against a tempo control team. That
happened against Purdue and LSU,'' the two teams to defeat the Lady
Vols.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (28-1), ranked No. 1 in the nation, earned the top seed
in the Midwest. Coach Carolyn Peck's team defeated Tennessee early
in the season and appears to have one of the best chances of
dethroning the Lady Vols.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't put any undue pressure on ourselves,'' said Peck,
who is leaving Purdue after the season for the WNBA. ``That
Tennessee game was a great measuring stick. But it was just one
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Techsters (26-2) have arguably the toughest road of any
top seed with a possible second-round date against either No. 18
Penn State (21-7) or No. 19 Virginia (20-8).
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Conference was awarded an NCAA-record eight
bids, while the Atlantic Coast Conference and Big 12 earned five
spots.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament begins Friday at eight campus sub-regional sites.

ACQUISITIVE COUPLE INVESTIGATED FOR WELFARE FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO -- &UR;  &LR; Choked by the constraints of communism, Dr. Yenok
Ordoyan fled the then-Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia to chase
a better life in America nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Landing in sunny Los Angeles, Ordoyan immediately went to work,
putting in 14 hours a day as a medical assistant in North
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In just eight years, Ordoyan and his wife, Armenui, amassed a
small fortune, including homes in the northern suburbs of Reseda
and Tarzana, a Lexus, co-ownership in a North Hollywood pharmacy,
and nearly $155,000 that they stashed in the bottom of a desk
drawer.
</P>
<P>
   They embraced the American Dream to be sure, but prosecutors
charge the Ordoyan's success story is flawed: It was based on
cheating the system.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is accused of stealing more than $58,000 from welfare
rolls to finance their lavish lifestyle. Ordoyan also is being
investigated by the state for how he handled Medi-Cal
reimbursements at a North Hollywood medical center, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the truly greedy need do to steal from the truly needy _
and you, the taxpayers _ is to lie,'' said Steven L. Cooley, the
director of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Welfare
Fraud Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Ordoyans' attorneys said the couple denies any wrongdoing,
but prosecutors insist that the case reflects a welfare system
fraught with abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you,'' Cooley said, ``that lying and cheating to
defraud public benefit programs is occurring on a grand scale,
particularly here in Los Angeles County.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News has learned from two sources that a Los Angeles
County grand jury plans to hand down a series of ``significant
reform recommendations'' next month to overhaul the way the
Department of Public and Social Services distributes government
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grand jury wants to close the floodgates on welfare
fraud,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates are alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Based on recent studies of welfare fraud in Orange and San Diego
counties, at least 30 percent of Los Angeles County's $1.2 billion
in welfare claims are bogus, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated $396 million in fraudulent benefits paid to Los
Angeles County residents last year, officials said, the county
recovered $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley declined to comment on the grand jury investigation, but
he described the county verification system as ``extremely flawed''
because it no longer requires home checks of each applicant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something wrong with the system that's now in place.
It is built on self-disclosure and trust. That's a false
assumption. A lot of people go down there and lie to get money,''
Cooley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, fraud or misrepresentation was found in 19,500 cases,
and an additional 10,500 recipients were deemed ineligible and lost
their benefits, said Shirley Christensen, the director of the
Department of Public and Social Services fraud prevention and
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The major fraud cases, involving at least $50,000 or linked to
other criminal activity, are referred to the District Attorney's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Awash in fraudulent claims, District Attorney Gil Garcetti
ordered the Welfare Fraud Division's 20 investigators to focus only
on major cases two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal thing is to go out and start doing the home checks
again,'' Garcetti said. ``By spending money in the beginning of the
process to prevent the crime, you will save a lot of money at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Using surveillance and search warrants, the division has
arrested more than 50 welfare kings and queens, and seized more
than $1 million in property and assets in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   That does not include the Ordoyans.
</P>
<P>
   On paper at least, the Ordoyans appeared to be a struggling
family of five.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1998, they never reported an income of more
than $200 a month to the county and received $58,017 in welfare
benefits in the form of cash and food stamps, according to court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   But during the same period, the couple had enough money at their
fingertips to make monthly mortgage payments of more than $1,300 on
their $205,000 home in Reseda, according to search warrant
documents that included bank statements.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Ordoyan even applied for a state permit for
Saturn Pharmacy and Medical Supplies Inc. in North Hollywood. In
the application to the state pharmacy board, he is identified as a
25 percent shareholder and the company estimated its annual gross
sales at $300,000, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Notified of the apparent welfare scam by the state, the district
attorney's investigators examined the Ordoyans' tax records, credit
reports, welfare application and Department of Motor Vehicle
records, eventually compiling enough evidence to take action.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES: to take action.
</P>
<P>
   When senior investigators Teresa Carver and George Mueller
searched the Ordoyans' detached single-story house in Reseda in
September, they found $154,933 tucked away in white envelopes at
the bottom of a desk drawer, a $15,000 Lexus, airline tickets, 14
credit cards, documents listing bank accounts in the names of the
Ordoyans and a semiautomatic 9 mm Luger pistol.
</P>
<P>
   County regulations prohibit welfare recipients from owning a
vehicle valued at $4,650 or higher or possessing more than $2,000
in personal property or cash.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, the Ordoyans argue they received the car as
a gift and were able to meet their mortgage payments and save money
through loans from family members.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Held on $500,000 bail, 47-year-old Yenok Ordoyan has been in a
state prison for five months. Armenui Ordoyan, 41, was released on
her own recognizance, in part to care for her three children all
under 5, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The two will be reunited today during the closing arguments in a
hearing to determine whether there is enough evidence to try them
on charges of welfare fraud, which is a felony, and 21 counts of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their assets have been seized; their bank accounts are
frozen, and things could get much worse for Yenok Ordoyan.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the state Attorney General's Office are
investigating Ordoyan's role in Medi-Cal billing out of the
Universal Family Medical Center in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Moss, a Pasadena attorney representing Ordoyan,
described the state's treatment of his client as ``grossly
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation has been going on since September. If they
had enough evidence to charge him, they should have done it,'' Moss
said. ``They've had enough time.''
</P>
<P>
   And in court papers, family and friends paint the Ordoyans as
hard-working but down-on-their-luck parents who were in desperate
need of government help to feed their three young children.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter to the court, Glendale architect Armen R.
Tor-Oganesian, a friend of Yenok Ordoyan's for more than 20 years,
wrote, ``Yenok looked for any job, even newspaper delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Statements like those make Cooley, the hard-charging prosecutor
responsible for catching welfare kings and queens, cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by a significant paper trail in the Ordoyans' home,
investigators obtained a search warrant for the North Hollywood
medical center where they found hundreds of photocopied State of
California Benefits Identification Cards stuffed in brown paper
bags, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   The cards are used by welfare and Medi-Cal recipients to obtain
free medical care from state-authorized clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the state Attorney General's Office seized 78 boxes
of patient charts, bills, identification cards, and files, as well
as a hand-written document that defined medical conditions,
treatments, and listed Medi-Cal billing codes, according to search
warrants.
</P>
<P>
   The documents could be used to bill the state for $1.2 million
in Medi-Cal reimbursements, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information allows a nonmedically trained person to
prepare a false billing statement to create an apparently
legitimate claim,'' investigator Harry Blair explained in the
search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Venolia, supervising deputy attorney general, said
Ordoyan's steep bail was based largely upon the strength of the
state's ongoing investigation, which is expected to conclude in two
to three months.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley said the case against the Ordoyans is typical: There was
no attempt to hide the lavish lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's important the public doesn't lose faith in the
programs. There are truly needy people in the county who need these
benefits,'' he added. ``We want to make sure the money and help is
going to them.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Some teams, like Mississippi State and Xavier,
were visibly disappointed to be relegated Sunday to the National
Invitation Tournament. But that wasn't the case for USC, which was
thrilled at its inclusion in the venerable, if not elite,
postseason tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans play Wyoming in Laramie at 6:30 p.m. (PST) on
Wednesday, in their first NIT appearance since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``It's not a
second-rate tournament. It's for teams like us that didn't get off
to a strong (conference) start but are finishing strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans weren't the only local team to receive a berth in
the tournament. Pepperdine received its first NIT bid since 1993
and first postseason berth of any kind under coach Lorenzo Romar.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves (19-12) will play at Colorado (17-14) on Wednesday at
a time to be determined. The Buffaloes are led by 6-foot-4 guard
Kenny Price, who averages 15 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   If the Waves win, they would play the winner of the Mississippi
State-Colorado State game either next Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As for USC (15-12), it will face a Wyoming team that hasn't
played a game since defeating UNLV 79-76 on Feb. 27. The Cowboys
did not qualify for the Western Athletic Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (17-9) feature 6-8 forward Ugo Udezue of Nigeria,
who averages 20.5 points and 7.7 rebounds. Freshman point guard
Chris McMillian of Brea averages 9.5 points and 4.9 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game we can win,'' Bibby said. ``We don't know what
kind of team they are or what they run offensively or defensively,
but we'll find out.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Trojans win, they will play the winner of the Georgia
Tech-Oregon game either Monday or Tuesday. That means a possible
third meeting of the season with the Ducks, who have split with USC
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was some doubt whether the Trojans would qualify
for the NIT, even after Saturday's victory over Arizona State,
Bibby said he never worried that USC would not be selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt we would get in. I was very confident. I thought
we played well at the end,'' Bibby said. ``We beat some quality
teams. We're young and survived the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started playing better the last seven or eight games. I
think people say `They have been much better at the end.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is USC's second postseason appearance in Bibby's three full
seasons as coach. USC went to the NCAA Tournament in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is excellent for the program. For recruiting. It's
excellent exposure,'' Bibby said. ``This is our championship. It's
a tournament we can go in and do some damage.''

M'S APT TO LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT OUTSIDE DOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ After a week observing spring training, it's
apparent that changes in the Mariners' team on the field for 1999
are of the size detectable by forensic microscopes instead of
sportswriters.
</P>
<P>
   As it has been for the last half of the decade, the Mariners
have a flair for longball and a prayer for pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The only substantive change for the Mariners on the field is the
field.
</P>
<P>
   The midseason switch of home ballyards is a rare thing in
baseball. In the 20th century, only four teams have intentionally
had two fields in one season _ Cincinnati, St. Louis, Pittsburgh
and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   None involved going, as the Mariners will, from inside to
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Mariners have had some experience at other
outdoor parks, so it won't be quite like the graveyard shift
getting first-time day jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And the game remains the game _ so far, no one has indicated
that any Mariner will be required to run a post pattern into zone
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But the subtleties will be different. And baseball, with the
exception of spitting and labor strikes, is all about the little
things.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, most Mariner players share the view of catcher Dan
Wilson:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been in Seattle five years, but I can't wait to see
sun shine on the grass in the outfield, surrounded by a big
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   But a quick survey of Mariner veterans _ each was asked what he
is most excited about and most apprehensive about in the new park _
made it clear that the hitters wondered if their strength won't be
sapped, while the pitchers think they might get small assists.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, none of them worried about the cost overruns at Safeco
Field or the expense to the taxpayer _ proof again that a
ballplayer's life is indeed a good one, as utterly free of
conscience as one can be outside of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably will be the most exciting new stadium in any
sport, and it should be exciting for the fans and energize us,''
shortstop Alex Rodriguez said. ``I hope it's not a moist field.
With all the water we get in Seattle, I hope when you pick up a
ground ball, it doesn't feel like it just came out of a pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is, hopefully the ball will carry. But in the
thick air, maybe it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the experience of Edgar Martinez, who despite making a
living indoors has become knowledgable about Puget Sound's marine
climate and its impact on a spinning spheroid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apprehension is that the ball won't go anywhere,'' he
said. ``Years ago I played in Tacoma and Bellingham, and the ball
didn't go very far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when the roof is closed, I'm not sure how the wind and
drafts will affect the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jamie Moyer worries how fly balls will look against the
retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they had the roof worked out in the Metrodome,
too,'' Moyer said of Minneapolis's translucent, baseball-colored
fabric roof. ``But it's a very common occurrence for visiting teams
to take two days to adjust. If it's a sunny day, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new roof's metallic underside should offer sufficient
contrast with the ball. What it can also do is help mimic at least
partially what Moyer considers the greatest loss leaving the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans will still be loud, but the new park won't be as noisy,''
he said. ``The acoustics can't be as good. It's too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ninth big-league season, the Mariners' No. 1 starter,
Jeff Fassero, will get to play mostly outdoors for the first time,
after six seasons indoors at Montreal. He thinks the M's might
catch a little break because of the grass field instead of turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a team with much footspeed,'' he said. ``Grass will
slow the ball down a bit and give the infield an extra half-step.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer and Fassero weren't sure about the park dimensions, but
they did know that when the fences were moved closer, it developed
from consultations with Mariner sluggers, not pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Another guy the ballpark pushers didn't consult was first
baseman David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed we're leaving the Kingdome,'' he
said. ``I've always liked it there. The dimensions are smaller, and
it's loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the new park will be an advantage or a
disadvantage. I think, for awhile, it's going to be strange for us.
Except for the fans cheering, it will be like a road stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, Ken Griffey Jr. had a different take on things.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's the excitement of something special that's ours,''
he said. ``When we go to new stadiums in Toronto, Texas, Baltimore,
Cleveland, we walk around staring. Now people can come to our
stadium in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey pointed out the concerns about air, light, grass and
roof become secondary to the peculiar urgency of this spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't go into the new stadium with a good start on the
field,'' he said, ``it won't be long before there's empty seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's fear is that, at about 15th in major-league payroll
this season but No. 1 in ballpark price, club management has
indulged cost overruns on the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   Which might be the most unforeseen subtlety of all.

BENIGNI, PALTROW TOP WINNERS AT SCREEN ACTORS GUILD AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- &UR;  &LR; Life was beautiful for actors Roberto Benigni
and Gwyneth Paltrow at the 5th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The two took home ``actor'' statuettes Sunday evening for their
work in ``Life is Beautiful'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,''
respectively, in what has become a closely watched indicator of
Academy Award prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The show was held at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium, and was
broadcast live on TV's TNT Network.
</P>
<P>
   In categories not covered by the granddaddy of awards shows, the
Oscars, ``ER'' won for outstanding ensemble in a TV drama series,
and ``Shakespeare in Love'' won the award for best film ensemble
cast.
</P>
<P>
   Other awards went to a combination of veterans _ such as Robert
Duvall for his supporting role in the film ``A Civil Action.'' _
and relative newcomers, such as Angelina Jolie for her star turn as
a troubled model in the HBO TV movie ``Gia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild is a relative latecomer to the awards
show business, but organizers have made up for lost time by
attracting top talent to their show. The program is unique in
honoring actors from both film and television with awards voted on
by their peers: other actors.
</P>
<P>
   Even veteran actor Kirk Douglas, who was presented with a life
achievement award by Karl Malden, Lauren Bacall, Janet Leigh and
Dan Aykroyd, said he was honored to ``have an award from my fellow
actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, 82, was feted with numerous clips from his films, and a
standing ovation from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare'' was a clear favorite, garnering both top female
actor and cast awards. The film is nominated for more Academy
Awards this year than any other film.
</P>
<P>
   Also receiving more than one award was TV drama ``ER,'' for its
cast and for female star Julianna Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Bates, who took home the supporting female actor award for
her role in the film ``Primary Colors,'' admitted she'd be happy if
it portended bigger things at the Oscars ceremony later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to win another Academy Award, especially for this
part,'' she told the press backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Several presenters and award winners commented sadly on the
death of legendary director Stanley Kubrick, who passed away in
London early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envy a friend of mine who got to work for him recently. It's
a sad time for the industry,'' Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni described the director of such films as ``2001: A Space
Odyssey'' and ``A Clockwork Orange'' as ``a genius,'' likening him
to Italy's Federico Fellini and Japan's Akira Kurosawa.
</P>
<P>
   Other TV honors went to Sam Waterston for his role in ``Law &AMP;
Order''; to Michael J. Fox for ``Spin City''; to comedienne Tracey
Ullman for ``Tracey Takes On''; to Christopher Reeve for ``Rear
Window'' and to the cast of ``Ally McBeal'' for comedy ensemble
work.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it seemed a night of camaraderie for the actors present.
Accepting her award, Kathy Bates said giddily, ``I'm so excited. I
get to sit at the same table as Meryl Streep.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep, nominated for her role in ``One True Thing,'' reared her
head with laughter.

HUSKIES GLADLY GO TO BIG DANCE WITHOUT CINDERELLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ CBS had it right. Last year, the official network of
the NCAA tournament sent cameras to Montlake because Washington, a
bubble team, promised to make excellent theater during the
announcement of the 64-team draw.
</P>
<P>
   Get overlooked, and there is live footage of Husky heartbreak to
beam across the land. Call it the ``agony of defeat'' live shot.
</P>
<P>
   Get in, however, and there is that spontaneous eruption of
unbridled emotion _ the kind of feel-good cameo by an elated
bubblicious team that goes far to affirm that the NCAA tourney is
one of the biggest, zaniest, funnest, let-'er-rip sporting events
in the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies circa 1998, those unheralded under-Dawgs, hooted,
hollered and relished their call to the Big Dance.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then. This is now.
</P>
<P>
   CBS cameras were at Montlake again Sunday, but not for a live
shot. The Huskies, no longer a ``bubble team,'' did not promise to
go bananas just to hear their name called.
</P>
<P>
   CBS had it right again. The Dawgs got their invite. They are the
No. 7 seed in the Midwest Region. Their first-round opponent is
Miami of Ohio. They did not even seem to care that Utah, Kentucky
and Kansas are entrentched like landmines in their bracket.
</P>
<P>
   And just as significant, no one went crazy inside the Hec Ed
Hall of Fame room when the Huskies got their call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more business-like,'' said Slick Watts, father of UW
senior guard Donald. ``It was like some of the guys were saying,
`OK, we know where we're going, now let's go take care of
business.'''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are a funny thing. The Huskies can no longer live
on the hope of being a Cinderella entry. Nor do they want to. Not
that there wasn't a good scene at Huskyville. As soon as CBS went
into a commercial break after the UW berth was announced, Donald
Watts got up from his chair and walked across the room. The first
person the Washington guard wanted to give a high-five to was his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Slick had called it: A first-round NCAA game for the Huskies in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a feeling about it,'' the elder Watts said, adding
that once the Huskies had a 10-8 Pac-10 record to their credit and
a fourth-place finish in sight, the Huskies were deserving.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's going to be a Bourbon Street shuffle for the Dawgs.
It's going to be a few deserved helpings of gumbo, jambalaya and
crayfish etouffe, too.
</P>
<P>
   And, naturally, it will take a decided effort on the part of
Washington's chaperone contingent to keep the young Dawgs out of
the jazz and blues bars because the only thing more important than
food and music in New Orleans is, well, the booze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few family reunions down in New Orleans. It's an
old city. It's a fun place to hang out, walk down Bourbon Street,
party,'' Donald Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Watts family knows its way around New Orleans. Slick
played college there. Slick's mother, father, aunts, uncles and
cousins are just a few hours away in Jackson, Miss. And the other
side of Donald Watts' family is all over in Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 80 to 100 family and friends'' all within a
three-hour drive of The Big Easy, the elder Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that doesn't even include the 20 or so I'm going to call
and tell not to even bother asking for tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Slick Watts and his well-spoken son have become the most
familiar symbols of Washington's basketball rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Having been there just last year, when the Huskies upset Xavier,
beat Richmond and lost a heartbreaker to Connecticut that kept them
out of the Elite Eight, the Huskies are promoting the fact that
this time around, they'll be used to things.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be any nervous jitters that can lead to sloppy
play and turnovers in the first five minutes,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what to expect about tournament security, the open
practices, the media sessions, all the stuff that comes with the
tournament,'' UW coach Bob Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the tournament progresses and the further you go, there are
fewer teams still around so I was aware (last year) that we were
getting some pretty good looks and some discussion,'' UW center
Todd MacCulloch said. ``That has certainly heightened expectations
(for this year.) We have the higher seed and now Donald, Deon
(Luton) and I have to take on that responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Having been there already is going to help these Huskies
navigate their way to New Orleans. But how much does having been
there, done that really mean? Not all that much in a
single-elimination tournament where madness is all about the moment
_ seizing it and rolling with it down to the last, anxious buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have already showed they can do that with the best
of them.

EXPERIMENTS NOT WORKING FOR MAVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Don Nelson has tried just about every
gimmick he can think of during these past three games. But none of
them has resulted in a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Mavericks coach benched his top two point guards
for most of the second half. That strategy worked to a degree, but
the results were still the same: another loss for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento Kings got 18 points and 13 rebounds from Chris
Webber en route to holding off the Mavericks before 14,715 at ARCO
Arena, 94-89. After winning five of seven games, the Mavericks have
now dropped their past three games and are 6-13.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas starts a four-game homestand tomorrow against old nemesis
Jason Kidd and the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks had another horrible night from the floor,
shooting 38.5 percent against a Kings team not known for its
defense. Nelson said he is surprised his team is having shooting
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been there,'' he said. ``I've learned to live with
it now. I don't know if it's just us, or the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (8-8) had control of the game until Michael Finley
converted a 360-degree circus shot inside the paint to get the
Mavericks to within 92-86. And the Mavericks had a chance to cut
the deficit to three or four.
</P>
<P>
   But Tariq Abdul-Wahad stripped the ball from Finley as he was
going up for a shot with less than 35 seconds left to end Dallas'
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he went with Hubert Davis at point guard for most of
the second half _ while benching Steve Nash and Robert Pack _
because ``it was just a feel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for this particular game to maybe have two shooters
in,'' Nelson said. ``And we were going to more postups at that
time, so it was something I wanted to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks attempted 59 field goals in the first half. That's
the team's second-most all-time, trailing only the 60 they
attempted against Denver on Apr. 8, 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Bradley drew his fourth foul less than three minutes into
the second half, and Nelson chose to leave him in the game. A
little over two minutes later, Nelson had no choice but to bench
Bradley after the center drew his fifth personal.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he never thought about benching Bradley after he was
tagged with his fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I thought about keeping him in,'' Nelson said.
``There was a situation a few games ago where I protected him on
fouls _ he got his third, I took him out, and he got his fourth and
I took him out _ and by the time I put him back in the game was
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I wanted to protect him a little, but not too much,
because often times he can play a whole quarter or a half and never
even commit a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley returned with 8:04 left in the game and the Mavericks
behind, 81-72. But then, he had to play tentative.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks led, 19-12, late in the first period after a
jumper by A.C. Green. But the Kings, led by Chris Webber, Predrag
Stojakovic, Vernon Maxwell and rookie sensation Jason Williams,
bolted to a 46-41 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had 13 points and five assists, banged in a
3-pointer at the third-quarter buzzer as the Kings increased their
lead to 72-64.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was definitely a momentum for them going to the bench,''
said Gary Trent, who had 18 points and 14 rebounds. ``That might
have fired them up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we competed really hard and stay right in it,''
Nelson said. ``It was maybe a long shot, but I think we were close
enough to have a chance, and I thought it was a good game.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- &UR;  &LR; Choked by the constraints of communism, Dr.
Yenok Ordoyan fled the then-Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia to
chase a better life in America nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Landing in sunny Los Angeles, Ordoyan immediately went to work,
putting in 14 hours a day as a medical assistant in North
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In just eight years, Ordoyan and his wife, Armenui, amassed a
small fortune, including homes in the northern suburbs of Reseda
and Tarzana, a Lexus, co-ownership in a North Hollywood pharmacy,
and nearly $155,000 that they stashed in the bottom of a desk
drawer.
</P>
<P>
   They embraced the American Dream to be sure, but prosecutors
charge the Ordoyan's success story is flawed: It was based on
cheating the system.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is accused of stealing more than $58,000 from welfare
rolls to finance their lavish lifestyle. Ordoyan also is being
investigated by the state for how he handled Medi-Cal
reimbursements at a North Hollywood medical center, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the truly greedy need do to steal from the truly needy _
and you, the taxpayers _ is to lie,'' said Steven L. Cooley, the
director of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Welfare
Fraud Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Ordoyans' attorneys said the couple denies any wrongdoing,
but prosecutors insist that the case reflects a welfare system
fraught with abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you,'' Cooley said, ``that lying and cheating to
defraud public benefit programs is occurring on a grand scale,
particularly here in Los Angeles County.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News has learned from two sources that a Los Angeles
County grand jury plans to hand down a series of ``significant
reform recommendations'' next month to overhaul the way the
Department of Public and Social Services distributes government
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grand jury wants to close the floodgates on welfare
fraud,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates are alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Based on recent studies of welfare fraud in Orange and San Diego
counties, at least 30 percent of Los Angeles County's $1.2 billion
in welfare claims are bogus, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated $396 million in fraudulent benefits paid to Los
Angeles County residents last year, officials said, the county
recovered $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley declined to comment on the grand jury investigation, but
he described the county verification system as ``extremely flawed''
because it no longer requires home checks of each applicant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something wrong with the system that's now in place.
It is built on self-disclosure and trust. That's a false
assumption. A lot of people go down there and lie to get money,''
Cooley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, fraud or misrepresentation was found in 19,500 cases,
and an additional 10,500 recipients were deemed ineligible and lost
their benefits, said Shirley Christensen, the director of the
Department of Public and Social Services fraud prevention and
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The major fraud cases, involving at least $50,000 or linked to
other criminal activity, are referred to the District Attorney's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Awash in fraudulent claims, District Attorney Gil Garcetti
ordered the Welfare Fraud Division's 20 investigators to focus only
on major cases two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal thing is to go out and start doing the home checks
again,'' Garcetti said. ``By spending money in the beginning of the
process to prevent the crime, you will save a lot of money at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Using surveillance and search warrants, the division has
arrested more than 50 welfare kings and queens, and seized more
than $1 million in property and assets in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   That does not include the Ordoyans.
</P>
<P>
   On paper at least, the Ordoyans appeared to be a struggling
family of five.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1998, they never reported an income of more
than $200 a month to the county and received $58,017 in welfare
benefits in the form of cash and food stamps, according to court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   But during the same period, the couple had enough money at their
fingertips to make monthly mortgage payments of more than $1,300 on
their $205,000 home in Reseda, according to search warrant
documents that included bank statements.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Ordoyan even applied for a state permit for
Saturn Pharmacy and Medical Supplies Inc. in North Hollywood. In
the application to the state pharmacy board, he is identified as a
25 percent shareholder and the company estimated its annual gross
sales at $300,000, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Notified of the apparent welfare scam by the state, the district
attorney's investigators examined the Ordoyans' tax records, credit
reports, welfare application and Department of Motor Vehicle
records, eventually compiling enough evidence to take action.

HUSKIES TO OPEN NCAA AGAINST MIAMI (OHIO) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They soared at times and staggered at others, but the
Washington Huskies were rewarded for their 17-11 season Sunday with
an invitation to the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The respect was evident, the selection committee giving
Washington a seventh seed and the favorite's role against No. 10
Miami of Ohio. The first-round Midwest Regional game will be played
Friday night at the Superdome in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's UW team stunned Xavier and Richmond to advance to
the Sweet 16, attracting national attention and creating high
expectations for this year's team.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Bender wants the Huskies to focus on the first game,
but now that they are on the road to St. Petersburg, Todd
MacCulloch momentarily looked off in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been to the Sweet 16,'' said the Husky senior center.
``Now I want to see what it's like in the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   The other senior on the team, Donald Watts, hopes for redemption
in the tournament. He has struggled most of the season because of
an ankle injury. The New Orleans draw means a lot to him _ his
father's family lives in Jackson, Miss., his mother's in Mobile,
Ala., both within a comfortable drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's showcase time,'' Watts said. ``The farther we go, the
better I'll feel about the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Huskies were inconsistent this season, the players
believe they will be better prepared for this year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the travel and atmosphere, we know what it's like,'' said
sophomore forward Thalo Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came together and sacrificed our individual needs and
wants,'' MacCulloch said. ``I hope we'll be able to do that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies gathered around a big-screen TV in the Husky Hall of
Fame room to watch Sunday's selection show. They reacted with
cheers, but it was a muted celebration compared to last year.
Uncertainty has been replaced by unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt a little more comfortable sitting here,'' MacCulloch
said. ``Guys started thinking about not just getting in the
tournament but making a statement when we get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami of Ohio, 22-7 overall and 17-4 in the Mid-American
Conference, is led by senior forward Wally Szczerbiak, who averages
23.6 points and is projected to be a top-10 pick in this year's NBA
draft.
</P>
<P>
   If they prevail, the Huskies will play Friday's Utah-Arkansas
State winner on Sunday.

CLOUDE'S DEBUT CASTS SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Ken Cloude's rocky first outing didn't start a
panic in Mariner camp, but it also did nothing to diminish the
club's interest in trading for a starting pitcher, as well as a
left-handed reliever.
</P>
<P>
   While Manager Lou Piniella dismissed concern about Cloude's
debut Saturday against San Diego, in which he gave up seven hits, a
walk and five runs in two innings, Woody Woodward, the club's vice
president of baseball operations, had a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed,'' he said. ``He's got enough experience
that he should be better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude is scheduled to be the No. 3 starter behind Jeff Fassero
and Jamie Moyer. As the No. 4 starter a year ago, Cloude had an
8-10 mark with a 6.37 ERA. With no clear claimants to the fourth
and fifth spots, it's apparent the rotation remains the club's No.
1 vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said he has had contact with at least two clubs that
might be in position to deal pitching. But he knows that with so
many other clubs in the same position, competition will be heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we aren't able to find those two (starter and reliever) in
a trade, someone (among the younger pitchers) is going to have to
step up,'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   The best early prospects to meet that possibility are
right-hander Brett Hinchliffe, 24, who was 10-8 with a 4.00 ERA in
Tacoma last year, and left-hander John Halama, 27, one of three
pitchers acquired in the Randy Johnson trade.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners do want to trade, options are limited. The eight
position starters are virtually set, and the reserves are
journeymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a little depth in the outfield that some clubs are
interested in,'' Woodward said. ``And we have some pitching
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   The club is loath to part with its promising youngsters such as
Ryan Anderson and Gil Meche. But neither is it eager to stumble out
of the seasonal gate and have no emotional momentum going into the
July 15 move into the new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said that regardless of what happens in spring
training, the owners won't increase the player payroll budget,
which remains near the $53 million level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get it done,'' he said, ``with what we have.''

LAKERS TUNE OUT THE PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ A notorious tormentor of the Utah Jazz returned
to the Delta Center on Sunday, and the locals recoiled at the site
of the wormy fellow with the camouflage hair who does everything
but bite the neighborhood Mailman.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis Rodman's biggest offense this day was slapping Karl
Malone's butt. And while the Worm engaged in frivolous sideshows,
his new Lakers teammates, lesser-knowns like Derek Fisher and Elden
Campbell, put on the main event, performing to a level worthy of
Rodman's old running mates in the Windy City.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Finals, this was not. But neither was this the Western
Conference finals, as the Lakers shook off the ghosts of playoffs
past with an impressive 97-89 victory over the Jazz before a packed
house.
</P>
<P>
   No Larry O'Brien Trophy was presented, as it was for Rodman's
last visit here with the Bulls. But for the Lakers, losers of five
straight games and two crushing playoff series to the Jazz, this
was more than the basic Game 19 of the season.
</P>
<P>
   This was therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big for us psychologically,'' Derek Harper said. ``When
a team beats you five straight times, obviously you wonder if you
can beat a basketball team that's beaten you that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of weeks back, the Lakers were wondering after
Utah beat them at the Forum. But that was the other Lakers team.
The one that later lost to Denver and Vancouver. This one just won
its seventh straight _ sixth since Rodman's arrival and Kurt
Rambis' installment as coach _ and it was easily the biggest win in
the string.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three weeks ago, we would have probably given this game away
on somebody else's floor,'' Harper said. ``The fact that we found a
way to stay the course of the game, especially in the fourth
quarter, shows that we've grown. . . . I think we gain confidence
from a win like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed the nemesis Jazz only once. They controlled
the game for all but a brief letdown just before halftime. And the
Lakers avoided the overreliance on Shaquille O'Neal that has
characterized any number of losses to Utah in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 23 points, Kobe Bryant 24, but it was a 20-point
outburst from Fisher and 16 from Campbell, both off the bench, that
carried the day and changed a few trends.
</P>
<P>
   Utah had won its first eight home games this season and 20
straight dating back to last season. The Lakers had lost 10 times
in their last 11 trips here.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman kept alive his personal winning streak against the Jazz,
though Malone won the much-hyped individual battle, scoring a
game-high 34 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman provided the usual entertainment _ starting a silly slap
fight with Malone at midcourt after a hard foul, bantering with the
locals _ but he only matched up with Malone for about half the
game. The rest was left up to Campbell. If nothing else, they wore
Malone down. He made just 1 of 6 shots in the fourth quarter,
settling for five points.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we win, that's the most important thing. I take all
the blame for what happened with Karl Malone,'' Rodman said as he
exited the building. But he didn't step onto the team bus without
leaving a parting shot: ``The fact of it is that Utah will never
win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, the Lakers might, Rodman said. If they do,
it will be with games like this, games in which they can take a
14-point lead in the second quarter, fritter it away and still find
a way to win. They survived a 14-1 run from the Jazz at the end of
the first half, then rebuilt the lead in the third behind 10 points
each from Campbell and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   And then Bryant took over the fourth. His flying slam dunk over
Greg Ostertag, followed by Harper's 3-pointer, turned a three-point
game into an 89-81 lead, changing the momentum for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the fans in the first quarter that I was gonna dunk on
somebody,'' Bryant said. ``They was getting on me about it, so I
told them here it comes and I dunked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ostertag had it coming,'' Bryant said. ``He blocked my dunk
like three times last year during the playoffs. I don't forget
about that, man. I don't appreciate that too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He can consider the favor repaid, with interest.

STARS REBOUND FROM LOSS WITH VICTORY AGAINST BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars have followed nine of their 12 losses this
season with a victory, so it was no surprise yesterday when they
outlasted the St. Louis Blues, 4-3, before the 27th consecutive
sellout crowd of 16,928 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Despite coming off a 2-1 loss in Buffalo 40 hours earlier,
despite playing their fourth game in less than six nights, despite
missing Brett Hull with a pulled hamstring and losing Darryl Sydor
to a knee strain (day-to-day) during the game, the Stars did what
it took to dispose of a struggling Blues team in desperate need of
a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was good for us. To come off the road and score four
goals, it was good,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We saw this
as a game that we wanted to put a lot into. Whatever we had, we
wanted to put into today. And the tradeoff was we'll take some time
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Today and tomorrow mark the first time the Stars have
consecutive open dates since Feb. 10-11 _ a span of 24 days and 14
games. Yet, during that 14-game stretch _ one of the Stars'
toughest _ they went 10-2-2 and separated themselves from the rest
of the Western Conference, if not the entire NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars move to 40-12-10 with the victory, good for 90 points.
They are 18 points better than the next-closest team in the Western
Conference and 10 points better than the Ottawa Senators, who lead
the East. While other leaders battle occasional slumps, the Stars'
worst was 2-4-2 in January.
</P>
<P>
   A good reason for the consistent winning has been the play of
goalie Roman Turek. While the backup to No. 1 goalie Ed Belfour,
Turek boasts some of the best statistics in the NHL. With
yesterday's victory, he moves to 12-2-2 with a 1.96 goals-against
average and a .921 save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's a backup in name only,'' Hitchcock said. ``He has
all the qualities that a good starting goalie has. It's a great
luxury to have that, and I think that's a big part of your team. We
have two goaltenders we feel confident in.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Turek stopped 31 shots, including 14 of 15 in a
hectic first period in which the Blues had three power-play
chances. The Blues couldn't solve Turek until Al MacInnis hit on a
five-on-three power play at the 18:31 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Stars had scored twice on Blues goalie Jim Carey, a
free-agent addition making his first start for St. Louis. The
24-year-old Carey, a Vezina Trophy winner as top goalie, is trying
to make a comeback after fizzling out with the Washington Capitals
and Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock put together the line of Mike Modano, Jere Lehtinen
and Joe Nieuwendyk for the power play yesterday, and that line
scored the first two goals. Modano fed Lehtinen in the slot for an
easy goal 18 seconds after the Stars' first power-play opportunity
had expired, and Modano then whipped a wrister in from 30 feet
away, 19 seconds into their second power-play chance for a 2-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The second goal broke a Stars' 0-for-30 power-play drought that
stretched back eight games.
</P>
<P>
   After the MacInnis score, Jamie Langenbrunner scored off a
perfect feed from Tony Hrkac at the 3:06 mark of the second period
for his 11th goal of the season, and Verbeek whipped in his 15th
goal of the season off a feed from Nieuwendyk at the 16:41 mark of
the second to give the Stars a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   While the Blues scored twice in the third, including a
long-distance shot from Chris McAlpine that was fumbled by Turek
and made the game's final three minutes a lot more exciting, the
Stars were able to earn a day of rest with the victory that dropped
the Blues to 26-26-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a day off feels like a week,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's
real important for our group right now. The tank is a little low,
our energy is a little down, and that's why I feel it was good that
we battled hard against a desperate team today.''

PALMEIRO OUT 4 TO 6 WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rangers first baseman Rafael Palmeiro is
in peril of going on the disabled list for the first time in his
major-league career. He could find backup first baseman Mike Simms
right there with him.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro underwent surgery yesterday to repair torn medial
meniscus cartilage in his right knee. Dr. John Conway, who
performed the surgery in Fort Worth, said Palmeiro could be
sidelined four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little better,'' Rangers general manager Doug Melvin
said. ``I was sort of expecting the worst to happen. Conway doesn't
rule out him being ready for Opening Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway said the medial meniscus cartilage isn't related to the
articular cartilage that was repaired surgically Feb. 10. Conway
said there was evidence at that time that the medial meniscus
cartilage was showing ``some degeneration,'' but they decided
against surgery, believing it could be years before Palmeiro might
injure it.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmeiro, who was about a week away from playing in
exhibition games, felt more pain in the knee jogging in the
outfield Thursday and returned to Texas to have the knee examined.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are four weeks away from their April 5 opener
against the Detroit Tigers. The Rangers signed Palmeiro to a
five-year, $45 million contract in the off-season in part because
he had a much better history of staying healthy than Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be easy for us, but that's part of the
game,'' outfielder Juan Gonzalez said. ``We just need him to come
back strong as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers heard worse news on Simms, their right-handed
designated hitter. A second doctor looked at his X-rays and
determined he could have a more serious tear in his Achilles'
tendon, causing him to miss a substantial amount of time. He is
expected to undergo more tests this week.
</P>
<P>
   Simms' injury leaves Lee Stevens as the only healthy first
baseman/designated hitter with major-league experience in camp.
Scott Sheldon could play first base in an emergency. Roberto Kelly
and Luis Alicea could fill in at designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said it's unlikely the two injuries would open up a spot
for the younger prospects such as Ruben Mateo, Shawn Gallagher,
Mike Zywica and Carlos Pena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're better off going out and playing, but I won't rule it
out,'' Melvin said. ``It's still to early to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he might try to pick up a right-handed bat off the
waiver wire or in a minor trade, but it's unlikely the Rangers
would make a major move.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make a trade and two weeks later have to get rid of
someone,'' Melvin said. ``You'd like to keep your trade inventory
for pitching. It may come down to Stevens playing against
left-handers for a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is a career .265 hitter against right-handers but only
.214 against left-handers. He and Simms were expected to platoon at
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be nice to have the opportunity to play against
left-handers, but we need to put the best lineup on the field
possible,'' Stevens said. ``Mike and Roberto Kelly have great
numbers against left-handers. I want to play against left-handers.
I look at it as a challenge. Hopefully they'll have confidence to
throw me out there, but Johnny has to put his best team out
there.''

HORNED FROGS' BUBBLE BURSTS AND OUT FALLS NIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU forward Shannon Long listened intently
as NCAA Tournament brackets were being announced on CBS yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled as soon as he heard Gonzaga and Southwest Missouri
State were in, two teams TCU defeated this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we were in, too,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   He figured wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, TCU (19-10) settled for a trip to Manhattan, Kan., to
play Kansas State (20-12) in the National Invitation Tournament at
8 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just put it this way,'' Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs
said. ``I know politics enough to know not to expect to see TCU in.
... Did we deserve to be in? I don't think so, but I saw a lot of
people up there who didn't deserve to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU had a stronger Ratings Percentage Index than two bubble
teams selected for at-large slots _ Mississippi (19-12) and New
Mexico (24-8).
</P>
<P>
   The RPI is derived from three factors: Division I winning
percentage, schedule strength and opponents' schedule strength.
Games against non-Division I opponents are not used in calculating
the RPI.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs and his Horned Frogs had an RPI of 41, yet they lost six
of their final 10 games and lost to Brigham Young in the first
round of the Western Athletic Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   TCU was among 49 teams listed on the tournament committee's
``other teams considered'' list. The Frogs' 19-10 record didn't
stack up well. Of those 49 teams, there were 18 with 20 or more
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three weeks or a month ago, TCU was one of those teams you
would have figured would make the field,'' said committee chairman
C.M Newton, athletic director at Kentucky. ``They just needed to
win a game or two late, particularly in their tournament. BYU just
drilled them. They finished on a down tick.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said he had been hoping for an NCAA bid, though hardly
expecting one.
</P>
<P>
   He figured TCU would at least be given an NIT game at
Daniel-Meyer Coliseum. He also figured wrong there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, fellow WAC schools Colorado State (17-10) and Wyoming
(17-9) were given home games while TCU travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hasn't been a good year as far as breaks go,'' Tubbs
said. ``Maybe, we're better off on the road to start off.''
</P>
<P>
   He has to play a Wildcats squad that just returned from a pretty
strong Big 12 tournament performance, getting victories over Texas
A&AMP;M and Missouri before losing to Kansas in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've got a terrific team, and why they didn't play
as well down the stretch, I don't know,'' Wildcats coach Tom Asbury
said. ``A game that I remember was when \RTCU\S played Iowa State
in Puerto Rico last season. They absolutely dismembered Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got an NCAA-caliber team in my way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs thought so, too.
</P>
<P>
   A season marked by a suspension to Lee Nailon, a four-game
losing streak, injuries to Nailon and Marquise Gainous and
back-to-back, season-ending losses to Tulsa and BYU conspired to
prove him wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not a bubble team at one time,'' Tubbs said. ``We put
ourselves on the bubble.''

BIG 12 TEAMS FACE TRYING MATCHUPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In what many considered a down year, the Big
12 nevertheless landed five teams in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Five conference teams also made the field of 64 in 1997, but
only four were in last year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Big Ten with seven and the Southeastern Conference with
six gained more berths this year. The Big East also had five. But
judging by the seeding, the NCAA Tournament committee doesn't
expect either Kansas (No. 6), Texas (No. 7), Missouri (No. 8),
Oklahoma State (No. 9) or Oklahoma (No. 13) to survive past the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas survives its opening game against 11th-seed
Evansville, the Jayhawks will likely be looking at second-seeded
Kentucky in the Midwest. Texas has 10th-seeded Purdue, but then
would look to a probable game against the East's No. 2 seed in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our seeding,'' Kansas coach Roy Williams said. ``I just
wanted to be there. I thought we might have played our way to a
five seed, but I thought going in we would probably be a six.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks are accustomed to playing as a much-higher seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is different when you're a No. 1 or No. 2 seed,'' Williams
said. ``You're always going to get someone who is not as gifted or
doesn't have the same number of scholarships. But we're not in that
situation right now. We're happy going to New Orleans, and I just
hope we play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas guard Ryan Robertson said he also likes the Jayhawks'
slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of years everyone expected us to be in the
Final Four or win the national championship,'' he said. ``Now we
have a chance to go in without those expectations and do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State is in a toss-up game with eighth-seeded Syracuse,
but then likely would go up against the South's No. 1 seed in
Auburn. Missouri faces the same dilemma in the West, opening
against No. 9 seed New Mexico in the same part of the bracket with
the region's top seed, Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy to be in the tournament,'' Cowboys coach
Eddie Sutton said. ``Had we not played well the past three weeks,
we wouldn't be in it. And I was happy to see the conference get
five teams in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That eight-nine is not the right place to be. I've seen Auburn
play, though, and if we're fortunate enough to get by Syracuse, I
think our team can play with Auburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Selection committee chairman C.M. Newton explained his nine-man
group doesn't look at conferences once the automatic bid has been
determined. But he did say that in his mind, both Oklahoma State
and Kansas improved their eventual seeds by advancing to the finals
of the Big 12 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who entered the week as a tenuous bubble team,
gained the most by winning three games in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question they won their way in,'' Newton said.
``They certainly didn't hurt themselves any this weekend. They did
what they had to do _ win some basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas \Ralso improved\S by winning the tournament. We never
had them seeded anywhere, actually, but in my own mind Kansas did
improve themselves. You never hurt yourself by winning basketball
games. I never saw an ugly win'' in the selection process.

regulators to predict a television signal's reach say it should.
Drawn in the 1950s to prevent signal interference, the maps are at

interview she acknowledged that the search for another self was a

we can truly know another person.'' By Mel Gussow.

MARCH MADNESS IS COMING TO TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
 TOURNEY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The final destination is St. Petersburg, Fla., and the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   For No. 1 Duke, the opening act will begin Friday, much closer
to home, in Charlotte, N.C., against 16th-seeded Florida A&AMP;M in one
of the more notable David vs. Goliath battles in NCAA Tournament
history.
</P>
<P>
   But before Duke can get that far, it will have to contend with a
couple of teams who will be involved in a historic occasion as the
NCAA Tournament makes its first-ever stop in Boston, which will
host first- and second-round games in the East Regional at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   It should be quite a show, with No. 2 seed Miami heading a
regional grouping that is as physical as any in memory, ranging
from No. 3 seed Cincinnati, the only team to beat Duke this season,
to such physical clubs as No. 6 Temple, No. 7 Texas, and No. 10
Purdue. Even No. 11 seed Kent is not afraid to mix it up.
</P>
<P>
   Count on next Sunday's doubleheader in Boston to have the
feeling of a heavyweight title fight. The two winners will move on
to the regional finals at the Meadowlands, where the prospect of
meeting Duke looms large.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Blue Devils make it to the Final Four, as most
everyone figures they will, they could very well be banged up and
worn down by one of the teams playing in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 college basketball season, following a course that
has emerged the last several weeks, has become a curious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, so overwhelming against so many opponents for so long. And
. . . the rest of the NCAA Tournament field.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is questioning that Duke is the No. 1 team,'' said
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun, who has a pretty good team himself,
one that will begin its quest for its first Final Four appearance
in the West Regionals in Denver Thursday against No. 16 seed
Texas-San Antonio. ``But we think we can play the game ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   So can teams such as Auburn and Michigan State, the tournament's
other No. 1 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Some other teams who can play the game will have to come from
off the pace, such as Ohio State (23-8), the No. 4 seed in the
South. The Buckeyes have staged a stunning turnaround from last
year's 8-22 mark under former Boston College coach Jim O'Brien, who
was named Big Ten coach of the year and has an outside chance at
being named national coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Or there is a team like Miami, which, under coach Leonard
Hamilton, has gone from worst to nearly first in the Big East,
chalking up some remarkable road wins against UConn, St. John's,
and Syracuse in roaring to a 22-6 record. The Hurricanes are a No.
2 seed who will play in Boston, facing Patriot League champion
Lafayette Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For those looking for someone other than Duke to place as the
final team in your bracket (for recreational purposes only, of
course), consider teams with experienced guards.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-and-done format of the NCAA Tournament, guard play is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why a team like Ohio State, which has former BC star
Scoonie Penn and the multitalented Michael Redd in its backcourt,
could emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Maryland, which became much better with the arrival
of guard Steve Francis, a junior college transfer from Alleghany.
</P>
<P>
   Look out for Arizona, which may have the best player in the
country in guard Jason Terry. As the No. 4 seed in the Midwest, the
Wildcats can make another run if they can get past No. 13 Oklahoma
in the first round, then a tough second-round game against the
winner of UNC-Charlotte-Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count out defending national champion Kentucky, which is
led by former Beaver Country Day standout Wayne Turner, who is
looking to be one of the few players in NCAA history to participate
in four consecutive national championship games. The Wildcats are
finally playing well, coming off their victory over Arkansas Sunday
in the Souteastern Conference tournament championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it will be Utah, which comes in as one of the hottest
teams in the country and is counting on 6-foot-2-inch senior Andre
Miller to lead it to back-to-back national championship games.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a UConn fan, don't count on the Huskies breaking the
Final Four frontier without strong peformances from point guard
Khalid El-Amin and Ricky Moore, who may be the best defensive guard
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it all probably will come back to Duke, which does
not appear to have any weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Duke comes into the tournament as the most prohibitive favorite
since unbeaten Nevada-Las Vegas in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, lost to . . . Duke and coach Mike Krzyzewski.

TOO WEAK TO PUT UP ITS DUKES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ I've done the requisite research. The record margin of
victory in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament is 69 points.
Loyola of Chicago abused Tennessee Tech by a 111-42 score en route
to winning the championship in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   It's a factoid worth noting, inasmuch as we have an on-paper
mismatch of colossal proportions scheduled for Friday in Charlotte,
N.C. Duke, the No. 1 seed in the East, will play No. 16 Florida
A&AMP;M. This may be historic, even by 1 vs. 16 standards.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is, well, Duke. The top-ranked Blue Devils are pulverizing
people, and it doesn't seem to matter if they don't have all their
players. Shane Battier or no Shane Battier, Trajan Langdon or no
Trajan Langdon, Duke trashes everyone.
</P>
<P>
   What Florida A&AMP;M has going for it are two things: a great
nickname (Rattlers) and a noted band. Basketball? The Rattlers may
have won the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Tournament, but
they're still, ahem, 12-18.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? Duke is 32-1. The Rattlers have won 32 games in the
last three seasons, and 48 in the last six. There isn't much of a
hoop thing going on down there in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   But here they are. Bring on the Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers lost an exhibition game to a team from
basketball-challenged Denmark, for God's sake. Then they went out
and lost their first 10 games of the regular season. Injuries
reduced coach Mickey Clayton's roster to eight players. They've got
an RPI ranking of 270 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Can't knock their timing, though. They picked a nice time to go
on a four-game winning streak, the last three of which constituted
the MEAC Tournament. They knocked off Coppin State the first night,
took care of Morgan State the next night, and disposed of South
Carolina State the night after that. Time to break out the finery.
For the first time in school history, they're going to the Big
Dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't even measure this on the Richter scale,'' says St.
Claire Murraine, who covers the team for the Tallahassee Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Florida A&AMP;M has given us Bob Hayes, Althea Gibson, and Vince
Coleman. It has that fabulous band. The school's academic prowess
earned it College of the Year honors last year from Time Magazine.
``If this were a `Brain Bowl,' '' maintains Murraine, ``they'd have
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   No, unfortunately, the issue is basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Krzyzewski is running the best basketball program in
America. The people at Duke want to have a great team, and so Coach
K has all the needed resources to build one. If he wants a player,
he can go after him, even if, like Langdon, he happens to come from
Alaska. Duke may be the ultimate national program.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit different at A&AMP;M. ``Mickey Clayton has no
secretary,'' reports Democrat columnist John Nogowski. ``He has to
take care of all his own correspondence and make all the
transportation arrangements for the team. I know for a fact he had
to reach into his own pocket this year to help feed the team when
meal money fell short.''
</P>
<P>
   When Coach K heads to a tournament game, he doesn't have to
worry about anything. Clayton isn't so lucky. Consider his trip to
the airport for the trip to the MEAC Tourney in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletic department bus was late,'' Clayton explains. ``So
we got players to take their own cars, trying to make our flight.
It's storming and raining, and all of a sudden a guy hits my car,
broadside. Totals it.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach was OK, but if that doesn't sum up a year that starts
0-10, what does?
</P>
<P>
   ``My players are walking around saying, `Coach, you OK?' It's
just been that kind of season,'' Clayton says. ``Everything that
could go wrong did go wrong. But we knew that if we hung in there,
something positive would come from all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those positives were 37 points from feisty guard Monroe
Pippins against Coppin State and 31 from 6-foot-10-inch center
Kevin George against Morgan State. Tourney MVP Pippins threw in 22
more in the upset over South Carolina State in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Who could possibly measure what this opportunity to put a team
on the floor against Coach K and mighty Duke will mean to Mickey
Clayton? The mentor is a 1975 A&AMP;M grad and the son of an A&AMP;M grad.
He formerly coached the Rattlers' women's team, and it was a rocky
tenure, to say the least. His teams won more than their share, but
some of his players objected to what they considered to be Captain
Bligh tactics, and there was a player rebellion that ultimately
cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed on at the University in a nonathletic capacity, and,
in time, according to Nogowski, ``some of the girls who quit the
team became good friends of his.'' Meanwhile, the men's program was
going nowhere, and when a change was needed two years ago, guess
who got the call?
</P>
<P>
   It's a team of basic nonshooters, but it will pound the glass
and it will scrap for 48 minutes on defense, contesting every pass.
Murraine thinks the guards might have ``10 minutes of good
basketball in them'' against Duke, but he genuinely fears for the
safety of the frontcourt against the likes of Elton Brand and
Battier because ``there is no muscle on those bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of Coach K's mercy may be tested in this one. Duke
has been beating up on legitimate teams by an average of more than
25 points all season long. He might have to institute a 10-pass
rule to keep his team under 120 in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the Rattlers are smiling. There may not be a happier
bunch in America. Things will be different on Friday. They will be
standing on the beach, looking at the oncoming tsunami. If you're a
God-fearing man, you might say a prayer for the Rattlers in the
hopes that Loyola will still hold the record when this one is over.

CELTICS RAPPED BY RAPTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ With 6:59 remaining in Sunday's game, the Boston
broadcast crew filled out its request sheet for postgame
interviews. Under the column headlined `If Raptors Win,' there were
three names. Under the column `If Opponent Wins,' there were none.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics got their first look at the Air Canada Centre and
their second look at the Raptors, which was a lot like the
unappealing first. Toronto manhandled the Celtics in the
season-opener in Boston and did the same thing here, taking a
105-92 victory that was not as close as the final score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were never in this one after a short Dee Brown
jumper made it 37-26 with 6:58 left in the first half. From that
point on, the Celtics never got closer than 11 and trailed by as
many as 19 in the third and 24 in the fourth. Toronto got a big
game from skywalking rookie Vince Carter (26 points) and
overpowered Boston on the boards, 54-32, to send Boston back below
.500 on the first game of a five-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's twice in a row (against Toronto) that we've been
physically dominated inside. That's their strength and that's our
weakness,'' coach Rick Pitino said. ``Give credit to them. They
have physical players inside who are hurting us.''
</P>
<P>
   Old paint Charles Oakley, wearing cornrows instead of
dreadlocks, led the domination with 13 rebounds. Doug Christie had
nine and Kevin Willis seven. The starting frontcourt for the
Celtics _ Paul Pierce, Antoine Walker, and Tony Battie _ had 10
rebounds between them, none on the offensive glass.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors' constant pounding inside paid off at the line,
which had been a source of concern before the game. Coach Butch
Carter openly fumed when his team was awarded seven free throws to
Orlando's 34 last Friday, saying his players weren't getting the
calls. That was not an issue Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors were rewarded for their rough-housing, collecting 41
free throws to Boston's 25. That proved to be the scoring
difference, for each team was 37 of 82 from the field with the
Celtics making four threes to the Raptors' one. Walker, who led
Boston with 29 points, was 4 for 11 from the line as the Celtics
missed almost half (12) of their 25 freebies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything away from them,'' said Walker,
who was 11 of 16 from the field, ``but we feel we can beat them
with the game plan we have. But we didn't execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed Pitino, ``Our game plan was, `Don't let them dominate
us.' But they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The game also matched up two of the league's top rookies in
Carter and Pierce, who spent much of the afternoon guarding each
other. Pierce finished with only 7 points _ 5 coming after the
Celtics fell behind by 24 in the fourth _ and didn't have a steal.
(He did block two shots, one of them a Carter turnaround.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing for me,'' Pierce said. ``You don't like
to lose a game when your man does it against you.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no key stretch or defining breakout moment. Boston
actually had a 3-point lead, 11-8, after a free throw by Ron Mercer
(22 points). Toronto then scored 8 straight, 4 by the acrobatic
Tracy McGrady, to take the lead for good. From then on, it was all
Toronto, all the time, all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out flat,'' said Kenny Anderson, still perceived here
as an ingrate for refusing a deal to Toronto. ``Give them credit.
They came out and played well. There's not really too much to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The Raptors led by 7 after one, by 12 at the half,
and by 17 after three. The Celtics then went the first 4:13 of the
fourth without a basket (scoring just 2 points in that span) to
fall behind by the aforementioned 24. A late rally might have had
some gamblers anxious, but did nothing to alter the already assured
outcome.

POOR MIDDLE MANAGEMENT BY BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Coach Pat Burns has dubbed this ``The Week.''
</P>
<P>
   During that time, and especially after this Saturday's game in
Buffalo is in the books, it's likely the Bruins will get a good
idea just what kind of shape they're in with regard to the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Boston blew a golden chance to gain some much needed
breathing room on its challengers for the final spot in the Eastern
Conference playoff hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored a pair of goals in the second period and
added another in the third and goalie Mike Richter had 37 saves on
the way to a 3-1 New York victory at the FleetCenter. The Rangers
are unbeaten since Wayne Gretzky went out of the lineup with a neck
injury (4-0-1).
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, now just 2 points ahead of the Rangers, have lost
two of their last three and it doesn't get any easier. Tuesday
night they host the Florida Panthers, who are 3 points behind them.
Then they have a rematch with the Rangers in New York Friday and
face the Sabres in Buffalo the next night to round out the week.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the Bruins just didn't get the job done. They played a
so-so first period, which ended scoreless. The highlights included
a couple of great saves by Byron Dafoe on Adam Graves on the
doorstep, Jason Allison missing an open net, and Ken Belanger being
tossed out for boarding defenseman Ulf Samuelsson, knocking
Samuelsson out of the game, and giving the Rangers a five-minute
power play that was knocked down to three when Kevin Stevens took a
goaltender interference penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, John MacLean put the Rangers ahead with a goal at
4:32 and Niklas Sundstrom made it 2-0 at 15:14 on a shorthanded
goal. Boston had plenty of chances, including during a two-man
advantage, but couldn't make them count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in the second period,'' said Burns. ``I think
that was the turning point of the whole game. The first period we
came out all right. The third period was too little, too late. The
second period was the killer. This time of year, you've got to put
three periods together. You can't have a 20-minute break. For some
reason or another, I'd like to know why in a game of such
importance, in the second period, we just weren't on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third, the Bruins outshot New York, 15-4, but only got
one past Richter. Landon Wilson made it 2-1 at 12:25 but just over
a minute later, former Bruin Stevens sealed it with a goal at
13:51.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of looked at this week,'' said Dafoe, who had 15
saves. ``Obviously, it's not the start we wanted for it, but now
we've got Florida, the Rangers and Buffalo; they're three huge
games and we've got to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter was named the No. 1 star of the game but the fact of the
matter was, the Bruins made him look even better than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good goaltender and he's been known to win big
games,'' said Dafoe. ``You knew that none of the goals were going
to come easy and he definitely didn't give us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What was most disappointing for the Bruins was the lack of
production from the top line of Allison, Dmitri Khristich, and
Anson Carter. The three combined for a total of four shots.
Khristich played just over 20 minutes, Carter a little under that,
and Allison played 22 shifts for a total of 27:26, second only to
Ray Bourque in ice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need contributions from our big players,'' said Burns.
``Our big players didn't contribute a lot (Sunday). We need them to
win hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said it was frustrating to not be able to build on their
big victory over the Devils in New Jersey Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game that we blew and it was a big game for us and a
big loss for us,'' he said. ``No excuse, we didn't play good enough
to win it. We made it easy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And harder on themselves.

STEVENS GOAL IS A SNAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Snap your fingers. That's how quickly Rangers center
Marc Savard gave Kevin Stevens the puck on a play in the third
period against the Bruins Sunday. Savard was racing down the left
side, and he fed a pass to Stevens in the right slot.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the former Bruin, snapped in his 16th goal of the
season, the final tally in the Rangers' 3-1 win over Boston at the
FleetCenter. The goal, at the 13:51 mark, came just a minute and a
half after the Bruins had made it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Rangers are just 2 points behind the Bruins in
the fight for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference. The teams meet again Friday in New York, and the
Rangers, who are 4-0-1 in their last five games, have six of their
next eight at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came out over the blue line and I noticed that (Bruins
goalie Byron) Dafoe was kind of cheating, like he thought I was
going to shoot the whole time,'' Savard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I looked for another option, and I saw Kevin. I faked a
shot and slid it to Kevin and he put it in. Kevin's just a good
player and he was in the right position at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Stevens, Rangers left wing John MacLean helped on
the play by driving hard to the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``That opened the side, and I was able to one-time it,'' said
Stevens, the former Boston College standout who lives in Duxbury
and is from Pembroke. ``That was a turning point in the game. If
the Bruins had five or six minutes left, they would have gotten
rolling, they'd get some room there and we might have had
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was hugging the post. On the pass to Stevens, Dafoe darted
to the right side, and Stevens had a lot of net to shoot at.
``Savard is a good passer,'' said Stevens, who notched his 35th
point. ``He's a guy who gets a lot of points that way. He's an
up-and-comer; he makes big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who has 11 points (six goals) in his last 14 games,
actually never noticed how open the net was. ``I never even
looked,'' he said. ``If you don't look, it's awfully tough to see
the hole. It was a bang-bang play. You get rid of the puck, that's
what you've got to do. You sit there and you let them set up, then
you've got problems. The quicker you get rid of it . . . that's
what I did, just try to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said it wasn't more special because of his struggles
while with the Bruins in 1995-96, when he had 10 goals and 23
points in 41 games before he was traded to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it means anything extra, but it's nice to beat
them,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a team I like to beat and it's a team we have
to beat at this point of the year. We have them again Friday, and
if we can keep climbing, that's another big game. This is a team
we're chasing, this is a team we have to catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game we needed to win. Would you rather be behind 6
points or behind 2 points? This was the biggest game of the year
for us.''

CANDIDATE OF RULING PARTY DECLARES VICTORY IN PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating and rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ The candidate of the conservative
governing party, a philosopher with a reputation for consensus
building, declared victory in Sunday's presidential elections,
based on early official results and the party's own sampling
showing him in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Flores, 39, the candidate of the governing Nationalist
Republican Alliance, known as Arena, campaigned on promises to
solve problems of crime and unemployment that afflict the country
seven years after the end of its civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a crowd of supporters shortly before midnight,
Flores thanked them for their work and then seemed to embrace the
party's murky past despite his fresh-face image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's remember the values of our founder,'' he said. ``Let's
remember Roberto d'Aubuisson,'' he said of Arena's main founder, a
cashiered army major who died in 1992 and who was repeatedly cited
by human rights groups as an organizer of the death squads that
accounted for many of the civil war fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were held on the eve of President Clinton's
four-day visit to Central America to survey the damage inflicted by
Hurricane Mitch late last year and, according to a senior State
Department official, to celebrate the region's democratic
transformation after the civil wars of the 1980s, particularly the
elections in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Arena said it had taken an early ballot sampling showing that
Flores had won about 53 percent of the vote, enough to avoid a
runoff election, and his chief opponent, Facundo Guardado, 44,
getting about 27 percent. Guardado was the candidate of a coalition
led by the country's former guerrilla movement, the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front
</P>
<P>
   Arena's figures closely matched early official results, based on
tallies from almost one-quarter of the balloting places. Of the
286,000 votes counted, Flores received about 51 percent and
Guardado about 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition party rejected Arena's numbers, saying it would
wait for the official count.
</P>
<P>
   Among five other candidates, Ruben Zamora, the coalition's
choice in the last election who this year ran under his own
Democratic Center Union, was third, with about 11 percent of the
vote according to Arena's figures and 9 percent based on early
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout among 3.1 million registered voters appeared low after a
campaign dominated by the grave problems that Salvadorans have
inherited since their 12-year civil war ended, including rampant
crime, unemployment and poverty. The presidential vote was only
their second since the war's end.
</P>
<P>
   Such apathy, political analysts said, demonstrates a loss of
faith in the effectiveness of government since peace arrived in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that despite the end of the war, the fundamental
problems of the country have not been solved like they had
expected,'' said Jose Miguel Cruz, the director of the Public
Opinion Institute at the Central American University. ``They say
we've had war, elections, peace accords and more elections, and we
still have violence and problems of unemployment and poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Two out of three Salvadorans had little or no interest in this
election, according to a survey last month by the public opinion
institute. The reasons, it found, ranged from mistrust of
politicians to skepticism that the vote could make a difference in
solving the country's problems or improving living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But the disillusionment of Salvadorans was not enough to turn
many voters away from Arena, which suffered serious losses to the
party of the former guerrillas in municipal and legislative
elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the polls opened on Sunday, Flores, a philosopher
with a fresh face and no ties to the civil war, was favored to win,
though it was unclear whether he would gain enough votes to avoid a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition party led by the former rebels, after much
infighting, had rejected broadening its appeal and settled on
Guardado, a moderate ex-guerrilla commander who had pushed for the
selection of a centrist candidate from an allied party. Guardado's
war credentials and Flores's resume, which includes studies in
Indian philosophy and a bachelor's degree in political science from
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, seemed to leave many
voters unable to see an alternative beyond Arena, however
dissatisfied they might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Francisco Flores seems to me more capable, better educated,''
said Raul Avila, 68, a tailor who said he had been held up twice in
recent years during the day. ``No government is ideal but the hope
we all have is that he can begin solving the most serious problems
of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Avila voted at the fairgrounds here where 69,000 Salvadorans
were registered to vote. If the overall turnout was low, spirits
were high on Sunday, as throngs filed into cavernous pavilions to
cast their ballots at cardboard podiums.

MONSTER ROUND AT DORAL 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As Steve Elkington's caddie, Gypsy Grillo, walked off
the tee Sunday after his boss split the fairway on the first hole
of the Doral Open over the storied Blue Monster course, he gave a
thumbs-up sign to someone he recognized in the gallery. ``Nothing
to it,'' Grillo said later. ``I just knew we had to shoot a low
round.'' So they did.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington began the day in a group of 10 tied for 21st place.
But even though he finished with a bogey on the infamous 18th hole
and had to sit for an hour, Elkington's 64_275 totals brought him
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington, who won this tournament two years ago and the PGA
Championship in a playoff against Colin Montgomerie in 1995 at
Riviera in addition to a pair of Players Championships in Ponte
Vedra, Fla., had six straight birdies starting at the par-4 sixth.
``I never thought of winning until I was leading,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no lack of challengers in a field that the area media
played up as below Doral's normal standards in the wake of the
World Match Play Championship, with its $5 million purse, last week
at La Costa. But they all destructed, with Ernie Els (70_277)
taking a six on the 18th and runner-up Greg Kraft (71_276) hitting
a fat 5-iron into the pond on the closing hole.
</P>
<P>
   This turned out to be a beguiling final round, even if Els was
the only one of the world's Top 7 to show up, and he did so only
because he lost to Paul Azinger in the first round of match play
the previous week. Els ended up tied for third with David Toms
(67), who started with two consecutive eagles, Tommy Armour III
(68), Jay Haas (68), and Scott Dunlap (69). Elkington earned
$540,000.
</P>
<P>
   With light breezes and temperatures approaching 80, it was a
picture-perfect round.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington, who long has owned one of the game's best swings but
has had a series of ailments that have affected his play, started
by nailing a 3-wood second shot to 50 feet on the inviting par-5
opening hole and taking two putts for birdie. He then lofted a
wedge to 10 feet on the second for another birdie.
</P>
<P>
   The longer birdie string started on the sixth when his wedge
second shot nestled in 2 feet from the cup, and he followed it with
birdies on the seventh (8-iron, 20 feet), eighth (bunker, 1 foot),
ninth (8-iron, 10 feet), 10th (two putts, 20 feet), and 11th
(7-iron, 12 feet). He three-putted the 13th for bogey, then
penciled in two more birdies on the 16th (sand wedge, 15 feet) and
17th (8-iron, 2 feet) before his second putt on the 18th rimmed
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little upset,'' said Elkington after the bogey on 18.
``I felt I let everybody back in. It was never my tournament to
start with, then I got a hold of it and dropped the ball. I didn't
putt that bad. It was a straight putt, and Gypsy and I felt it just
may curve a little bit. I played it just inside the center. I felt
I hit it pretty good. It was a pretty severe lip-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkington has been known to storm out of the pack. ``The first
tournament I won was the Greater Greensboro Open in 1990,'' he
said, ``and I finished early so they didn't have me on TV.'' He was
actually in danger of missing the cut, but made birdies on four of
the last six holes. ``I wanted to keep it tidy,'' he said of
Sunday's finish. ``I didn't want to leave any crumbs out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, but Kraft's finish cost him a chance at a playoff to
possibly win for the first time on the PGA Tour. ``I just hit a fat
5-iron into the water,'' he said. He had struggled early in his
round, making the turn in 36, but birdies on the 10th and 12th
brought him into a tie with Elkington. The bogey on the 18th did
him in.
</P>
<P>
   Els also saw his chances of victory go by the boards when his
second shot on 18 went left and into the rough just above the
water. He tried to chop it out, but it rolled back and almost went
into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Horgan of Newport, R.I., finished 68_278 to tie for eighth
and earn his biggest paycheck of $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Sisk of Marshfield, Mass., tied for 19th with 69_281
totals, and picked up $29,000.

RED SOX GOOD FIT FOR FISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ ``I'm sweating,'' Carlton Fisk said,
fingering the Red Sox cap on the table before him.
</P>
<P>
   He looked to his wife, Linda, for help. ``How's it look?'' he
said, fitting the cap snugly on his head. ``This is the longest my
hair has ever been any time I've worn a cap. Do you put your ears
inside it?''
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, a perfect fit, just as it was from the time
he first put one on 30 years ago. Carlton Fisk, who may be 51 and
the grandfather of five-month-old Grace McAvoy but still has days
he's certain he still could play, is back with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The title: Special assistant to general manager Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to reintroduce him to the fans of New England,''
Duquette said Sunday at the press conference that made Fisk's
hiring official.
</P>
<P>
   The job: It's evolving, but for now, Fisk's plans are to work
with the team's young catchers and do some public relations work
for the club. ``You'll find I'm not politically correct,'' he said.
``I'm somewhat blunt at times. But all the time it will be the
truth. I don't think I'll ever skirt an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects to be on the field in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Yogi-ism if there ever was one,'' said Fisk,
invoking the master of baseball malapropisms, Yogi Berra, ``but I
told my wife as we were driving down here, `There are a lot of
things I know that I didn't even know I knew.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where I can make a contribution, and that's with the
catching corps.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits: Obvious to the Red Sox. There is no downside to a
future Hall of Famer and New England native son setting aside the
bitterness he once harbored toward the Olde Towne Team and claiming
it as his own again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlton's presence,'' Duquette said, ``upgrades the entire
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk had so much leverage to make this deal, he should have
asked Duquette to throw in Fenway's left-field foul pole, the one
on which he placed the stamp of history with his 1975 World Series
home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to let you keep it,'' Fisk said to Duquette. ``Just
put it somewhere I can see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette told Fisk that in all likelihood, the foul pole will be
part of any new stadium the Red Sox build. And Fisk, for all that
Fenway Park has meant to him, made it clear that while he hasn't
been asked to be front man for the team's push for a new ballpark,
he supports the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't drive a car that's 100 years old,'' he said,
``because it wouldn't work very well. And you don't want to
continue to play in a ballpark that doesn't work very well. Bring
the memories with you to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette already has figured out how Fisk can help usher in a
new era of Sox baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to groom Steve Lomasney to be our Opening Day
catcher in the new ballpark,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Lomasney, the 21-year-old son of the Peabody (Mass.) Lomasneys,
hit a game-tying home run in the bottom of the ninth inning of
Sunday's 7-6, 10-inning win over the Texas Rangers. Not only was
Fisk in City of Palms Park for that one, but so were Ed and Joyce
Lomasney, the rookie's parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you said that you were going to give a sign for the boys
back home,'' said winning pitcher Derek Lowe, who gave up the tying
run on a bloop hit in the ninth inning but struck out four of the
six batters he faced. ``And you forgot all about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lomasney, who was an All-Scholastic football player at Peabody
High, knew that Sunday's exhibition was televised back to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did tell Derek that I wanted to do something special for my
friends to let them know I'm out there,'' he said. ``Hopefully,
they saw the home run.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 19 years since Fisk's separation from the Red Sox,
when Haywood Sullivan forgot to put his contract offer in the mail
during an ugly salary dispute, an omission that made Fisk a free
agent. He went on to finish his career with the Chicago White Sox,
but his parting there left an equally acrid taste, as he warred
with owner Jerry Reinsdorf and was unceremoniously released in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Other than serving as a volunteer coach for his son Casey's
college team at Illinois State, Fisk stayed away from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bitter and angry at both of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't resist the siren's call forever. Duquette has
been talking to him about a job for five years, and Sunday, Fisk
said the idea of actually accepting may have taken root 18 months
ago, when he was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a long time ago,'' Fisk said of his falling-out with
the Sox. ``The people who caused that situation are not here
anymore, as opposed to the Red Sox or the people of New England or
the game of baseball. This is a new start, a fresh start. There's
no part of the previous regime behind doors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you,'' he added, ``just carrying that cap in here,
my hands and arms were sweating. What will I feel, putting the
uniform on again? Thinking about it, my heart started beating and
the adrenaline started pumping.''

ODOM GETS SHOT AT FULFILLING DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
 ISLAND-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, R.I. _ Lamar Odom remembers sneaking out of bed past
curfew 10 years ago to find out who won the 1989 national
championship rather than wait to hear about it in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   That was when dreams of playing in the NCAA Tournament began for
the University of Rhode Island sophomore sensation. Saturday, he
made his dream come true with a winning 3-point shot to lift the
Rams past Temple in the Atlantic 10 championship game in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the forward from New York discovered how his dream will
unfold: URI (20-12) is seeded 12th in the Midwest Region and will
meet fifth-seeded North Carolina-Charlotte (22-10) at the Bradley
Center in Milwaukee Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who is still battling flu symptoms he had over the
weekend, didn't mind that the Rams were a 12th seed, he was just
pleased to have his childhood dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember watching (former Michigan guard) Rumeal
Robinson against Seton Hall, and I had to sneak to watch that
game,'' said Odom, referring to the 1989 title game. ``I remember
it was late at night, and I was supposed to turn the television
off. But I had to watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom and his URI teammates were silent throughout Sunday's
tournament pairings show. Even when Rhode Island's pairing was
flashed across the screen, they sat motionless.
</P>
<P>
   Most players said they were silent because they knew they were
in the tournament after beating Temple to gain the Atlantic 10's
automatic bid. Last season, they were more emotional because they
made the tournament as an at-large team.
</P>
<P>
   The players' excitement was also tempered by the seed they
received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we deserved a higher seed,'' said senior guard
Preston Murphy. ``I think most of us would have been satisfied with
a 10 seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Antonio Reynolds-Dean said the venue tempered his
excitement, too. ``Orlando would have been nice. Charlotte would
have been nice,'' said the Atlanta resident. ``I've never been to
Milwaukee. The only thing I know about Milwaukee is that the
Packers play there.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that the Packers play in Green Bay, about two hours
north, Reynolds-Dean replied, ``Then, I don't know anything about
Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   As for North Carolina-Charlotte, the Conference USA tournament
champs, URI players say they know the 49ers twice beat Cincinnati,
a team that trounced URI, 67-49, at the Providence Civic Center
Nov. 19. Both URI and N.C.-Charlotte beat Virginia Tech and George
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``(N.C.-Charlotte) is a tough team, a talented team,'' said
Odom. ``They go seven or eight deep and they really defend. They're
up-tempo and they shoot the three a lot. We'll scout them, but when
you step on the floor, it's about handling your business.''
</P>
<P>
   Should URI win Friday, it would be only the sixth time this
season the Rams beat a team with a winning record. URI, however,
enters the tournament 5-0 in games this season played at neutral
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Rams say the momentum they gained in their
conference tournament victories should carry over into the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who said having to sit out last season while trying to
meet eligibility requirements was the ``longest period of my
life,'' said he is well aware he will be the focal point of media
attention in Milwaukee this week. But he said he will not allow
that to distract him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time last year, I was watching (former URI players) Tyson
Wheeler and Cuttino Mobley lead this team to the Final Eight,''
said Odom. ``Hopefully, I can do the same.''

   Someone must have been listening.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast Conference champions, who secured an automatic
NCAA bid last week by winning the WCC tournament in Santa Clara,
Calif., Sunday landed what coach Dan Monson called another home
game when the tournament bracket was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, making its second NCAA tournament appearance, faces
Minnesota Thursday at KeyArena in one of four West sub-regional
games there. Pac-10 champion Stanford, which blew any shot of being
a No. 1 seed by losing at Oregon State Saturday night, is seeded
second in the West and plays Alcorn State. Also, high-profile North
Carolina battles Weber State and Florida meets Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Game times will be announced today.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs and nearly 400 boosters gathered at a Spokane hotel
to watch the selection process unfold. Some 20 minutes and three
regions later, Gonzaga still hadn't been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had flashbacks to last year and I had to keep reminding
myself that we were an automatic,'' Monson said. ``A big roar went
up when we knew we'd be staying in the West, and an even bigger
cheer came after the field in Denver had been announced. We knew we
were going to Seattle, and you can't get a much better homecourt
advantage than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't ask for more,'' he added. ``Most of our kids are
from that side of the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, seeded 10th, brings a 25-6 record to Seattle, including
an 82-71 victory over the tournament-bound Washington Huskies. The
Bulldogs lost to Kansas, Purdue and Detroit, who also made the NCAA
field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Saturday's loss in Corvallis, Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said he is happy about playing in Seattle as the No. 2
seed. The Cardinal made it to the Final Four with virtually the
same team last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we wanted, what we earned, what we deserved,'' he
said. ``We couldn't be happier. I didn't think we would get a No. 1
seed under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery downplayed Gonzaga's homecourt advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tickets already have been sold, so it's not like they will
be filling (KeyArena) with Gonzaga people,'' he said. ``But they
are Washington people.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of them figure to support Gonzaga. Eight of the 10 Bulldog
players are from the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (17-10) is one of seven Big Ten teams in the
tournament and features conference scoring leader Quincy Lewis,
averaging nearly 25 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anybody in this tournament we can't play with,''
Monson said of his 10th-seeded team.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara coach Dick Davey agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought they would be a higher seed, perhaps a
seven,'' he said. ``But my math is not the same as the (selection)
committee's math.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monson doesn't mind being a No. 10 seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in Seattle soothes whatever number they put in front
of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davey said the Bulldogs, who beat his Broncos three times this
season including the WCC tournament finale, said, ``They have good
shooters, play smart basketball and can beat you in a number of
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Gonzaga has four starters who score in double
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Junior forward Richie Frahm leads the way with 14.2 points a
game, then comes Matt Santangelo, a junior guard (12.7), senior
center Jeremy Eaton (12.1) and senior guard Quentin Hall (11.4).
All were selected to the 10-player All-WCC first team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are one of the best-shooting teams around, and I don't
think they are missing much,'' Davey said. ``They have a lot of
weapons and are capable of beating most teams any night. Minnesota
will have its hands full. They will be tested.''

PICTURE-PERFECT DAY FOR LAYFAYETTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTON, Pa. _ Normally, the 104-seat Limburgh Theater in the
bowels of the Lafayette College student union is reserved to import
current films for the benefit of those undergrads who otherwise
might not pry their heads from their engineering texts.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday night the cinematic bill of fare was decidedly
different. They showed a hit revival _ ``Leopards: Back From
Extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   As the team's players clustered expectantly in the first two
rows and coach Fran O'Hanlon stood impassively at the back of an
auditorium ringed by about 60 family members, supporters, and
media, the Leopards' basketball rebirth assumed definite shape.
They'd known since Friday, when they outscrapped Bucknell, 67-63,
in the Patriot League tournament final, that the nation's
second-longest NCAA Tournament drought had ended at 42 years
(exceeded only by Harvard's 53-year wait between dances).
</P>
<P>
   But when CBS's Michele Tafoya announced on Limburgh's big screen
during the selection show that 15th-seeded Lafayette will be coming
to Boston's FleetCenter Friday to face No. 2 seed Miami in the East
subregional, the Leopards clapped their hands, stomped their feet,
and emitted cheers between bites of the cheese, pepperoni, and
sausage pizza catered for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' said guard Brian Ehlers, the league scoring
champion, player of the year, and tournament MVP, who hails from
Bay Shore, N.Y. ``It's nice to stay on the East Coast because my
friends and family can come watch.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lafayette hopes to stock the FleetCenter with Leopards.
``This means more of our fans hopefully will be able to follow us
up there,'' said O'Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Tim Bieg was pleased to realize that he'll have at
least one rooter on hand, guaranteed. ``My older sister goes to
Boston College,'' he said. ``I've been to Boston a lot and I love
it. It's such a nice city, a great sports town.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the Leopards are thrilled to be going anyplace,
considering that they offer no athletic scholarships and a mere
five years ago, they went 2-25 and were ranked next-to-last among
the 306 NCAA Division 1 basketball schools. Add to that the fact
that not since 1957, almost before talkies were invented, had they
had an opportunity to put on an NCAA show in March and their
euphoria is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   While they were thrilled with this turn of events, the bounty of
a 22-7 season, they certainly weren't surprised. Try as CBS might
to turn the selection show into suspense theater, there are no
bombshells in this age of technopunditry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked my computer right before I came over here,'' said
Ehlers. ``That's exactly what it said _ that we'd be going to
Boston to play Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone kind of projected that we'd get Miami in Boston,''
said O'Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   How long they'll be hanging out at Quincy Market is another
matter. The Leopards are well aware that the lot of 15th seeds is
to serve as first-round appetizers for the high and mighty, and
they are duly impressed with Miami, another program up from the
netherworld.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very athletic team, very good defensively, and Tim
James is a great player,'' said O'Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, he'll rely on Lafayette's motion offense,
matchup zone, and ensemble approach in which all 12 players see
significant action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not a real big team,'' said O'Hanlon. ``They don't
have anyone 6-11. That might help us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes may not be big, but they are relentless.
``They're a typical Big East team,'' said Ehlers. ``They're going
to try to push the ball. We know we're going to have to be real
strong in taking care of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the Leopards could offer only generalities about
Friday's challenge. They'll be consumed by film of a different
nature Tuesday when they begin scrutinizing Miami game tapes, after
the coaching staff has broken them down and done reconnaissance
work with its contacts who have done battle with the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say this,'' said O'Hanlon. ``Give Miami a lot of credit.
I'm very impressed with how far they've come. Never mind come.
They've arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Sunday night's Lafayette theater audience.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PORTLAND, Ore. _ The good news was that no one got punched.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Portland Trail Blazers claimed the NBA's best record with
the finesse of a sledgehammer Sunday night, scoring an early
knockout without ever really letting up until they had beaten the
Rockets 111-71. The defeat was the Rockets' worst since a 56-point
whipping in Seattle in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Rockets' previous worst loss to the Blazers, a
38-point collapse in 1995 in which Vernon Maxwell went into the
stands to slug one of the customers, Sunday's beating was
restricted to the court.
</P>
<P>
   The rout was so thorough that Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
pulled his regulars with nine minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us, but I'm not going to look at the score and say
it's reality,'' Tomjanovich said. ``When the dam broke, I had to do
some damage control with my team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets described their complete collapse as a freakish
combination of their fatigue and the Trail Blazers' depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team, but they're not that good,'' Rockets
forward Othella Harrington said. ``They have good starters and a
deep bench, but that good? C'mon.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Trail Blazers described the rout as something of a
fluke. Before 20,062, the largest Rose Garden crowd of the season,
they won their sixth consecutive game and 10th in 11, with the only
loss coming to lightweight Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the rout of the Rockets, the Blazers have scored wins
this season against Utah and Indiana. But even while holding the
league's best record for the first time since the 1990-91 season,
even the Trail Blazers (13-3) would not claim to be that much
superior to another presumed Western Conference contender, at least
not in early March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get it twisted,'' Trail Blazers forward Brian Grant
said. ``They had a game last night. We were just hitting shots.
Everything went right for us. Was it a fluke? Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Portland guard Greg Anthony, ``It was one of those nights
where we played as well as we played all year. They probably played
as poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets shot worse than they had all season, making just
31.1 percent (23 of 74) of their shots. And even that was not their
biggest problem. The Rockets' defense was worse, allowing the Trail
Blazers to make 55.3 percent of their shots and leaving them so
alone outside that they made nine of 16 3-pointers. The Trail
Blazers ran up assorted misprint-quality numbers, outscoring the
Rockets 36-18 in the paint, 28-2 on the break and 16-5 on
second-chance points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like we gave up in the second half,'' Rockets
forward Scottie Pippen said. ``We didn't come out with any sense of
urgency to get back into the game. We didn't have any defensive
intensity. That's the only way to get back in a game, but we didn't
play with any intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had remained within 48-36 by halftime, but Isaiah
Rider scored nine points in four minutes of the second half to help
push the margin to 19 at 61-42. The Rockets got back within 13 with
as little as four minutes left in the third quarter but could not
begin to slow the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   While Portland's defensive intensity was unrelenting, the
Rockets' faded fast. Stacey Augmon started at forward specifically
to hound Pippen, who made just three of 11 shots and had as many
turnovers, four, as assists. Charles Barkley drew only occasional
double teams, preventing him from sparking the Rockets' offense
with passing as he had in Vancouver a night earlier. After getting
six assists before his first field-goal attempt Saturday, he had
one assist Sunday and made just four of 12 shots for 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd certainly like to bottle this one,'' said Trail Blazers
coach Mike Dunleavy, who used 11 players in the first half. ``The
whole four quarters were terrific. I especially liked the defensive
pressure we applied, and we didn't let up.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Blazers began the fourth quarter with an 8-0 run to an
84-57 lead, the only thing the Rockets could hope to accomplish was
to rest their regulars, who had become as worn as your favorite
pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Even that didn't work out quite as planned. Barkley drew a
technical foul four minutes after he left the game and several
minutes later was run over by Rodrick Rhodes, who was chasing a
loose ball _ naturally, in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Long before then, however, the mass substitution only served to
make the damage cut deeper while turning Pig Miller into the
Rockets' go-to low-post threat. The Blazers, however, were so deep
that they had no way to call off the rout. They gave third-team
point guard John Crotty some minutes and even found a way for
Jermaine O'Neal to break a sweat. But Dunleavy also played some of
the players, Jim Jackson and Walt Williams, who had turned the game
into a rout.
</P>
<P>
   It took five minutes for the Rockets to get a fourth-quarter
field goal, a Miller jump shot cutting the deficit to 31. And while
everything the Rockets tried failed, the Trail Blazers' night ended
somehow appropriately with Kelvin Cato, a 6-11 defensive
specialist, swishing the first 3-pointer of his two-season career
at the buzzer to cap Portland's most lopsided victory in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no extra points for how many you win by,'' Barkley
said. ``You can win by one or win by 30; you only get one win.
We'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And this time the Rockets can forget it, having restricted the
beating to the game.

DUKE'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE: SURVIVING 
</HEADLINE>
 EAST PREVIEW-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Naturally, any discussion of the East Regional begins
with Duke. But the top-seeded Blue Devils will have a mere
scrimmage in their opener against Florida A&AMP;M. Beyond that,
however, things could get interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the first-round game between the Nos. 8 and 9 seeds,
College of Charleston and Tulsa. Charleston may have been seeded
too low, and if it can knock off Tulsa _ and the guess is that it
can _ Sunday's second-round game against the Devils should be a
doozy. Charleston has beaten North Carolina and Massachusetts this
season, so it's not afraid of big-name opponents, both good and
bad.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the Charlotte, N.C., bracket is pretty
pedestrian. Wisconsin has not been impressive for a couple of
months, and Tennessee is one of the yo-yo teams of all time. One
potential shocker: No. 13 Delaware could emerge as the other team
to advance, along with Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston half of the draw should be a matter of survival. The
basketball might not be pretty, but it will be physical.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, which has showed it could play with the elite of the Big
East, is the most athletic team in the bracket. The second-seeded
Hurricanes should handle Patriot League champion Lafayette in the
first round, but then it gets tough. Awaiting would likely be
Texas, which looks like a better team than first-round foe Purdue,
and that could be an interesting matchup, though the Hurricanes
probably have too much speed for the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati should knock off both George Mason and either Temple
or Kent, setting up a nice regional semifinal against Miami in the
Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Once the regional moves to East Rutherford, N.J., the
entertainment quotient should be high. Let's assume Duke avoids a
second-round upset and takes care of our sleeper, Delaware. A
regional final pitting the Blue Devils against either Miami or
Cincinnati should be a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati already has proven it can beat the Devils, although
that victory came in Alaska back around Thanksgiving. Miami, with
players like Big East Co-Player of the Year Tim James and Boston
product and former Boston College recruit Elton Tyler, would not be
intimidated, either. The Hurricanes, after all, have a pair of
victories over St. John's and a split with Connecticut on their
resume.
</P>
<P>
   These could be the toughest matchups in the tournament for the
Blue Devils. At the very least, the Devils will face a challenge
rather than getting a walk-through to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Teams to watch: Delaware, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Upset special: Delaware over Tennessee, Kent over Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to East Rutherford: Duke, Delaware, Miami, Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Regional champ: Duke.

TIME FOR AUBURN TO PUT, OR ... 
</HEADLINE>
 SOUTH PREVIEW-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Now it's showtime for Auburn. The Tigers had a great
regular season, which earned them the No. 1 seed in the South
Regional. But this is a new season, and the spotlight is going to
be bright. Can the Tigers handle it? We think not.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at the danger spots. There isn't one in the
first round, as No. 16 Winthrop, while a nice Cinderella story,
will be more dazzled than the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Move to Round 2. Watch out. The survivor of the No. 8 Syracuse
vs. No. 9 Oklahoma State game will be waiting. It'll likely be the
Orangemen, who, free from the Carrier Dome (where they had trouble
winning, amazingly) and the Big East, will be frisky. Auburn's
athleticism will not bother Syracuse, and Orangemen coach Jim
Boeheim will throw up a few defensive wrinkles. We smell upset.
</P>
<P>
   In the other half of the Indianapolis bracket, Ohio State is one
of the turnaround stories of the season. Jim O'Brien can outcoach
just about anybody, and his No. 4-seeded Buckeyes have a strong
backcourt in Scoonie Penn and Michael Redd.
</P>
<P>
   If the Buckeyes can avoid a jittery opening-round game against
Murray State _ and the Racers are dangerous _ they can handle
either Detroit or talented but erratic UCLA in what could be a
high-speed game.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say Ohio State keeps it going and O'Brien finds old Big
East rival and golfing buddy Boeheim his foe in a regional
semifinal. With those guards, Ohio State can win that matchup as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In the Orlando bracket, No. 3 seed St. John's should get past
Samford, then handle either Indiana or George Washington. No. 2
Maryland will not be intimidated by Valparaiso, especially in
Orlando, and Louisville and Creighton are not threats.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland and St. John's should advance to Knoxville along with
Syracuse and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will become interesting, with two Big East teams and two
other teams whose coaches (O'Brien, Maryland's Gary Williams) have
Boston College connections.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a nice little reunion, especially since Williams,
O'Brien, and Boeheim all play golf together in the summer. Of the
three, Williams has the best team and O'Brien is the best coach,
while St. John's Mike Jarvis (another Boston connection) has a team
that comes closest to matching Maryland in talent.
</P>
<P>
   What's going to happen? Ohio State will beat Syracuse, but
that's as far as the Buckeyes can go without their opponent
self-destructing.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland and St. John's is a tough matchup to fathom. Both teams
have to prove they can win big games.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's should win a close final over Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Teams to watch: Ohio State, Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Upset special: Syracuse over Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Knoxville: Syracuse, Ohio State, St. John's, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Regional champ: St. John's.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Steve Elkington had just planted one of his size-12s into
the outside wall of the scoring trailer, leaving a good-sized divot
in the corrugated metal surface.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He thought he had just booted away the Doral-Ryder Open by
missing a four-foot par putt on the famed 18th hole, capping a
fantastic round of golf on a downer.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Elkington's Al Del Greco imitation was just the last
symbolic gesture after he kicked Doral's Blue Monster and a lot of
his PGA Tour brethren's tails Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington won Doral for the second time in three years, shooting
a final-round 8-under-par 64 to pass 19 players who started the day
in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Playing nearly two hours in front of the third-round leaders,
Elkington had forged ahead almost before Greg Kraft and friends had
teed off. He strung together six birdies in a row during the middle
of his round and finished at 13-under 275.
</P>
<P>
   And then he waited, thinking his gaffe on No. 18 had left him
one stroke shy of the score that would be needed to qualify for a
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hoping for a playoff,'' the Houstonian said,
figuring that was the best he could expect at 13-under. ``I really
thought somebody would get to 14-under.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he kicked the scoring trailer when he was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little upset at myself,'' he said. ``I felt like I had
let everybody back in. I had a pretty severe lip out, and I was
upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really angry, because I'd just had one of the
greatest rounds I've ever played. I was just frustrated when I came
off because I had done all that work. I had the tournament. Not
sewn up, by any means. But I didn't want to leave any crumbs out
there. I wanted to send a message.''
</P>
<P>
   The message was this: 2-under-par on the back nine would have
been good enough for a win by Ernie Els. If Kraft, David Toms,
Scott Dunlap or Jay Haas had shot 2-under on the back, they could
have forced a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   None could do it.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, the hole that cursed Elkington ended up saving him.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the leaders who became chasers fired and fell back.
Els hit two awful shots on No. 18 for a double bogey. Kraft, who
had a two-shot cushion over Els and Glen Day when play began
Sunday, hit a fat 5-iron into the water on No. 18 for a bogey. If
either player had parred the treacherous 443-yard finisher, he
would have been in a playoff with Elkington. But neither got the
chance to putt for the tie.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington took control of the tournament when he birdied Nos. 6
through 11, making long putts (a 20-footer) and short putts (two
inches and a foot) and even two-putting the par-5 10th for birdie
during the binge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling no pain at all,'' Elkington said. ``I was sort
of counting my birdies a little bit. Then, I stopped my momentum on
that hard 13th hole.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Elkington's lone bogey until the 18th, when he
three-putted from 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   But Elkington already had seized control. He slowly made his way
up the leader board until getting ahead just after Kraft and Els
had hit their first shots of the day. When it was over, Elkington
confessed he was a bit surprised by the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty lucky, wasn't it?'' he said. ``But I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Elkington's 10th victory on the PGA Tour, and the
$540,000 winner's check put his career earnings over $7.5 million.
He had started the day six shots behind Kraft, making this the
fifth time Elkington had come from at least four shots off the pace
to win a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The second shot at No. 18 was the culprit in Els' demise. After
a good tee shot, the 18th is a hole where the only place disaster
can strike is left of the green. So what did Els do? He pulled an
8-iron from only 154 yards about five yards left of the pin. It
trickled down the short cut of grass into deep rough, less than
three feet from the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to really step on the 8-iron,'' Els said. ``I tried to
hit it too hard and just came over the top of it. I wanted to hit
it right of the pin.''
</P>
<P>
   When he didn't, the result wasn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was up against the thick cut, stuff that really kept it
from going in the water,'' Els said. ``It was almost unplayable,
really. I tried to just get it on the green, and I couldn't get
myself to hit it hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do? You need par, so you try and play a miracle
shot from there. It just didn't come off.''
</P>
<P>
   Els said he felt he lost momentum in his round when he
three-putted the par-3 ninth hole for a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought 15 under was going to be the score (needed
for victory),'' Els said. ``I was right on track until the
three-putt threw me off.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kraft, he overcame a rocky start with birdies at Nos. 9
and 10, then got to 13-under with a four-foot birdie putt on the
17th.
</P>
<P>
   After he drove it perfectly on 18, he thought he could finish
the tournament with a birdie and a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of birdie,'' Kraft said. ``The hardest part of
that hole is the tee shot. And I hit that perfect. Then I played an
aggressive shot, and a very poor one. I was telling my caddie,
`Let's end it right now.' And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But not the way he hoped. The 5-iron shot was hit fat and went
only about 100 yards, plopping into the lake. It was the sort of
shot a weekend hacker hits, not a PGA Tour pro.
</P>
<P>
   Once that shot hit water, Elkington had survived the long
afternoon of waiting.

EVERYTHING SEEMS IN ORDER FOR UCONN 
</HEADLINE>
 MIDWEST PREVIEW-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jim Calhoun should be smiling this morning. The
University of Connecticut coach got the seed he wanted. He got the
region he wanted (if not the location). And, most important, he got
the bracket he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look. Top-seeded UConn's first-round game in Denver
against Texas-San Antonio should not be a problem. Its second-round
game would be against the Missouri-New Mexico winner, perhaps the
weakest No. 8 vs. No. 9 matchup in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom half of the draw features Iowa and
Alabama-Birmingham. Forget about it. Arkansas and Siena? Watch out
for Arkansas, at least when it gets on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks may join the Huskies in Phoenix for the regional
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Now examine the other half of the bracket, in Seattle. Stanford
vs. Alcorn State. Stanford is too big, too talented. Minnesota vs.
Gonzaga. Gonzaga can win that one. North Carolina vs. Weber State.
The Tar Heels are too talented. Florida vs. Penn. Penn can
frustrate the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the sake of argument, UConn and Arkansas would likely be
joined by North Carolina and Stanford, a chalk matchup. But it's
soft chalk.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina isn't the team it was a year ago, and if you don't
think Calhoun and the Huskies want a payback for last year's
regional final loss to Carolina in Greensboro, you don't know your
Huskies or Calhoun. Stanford is a nice team that can get back to
the Final Four, but the Cardinal have a tough time matching up
against the Huskies and Carolina might knock them off before UConn
does.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious obstacle UConn faces is Arkansas. If the Hogs
are playing defense and running, and Pat Bradley is making
3-pointers, they can be 40 minutes of hell for any team.
</P>
<P>
   But Nolan Richardson's team has been inconsistent. Not long ago,
Arkansas was worried about even making the tournament. Now the
Razorbacks are a No. 4 seed. But the only reason they are seeded
that high was that the committee couldn't find another worthy team.
</P>
<P>
   Strange things can happen. Players can get hurt, as Calhoun
knows very well. But this regional looks very favorable for Calhoun
and the Huskies, which could lead to their first Final Four trip.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way: UConn is the best team, with the most
talent and the best coach, although Stanford's Mike Montgomery will
battle you all the way.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest opponent UConn will have out West is UConn. If the
Huskies stay focused and healthy, they're heading to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Teams to watch: Arkansas, Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Upset specials: Gonzaga over Minnesota, Penn over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Phoenix: Arkansas, UConn, Stanford, North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Regional champ: UConn.

<P>
   BOSTON _ The dozen pizzas were being devoured, sodas were being
passed around, and snapshots were being taken as the Boston College
women's basketball team gathered at Conte Forum Sunday not to play
a game but to see where and against whom they'll be playing their
next game when the NCAA Tournament starts next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Paula Bacso had comforting words for her teammates as
they waited for word. ``OK, if we go east, we have a lot of fans,''
she said. ``If we go south, we have warm weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The warm weather won.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles will travel to Knoxville, where the University of
Tennessee will host the first and second rounds of the East
Regional. But with the warm weather comes the possibility of facing
defending champion Tennessee in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   BC (21-7), seeded No. 8, will face No. 9 Ohio State (17-11)
Saturday night. Top seed Tennessee (28-2), ranked No. 2 in the
country and champion of the Southeastern Conference, will face
16th-seeded Applachian State (14-14) later that night. The winners
will meet next Monday, and the winner of that game will go on to
Greensboro, N.C., to decide the East Regional the following
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The BC players watched ESPN's telecast of the bracket
announcements in nervous anticipation as hosts Robin Roberts, Mimi
Griffin, and Rebecca Lobo went through the seedings for the West,
then the Midwest, then the Mideast. Finally, hoots and hollers
erupted and the players began hugging when the BC vs. Ohio State
matchup flashed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time in the 27-year history of the program
that the BC women have made it to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Cathy Inglese acknowleged that ``we're in a tough
bracket,'' but said she's ready for the competition. ``Ohio State
is probably pretty like us, and I think it's going to be up for
draw,'' she said. ``And whoever plays the better game is going to
have the opportunity to play Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has been to the NCAAs three times, and has beaten BC
in each of their five meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But Tennessee is a far more formidable hurdle. The Lady Vols,
who have won the NCAA championship the past three years, are led by
Chamique Holdsclaw (20.9 points per game), Tamika Catchings (14.8),
and Semeka Randall (13.9).
</P>
<P>
   However, not even the prospect of having to face Tennessee could
damper spirits of a BC team that won 20 games for the first time in
school history, including an upset of another regional top seed,
the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Inglese and her players did not seem concerned. In fact, they
seemed to relish the chance to play one of the top teams in the
country. ``I want to play Tennessee,'' Inglese said. ``Tennessee
could be making a record this year with four titles, and we have
the opportunity to play them on their home court. I mean, how much
more exciting can that be?''
</P>
<P>
   Bacso said she felt the same way. ``It's a great place to play _
when are you going to get a chance to play in Knoxville?'' she
said. ``It's a great opportunity. Of all the places, I would love
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her fans vs. warm weather statement, Bacso said she
thinks the Eagles will have both in Knoxville. ``My parents are
going to go,'' said Bacso, from Long Island. ``I think a lot of
parents will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to the BC players to see just how long _ or short _
a trip to Knoxville it will be for their family members and fans.

NEWTON PLANTED THE SEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the last seven years, C.M. Newton has convened the
NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Selection Committee and
sequestered it on the 40th floor of the Hyatt hotel in downtown
Kansas City, Mo. There he and the other selection committee members
have evaluated reams of data _ ranging from ratings percentage
indexes to strength of schedules to won-loss records _ and picked
the 64-team field for the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In his last year as chair of the committee, Newton, the athletic
director at the University of Kentucky, fondly recalled during a
conference call Sunday that ``the first time I came here, I
couldn't even find the 40th floor, hardly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where you didn't know anybody and I
was scared to death, and the whole process was just almost
overwhelming,'' he added. ``But I was able to do a hell of a job
eating all the ice cream and the meals and all that kind of thing
and watch a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   While he witnessed quite a number of upsets among the Top 25
teams in the last 48 hours of his term, Newton indicated it never
hindered the selection process. At no time was the committee
compelled to re-do brackets. All that was required, really, was
some pencil sharpening.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we weren't close to tearing it up, because of all the
constraints,'' Newton said. ``The upsets delayed what we were able
to do, and what we did do, and it made us a little later than we
would like to be. But we were able to do it in a timely fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, shortly after the Big 12 tournament championship was
decided by Kansas's 53-37 victory over Oklahoma State, the
committee finalized the field _ putting it down in ink _ by naming
Duke, Connecticut, Michigan State, and Auburn as the No. 1 seeds in
the East, West, Midwest, and South regions, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auburn, by losing (in the SEC tournament), created a situation
where you might have had those four (No. 1s) penciled in with your
eraser still on your pencil,'' Newton said. ``As with any of those
_ other than probably Duke or UConn losing _ I think if Michigan
State had gotten upset today, just as Auburn got upset, then you'd
see about Maryland and Stanford. But when both of those teams lost,
the committee felt that Auburn should retain its No. 1 standing.''
</P>
<P>
   No upset there.
</P>
<P>
   But if there appeared to be one, it was the fact that UConn,
which won the Big East tournament championship Saturday night with
an 82-63 romp over St. John's (a No. 3 seed in the South), was
dispatched well beyond its natural geographical area. The Huskies
(28-2) will face No. 16 seed Texas-San Antonio, champions of the
Southland Conference, in a first-round meeting Thursday at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is because Duke is the No. 1 seed,'' Newton said of
Connecticut's move to the West. ``UConn came out second, but had to
go out of region because Duke was the top seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the committee's general philosophy on keeping
lower-seeded teams closer to home _ which appeared to be the case
with No. 10 Gonzaga of Spokane, Wash., in its first-round West
Region matchup against No. 7 seed Minnesota in nearby Seattle _
Newton said: ``We want to play teams as close to their homes as
best we can without disadvantaging, in a significant way, a high
seed. We've made a concentrated effort to keep teams as close as we
can to their geographical area, so that their fans can go see them.
In the first-round game, the teams get 350 tickets or whatever and
we didn't feel it would disadvantage anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The only team that would appear to face a huge disadvantage by
its bracket placement would be No. 16 seed Florida A&AMP;M. The
Rattlers, the only team in the field with a sub-.500 record
(12-18), won an automatic bid by winning the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference. Their spoils? A first-round date in the East Region
against top-seeded Duke _ in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for the tournament and good for college
basketball to have teams like that,'' Newton said of the Rattlers.
``Just think of the experience that those young people are going to
have. It's the absolute experience of a lifetime to make that
field. That's the beauty of this national tournament _ it's truly
national.''

MAINE LANDS AT-LARGE BID 
</HEADLINE>
 ENGLAND-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Since the NCAA women's basketball tournament expanded
to 64 teams six seasons ago, one fact has been very clear to teams
from lower-profile leagues: If you don't win your postseason
conference tournament, expect to stay home, regardless of record.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, after Maine lost to Northeastern by 2 points in the
America East final Saturday, the Black Bears left Vermont's Patrick
Gym with heads hung low and even heavier hearts. Despite a 23-6
record and regular-season conference title, it appeared the Black
Bears would be left on the sideline for this year's NCAA event.
</P>
<P>
   So when the team gathered Sunday for the NCAA selection show, no
one was expecting much to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all showed up kind of somber,'' said Maine coach Joanne
Palombo-McCallie. ``I was prepared to tell the team why teams don't
get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the reaction in Orono was anything but somber when
Maine learned it was chosen as an at-large team, given the 10th
seed in the East Regional, and matched against seventh-seeded
Stanford Friday in a first-round game at Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears are one of a record-tying six New England teams
that will play in this year's tourney, along with another at-large
selection, Boston College, plus league champions Northeastern,
Connecticut (Big East), Holy Cross (Patriot League), and Dartmouth
(Ivy League).
</P>
<P>
   ``Your stomach was in knots. When Maine flashed up (on the
television screen), we screamed. It was a very special moment, one
I'll never forget,'' said Palombo-McCallie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ended the season as a good team, and their loss in the
playoffs was narrow,'' said Bernadette McGlade, chairman of the
women's selection committee. ``There's no rule we can't have two
from the America East.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine's Rating Power Index (RPI) ranking of 42, only one spot
below perennial power Virginia, played a part in its selection. An
18-2 record over its last 20 games and four straight NCAA berths
also helped.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Dartmouth figured it wouldn't be going anywhere but
to downtown Hanover, N.H., during the NCAA tourney. A game behind
Princeton in the Ivy standings, the Big Green had to win their
final game at Harvard, then hope the Tigers somehow lost at home to
Penn to conclude the regular season and force a one-game playoff
for the league title.
</P>
<P>
   The day after all parameters were met and Dartmouth concluded
its unlikely run by winning the Ivy championship with a playoff
trouncing of Princeton, the Big Green (19-8) gathered to learn that
they drew the No. 14 seed in the East and will play host Rutgers,
the third seed, Friday at Piscataway, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very excited to be in the tourney, especially as a 14th
seed,'' said Dartmouth coach Chris Wielgus. ``We have tremendous
backing in the community, and a game this close allows those people
to be able to make the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross knows the NCAAs; the Crusaders will be making their
seventh trip to the Dance when they play host Duke in Durham, N.C.,
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never gets old, it only gets better,'' said coach Bill
Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross (21-7) takes a 10-game win streak into the tourney.
</P>
<P>
   ``No athletic scholarships and a 14 seed,'' said Gibbons. ``It
gets sweeter every year.''

FOCUS ON GLITTER COULD END UP UPSETTING 
</HEADLINE>
 MIDWEST PREVIEW-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ From a historical perspective, the Midwest Regional
appears to be overloaded. In the field are Kansas, defending
national champion Kentucky, Big Ten champion Michigan State, and
Western Athletic Conference champion Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But appearances may be deceiving. Upsets could abound here,
because at varying stages of the season all of these teams looked
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the bracket in Milwaukee, which includes No. 1
seed Michigan State. In the first round, the Spartans should
prevent venerable Mount St. Mary's coach Jim Phelan from getting
victory No. 801. And neither Villanova nor Ole Miss looks
frightening as a second-round obstacle. Both were considered bubble
teams on the NCAA board.
</P>
<P>
   Pencil Michigan State into the regional semifinals in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's look at the other half of the Milwaukee bracket. Rhode
Island is there, courtesy of Lamar Odom's last-second shot to beat
Temple in Saturday's Atlantic 10 tournament final. The Rams are a
tough team to figure out. Had they not beaten Temple, they were
headed to the National Invitation Tournament, not the NCAA. But
when they play, they can play with anyone, including Michigan
State.
</P>
<P>
   But will they play? They had better. The 12th-seeded Rams' first
opponent is No. 5 North Carolina-Charlotte, a streaking team that
knocked off Cincinnati and Louisville, back to back, on the way to
the Conference USA championship.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rams survive that test, they'll really need their ``A''
game in the second round, since fourth-seeded Arizona likely will
be waiting. And that means national player of the year candidate
Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rams make it out of Milwaukee, it'll be a major upset.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the draw has the sexy teams, which is not
surprising since the NCAA was hurting in ticket sales in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be the case anymore. Kentucky's presence will
draw a crowd, and a possible second-round matchup between the No. 3
Wildcats and No. 6 Kansas would have the feel of a Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas coach Roy Williams is likely to experience some big-time
emotions next weekend. He could see his team's season end
prematurely once again. Or he might knock off the defending
national champion, something his Jayhawks were unable to do in the
Great Eight in Chicago in December.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom half of that draw must have Utah coach Rick Majerus
wondering what he has done wrong. Three times in the last four
years he has had Kentucky on his NCAA dance card. Last year, he
didn't see the Wildcats until the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, the No. 2 seed, should knock off Arkansas State, then
either Washington or Miami of Ohio. That would bring Majerus face
to face with Kentucky again. Can he beat the Wildcats?
</P>
<P>
   It looks like a chalk regional final. It's just a question of
which chalk you use.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State might have problems with the speed of Arizona,
while Utah has to overcome the mystique of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Teams to watch: Arizona, UNC-Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Upset specials: Miami of Ohio over Washington, Evansville over
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to St. Louis: Kentucky, Utah, Michigan State, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Regional champ: Kentucky.

UCONN WOMEN LAND NO. 1 SEED 
</HEADLINE>
 TOURNAMENT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A year ago, the Connecticut women's basketball team was
discovering how many ways the loss of its best player could affect
it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did an injured Nykesha Sales's uncontested, staged
layup to set a school scoring record set off a national
controversy, it put coach Geno Auriemma's temper on display for all
to see.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, the loss of Sales to a torn anterior cruciate
ligament also was responsible for the Huskies' No. 2 seed in the
NCAA Tournament after landing four straight top seeds.
</P>
<P>
   But this March, all has been made right in Storrs. Sixth-ranked
UConn is the No. 1 seed in the Mideast Regional, with its first two
games at Gampel Pavilion and potential third- and fourth-round
games at the University of Cincinnati, only a half-hour from
freshman forward Tamika Williams's hometown of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's 27 wins, our schedule,'' said Auriemma of his
team's return to a No. 1 seed. ``We've won a lot of really good
games on the road, and our conference had a really high rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a problem last year not being a one (seed). You
take any team in the country and take away their best player,
they're not the same team. You can't reward a team for their
season; you have to project going into the tournament who the top
four teams in the country are.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the fact that UConn is ranked sixth means that two
schools ranked higher _ Colorado State and Old Dominion _ were
bypassed as top seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette McGlade, chairman of the women's selection committee,
told ESPN: ``The committee really analyzed all the aspects _ the
overall won-lost records as well as the conference championships.
Then the committee started to take a look at the number of games
against the Top 25 teams, and certainly Connecticut rose to the top
in that category to earn that No. 1 seed.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn lost to Tennessee, Old Dominion, Boston College, and
Louisiana Tech, dropping three of six games during a midseason
slump. But the Huskies have won 12 of 13 since, capped by cutting a
three-game swath through the Big East tournament.
</P>
<P>
   UConn (27-4) plays St. Francis (18-11) in a first-round game
Friday. If the Huskies dispose of the Northeast Conference
champion, they'd play the winner of Xavier-Florida International.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is looking forward to a trip home if UConn makes the
Sweet 16. ``I want to go back home and play in front of a home
crowd. But we need to prove we can play in Ohio,'' said Williams,
who leads the Huskies with 6.9 rebounds and is averaging 13.5
points per game.
</P>
<P>
   While UConn, making its 11 straight trip to the Dance, tries to
get to its first Final Four since 1996, Chamique Holdsclaw will be
trying to finish her glittery career with a fourth national
championship in four years at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols and Louisiana Tech, the only schools to have
appeared in all 17 previous NCAA tourneys, also earned top seeds.
Top-ranked Purdue, which handed Tennessee one of only two losses in
the Boilermakers' first game of the season, is the other No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has won six titles, while the Lady Techsters won their
only title in 1982, the year the NCAA took control of the tourney
from the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women.
</P>
<P>
   This year's lesson in how a team's seeding can fall due to a key
injury: When point guard Niele Ivy's knee caved in during Notre
Dame's Big East semifinal win over Rutgers, the Irish fell to a
fifth seed despite its status as a Top 10 team.
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone thinks the host schools, who play their first two
games at home campus sites, have it easy, check out UCLA. The
Bruins would play four straight in Los Angeles, should they advance
that far.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any doubt about the location of the women's
collegiate basketball power base, look south. The Southeastern
Conference has eight participants and the Atlantic Coast five. The
Midwest/Southwest has five from the Big 12, four from Conference
USA, and four from the Big Ten. The West Coast's Pacific 10 is also
sending four teams.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cal State Northridge, winner of the Big Sky tourney,
righted itself after suffering major trauma. Its former coach,
Michael Abraham, resigned following his arrest in October on
charges that he sold crack cocaine in Omaha, Neb. Assistant Frozena
Jerro led the Matadors to a 21-7 record.

TIMBERWOLVES TRIP SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ And the Sonics' struggles continue.
</P>
<P>
   The less-than-super Sonics dropped their third straight game
Sunday night and the fifth in their past seven. This time it was a
ho-hum 88-77 setback to the Minnesota Timberwolves at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   It was disturbingly similar to the Sonics' loss to the Phoenix
Suns at home last Thursday and Friday night's exciting, but still
losing, effort to the Lakers in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it wasn't pretty. It's getting to be more like a
trend,'' coach Paul Westphal said after his team slipped to 9-7 as
it heads to the Midwest for a three-games-in-three-nights road
trip. ``Minnesota came in here and kicked us, just like Phoenix
did. It seems like a trend. In order for us to get back into it,
we've got to start working together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The disjointed Sonics failed to get it done on either end of the
court against the Timberwolves, who improved their record to 11-6
to keep pace with the Utah Jazz in the Midwest Division.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the Sonics shot 40.3 percent, but they were a
horrendous 4 of 23 on 3-point attempts. Gary Payton, the team's
leading scorer, finished with a game-high 20 points. But he missed
18 of his 27 shots and was just 1 of 9 on treys.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Sonics looked tired and like the older team as
they struggled to stay with the younger, fresher Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics did a respectable job on Kevin Garnett, holding the
T-Wolves' 6-foot-11 jumping jack to 19 points. They did an even
better job on Stephon Marbury, who scored only 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   But the T-Wolves' bench proved to be the difference in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Sealy, who played last season with the Detroit Pistons
after four seasons of NBA purgatory with the L.A. Clippers, hit 8
of 13 shots in scoring 18 points. Sam Mitchell, who played his
501st game with Minnesota, chipped in 16 points as the sub-Wolves
contributed 41 points.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast, the Sonics' bench scored only 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bench, we try to bring it whether it's on the defensive
end or the offensive end,'' Sealy said. ``Tonight, fortunately, we
were able to get it cooking on both ends. We were able to contest
their shots on one end and hit the open shots we got at the other
end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I was looking to shoot tonight,'' he said. ``I
was open. And when you're open you have to make them pay for
leaving you open.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what made Sunday night's loss especially distasteful for
the Sonics. It's one thing to play poorly on offense. It's
un-Sonic-like to let the lackluster effort carry over to the
defensive end of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to do a better job on defense,'' said Dale Ellis,
who had an interesting evening with a blocked shot and a tip-in,
but was only 2 of 7 at shooting 3-pointers, his speciality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had guys come in and play good selectively, but we need
to play more as a team,'' he said. ``Gary has carried us most of
the way, and we need for the rest of us to get on the same page.
We're not going to make every shot, but as a team it can be
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts like the one Sunday night are making it harder for
Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not play with much emotion in the first half, but we
did a lot better in the third quarter,'' he said. ``In this league,
you've got to play 48 minutes and not just quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dragging offensively,'' he added. ``We need to work a
little harder at that end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics did make several runs at the T-Wolves, tying the
score at 47 with just under eight minutes left in the third quarter
and then cutting Minnesota's lead to three, 67-64, at the start of
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But every time they made a run, the Sonics would follow it by
stumbling on one end or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, we were just flat,'' said Vin Baker, who scored only
nine points but did contribute 10 rebounds and three blocked shots.
``For what reason, I don't know. ... The thing we have to realize
is that going through this period of time we can't get down on each
other or the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   If performances like the one Sunday night and the one against
the Suns continue, that will become more and more difficult.

DUKE. You're welcome. That takes care of March 29 in St. Pete.
</P>
<P>
   Now all you have to do is plug in the winners of the other 62
games in the NCAA Tournament, and you collect on your pool.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'll only have to beat out the computer geek who's
been up each night since the opening round of the Maui Classic and
the Great Alaska Shootout feeding new data into his circuitry and
letting the microchips give him the latest power ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Or you'll have to outthink the office intern, the one with
Scotch tape on his glasses and gum stuck to the bottom of his shoe,
who works out the pairings the old-fashioned way, like those NASA
engineers back in the days of the Apollo program, with a slide
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Or the giggly young woman in the accounting department who fills
out her bracket according to her favorite colors. Or the crotchety
lady in personnel who lets her pit bull chew on Milk-Bones labeled
with the names of all the teams in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Or your grandmother, who looks like she's been napping since
November but actually has a copy of Hoopin' It Up With Dick Vitale
hidden under that afghan and is going to take you to the rack like
she always has since the days when you were just a droolin' diaper
dandy, bay-bee!
</P>
<P>
   Duke. Coach K and the Blue Devils cutting down the nets on a
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   After that, you're on your own to handicap a tournament that
gets tighter and tighter and tougher to figure out each year. And
we're just talking about the seedings and the placements.
</P>
<P>
   How does Kansas, which spent the winter trading on its past
reputation, get a No. 6 seed and a berth in the geographically
friendly Midwest Regional when Texas, the Big 12 regular-season
champ, is seeded No. 7 and shipped up to Boston in the East
Regional?
</P>
<P>
   You figure the selection committee must have given considerable
weight to the relative performances in the Big 12 postseason
tournament. That is, until you notice that Oklahoma State, which
defeated Texas in the semifinals, drew only a No. 9 seed in the
South Regional.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Rick Barnes' bunch, a first-round date with slumping
Purdue could be a good matchup. But looking ahead to the second
round, the Longhorns would likely have to encounter Miami (Fla.),
which has been a terror all year long in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   The season began, and nobody gave Auburn a second look. Now the
Tourney begins, and the Tigers have a No. 1 seed in the South even
after a ripping by Kentucky in the SEC tournament. What's the
answer?
</P>
<P>
   Duke. Elton Brand, Trajan Langdon, Shane Battier, William Avery.
</P>
<P>
   They call this March Madness because this is supposed to be such
an easy stroll for the Blue Devils, and yet you know that
somewhere, somebody along the road to the Final Four will leap out
of the shadows _ maybe just for a few minutes _ and give them a
scare or all they can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The last team so heavily favored to waltz its way through the
Big Dance was UNLV in 1991. And the Rebels waltzed right into a
stunning upset in the national semifinals. By Christian Laettner
and Bobby Hurley and Grant Hill and Coach K.
</P>
<P>
   The Dookies would seem to have clear sailing through the first
two rounds of the Tournament, and their only real hurdle along the
road to St. Pete could be a possible rematch with Cincinnati _ the
only blemish on a perfect record. The assumption there is that Bob
Huggins' team doesn't suffer through one of its regular early-round
meltdowns, which then triggers a meltdown of a different sort by
Huggins himself.
</P>
<P>
   As for annual Tournament events, we will wait for the tears to
spill out of Roy Williams when Kansas makes another early exit. If
the Evansville Aces don't do the trick in the first round, then
Kentucky will likely turn on Roy's faucet in the second-round clash
of big-name programs.
</P>
<P>
   Every year a No. 5 seed is tripped by a No. 12 seed, and those
possibilities do abound. While in the West, Iowa (No. 5) should be
able to handle Alabama-Birmingham, the South has always-fragile
UCLA (No. 5) tangling with Detroit, the East pits slumping
Wisconsin (No. 5) against dangerous Southwest Missouri State, and
the Midwest has North Carolina Charlotte (No. 5) matched with
NBA-ready Lamar Odom and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The subregional with the most real depth, rather than just
names, is in the West at Denver, where No. 1 seed Connecticut gets
Texas-San Antonio in the first round but then must pick its way
through a minefield of Missouri, New Mexico, Iowa and a tough bunch
from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Valpo's back, this time without Bryce Drew. Lafayette is back
for the first time since 1957. Kent is in for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, there are only two sure things:
</P>
<P>
   Duke.
</P>
<P>
   And there are no sure things.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Maybe this is the ticket for the Jayhawks. Maybe
it's better for them to enter the NCAA Tournament as mostly chalk
instead of rock. Less pressure plus lower expectations equals more
fun?
</P>
<P>
   Given their recent sad history, it surely can't hurt to try a
backdoor approach. They have already perfected the art of getting
the front door slammed on their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be saying one of two things,'' Kansas' put-upon
coach, Roy Williams, noted sardonically. ``Either we're finally
peaking at the right time, or we're setting everybody up for
another bad fall.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit of bitterness aside, that KU won another Big 12 Conference
tournament Sunday in the role of underdog instead of big dog had to
have ranked among Williams' more prized accomplishments. For a
change, the playing field was Great Plains level going in, with any
of four or five teams capable of clipping the Kemper Arena nets at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be the well-rehearsed Jayhawks who found a way to
make the honor theirs again. Was it a coronation, though? Hardly.
Royalty they aren't. Williams was in full agreement on that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just kids,'' he said. ``But even when they've
`failed,' I've never once stopped believing that they're great
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   After what Roy called ``maybe my most difficult'' regular
season, the 22-9 Jayhawks fought through the pack here as the No. 3
seed and won less on talent surplus against Nebraska, Kansas State
and Oklahoma State than on sheer determination and gumption,
although the hapless Cowboys, playing for the fourth day in a row,
didn't have the legs or bullets to properly seek the vengeance they
sought.
</P>
<P>
   A brutal referee's call sealed Oklahoma State's fate in Lawrence
recently, giving KU a winning free throw with no time left. There
was nothing unjust, however, about the 53-37 rematch except the
back-to-back-to-back-to-back circumstances the Cowboys found
themselves in. Unfortunately, that's how it has to be when you fail
to procure a first-round bye.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Sutton's slow Pokes simply had nothing in their tanks. How
else, pray tell, do you explain 23 percent shooting at the
major-college level?
</P>
<P>
   The fearless Jayhawks freshman, Jeff Boschee, said KU's defense
deserved the credit. It didn't. It was good _ but not that good.
You know how freshmen are.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kansas only shooting 36 percent?
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw out there today,'' Williams said, ``were two
tired basketball teams.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA Tournament selection committee, convening nearby,
had judged the Big 12 solely on the merits of the championship
scuffle, the conference wouldn't have placed five schools in the
field of 64. There couldn't have been a more raggedy title bout
staged anywhere in the country over the weekend. No, these were
hardly the Jayhawks of lore, of Raef LaFrentz, Paul Pierce and
Jacque Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Because of names such as those, Williams has won more games
faster than any coach in history. He passed 300 three weeks ago,
and his .810 winning percentage is the highest among active members
of his profession. But his satisfaction with himself and his
program has been tempered by KU's inability to go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not many bad things about coaching,'' Williams says.
``It's a short list. But the worst thing is that the highs aren't
nearly as high as the lows are low, nor do they last as long.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's a tormented guy, haunted by failure more than
he's energized by success. And the last two seasons produced the
biggest disappointments of all. Both teams, the former 34-2 and the
latter 35-4, had valid national championship aspirations, yet
neither came close. A year ago, the Jayhawks were beaten in the
second round. By Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair,'' Williams argues. ``The past couple seasons,
expectations have been so high that it's been impossible to feel
good about yourself, because you don't win a national title or get
to the Final Four. Yet deep down inside, I know we did a good job
with those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The most crazed of Jayhawks fans would roundly disagree, of
course. But they should, nonetheless, love the current team. So
what if it has been out of the rankings for four of the last five
weeks and had to settle for a ho-hum sixth seed in the Midwest
Regional bracket?
</P>
<P>
   These kitty Hawks, for now, aren't hot NBA prospects or
consensus All-Americans, which routinely pepper Williams' rosters.
They're a somewhat anonymous lot, a collection of fresh-faced works
in progress who return next season en masse save for Ryan Robertson
and T.J. Pugh.
</P>
<P>
   Kids. Yes, that's all they are _ kids. And Kentucky, the
defending national champion, the program that grabbed what Kansas
wanted in 1998, now looms in the second round in New Orleans. The
Wildcats may be concluding something of a down year, too, but you
do sort of hate to have to mess with them the first weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, on second thought, that might be the perfect matchup
for the Jayhawks. How mad could Kansans be about their losing early
to almighty Kentucky?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Williams, for one, fears the worst. Guess he's conditioned
to it.

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Duke gets to stay on Tobacco Road before heading for the Big
Apple. Michigan State has a short trip to Milwaukee. Auburn stayed
in the South, even if the NCAA seems to think Indianapolis is in
the ``South'' these days.
</P>
<P>
   So who was the big winner when the NCAA men's selection
committee wrapped up the arduous business of picking and seeding
Sunday afternoon and announced its four No. 1s for this year's
foray into March Madness?
</P>
<P>
   How about Connecticut?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Calhoun's Huskies, 28-2 and the nation's No. 1 team for much
of the season, find that the Road to the Final Four leads through
Denver and Phoenix, hardly a hop, skip and jump from Storrs, Conn.
All things considered, however, they may not mind a trip out West.
</P>
<P>
   There are, it appears, some advantages to taking the long way to
St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there's that first-round game with Texas-San
Antonio. Arkansas, seeded fourth in the West, stands as the biggest
roadblock, and the Razorbacks won't come up until the regional
semifinal. The No. 2 seed in the region, Stanford, is a team the
Huskies already have beaten soundly on the Cardinal's home floor
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Other than tacking on a few extra frequent-flier miles,
Connecticut may have a good thing going here. Surely it has to be
better than last season, when the Huskies got to play North
Carolina in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   This draw even offers a chance to settle that, since the Tar
Heels are the No. 3 seed in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that Calhoun was able to see a silver
lining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested in brackets than geography,'' he said
Sunday. ``It's who's gonna be where you're gonna be, who you have
to beat to go where you want to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know where we want to go. We'd like to go to Florida. We
think we're good enough, but we know the trials and tribulations of
trying to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of trials and tribulations in setting this
64-team field, selection committee chairman C.M. Newton admitted
when the work finally was done. The biggest one involved what to do
with Connecticut, the Big East regular-season and conference
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, the Huskies belonged in the East, but No. 1-ranked
Duke (32-1 and winner of 27 straight) was an even better fit.
Michigan State (29-4), in turn, had earned its spot in the Midwest
as Big Ten regular-season and tournament champion and the logical
fit geographically.
</P>
<P>
   The committee then tinkered with putting Calhoun's team in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't work, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the conference constraints, we disadvantaged so
many teams, moving so many other teams out of regions, that we went
back and did another bracket with UConn in the West, and it was
much fairer,'' Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   So Auburn (27-3) got the South, where No. 2 seed Maryland and
No. 3 St. John's don't figure to go away without an argument. Even
on their own side of the bracket, the Tigers must contend with No.
4 Ohio State or No. 5 UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse, of course at the very least,
different. Auburn got the final No. 1 seed only after Maryland (a
loser to North Carolina in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament
semifinal) and Stanford (upset Saturday night by Oregon State)
failed to make appropriate last-minute bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``When both of those lost,'' Newton said, ``the committee felt
Auburn should retain its No. 1 standing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East, Duke got the sort of ride befitting its status as
the nation's No. 1 team and the clear favorite to wind up cutting
down the nets at Tropicana Field on March 29. The Blue Devils open
against 12-18 Florida A&AMP;M in Charlotte, then get the winner of the
Tulsa-College of Charleston game in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't win, we'll know that we did everything we could to
try to win it and we didn't let the pressure stop us,'' coach Mike
Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, meanwhile, Michigan State clinched the top seed
by ending Illinois' surprising run in the Big Ten tournament final.
Illinois was hoping to make the field at 15-17 but ran out of gas
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While that didn't do much for spirits in Champaign, it raised
them considerably in Norman, Okla., where the Sooners (seeded No.
13 in the Midwest) appear to have been the last team chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say they were pretty late,'' Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   Better late than not at all, of course, as TCU (19-10), Xavier
(21-10), Fresno State (21-11), Mississippi State (20-12) and
Rutgers (18-12) _ to name just a few _ would surely attest.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Big Ten got seven bids (with bubble boys Minnesota
and Purdue each surviving), followed by the Southeastern Conference
with six. The Big East and Big 12 got five each, while the Pac-10
and Conference USA managed four apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Among the day's big losers: The mighty ACC received only three
spots _ the same as the Missouri Valley, Western Athletic and
Atlantic 10 _ as potential No. 4s Wake Forest and North Carolina
State ultimately were found lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Others helped their stock near the end.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, the WAC champion, got a No. 2 seed in the Midwest, a trip
to New Orleans and a first-round game with Arkansas State as a
reward for its strong finish.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (Fla.) drew that honor in the East, while Maryland and
Stanford settled for the second spot in the South and West,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky overcame a late-season slump to win the SEC tournament
and grab a No. 3 seed in the Midwest, joining Cincinnati (East),
St. John's (South) and North Carolina (West) on the third line.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas' strong finish _ the Hogs beat Auburn and Kentucky late
in the season before losing to the Wildcats in the SEC title game _
got Nolan Richardson that No. 4 in the West, while Tennessee
(East), Arizona (Midwest) and Ohio State (South) completed the top
16 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   As for games to watch?
</P>
<P>
   Duke-Charleston could be fun (for a while, at least) in a
potential second-rounder. A Cincinnati-Temple second-round match,
meanwhile, could provide some fun in the coach-watching department
as mild-mannered Bob Huggins and laid-back John Chaney get
together.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Charlotte went from bubble team to No. 5 in the
Midwest by winning the C-USA tournament, and a second-round meeting
with No. 4 seed Arizona might be entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas and Kentucky also are on a course for a second-round
showdown in the Midwest, and St. John's Mike Jarvis could see his
old team (George Washington, coached by Tom Penders) in Round Two
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom, however, is that those will merely be
sideshows leading up to another Duke title. The Blue Devils are as
hot as can be and poised to take a lot of the fun out of the next
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be part of something bigger than themselves,''
Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   That other team that spent much of the season at No. 1 still
dreams of cutting the Blue Devils down to size.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut may find that a tall order. At least getting there
this time has a chance to be a little more fun.

GROUP OF ISLANDERS ON SAIPAN SALVAGE THEIR SEAFARING PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;   &LR;   &LR; SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands _ Lino Olopai strode up to
the counter at the McDonald's, and he didn't even have to order.
<P>
   ``The usual?'' the woman behind the counter asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he replied with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his friendly smile, his eyes were creased as if they
were looking at an empty ocean horizon. He didn't quite fit in a
fast-food joint, even one on Saipan, a small, tropical piece of the
United States in the western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   When he sat down at a table with his vanilla milk shake, Big Mac
and fries, he shook his head apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong just because I'm here, eating this. We
Carolinians are Americanized, but our hearts aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Olopai is a leader of a movement among Saipan's two local
indigenous groups, the Carolinians and the more-numerous Chamorros,
that is trying to rescue traditional islander culture from the
advance of modern consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   The movement stretches far beyond Saipan to Hawaii and hundreds
of inhabited atolls and volcanic peaks scattered across thousands
of miles of Pacific Ocean. On some islands, the old ways are still
alive, with grass skirts and a subsistence lifestyle, but on
others, such as Saipan, indigenous culture has been largely
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   As he munched on his Big Mac, Olopai explained that the key to
protecting indigenous identity is to revive the ancient art of
canoe navigating. For 6,000 years, Pacific islanders have steered
sailing canoes on long voyages without instruments or charts. The
navigators, or palu, guide themselves unerringly by the stars, wave
and wind direction, mid-ocean clusters of fish _ and, they say, the
guidance of ocean goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   Olopai and his cousin, Mau Piailug, one of the last master
navigators of the entire Pacific, are teaching the old ways of the
Refalawasch, or people of our land, as Carolinians call themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old Piailug, from the tiny Caroline Islands atoll of
Satawal, 500 miles southeast of Saipan, has given classes in
navigation in Saipan's high schools and is acting as a mentor for
young, would-be navigators. He also spends several months a year in
Hawaii, where he has helped native Hawaiians revive their long-dead
navigating tradition.
</P>
<P>
   On February 10, Piailug, his son and a Carolinian apprentice
embarked from Hawaii on a 6,220-mile, three-month canoe journey
through Micronesia, accompanied by 13 Hawaiian crew members. They
made their first landfall March 2, at Majuro in the Marshall
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The study of traditional navigating is a slow, painstaking task,
involving the memorization of a huge amount of astronomical and
marine data that has been passed on orally from generation to
generation. Most youngsters decide it's not for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gift from our ancestors over many, many years,''
said Piailug in an interview on Saipan before starting his voyage.
``It is courage. Courage is memory. I watch which person
comprehends, which one listens. Very few do. Many just want to run
off to America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, decades ago, the palu were respected because we
brought food from the sea. Now, the food comes in boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he was a child, there were about 45
traditional navigators in Micronesia, a broad area of the western
Pacific that includes the Mariana, Caroline and Marshall Islands.
Now there are only 15.
</P>
<P>
   In few cultures outside Micronesia is memory tied so closely to
survival. If a navigator at sea fails to remember the correct
formula of stars, currents or locations of fish clusters, he _ and
all those on board _ will fail to find land and thus perish. For
many Carolinians, therefore, there is a collective compulsion to
remember the old traditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northern Mariana Islands, the Carolinians are a small
minority. Carolinians total only 3,500, outnumbered by 17,000
members of the more Westernized Chamorro indigenous group, as well
as 4,000 U.S. ``mainlanders'' and 40,000 Asians who work in
Saipan's hotels and garment factories.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 10,000 Carolinians live in the Caroline Islands,
from where the Saipan Carolinians migrated after a huge typhoon in
1810.
</P>
<P>
   Although all navigators and almost all canoe crew members are
men _ part of the rigid gender divisions of traditional islander
culture _ Carolinian women activists are supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Navigating is the one thing that united our people, spread out
as we are on so many islands,'' said Cinta Kaipat, an aide in the
local legislature and the first Carolinian woman ever to become a
lawyer. ``You can't buy it, you can't sell it, and no one else can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong streak of anti-materialism prevails among the
Carolinians, in part because they have long lagged behind the
Chamorros in economic development and are especially vulnerable to
the harsh side of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Carolinian unemployment on Saipan is estimated at 20 percent,
and alcoholism, drug abuse (mainly of crystal methamphetamine),
domestic violence and obesity are widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing that has happened to our people is money,''
Kaipat said, referring to the U.S. government's multimillion-dollar
payments of claims for World War II combat damage and the even
larger payments, in the 1980s and 1990s, by Japanese hotel
developers to the lucky few with beachfront property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It began setting families against each other, brothers versus
sisters. The wealthier people got, the poorer they got,'' she said.
``It's all about fast food and convenience. You open up a can of
Spam, as opposed to going out to the reef to fish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation of striking it rich pervades almost the whole
society and has done enormous damage, while raising the standard of
living of the lucky ones,'' said Samuel McPhetres, a historian of
the Pacific Islands who teaches at College of the Northern
Marianas, Saipan's community college. ``Wishful thinking is the
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Carolinians' traditional concept of tipiyeew, or
solidarity, has dissolved. ``Now, Joe Blow over there needs help,
but so what, I don't know him from Adam,'' Kaipat said, mimicking
the modern attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Kaipat is the leader of several hundred Carolinians and
Chamorros who are lobbying the local government to lift its ban on
habitation of a chain of small islands north of Saipan, which were
evacuated after a volcano erupted there in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to lead a collective return to her home island, Pagan,
and other northern islands to re-establish traditionalist
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say that the loss of identity among the Carolinians,
who had less contact with Western society until recent years, has
been much less severe than among the Chamorros, who underwent
significant mixing with Filipino garrison soldiers under Spanish
colonialism in the 18th and 19th centuries and have been relatively
Westernized ever since. As a result, there is little support for
old traditions among the Chamorros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, the home was the center of life,'' Kaipat said. ``Now,
can you imagine, grandma and grandpa have to be schlepped off to
play bingo all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Saipan's local government has helped the Carolinian
traditionalist movement grow, aiding cultural activities and the
navigation classes. Recently, however, the money has dried up, and
the government's Carolinian Affairs Office is now seeking federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to reach kids nowadays, with all the TV and
drugs and everything else,'' said Frank Rabauliman, the office
director.
</P>
<P>
   But even the traditionalists like a dose of modernity every now
and then. Like Olopai, who admits that his craving for fast food
``pretty much contradicts'' his beliefs, they want the best of both
worlds: material progress and cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
   Kaipat returned to Saipan two years ago from the Midwest, where
she spent 20 years working, going to college and law school.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the University of Minnesota, where she got her law
degree, the sub-zero cold didn't faze her. In fact, it seemed
exotic. Despite the strong loyalty that pulled her home, ``I liked
it, you know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A faraway look came over her face, but she clearly wasn't
thinking about her people's ancient traditions or sailing the open
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it because it was really different from here.''
</P>

 A VOYAGE FROM THE PAST  &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAIPAN _ On February 10, master Carolinian navigator Mau Piailug
and 15 navigators and crewmen from Micronesia and Hawaii set sail
aboard the Makalii, a 54-foot, double-hulled traditional sailing
canoe, on a three-month, 6,200-mile voyage joining the past and the
present, Hawaii and Micronesia.
</P>
<P>
   Although Piailug is virtually unknown on the U.S. mainland, his
name is a household word in Hawaii and elsewhere in the Pacific,
where he is known as having single-handedly rescued the dying art
of traditional navigating.
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii, he has acted as teacher and mentor to Nainoa
Thompson, who has become a well-known navigator and an influential
spokesman for native cultures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Piailug, a Micronesian, was recruited by the Hawaiians,
who are Polynesian, to navigate a canoe from Hawaii to Tahiti, in
the first such voyage by traditional navigational methods since the
settlement of Hawaii centuries before. Piailug had never sailed in
Polynesia, but he was able to combine his own sailing knowledge
with Hawaiian traditions to get the canoe to Tahiti safely.
</P>
<P>
   Since that trip, Piailug and Thompson have led long voyages
through the Pacific, crossing thousand-mile empty stretches without
sextants, lorans or other modern navigating tools. Instead, they
use lore handed down orally from generation to generation over the
centuries: complex astronomical formulas, the types of waves,
location of schools of fish.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, Piailug's proteges are accompanying him
back to the atoll of Satawal, his home in the Caroline Islands, and
to Saipan. The trip aboard the Makalii will make eight stops in the
Marshall, Caroline and Mariana Islands _ ranging from atolls where
the only garments are the men's thu, or loincloth, and the women's
lava-lava skirt, to the modern hubbub of Saipan and Guam.
</P>
<P>
   But even on the tiniest islands, canoe navigating and other
traditions are dying out. Piailug and the others hope to rally the
people at each stop to return to the old ways.

 CLINTON TRIP TO CENTRAL AMERICA AIMS TO HEAD OFF IMMIGRATION  &HT;     By LOUIS FREEDBERG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton begins a four-day trip to Central
America Monday for a first-hand look at the region's efforts to
recover from Hurricane Mitch and highlight the administration's
plan to prevent a mass migration from the devastated area.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of that proposal is an administration plan to
send $650 million in emergency aid to the region, on top of $350
million already spent. The aid is intended to contribute to the
immediate repair of the region's infrastructure, as well as assist
the long-term rebuilding of a shattered economy in Honduras and to
a lesser extent in Nicaragua and El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the rebuilding proceeds quickly _ and provides hope to
the millions of Central Americans whose lives have been disrupted
by the most devastating natural disaster to strike the region in
modern history _ large numbers of Central Americans could decide to
migrate north.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a matter of grave concern to us,'' said Benjamin Zapata,
the interim chief of the Honduran mission in Washington, D.C. ``It
is in the forefront of discussions at the highest levels between
the governments concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch cut a brutal swath through Central America in
November, killing 9,000 people, leaving thousands homeless and
causing as much as $10 billion in damage. The reconstruction effort
will be a complex task that will go far beyond providing shelter or
rebuilding roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will be needed is providing people a makeshift school for
their kids, a health clinic _ a sense of community and a semblance
of ordinariness,'' said Demetri Papademetriou, director of the
international migration program at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. ``But if people feel they can't feed their
families, or the aid is too little or too late, they will start
looking at other options.''
</P>
<P>
   If they do decide to move northward, increased migration would
put an added strain on social services, especially in California,
Texas and New York, and it would place even more pressure on the
heightened efforts by U.S. immigration authorities to prevent
illegal migration across the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton attempts to persuade Central Americans that the
United States will help rebuild the region, he also must find a way
to persuade Congress to approve the money that would do that,
providing would-be migrants with an incentive to stay put.
Republicans in Congress are reluctant to approve the emergency
funds, although they say their concerns are strictly budget
related. ``It's not politics at all,'' said House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, R-Texas, last week. ``It's called budget
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, concerns about a wave of illegal immigration have been
unfounded. Despite media reports in recent weeks indicating that
large numbers of Hondurans say they intend to head to the United
States, there is scant evidence of a mass migration. Apprehensions
of Central Americans on the U.S.-Mexico border increased
substantially immediately after the hurricane, but the numbers of
are still tiny compared to apprehensions of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three months of 1998, 6,064 migrants classified as
``other than Mexicans'' _ mostly Central Americans _ were
apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol on the southwest border. That
contrasts with 4,734 apprehensions during the same period the
previous year. During the same period in 1998, the Border Patrol
apprehended 234,000 Mexicans, compared to 205,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The figures do suggest that more Central Americans are heading
north, however, and the administration is nervously eyeing the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake for us not to be concerned,'' said Russ
Bergeron, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ``There is no one who can predict with a high level of
certainty what will or will not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Others within the INS are much more alarmed. In fact, a
classified report prepared by the INS' own intelligence unit refers
to ``an expected mass influx'' from Central America and describes
the attempts of several groups of migrants from the region to cross
the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, which was obtained by Copley News
Service, a group of seven Hondurans apprehended in Laredo, Texas,
said that ``emergency aid is only getting to the big towns and not
the rural areas, and this is the reason why they attempted to get
to the United States. Further questioning revealed that more groups
of people from Honduras were headed toward the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the hurricane has placed Central America back
on the agenda of U.S. foreign policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1970s and 1980s, Central America was racked by
wars pitting leftist guerrilla groups against authoritarian
regimes. Caught in the crosswinds of Cold War politics, the region
was at the receiving end of massive amounts of military and other
aid.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1990s, the amount of aid to Central America has
slowed to a trickle. In 1985, for example, the United States Agency
for International Development spent $1.2 billion in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hurricane, the entire region was due to receive only
$145 million.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown factor is what the Mexican government will do if
large numbers of Central Americans cross into Mexico on their way
to the United States. Mexican officials annually apprehend and
return between 80,000 and 90,000 Central American migrants to their
home countries.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Mexico would be willing or able to deter a mass
migration of Central Americans is another question. Currently,
Mexico only has 150 agents posted on its 650-mile border with
Guatemala and Belize.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, March 7, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   TOURISTS-DANGER-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ The killing of tourists
by rebels in Uganda raises the questions of why weren't the
tourists warned that they were in a potentially dangerous region,
and were they crazy to be there in the first place? But the reality
is simple, and particularly relevant at a time of rising and
increasingly exotic global travel: Predicting danger for tourists
is a crap shoot, tour operators and foreign service officials say.
By Donald G. McNeil Jr. (`i' category). WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS-CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ The U.S. crime rate is
plunging, but its prison population is exploding. No matter how
much crime drops, the U.S. will still have to add the equivalent of
one new jail or prison every week for perhaps another decade,
federal officials say. Some even believe the prison boom could be
permanent, at least for another generation. A big the reason is
that so many of the new inmates are drug offenders. By Timothy
Egan. (`a' category). WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-POWER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Twenty years after the meltdown
at Three Mile Island, the nuclear industry has succeeded in ways
that were hard to imagine as Pennsylvania cowered in fear in March
1979 and plants around the country subsequently lost their luster
and scores of projects to build reactors were abandoned. The
industry is doing better now, ironically, because it is marching
ever faster toward extinction. By Matthew L. Wald. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   PBS-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ The recent flap over proposed format
changes in `Washington Week in Review' revived a nagging question:
What is the mission of public television these days, and who needs
it? The profusion of cable stations, some of which are doing the
sort of programming that Public Broadcasting could once call its
own, has sent the so-called noncommercial broadcasters into
something of an identity crisis. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-TIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Internet encompasses all
the world's time zones, making for a considerable amount of
incompatibility in transactions and other online activities. A
watch-manufacturing company, Swatch, is trying to introduce a
standard Internet time system. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   COUNSEL-TEXT-REVIEW (Washington) _ Last week the Clinton
administration completed a remarkable turnaround in its thinking
about the independent counsel law, which President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno persuaded Congress to renew nearly five
years ago. Excerpts from congressional testimony and other
statements illustrate the history of flipflops on the statute.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-NEWSPAPERS-TEXT-REVIEW (Toronto) _ It's not easy being in
the news business in Canada. You stare at juicy American stories
nearly every day while your own pages fill with curling scores and
wheat quotas. Oh, for a big, page one blockbuster! In February, a
Canadian newspaper thought it had a real scoop when it reported:
`U.S. believes North Korea would target Montreal for a nuclear
strike.' Excerpts on how the story played out.
</P>
<P>
   NONSTORIES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With the end of the century
approaching, Americans are making lists. Lots of lists. The Top 100
Films. The Top 100 Books. Now, a list of the top 100 most
unimportant news events of the century.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CREDITCARD-REVIEW (Undated) _ For Clinton, another
charge dismissed. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-FOREIGNPOLICY-REVIEW (Washington) _ For six years, the
Clinton administration and its critics have flailed about for some
grand Unified Field Theory of Foreign Relations _ something as neat
as the Cold War concept of containment to define priorities. Recent
U.S. actions on Kosovo and China have something odd in common: they
have come to mark the two extremes of the the administration's
struggle to bring coherence to U.S. foreign policy at a time that
often seems incoherent itself. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-CHINA-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Japan seemed resentful and envious
as it watched China's economy boom last year. Japan was suffering
its worst slowdown in more than half a century, and China was the
only Asian country to survive the regional economic crisis
enhanced. But now that China's economy is showing signs of frailty,
Japanese executives and economists are viewing that situation with
apprehension. By Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-WARCRIMES-REVIEW (Undated) _ While German scientists
conducted hideous experiments on concentration camp prisoners,
their lesser-known Japanese counterparts were waging full-scale
biological warfare and subjecting human beings to ghastly
experiments of their own _ on a far greater scale than the Germans.
Taking decades to emerge, the Japanese record of atrocities is
still producing revelations. The delay illustrates striking
differences in the willingness of the two former Axis allies to
come to terms with their past. It has also thrown a harsh light on
Cold War rivalries. By Ralph Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   GUATEMALA-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ When a Guatemalan truth
commission implicated the U.S. in the creation of a killing machine
that ravaged Mayan villages in the 1980s, it raised troubling
questions. How could a country that calls itself a beacon of
democracy link its military and intelligence agencies so intimately
to Guatemala's darkest reactionary forces? Some answers, or at
least clues, can be found in scores of declassified documents the
Clinton administration released to the National Security Archive.

 &HT;    DiMaggio's rich life ends
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the fisherman's son who came to define not just
baseball but all of sport for generations of Americans, once said
of his life's work, ``There's no skill involved. Just go up there
and swing at the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   At once modest and aloof, the words described how he lived his
life as well, a rich and full existence that ended when the Yankee
Clipper succumbed to a brief but vicious fight with lung cancer. He
was 84 when he died at home in Hollywood, Fla., after surgery Oct.
14 for the removal of a cancerous tumor from his right lung.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, who celebrated his last birthday Nov. 24 in the
hospital, was expected by many not to make it home. His lungs were
drained at least twice after surgery and he was given last rites
Nov. 16, when his blood pressure plummeted. But he did make it
home, and lived long enough to see a premature report of his death
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Until his hospitalization, DiMaggio had remained vibrant and
made regular ceremonial visits to Yankee Stadium, where he was last
honored Sept. 26 on Joe DiMaggio Day and presented copies of the 10
World Series rings the Yankees won over his 13-year career.
</P>
<P>
   But he was unable to accept the club's invitation to throw out
the first pitch of the 1998 World Series and already had been
hospitalized five days when the Yankees-San Diego series began. He
was among the last links to the World War II-era Yankees dynasty,
having broken in with the team in 1936. He played three seasons
with Lou Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   Though linked forever to the 56-game hitting streak that endures
57 years after he set it, DiMaggio's grace in center field left a
stronger imprint on New York, which watched him rise as the first
Italian-descended sports super hero the nation had produced. The
fly ball never seemed to fall until DiMaggio arrived beneath it,
prompting his detractors to gripe he'd never had a tough chance out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No outfielder is a real workman unless he can turn his back on
the ball, run his legs off and take the catch over his shoulder,''
DiMaggio once instructed. ``Back-pedaling outfielders get
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He had come up a shortstop, one of three baseball playing sons
of Joseph DiMaggio, an Italian-born fisherman who settled in San
Francisco. He was just 17 when he signed with the Pacific Coast
League's Oakland Seals and the following year, DiMaggio put
together a 61-game hitting streak. He made it to the Bronx to stay
in 1936 at age 21. Save for three years of military service, he was
the Yankees' constant presence into the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   A career .325 hitter, batting average hardly described his
exactitude at the plate. He went the entire 1941 season with just
13 strikeouts in 541 at-bats. He finished his career with but 369
strikeouts to go with 361 career homers. A three-time American
League MVP, some of his statistics suffered from playing at
spaceous Yankee Stadium. But then again, DiMaggio's game was far
more than numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball isn't statistics,'' New York writer Jimmy Breslin
said. ``It's Joe DiMaggio rounding second base.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 14, 1941, he singled off Chicago's Eddie Smith, beginning
a run that may never be equaled. Nearly a month later, another
single against the White Sox gave him a 29-game hitting streak,
breaking the Yankees' club record. Rogers Hornsby's NL record of 33
fell as did George Sisler's AL mark of 41. And when historians
insisted Wee Willie Keeler had recorded a 44-game streak in 1887,
DiMaggio broke it too before three groundouts July 17 in Cleveland
ended the run at 56 games.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, DiMaggio had 56 singles, 16 doubles, seven
triples and 15 home runs and the following day, he began a 16-game
streak which did not include a hit recorded in Detroit in the 1941
All-Star game. Pete Rose summoned a 44-game streak in 1978, but no
one else has yet approached 56.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, DiMaggio's shadow was purposely diminished. He
often dined alone, was polite but distant with teammates and,
partly as a result of public criticism he received in a contract
dispute, he was also wary of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he said hello to you,'' Detroit's Hank Greenberg once said,
``that was a long conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know him well,'' New York columnist Jimmy Cannon
wrote, ``although I've killed a lot of time in his company.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 37, slowed by back and foot injuries, DiMaggio turned
down a new $100,000 contract and announced his retirement in 1951
by simply saying, ``I no longer have it.'' But in his last World
Series that fall, he shared the Yankees outfield with a brutishly
built Oklahoma kid, at least until he waved Mickey Mantle off a fly
ball in Game 2. Mickey Mantle slipped and hurt his knee on the
play, opening a new chapter in Yankees lore.
</P>
<P>
   A failed marriage to Marilyn Monroe broke his heart but only
increased his public persona in retirement. Celebrated in song
(Simon and Garfunkel's ``Mrs. Robinson'') and in the written word
(a non-present hero in Ernest Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the
Sea''), DiMaggio's name came to represent new things to each new
generation, even as he was trying to hawk a coffee maker.
</P>
<P>
   He sold a lot of them, too, which only fit a larger pattern.
When asked once how DiMaggio excelled, New York teammate Tommy
Heinrich replied, ``He does everything better than anyone else.''

WORLD WAR II ATROCITIES: COMPARING THE UNSPEAKABLE TO THE
UNTHINKABLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Auschwitz. Dachau. Ping Fan. Changchun. In the shorthand of
World War II atrocities, some names are more recognizable than
others.
</P>
<P>
   But while Nazi scientists like Josef Mengele conducted hideous
experiments on concentration camp prisoners, their lesser-known
Japanese counterparts, led by Gen. Shiro Ishii, were waging
full-scale biological warfare and subjecting human beings to
ghastly experiments of their own _ and on a far greater scale than
the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine hundreds of Mengeles,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper of
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, who has been calling on
the Japanese to face up to their past as openly as the Germans
have.
</P>
<P>
   Ping Fan, built by Ishii, the mastermind of Japanese germ
warfare and its infamous Unit 731, was a camp of plague-bearing
fleas, rat cages and warrens for human guinea pigs. Changchun, 150
miles south, was another huge installation for germ tests on
plants, animals and people.
</P>
<P>
   Though not approaching the systematic exterminations by the
Nazis, the Japanese record of atrocities _ what victims call ``the
Asian Holocaust'' _ is still producing revelations more than 50
years after the end of World War II. The delay illustrates the
West's Eurocentric view of wartime suffering as well as striking
differences in the willingness of the two former Axis allies to
come to terms with their past.
</P>
<P>
   It has also thrown a harsh light on Cold War rivalries. As early
as 1949, the Soviet Union convicted 12 Japanese for biological war
crimes. Although the published transcript contained exhaustive
details of Unit 731's crimes, the accounts were largely ignored or
dismissed in the West as communist propaganda. The Allies did,
however, prosecute 5,570 Japanese, but none for biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, American and British scholars and
journalists rediscovered the germ war issue, adding new details of
U.S. involvement in covering up the crimes. The story has since
taken on a new momentum and questions of the guilt of Emperor
Hirohito persist. Justice Department officials, unfettered by the
State Department, are complaining that the Japanese are refusing to
provide data on suspected war criminals, who would be barred from
entering the United States, just as 60,000 Germans and other
Europeans are now.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a 1997 Japanese lawsuit by Chinese seeks
compensation for victims of Japan's germ warfare. Former members of
Unit 731 have been confessing crimes. Chinese researchers say they
keep uncovering new sites where anthrax, typhoid, plague and other
diseases were spread, wiping out perhaps hundreds of thousands of
Chinese. Another 10,000 or more Chinese, Russians and perhaps some
U.S. prisoners of war as well, researchers say, were killed in
ghoulish experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials insist they lack proof, although by other
accounts they have sealed wartime archives returned to them by the
U.S. authorities in the 1950s. With powerful right-wing and
militaristic factions long opposed to confessions of wartime guilt,
the Japanese publisher of a translation of ``The Rape of Nanking,''
the 1997 best-seller by Iris Chang (Basic Books), postponed its
publication.
</P>
<P>
   For decades after the war, veterans of Unit 731 and other
biological warfare detachments led Japanese medicine, say scholars
like Sheldon H. Harris, emeritus professor of history at California
State University at Northridge, and author of ``Factories of
Death'' (Routledge, 1994), on the Japanese germ war program.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in 1992 that the government officially acknowledged
that the Japanese army forced several hundred thousand Korean women
into prostitution in World War II, and it was only last year that a
Japanese court ordered the government to pay $2,300 each to three
plaintiffs. By contrast, Germany, in its schools and the press, has
dealt unflinchingly with its past and paid victims reparations now
amounting to about $80 billion, with private industry planning to
pay billions more.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese accountability for germ war atrocities got lost in the
Cold War. With the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Soviet Union and
the United States competed to snare Ishii's data. The Americans won
out, promising immunity from war-crimes prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dohini, a former lawyer on the U.S. prosecution team in
Tokyo, said recently he had no idea that the crimes had included
germ warfare. In December 1945, he said, he had carried a
top-secret message to the U.S. authorities in Tokyo. ``I assumed it
had to do with the emperor, because soon after, I discovered we
were not able to try him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He now calls the decision a big mistake, since revelations have
pointed to the monarch's knowledge of germ warfare. ``I don't think
there is any question of the emperor's guilt,'' he said.

WHY JAPAN IS ROOTING FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By SHERYL WuDUNN

<P>
   TOKYO _ Last year, Japan seemed to bite its lip as it watched
China's economy continue to boom. Japan was suffering its worst
slowdown in more than half a century, and its rival was the only
Asian country to survive the Asian economic crisis with its
reputation enhanced. Commentators made invidious comparisons
between Chinese decisiveness and Japan's inability to confront its
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   All this was hard to take in Japan, Asia's largest economy, and
it hurt even more when President Jiang Zemin made a state visit in
November _ the first ever by a Chinese leader _ and told Japan how
terrible it had been in World War II. Nobody wanted China's economy
to collapse, but there was a bit of a yearning for China to stumble
and learn its vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Now that has happened. China's economy is showing signs of
frailty, even though officials still hope for economic growth this
year of 7 percent. And Japanese business executives and economists
are finding that they are looking at China's economy these days not
so much with resentment or envy as with apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very nervous about them following the same path as the
Japanese economy in the next five years,'' said Takashi Hoshino, a
China specialist and director for research at the Institute for
Socio-Economic Infrastructure and Services here. ``There are very
big problems in China. In particular, the situation of the
financial sector _ the banking problems _ their situation is quite
similar to Japan's recent experience.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also huge differences. Japan's economy is more than
four times the size of China's. China can still enjoy catch-up
gains that are unavailable to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But some Japanese see in China a bit of their own experience.
China has enjoyed the go-go growth that Japan went through in the
1980s. But since Japan's speculative economic bubble burst in the
early 1990s, it has taken eight years for the nation to come to
grips with fundamental problems that still need to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   As a communist country trying to make the transition from
command economy to the market, China obviously has problems Japan
never faced; its dying state sector claims about 40 percent of
total economic output. Japan, with 120 million people, can tap into
a savings pool of $9 trillion. China, with about 1.2 billion
people, does not have nearly as big a savings pool.
</P>
<P>
   But China also has the creeping burdens that have plagued Japan:
government spending on public works to boost growth, a practice of
lifetime employment, growing public debt and a broken financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   China's economy is expected to grow this year, while Japan's is
going to have to fight to reach zero growth. But like Japan, China
is facing the threat of deflation, as prices begin to sink, as
factories become idle and as inventories rise with products no one
wants.
</P>
<P>
   With ailing state businesses trimming wages and workers, Chinese
consumers are increasingly worried about the future, hoarding their
money, rather than spending it, which would help boost nationwide
consumption. As in Japan, the only big spender in China is the
government, which is pouring money into concrete, bricks and mortar
for bridges, dams and other projects, even if they crumble thanks
to hasty construction or corruption.
</P>
<P>
   And as in Japan, China's spending is swelling the budget deficit
to record levels. And the banking system, buckling under bad loans
amounting to 30 percent to 40 percent of the nation's total
economic pie, is reluctant to lend. China, like Japan, is caught in
a credit squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very jittery,'' said Fred Hu, a China economist at
Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. ``They are moving from a world of
cradle-to-grave welfare system to a very uncertain brave new
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic relations between China and Japan are complicated by
more than a century of profound political and military antagonisms.
Many Chinese are irritated that Japan has not apologized more
forthrightly for World War II atrocities. Even today, many young
Chinese say with remarkable bluntness that they hate Japanese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese worry that China could become a militarist bully
in the next century the way Japan was in the middle of this one.
``China can become as militaristic, as expansionist and as arrogant
as we were,'' said a Japanese legislator who travels to China
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the two largest economies in Asia could
both be ailing troubles many economists. Many Japanese recognize
that growth in China would help maintain stability in the region by
maintaining the flow of trade and a firm exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in the habit of rejoicing in the misfortunes of
others,'' said Sakaaki Numata, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign
Ministry. ``And I'm not quite sure what is happening in China can
be described as misfortune just yet.''

PBS: CLINGING TO A DISAPPEARING NICHE

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, ``contentious'' was not a word associated with
``Washington Week in Review,'' the solid or stolid weekly PBS
get-together of mainstream journalists who never raised their
voices in disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   While over at the cable stations, a gabble of strong-lunged
television personalities were making reputations with passionate
encounters over the latest crowd-pleaser, ``Washington Week'' kept
doing what seemed in the cable commotion to come unnaturally,
reporting on subjects of consequence that its panelists knew
something about.
</P>
<P>
   But then Ken Bode, who had been the program's moderator since
1994 (and continues to serve as dean of Northwestern University's
Medill School of Journalism), quit or was bumped from his
television job, along with his producer Elizabeth Piersol. The
details are not agreed upon, but it appears that Dalton Delan, the
new head of programming at WETA, the Washington public station
responsible for ``Washington Week,'' was suggesting adding
ingredients like man-on-the-street interviews, appearances by
students and liberal-conservative clashes to give the half-hour
what has been described as more ``edge'' and ``attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The forces of righteousness came quickly to Bode's defense, and
whatever Delan's plans, they were put on hold or muddied
sufficiently to quell the indignation of the program's panelists
and its fans. Yet the dust-up leaves a nagging question: What is
the mission of public television these days, and who needs it?
</P>
<P>
   Delan, who came to PBS by way of cable, may reasonably have felt
that he had a mandate to refurbish the 32-year-old talking-head
program. The profusion of cable stations, some of which are doing
the sort of programming that Public Broadcasting could once call
its own, has sent the so-called noncommercial broadcasters into
something of an identity crisis. Looking for wildlife and wild
scenery? Try the Discovery Channel any week. Looking for children's
shows? There's Nickelodeon. In the mood for hard-edged
documentaries? HBO may come through. Old movies are never in short
supply. And if it's Washington news you're after, CNN has plenty of
that.
</P>
<P>
   PBS can make a case that its fare is by and large better, as
well as free to people without cable. Offerings like ``Nova,''
``Frontline'' and ``The American Experience'' have long been
network showpieces and remain the PBS vision of what it should be
doing. But the old-time monopoly of virtue is over. These days, the
once-proudly commercial-free network has plenty of commercials.
Tuning into ``The Newshour with Jim Lehrer'' or ``The Nightly
Business Report'' provides a cornucopia of silly slogans on behalf
of financial institutions. (The ``Newshour'' staff may have earned
its audience's trust that editorial blandishments from, say, Archer
Daniels Midland, will be resisted, but can one trust the innovative
Delan?)
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Teletubbies'' is a sly plug for the gay life remains
in dispute, but it is indisputably a merchandising bonanza that
exploits the youngest viewers of all.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is any claim that PBS refuses to pander to a
certain sort of audience taste, the fare during the current pledge
period _ self-help stuff, easy-to-take music and this and that _
tells a different story. The prolonged and witless pitches manage
to make network commercials seem almost intelligent even as they
test the patience of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet PBS retains a loyal and influential cadre of fans addicted
to ``The Newshour,'' ``Masterpiece Theater,'' ``Mystery'' and other
favorites. It's a classy constituency that has proved to be a
potent force when appropriation time comes around, and _ as
demonstrated by the Bode affair _ can join effectively in the
defense of endangered species like news programs about news.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the pledge period's upbeat pitches (``Wow, folks,
the fact that you are watching PBS confirms how special you
are!''), the future is shaky. Producers know, for example, that the
BBC and other British suppliers of the up-market goods that
American viewers have come to credit to PBS can now make their
deals with commercial cable networks that have deeper pockets than
public stations. And they also know that PBS serves a relatively
older audience in a time when youth is ascendant.
</P>
<P>
   So a new executive producer of, say, ``Washington Week in
Review,'' with its over-50-something viewers who by the
demographics of mortality are not likely to move in a happy
direction, may be tempted toward ``edge'' and ``attitude'' and
anything else that might conceivably lure a few more 30-somethings
if not high-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of this pledge period, while ``Washington Week'' is
preempted by programs providing health hints, money management and
Andrew Lloyd Webber, the producers may enjoy a respite from
controversy. But the forces operating on public television to keep
pressing the limits of commercial appeal remain compelling. Not
only is the fate of ``Washington Week'' far from settled, but, more
unsettling, the ideals that sparked PBS in the first place are
afloat in limbo.

   As a communist country trying to make the transition from
command economy to the market, China obviously has problems Japan
never faced; its dying state sector claims about 40 percent of
total economic output. Japan, with 120 million people, can tap into
a savings pool of $9 trillion. China, with about 1.2 billion
people, does not have nearly as big a savings pool.
</P>
<P>
   But China also has the creeping burdens that have plagued Japan:
government spending on public works to boost growth, a practice of
lifetime employment, growing public debt and a broken financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   China's economy is expected to grow this year, while Japan's is
going to have to fight to reach zero growth. But like Japan, China
is facing the threat of deflation, as prices begin to sink, as
factories become idle and as inventories rise with products no one
wants.
</P>
<P>
   With ailing state businesses trimming wages and workers, Chinese
consumers are increasingly worried about the future, hoarding their
money, rather than spending it, which would help boost nationwide
consumption. As in Japan, the only big spender in China is the
government, which is pouring money into concrete, bricks and mortar
for bridges, dams and other projects, even if they crumble thanks
to hasty construction or corruption.
</P>
<P>
   And as in Japan, China's spending is swelling the budget deficit
to record levels. And the banking system, buckling under bad loans
amounting to 30 percent to 40 percent of the nation's total
economic pie, is reluctant to lend. China, like Japan, is caught in
a credit squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very jittery,'' said Fred Hu, a China economist at
Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. ``They are moving from a world of
cradle-to-grave welfare system to a very uncertain brave new
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic relations between China and Japan are complicated by
more than a century of profound political and military antagonisms.
Many Chinese are irritated that Japan has not apologized more
forthrightly for World War II atrocities. Even today, many young
Chinese say with remarkable bluntness that they hate Japanese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese worry that China could become a militarist bully
in the next century the way Japan was in the middle of this one.
``China can become as militaristic, as expansionist and as arrogant
as we were,'' said a Japanese legislator who travels to China
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the two largest economies in Asia could
both be ailing troubles many economists. Many Japanese recognize
that growth in China would help maintain stability in the region by
maintaining the flow of trade and a firm exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in the habit of rejoicing in the misfortunes of
others,'' said Sakaaki Numata, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign
Ministry. ``And I'm not quite sure what is happening in China can
be described as misfortune just yet.''

PBS: CLINGING TO A DISAPPEARING NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, ``contentious'' was not a word associated with
``Washington Week in Review,'' the solid or stolid weekly PBS
get-together of mainstream journalists who never raised their
voices in disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   While over at the cable stations, a gabble of strong-lunged
television personalities were making reputations with passionate
encounters over the latest crowd-pleaser, ``Washington Week'' kept
doing what seemed in the cable commotion to come unnaturally,
reporting on subjects of consequence that its panelists knew
something about.
</P>
<P>
   But then Ken Bode, who had been the program's moderator since
1994 (and continues to serve as dean of Northwestern University's
Medill School of Journalism), quit or was bumped from his
television job, along with his producer Elizabeth Piersol. The
details are not agreed upon, but it appears that Dalton Delan, the
new head of programming at WETA, the Washington public station
responsible for ``Washington Week,'' was suggesting adding
ingredients like man-on-the-street interviews, appearances by
students and liberal-conservative clashes to give the half-hour
what has been described as more ``edge'' and ``attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The forces of righteousness came quickly to Bode's defense, and
whatever Delan's plans, they were put on hold or muddied
sufficiently to quell the indignation of the program's panelists
and its fans. Yet the dust-up leaves a nagging question: What is
the mission of public television these days, and who needs it?
</P>
<P>
   Delan, who came to PBS by way of cable, may reasonably have felt
that he had a mandate to refurbish the 32-year-old talking-head
program. The profusion of cable stations, some of which are doing
the sort of programming that Public Broadcasting could once call
its own, has sent the so-called noncommercial broadcasters into
something of an identity crisis. Looking for wildlife and wild
scenery? Try the Discovery Channel any week. Looking for children's
shows? There's Nickelodeon. In the mood for hard-edged
documentaries? HBO may come through. Old movies are never in short
supply. And if it's Washington news you're after, CNN has plenty of
that.
</P>
<P>
   PBS can make a case that its fare is by and large better, as
well as free to people without cable. Offerings like ``Nova,''
``Frontline'' and ``The American Experience'' have long been
network showpieces and remain the PBS vision of what it should be
doing. But the old-time monopoly of virtue is over. These days, the
once-proudly commercial-free network has plenty of commercials.
Tuning into ``The Newshour with Jim Lehrer'' or ``The Nightly
Business Report'' provides a cornucopia of silly slogans on behalf
of financial institutions. (The ``Newshour'' staff may have earned
its audience's trust that editorial blandishments from, say, Archer
Daniels Midland, will be resisted, but can one trust the innovative
Delan?)
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Teletubbies'' is a sly plug for the gay life remains
in dispute, but it is indisputably a merchandising bonanza that
exploits the youngest viewers of all.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is any claim that PBS refuses to pander to a
certain sort of audience taste, the fare during the current pledge
period _ self-help stuff, easy-to-take music and this and that _
tells a different story. The prolonged and witless pitches manage
to make network commercials seem almost intelligent even as they
test the patience of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet PBS retains a loyal and influential cadre of fans addicted
to ``The Newshour,'' ``Masterpiece Theater,'' ``Mystery'' and other
favorites. It's a classy constituency that has proved to be a
potent force when appropriation time comes around, and _ as
demonstrated by the Bode affair _ can join effectively in the
defense of endangered species like news programs about news.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the pledge period's upbeat pitches (``Wow, folks,
the fact that you are watching PBS confirms how special you
are!''), the future is shaky. Producers know, for example, that the
BBC and other British suppliers of the up-market goods that
American viewers have come to credit to PBS can now make their
deals with commercial cable networks that have deeper pockets than
public stations. And they also know that PBS serves a relatively
older audience in a time when youth is ascendant.
</P>
<P>
   So a new executive producer of, say, ``Washington Week in
Review,'' with its over-50-something viewers who by the
demographics of mortality are not likely to move in a happy
direction, may be tempted toward ``edge'' and ``attitude'' and
anything else that might conceivably lure a few more 30-somethings
if not high-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of this pledge period, while ``Washington Week'' is
preempted by programs providing health hints, money management and
Andrew Lloyd Webber, the producers may enjoy a respite from
controversy. But the forces operating on public television to keep
pressing the limits of commercial appeal remain compelling. Not
only is the fate of ``Washington Week'' far from settled, but, more
unsettling, the ideals that sparked PBS in the first place are
afloat in limbo.

   WASHINGTON _ Last week the Clinton administration completed a
remarkable turnaround in its thinking about the independent-counsel
law.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a House judiciary subcommittee, Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder said the law should be abandoned when
it expires this summer because it is so badly flawed that it cannot
be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The statute, originally passed in 1978, a few years after the
Watergate scandal, lapsed in 1993. Republicans were reluctant to
extend the law in the shadow of the Iran-Contra investigation, but
were ultimately persuaded by President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno to renew the legislation. Five weeks after Clinton
signed the law, Kenneth Starr became the first of seven independent
counsels to be appointed under the act.

the criminal justice system, to have confidence in the system, and
you cannot do that when there is conflict or an appearance of
conflict in the person who is, in effect, the chief prosecutor.'' _
Janet Reno, May 14, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opponents called it a tool of partisan attack against
Republican presidents and a waste of taxpayer funds. It was
neither. In fact, the independent-counsel statute has been in the
past and is today a force for government integrity and public
confidence.''

</P>

people. The act was supposed to increase trust in our government;
unfortunately it has diminished it.''

<P>

the trust between the government and our citizens. It ensures that
no matter what party controls the Congress or the executive branch,
an independent, nonpartisan process will be in place to guarantee
the integrity of public officials and ensure that no one is above
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton
</P>
<P>
   NOW: No one should be above the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law vests immense prosecutorial power in an inferior
officer who is not subject to the ordinary controls of any branch
of government.''

</P>
<P>

IT'S (AT)786. DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR COMPUTER IS?

<P>
   When computer consultant Gustavo Carreno received an e-mail
message at his Lisbon office last week asking for an appointment to
talk about universal time, an old concept recently repackaged by
the Swatch Group, the world's largest watch maker, he sent the
following response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well the thing is, I'm not that good on converting time but I
think there is a -5 hour of difference between Portugal/Lisbon and
New York, meaning that you'll have to add 5 hours to your local
time to get my time. So the best thing to do is to say that I'll be
available at my work fone from (AT)416 'till (AT)791.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that at (AT)786, or about one hour after the sun was
overhead in New York City, or 0552 Greenwich Mean Time, Carreno,
29, explained his enthusiasm for what Swatch is calling ``Internet
time.'' This way, when he meets with friends and colleagues online,
they ``have an understanding,'' he said. ``It's (AT)786 all around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swatch scheme, which divides the day into 1,000 ``swatch
beats'' equivalent to 1 minute and 26.4 seconds, is unabashedly
commercial. The system's meridian is located, conveniently enough,
over the Swatch building in Biel, Switzerland, where midnight
strikes (AT)000 beats. Swatch will begin selling a $70 watch that
tells Internet time, among other things, in the United States this
month. The product is already for sale in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has also made software that displays Internet
time on a computer screen available free from Swatch's site on the
World Wide Web. About 45,000 people downloaded it in January.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is not surprising that the notion of a world without
time zones strikes a chord even among some of the more
gimmick-weary Internet users. With its capacity to collapse
distance, the computer network has already managed to alter the
physics of space. And whether or not Internet time a la Swatch
catches on, the Internet seems to be responsible for an increasing
impatience with time as it has been kept thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something screwed up about our sense of time,'' said
Danny Hillis, a computer scientist who is spearheading an effort to
build a clock that will strike once every 10,000 years. (He wants
to encourage a longer view of the future.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our classical notion of time that we've inherited from the
industrial age doesn't fit with the way we live now,'' he said.
``Time zones made a lot of sense when we stayed in one zone. Now I
find I'm living on CNN time rather than my local time. I can call
you back at the end of the hour, but I have no idea which hour it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, cities set the time by the sun until the
late 1800s, when time zones were invented by the railroads to
coordinate schedules and avoid collisions. In the 1960s, after the
vibrations in a cesium atom were found to be a more reliable
measure that the rotation of the Earth, universal time became based
on a a calculation done in Paris of the average of atomic clocks.
(Most people still look to Greenwich, England, for the universal
time, established in an 1874 treaty.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet may already have warped the way its frequent
users experience time. In the technology industry, ``Internet
time'' has come to mean something like dog years, denoting the
ever-accelerating speeds of microprocessors, data transmission and
startup companies going public. The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's business school, for instance, recently buried an
Internet time capsule _ to be opened in five years.
</P>
<P>
   So now there are concerns that Internet time means abandoning
biological rhythms in favor of 24-hour computer clocks synchronized
to the nanosecond. But it has also increased the demand for the
correct time. The guardians of the Network Time Protocol, which
allows computers on the Internet to adjust their clock within
milliseconds of Greenwich time, say requests for the correct time
have doubled in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   For Nicolas Hayek, the founder and chief executive of the Swatch
Group, that is all the more reason why people will want to buy
Swatch's first Internet time watches. ``The Internet has made human
beings more globally conscious of being on a small planet where we
are all really equal,'' Hayek said. ``Internet time is the perfect
measuring stick for this era.''
</P>
<P>
   Judah Levine, a physicist at the time and frequency division of
the National Institute for Standards and Technology in Boulder,
Colo., is not so sure. After all, he notes, they're still sleeping
in China when New Yorkers are having breakfast, even if it's
(AT)430 in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the same problems with the Earth going around the
sun as we always did,'' Levine said. ``The Internet can't change
that.''

are all really equal,'' Hayek said. ``Internet time is the perfect
measuring stick for this era.''

   Judah Levine, a physicist at the time and frequency division of
the National Institute for Standards and Technology in Boulder,
Colo., is not so sure. After all, he notes, they're still sleeping
in China when New Yorkers are having breakfast, even if it's
(AT)430 in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the same problems with the Earth going around the
sun as we always did,'' Levine said. ``The Internet can't change
that.''

   The definition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is subject to
interpretation by the Senate. But a charge card's expiration date
is etched in plastic.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, President Clinton ducked into Dolly's Books in Park
City, Utah, where he was spending a long weekend with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea. He picked out
two thrillers and two volumes about India and laid down his
American Express gold card to pay the $62.66. But the card had
expired the day before and was rejected by the American Express
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sosnik, the president's ubiquitous senior adviser, slipped
the boss $50 and Clinton sheepishly paid cash for the books.
</P>
<P>
   An American Express spokeswoman, Gail Wasserman, said the
company sends out new cards three to four weeks before a card
expires. The cardholder is required to acknowledge receipt of the
new card by calling a toll-free number. Clinton apparently never
saw the new card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people like you and me _ as opposed to dignitaries _ open
our own mail,'' Ms. Wasserman said. ``Some others get a lot more
mail and have people who do that for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A presidential spokesman said Clinton's new gold card was
waiting for him when he returned to the White House on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosnik is still waiting for his 50 bucks. ``He usually pays
back quickly,'' Sosnik said, ``but he hasn't yet.''

   WASHINGTON _ Twenty years after the meltdown at Three Mile
Island, the nuclear industry has succeeded in ways that were hard
to imagine in March 1979 as Pennsylvania cowered in fear and plants
around the nation subsequently lost their luster and scores of
half-built reactors were abandoned. The industry is doing better
now, but ironically extinction is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Today, reactors are quietly producing about one-quarter more
electricity each, and the level of radiation exposure to workers is
down, as is the number of automatic shut-downs. Uranium fuel is
cheap and plentiful, and, with low interest rates, so is nuclear
power's biggest ingredient, capital. The industry has also happily
achieved a lowered public profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``And everything seems to be falling apart,'' Michael Corradini,
a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Wisconsin,
said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear industry will be around for years to come, but seems
to have peaked in terms of the number of working reactors and their
share of power generated nationally. No reactors are being built;
the last ordered were Palo Verde 1, 2 and 3 in Arizona in October
1973, the month the Arab oil embargo began.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there has been an energy revolution, but it wasn't
nuclear. A barrel of oil, which has roughly enough energy to run a
small house for a month, sold for $12 in 1973; by 1979 it was $40.
Today it is back down around $12. These gyrations upward lured
utility companies into nuclear decisions that now look ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Millstone 3 reactor in Waterford, Conn., was far
over budget during construction in the late 1970s. Even after the
incident at Three Mile Island, consultants said it was still
worthwhile to finish Millstone if oil averaged $96 a barrel over
the reactor's lifetime. The Energy Information Administration, part
of the Energy Department, predicted that the price would be $100 by
the turn of the century. But oil is now about a 10th of that.
</P>
<P>
   Reactors are a bit like the Concordes, the supersonic transport
planes that first flew a few days before the Three Mile Island
accident, or the Apollo moon rockets, which made the last of their
flights to the moon a few years before. They are technological
artifacts of an era slipping into history.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning the best practices from one utility to another, policing
each other, getting more output from the reactors, the industry
essentially adopted the Greenpeace motto: a nuclear accident
anywhere is a nuclear accident everywhere. It vowed to have no more
meltdowns. Not counting the 1986 catastrophe at Chernobyl, where
the nuclear reactors are of a different design, the industry has so
far succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that the industry's performance is
greatly improved. James Riccio, a nuclear expert at Critical Mass,
a Washington-based nonprofit organization affiliated with Ralph
Nader, said that the plants operated more now because the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission had shortened the list of equipment that had
to be in perfect working order for them to run, and the number of
automatic shut-downs has declined because the number of manual
shut-downs is up. ``They've gotten more intelligent about what
they're doing,'' he said, ``but then again, they've had to.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other changes in the last 20 years. If two
decades ago nuclear power seemed forbidding and secret, today
anyone can log on to Nuclear Regulatory Commission Web site, which
offers detailed specifications for each reactor
(http://www.nrc.gov/AEOD/pib/pib.html). For Three Mile Island unit
1, the undamaged twin of the reactor that had the meltdown, the
data includes the identification numbers stamped on the water
pumps. Another table for Three Mile Island shows the temperatures
and pressures at which the emergency systems will automatically
start, with different numbers depending on how many coolant pumps
are running.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere technology is accelerating, too. Natural gas has
become cheaper to find and recover, and the system for turning it
into electricity has improved steadily. The newest plants produce
twice as many kilowatt-hours from a thousand cubic feet as the ones
that nuclear power was competing with in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The real reactor killer, according to Corradini and others, is
something that was not thought of in 1979 _ deregulation in the the
utility industry. Nationwide, power companies are fissioning into
companies that will distribute electricity and sell it to consumers
(like local phone companies) and other companies that will generate
power and compete to sell it (like long distance carriers).
</P>
<P>
   The companies that built the 104 reactors still operating
ordered them in the 1960s and early 1970s. Asked then which source
of power would be the cheapest in the next few decades, they had
guessed nuclear, knowing that if they were off by a few tenths of a
cent per kilowatt-hour, the consumer would pay or reap the
difference. Now, if they are asked the question at all, they say
natural gas. Today they are building nothing and buying power from
independent producers, none of whom seems inclined to place a
multi-billion-dollar bet on a reactor where the output might be
uncompetitive in 2010, or 2020 or 2030, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investment risk changed,'' said James Joosten, a nuclear
engineer and consultant and former official of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of industrialized
nations. ``In the old days, people used to talk about nuclear power
in religious terms, and say, `It's good and we need to do it and if
the public doesn't buy into it, we'll make them buy into it.'
Realistically, today it's a business decision.''
</P>
<P>
   By Joosten's estimate, if electricity is completely deregulated,
the market price will be about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour at the
wholesale level, a price that about 28 nuclear plants cannot
achieve. And if some states offer a one-time payment to their
utilities because they have to close such plants in the transition
to deregulation, then some reactor owners with marginal plants will
jump at that offer while they can get it.

TOP 100 STORIES SHOULD HAVE GONE BEYOND THE FRONT PAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That newly compiled list of the century's top 100 stories got so
much media coverage that I designated its release the 101st top
story. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not that I was trying to avoid this story, but because it was
yet another pseudo-event I eventually got as weary of it as I did
the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. By the way, that scandal, with its
attendant impeachment trial, did not even rank in the top half of
the 100 stories, settling in at No. 53, one ahead of the Marshall
Plan and one behind the 1901 transmission of a radio signal across
the Atlantic Ocean. Go figure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all proves what Joe Urschel, executive director of the
Newseum media museum, said: ``News judgment is not an exact
science.'' (The Newseum, in Arlington, Va., sponsored the survey of
journalists and scholars that came up with the 100 list.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoo-boy, is Urschel right. Heck, news judgment isn't a science
at all. From more than 30 years in the newspaper business, I can
testify that news judgment is an occult art of impenetrable mystery
that it's best not to scrutinize. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 100-story list was interesting, even if none of the
six events from 1945 included on it was my birth. Well, perhaps not
enough time has yet elapsed to allow my life to compete with events
connected to World War II. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 100-story list stands as proof that this has not been a slow
news century. Indeed from Max Planck proposing the quantum theory
of energy in 1900 (No. 78 on the list) to the official end of
apartheid in South Africa in 1993 (No. 49), the 20th century has
been a journalist's dream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the list, however, is that it tends to focus on
the front page of the newspaper. I've got nothing against Page One.
But the stories that shed the most light on the human condition
often get buried inside with what young journalism students used to
call (and maybe still do) the truss ads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I can't tell you the last time I saw an actual truss ad in a
newspaper, but it's been a long time. One reason may be that I
almost never read any ads. I know that will come as a huge
disappointment to folks in the advertising department at my
newspaper, but maybe not. The chances are probably pretty good that
they don't read my (or anyone's) column, so we're even. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of which is beside the point. The point, if any, is that I
think a much more interesting list of stories could be fashioned
out of the inside pages of of the 20th century's newspapers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a big story now is about the Y2K computer bug. But
did you know that use of the word bug to describe a computer glitch
goes back to the famous year 1945? Rear Admiral Grace Murray
Hopper, a Navy computer pioneer, says her team members coined the
phrase when they found a two-inch moth stuck in a switching contact
in Mark II, the first large-scale American computer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admiral Hopper's bug didn't deserve to make the top 100 list.
But it's on my list of revealingly odd stories. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few 1968 stories made the top 100 list, such as the
assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy and
the Chicago police riot at the Democratic National Convention in
Chicago. Fine, but did you know that it was with the 1968 release
of ``The Graduate'' that we all began to sing, ``Here's to you,
Mrs. Robinson''? And speaking of engaging women of a certain age,
do you recall that Jackie Kennedy married Aristotle Onassis in
1968? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm not arguing that these and similar stories are more
important than wars and rumors of wars, which much make up nearly
the whole of the 100 list, but they do provide some things to fight
wars about. And without things to fight about the list of 100 top
stories would be shortened to maybe five. &QL;
</P>

THE CIA AND GUATEMALA: THE SPIES WHO NEVER CAME IN FROM THE COLD
WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a Guatemalan truth commission implicated the United States
in February in the creation of a killing machine that ravaged
entire Mayan villages in the 1980s, it raised questions that are
not likely to go away soon _ certainly not by the time President
Clinton visits Guatemala this week:
</P>
<P>
   How could a country that calls itself a beacon of democracy link
its military and intelligence agencies so intimately to Guatemala's
darkest, most reactionary forces? What was the nature of that
relationship over three decades? What were U.S. officials thinking
as 200,000 people were killed?
</P>
<P>
   Some answers, or at least clues, can be found in scores of
declassified documents the Clinton administration released to the
National Security Archive, a research group that aided the truth
commission in its research.
</P>
<P>
   From these documents, a narrative emerges _ the story of an
approach launched in the 1950s, when confident World War II
veterans set out to stop communism with a new kind of warfare that
would eventually be called counterinsurgency.
</P>
<P>
   It is well known that the CIA engineered a coup in Guatemala in
1954, and that Americans lavished training and equipment on a
series of rightist governments.
</P>
<P>
   What is less familiar is that, even as U.S. policies evolved in
other parts of the world, especially after the failures in Vietnam,
the policies in Guatemala did not. Washington's counterinsurgency
arsenal melded with the traditional brutality and racism of the
Guatemalan army to make a horrifying brew, and the effects
outlasted the global threat of communism itself.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts in 1954, when Gen. James Doolittle wrote a
report for a fellow World War II hero, President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, on how to use the CIA in the Cold War: ``There are no
rules in such a game. Hitherto acceptable norms of human conduct do
not apply.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, CIA officers were sifting through the documents of
an elected leftist government it had just overthrown in Guatemala,
assembling a list of suspected communists. The new rightist regime,
handpicked by the agency, used the list to eliminate by death any
potential opposition. That kind of coordination went on for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Newly declassified U.S. documents, for example, place a CIA
officer in the room where Guatemalan intelligence officers _ men
responsible for death squad killings _ planned their covert
operations in 1965. They show that CIA and other U.S. officials
played a key role in the latter 1960s in centralizing command
structures and communications of agencies that would be involved in
death squad killings for years. They contain CIA reports of secret
executions of Communist Party leaders by Guatemalan government
agencies in 1966 that Guatemalan officials publicly denied.
</P>
<P>
   They also show that the CIA station in Guatemala City knew that
the Guatemalan army was massacring entire Mayan villages while
Reagan administration officials publicly supported the military
regime's human-rights record. Even after the war was won, the
documents reveal, Defense Intelligence Agency officials knew that
the Guatemalan military was destroying evidence of torture centers
and clandestine graveyards in 1994. Not a word was uttered publicly
by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Through the decades, a lone voice of warning belonged to Viron
Vaky, a State Department official who had been the Number 2

March 1968, he wrote that the ``indiscriminate'' violence of the
counterinsurgency tactics ``present a serious problem for the U.S.
in terms of our image in Latin America and the credibility of what

<P>
   The Vietnam War had not been lost yet, but it was turning sour.
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights concerns led the Carter administration to cut off
military aid to Guatemala in the 1970s, and Congress shackled the
Reagan administration's efforts to resume it. But it was too late.
The CIA would retain strong influence in relations with the
Guatemalan government, to the frustration of U.S. ambassadors, well
into the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. training and planning could not be taken back. ``The
Reagan administration wanted to pretend the officers were good
people, but it was the Kennedy and Johnson administrations that
gave them muscle to create a murderous machine,'' said Piero
Gleijeses of Johns Hopkins University, an expert on Guatemala.
``That's when the Frankenstein was created.''
</P>
<P>
   The monster was a response to a real challenge: In the early
1950s, Guatemala's Communist Party had played a major role in the
government of Col. Jacobo Arbenz, who had expropriated the lands of
United Fruit Co., imported arms from Czechoslovakia and mourned the
death of Stalin. A decade after his overthrow, Cuban-backed
guerrillas threatened to take the eastern third of the country and
assassinated a U.S. ambassador. After every defeat, the left came
back, exerting control in the labor movement and universities and
gaining tens of thousands of Mayan supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Long after its humiliations in the U-2 and Bay of Pigs fiascos,
the CIA continued reaching into its bag of tricks to assure that
its 1954 success would not become unglued. That meant flying
intelligence flights over guerrilla positions in the 1960s and
giving advice and financial support to known human- rights
violators through at least the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the saddest chapters of American relations with
Latin America,'' said Frederick Hitz, the CIA inspector general
from 1990 to 1998. ``The United States felt responsible for what it
started by removing Arbenz, and essentially we were trapped. We
started something and didn't know how to get off the train.''
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush cut off Washington's tiny military aid
program following the unexplained 1990 murder of an American
innkeeper near an army base. Even then the CIA continued to give
monetary assistance to the military behind the back of the State
Department. Two senior CIA officers lost their jobs after
Congressional intelligence committees found that the CIA station in
Guatemala was keeping human rights violations secret from CIA
headquarters and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Following an investigation of the matter, Anthony Harrington,
who leads the Clinton administration's Intelligence Oversight
Board, expressed bewilderment. ``The board asked itself: the Cold
War's over _ what are we doing down there?''

THE CIA AND GUATEMALA: THE SPIES WHO NEVER CAME IN FROM THE COLD
WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   When a Guatemalan truth commission implicated the United States
in February in the creation of a killing machine that ravaged
entire Mayan villages in the 1980s, it raised questions that are
not likely to go away soon _ certainly not by the time President
Clinton visits Guatemala this week:
</P>
<P>
   How could a country that calls itself a beacon of democracy link
its military and intelligence agencies so intimately to Guatemala's
darkest, most reactionary forces? What was the nature of that
relationship over three decades? What were U.S. officials thinking
as 200,000 people were killed?
</P>
<P>
   Some answers, or at least clues, can be found in scores of
declassified documents the Clinton administration released to the
National Security Archive, a research group that aided the truth
commission in its research.
</P>
<P>
   From these documents, a narrative emerges _ the story of an
approach launched in the 1950s, when confident World War II
veterans set out to stop communism with a new kind of warfare that
would eventually be called counterinsurgency.
</P>
<P>
   It is well known that the CIA engineered a coup in Guatemala in
1954, and that Americans lavished training and equipment on a
series of rightist governments.
</P>
<P>
   What is less familiar is that, even as U.S. policies evolved in
other parts of the world, especially after the failures in Vietnam,
the policies in Guatemala did not. Washington's counterinsurgency
arsenal melded with the traditional brutality and racism of the
Guatemalan army to make a horrifying brew, and the effects
outlasted the global threat of communism itself.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts in 1954, when Gen. James Doolittle wrote a
report for a fellow World War II hero, President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, on how to use the CIA in the Cold War: ``There are no
rules in such a game. Hitherto acceptable norms of human conduct do
not apply.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, CIA officers were sifting through the documents of
an elected leftist government it had just overthrown in Guatemala,
assembling a list of suspected communists. The new rightist regime,
handpicked by the agency, used the list to eliminate by death any
potential opposition. That kind of coordination went on for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Newly declassified U.S. documents, for example, place a CIA
officer in the room where Guatemalan intelligence officers _ men
responsible for death squad killings _ planned their covert
operations in 1965. They show that CIA and other U.S. officials
played a key role in the latter 1960s in centralizing command
structures and communications of agencies that would be involved in
death squad killings for years. They contain CIA reports of secret
executions of Communist Party leaders by Guatemalan government
agencies in 1966 that Guatemalan officials publicly denied.
</P>
<P>
   They also show that the CIA station in Guatemala City knew that
the Guatemalan army was massacring entire Mayan villages while
Reagan administration officials publicly supported the military
regime's human-rights record. Even after the war was won, the
documents reveal, Defense Intelligence Agency officials knew that
the Guatemalan military was destroying evidence of torture centers
and clandestine graveyards in 1994. Not a word was uttered publicly
by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Through the decades, a lone voice of warning belonged to Viron
Vaky, a State Department official who had been the Number 2
official in the Embassy in Guatemala. In a long memo of dissent in
March 1968, he wrote that the ``indiscriminate'' violence of the
counterinsurgency tactics ``present a serious problem for the U.S.
in terms of our image in Latin America and the credibility of what
we say we stand for.'' Not shirking his own responsibility, he
added, ``I feel somewhat like Fulbright says he felt about the
Tonkin Gulf resolution _ my deepest regret is that I did not fight
harder within the Embassy councils when I was there to press my
views.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War had not been lost yet, but it was turning sour.
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights concerns led the Carter administration to cut off
military aid to Guatemala in the 1970s, and Congress shackled the
Reagan administration's efforts to resume it. But it was too late.

CLINTON'S FOREIGN POLICY LACKS COHERENCE, BUT SO DOES THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the space of a week, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has searched for a way to use the threat of U.S.
military power to end civil war in the world's smallest would-be
nation, Kosovo, and for a way to use U.S. economic power to change
the behavior of the world's largest and oldest nation, China.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign-policy conundrums, the two have little in common,
except that both are familiar and both have grown more resistant to
U.S. influence. Neither the last-ditch efforts to salvage a peace
proposal for Kosovo nor the ritualistic exchanges in Beijing last
week are likely to be recalled warmly in Albright's memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   But these radically different encounters have something odd in
common: They have come to mark the two extremes of the Clinton
administration's six-year struggle to bring coherence to U.S.
foreign policy in a time that often seems incoherent itself _ a
time of confusing ethnic and economic rivalries, of elbowing for
position in the pecking order of power.
</P>
<P>
   So as it begins the final quarter of its eight-year game,
President Clinton's team still trips over itself setting
foreign-policy priorities or fully explaining them to Americans, or
seeking leverage over foreign potentates, whether in a tiny corner
of the Balkans or the vastness of China.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that throughout the 1990s, both the
administration and its critics have flailed about for some grand
Unified Field Theory of Foreign Relations _ something as neat as
the concept of containment during the Cold War _ to define what it
should be doing, and in what order.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Michael Mandelbaum, a Johns Hopkins University
professor, issued a searing critique of the administration's
troubles separating the peripheral from the central; it resonates
more loudly today than ever. Kosovo, he says, is ``the ultimate
social work'' and has become ``something between a hobby and an
obsession'' for the administration. In contrast, he says, ``China
is truly important, the most strategically vital foreign-policy
problem we face.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, China policy _ like Japan and Russia policy _ is
endlessly bounced between the State Department and the Treasury,
and efforts at coordination are sporadic. Perhaps it is no surprise
that Albright's interchanges with Beijing last week about human
rights and China's integration into the world economy appeared to
have barely moved the conversation much beyond where it was in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the administration thought it had found something
approaching a Unified Theory _ that comprehensive economic
engagement and ``enlargement'' with great and small powers would
lead, sooner or later, to the spread of both free-market capitalism
and democracy. In Clinton's speeches, the two were usually tightly
linked, part of a web of global forces that was moving history
America's way. China was the great example, followed immediately by
Russia. But it didn't stop there:
</P>
<P>
   Economic engagement explained why peace talks in Northern
Ireland or the Middle East were always followed up by an economic
conference focused on creating jobs and ``enterprise zones'' in
hopes that prosperity would bring contentment, then hope, then
lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   But these are tough times for unified theories of all kinds.
``It's fair to say,'' one of Clinton's longest-serving aides mused
recently, ``that over time we have learned and relearned the lesson
that other countries shape their own destiny to a far greater
extent than we believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains why Clinton offered no grand theories in a
speech 10 days ago that was billed as an outline of his agenda for
the remaining two years of his presidency. The president delivered
what amounted to a list of agenda items: supporting peace (with the
use of as few U.S. troops as possible), supporting financial
stability (with the use of as little U.S. money as possible),
containing weapons of mass destruction and the countries and
terrorists who are trying to get hold of them.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing was any attempt to describe which items on the
list went to the heart of U.S. interests, or how they interrelated.
Even Clinton's critics expressed some understanding. ``Trying to
get the bumper sticker term for our foreign policy is a waste of
time,'' said Robert Zoellick, a former Bush administration official
who now heads the Center for Strategic and International Studies
here. ``But you can have a foreign policy with priority values,''
he said, ``rather than one that is case by case, reactive and
designed to immunize political threats at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there are plenty of grand theories kicking
around Washington. That, after all, is what out-of-power
foreign-policy wonks do. Samuel Huntington, the Harvard political
scientist, writes constantly about how ethnic tensions are the
nexis of the post-Cold War world. Others argue that the key to
modern U.S. hegemony is leadership, and thus the United States must
get involved in the Bosnias of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of contagious economic failure has given rise to
prescriptions for expanding the powers of international
institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, so that they can dictate domestic economic policy to
countries on the brink.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the old Cold Warriors, some of whom met over
lunch last week and raised the possibility of re-creating the
Committee on the Present Danger, a Reagan-era anti-communist group.
They spent the rest of lunch debating what constitutes the Present
Danger. A weakened Iraq? A starving North Korea? China in the midst
of its economic high-wire act?
</P>
<P>
   Their confusion arises from the difficulty in defining national
interest these days. And that is the real meaning of the Bosnia to
Beijing bookends.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration came to power far from convinced that
Bosnia was a central interest of the United States, then decided
that the Balkans (along with Somalia and Haiti) must be, as the
horror of it all unfolded on television. But the reality is that
while Americans are perfectly happy to see the secretary of state
jetting around the world to strike peace agreements, their
willingness to put lives at risk for such causes is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, though, both the public and Congress have come to
recognize a second type of national interest: averting economic
implosions that could affect U.S. prosperity. Congress screamed
when the administration bailed out Mexico, a move that most now
believe avoided a long, ugly recession on America's border. By the
time the Asian crisis hit, the objections began to dissipate, and
there was barely a peep when the Treasury helped organize the
rescues of South Korea and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration's luck ran out when it came to Russia.
Ever since the $17 billion IMF package failed last summer, both the
Russian economy and Moscow's relationship with Washington have been
in a downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes China, the most complex case. No one doubts that
Chinese are enjoying greater economic freedom. Or that China is
cracking down on political organizers, reverting to elements of a
state-run economy and adding to the missiles facing Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   So Washington has reverted to a mixed message, encouraging moves
to get China into the World Trade Organization _ part of that web
of economic engagement _ while talking about building a regional
missile defense that drives the Chinese up the wall. The Chinese
say they recognize America's real strategy and it is both old and
familiar: containment. They may be wrong, but at least it's a
coherent theory.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Eight tourists, including an
American couple, are slashed to death deep in the Ugandan jungle,
apparently by Hutu militiamen targeting Britons and Americans. They
had been there last week in the hope of trekking up a slope full of
biting insects and stinging nettles to spend a brief hour in the
company of mountain gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department and the British Foreign Office had
issued warnings about fighting in western and northern Uganda, but
the park they were visiting, the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park,
was considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   This raises two important questions. Why weren't the tourists
warned that they were in a potentially dangerous region? And, on
the other hand, were they crazy to be there in the first place,
paying a fortune and risking malaria just to get close to a family
of gentle giants led by a 400-pound silverback who is perfectly
capable of ripping a man limb from limb?
</P>
<P>
   Now forget Uganda. In fact, forget all of Africa, the continent
comprising 15 of the 28 countries on the State Department's
``Travel Warning'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Think about Austria, the land of edelweiss. Austria is
instructive because most of the 38 people smothered by two
avalanches there last month were tourists _ skiers. Austria is also
instructive because late last year, the State Department briefly
cautioned travelers to be wary of going there, detecting vague
``threats to American interests.'' Nothing happened. Ultimately,
better weather reports might have saved more lives than deep
political intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, look at Egypt. The risks there are no secret.
Muslim fundamentalists trying to choke off the government's tourism
revenue killed dozens of tourists between 1992 and mid-1997. But
after a government crackdown, Egypt was considered a fairly safe
destination on Nov. 16, 1997; it was on nobody's ``don't go'' list.
The next day, 58 tourists were cut down at the Temple of Luxor, and
tourism dropped 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The point is simple, and particularly relevant at a time of
rising and increasingly exotic global travel: Predicting danger for
tourists is a crap shoot, tour operators and foreign service
officials alike say.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one ignores the fact that plane crashes and natural
disasters like mudslides and avalanches can happen pretty much
anywhere, political violence is remarkably unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known that Islamic fundamentalists would set off
a bomb last year in Kenya? Or, in a country like South Africa with
a minuscule Muslim population, that a few anti-American Muslim
fanatics would blow up a Planet Hollywood restaurant, killing not a
single American (clearly, Americans were the desired target) but
instead a South African banker, while maiming a British family?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have foreseen this,'' Sue Ockwell, a spokeswoman
for Acacia Expeditions in London, said of the attack last week in
Uganda, which killed four of her tour group's clients. ``The
Foreign Office didn't, and our local contacts had no sense of
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that  &UR; someone &LR;  could have intuited the
danger. Not too long ago, Hutu militias attacked a Ugandan village
and killed nearly everyone in it. Gorilla trekking in Rwanda and
the former Zaire died out because of guerrilla warfare. Moreover,
diplomats and journalists working in east Africa were aware that
some Hutu militants resent Americans and Britons.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the fundamentalists in Egypt, the Hutu militias had
never announced any hostile intent toward tourists. Wednesday, a
British newspaper reported that the Ugandan government had received
a threat in writing. Uganda denies it. ``There was no warning,''
said Arthur Kafeero, press officer at Uganda's London embassy. ``If
there had been, preventive action would have been taken.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, keeping travelers apprised of dangers is very much
on the minds of Western governments. Most of the 28 countries on
the State Department's ``don't go'' list, however, are fairly
obvious threats. They are either at war, or have public,
government-endorsed bouts of anti-American feeling. Among the
former are Bosnia, Angola, Rwanda, Burundi, the two Congos, Sierra
Leone and Guinea-Bissau. Among the latter are Iran, Iraq, the
Sudan, Afghanistan and Serbia. (The list's glaring exception is
Montserrat, which is in danger of being buried in volcanic ash.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet no country is on the list simply because it has a high crime
rate _ although consular information sheets on every country in the
world include warnings about crime. ``Just because a country isn't
on the travel warning list, it's important not to be lulled into
thinking it's completely safe,'' the State Department spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that crime is spotty, so it wouldn't be useful or
fair to stigmatize an entire country over its crime rate. For
example, crime has closed all the luxury hotels in downtown
Johannesburg, but tourists happily stay in newer hotels in safer
northern Johannesburg and then return to the airport for flights to
crime-free game parks and beaches.
</P>
<P>
   American tourism, of course, is not immune to the crime problem.
In 1993, after nine foreign tourists were killed in south Florida,
Germany put Florida on its ``don't go'' list. Yet no one can
credibly argue that all of America is unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ockwell of the British tour outfit said that in an effort to
get more timely safety updates, representatives of the British
travel industry recently met with officials from the Foreign
Office. Not surprisingly, that meeting was prompted by old news:
the killing of three British tourists kidnapped by Yemeni
tribesmen, and a government warning to Britons to shun Chile
because of resentment over Britain's detention of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator.
</P>
<P>
   The industry wanted better international coordination, and it
wanted site-specific warnings: Tour promoters thought remote parks
in Chile were safe for British tourists even if the capital,
Santiago, was dicey.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Eight tourists, including an
American couple, are slashed to death deep in the Ugandan jungle,
apparently by Hutu militiamen targeting Britons and Americans. They
had been there last week in the hope of trekking up a slope full of
biting insects and stinging nettles to spend a brief hour in the
company of mountain gorillas.

   In any case, if any group of globetrotters should have been able

HOW CANADIANS STOPPED WORRYING AND LAUGHED AT A JOURNALISTIC BOMB

   TORONTO _ It's not easy being in the news business in Canada.
You stare at juicy American stories nearly every day while your own
pages fill with curling scores and wheat quotas. Oh, for a big,
page one blockbuster!
</P>
<P>
   In February, one of the two Canadian national newspapers now
locked in vicious competition thought it had a real scoop when it
breathlessly reported: ``U.S. believes North Korea would target
Montreal for a nuclear strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredible! The front-page article quoted Canadian legislators
just back from a NATO conference at the United States Army War
College. If tensions between North Korea and the United States
escalate, the Canadians said, Washington expected the wily
communists to pick a fight with America's wimpy non-nuclear
neighbor, knowing that dropping a nuke on say, Hoboken, would earn
them a nuclear drubbing.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few problems with the story. For one, the Army
College has no such scenario involving North Korea. ``Where it came
from, I don't know,'' said Lt. Col. Pete Pierce of the college
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the American press that hates to let go of a
good yarn. Even when the Canada bomb article bombed, newspapers
kept it going with the only weapon left in their arsenal _ humor.
Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ANTHONY DePALMA
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The original report appeared Feb. 12 in The
National Post, the new flagship of the Southam newspaper chain. The
article had more prominence on the front page than news of the
expected acquittal of President Clinton that day:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Army officials say they expect Canada would be the first
target of a North Korean nuclear attack if tensions were to
escalate between the communist power and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to a war scenario being developed at the U.S. Army War
College, Montreal would be the Canadian city likely to be hit by
North Korea, which is suspected of having nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Three Canadian MPs were briefed about the war scenario during a
meeting of elected representatives from the 16 NATO countries in
Carlisle, Pa., last week, the National Post has learned.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army officials told the MPs they doubt North Korea would
attack the U.S. directly because it would result in massive nuclear
retaliation that would wipe the Asian nation off the map.
</P>
<P>
   American officials therefore think it more likely for North
Korea to hit U.S. interests indirectly by attacking a close ally
and a friend _ Canada _ that does not have nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The next day, the news hadn't exactly
stoked panic in Montreal. Au contraire, The Post reported:
Residents saw an opportunity to rid themselves of a debt-plagued
relic of the 1976 Olympics:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Montrealers, perhaps inured to doomsday scenarios by three
decades of dire warnings over the consequences of Quebec
separation, took news of their status as a potential nuclear target
in stride yesterday. Some callers to CJAD, a private English radio
station, pointed out the bomb would end the never-ending debate
over what to do with the Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   `That actually came up a couple of times,' said Lisa Durron, the
program's producer. `Over all, people thought it was a joke.' ...
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thought it was funny. ``One woman chastised me for
doing a show that might scare the children,'' said Tommy
Schnurmacher, CJAD morning host.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The Globe and Mail, The Post's national
competitor, stayed away from the story. But The Montreal Gazette
went after it, albeit skeptically: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that North Korea is likely to target Montreal in a
nuclear attack, as reported on the front page of the National Post
yesterday, was debunked yesterday by experts across the country.
</P>
<P>
   `It's absolutely bizarre, ' said Jim Bayer, director of the
Conflict Analysis and Management Program at Royal Roads College in
Victoria, B.C., `for any number of reasons, including picking on
poor old Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   `It seems to be one of these Dr. Strangelove scenarios that the
American military develop from time to time.'
</P>
<P>
   `Obviously the North Koreans can't reach Montreal,'' added David
Rudd, executive director of the Canadian Institute for Strategic
Studies. ``Their missiles can't even reach Hawaii.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The Gazette said one of the visiting
lawmakers, David Price, was sticking with the story that he said he
got from the Americans: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``As Price recalls it, Montreal was singled out because an
attack on this city would affect the St. Lawrence Seaway and could
provoke a massive movement of people across the border.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But the Gazette also quoted a War College
spokeswoman, Carol Kerr, on how the misunderstanding might have
developed: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no discussion of North Korean scenarios. Nor do we
have a North Korean scenario. Perhaps the very futuristic
environment inspired some offline discussions while (the
legislators) were on tour.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Adding its two cents, The Toronto Star
surmised in an editorial Feb. 16 that the report was part of a
nefarious U.S. drive to drum up support for a ``Star Wars'' missile
defense: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon argues, against all logic, that the U.S. needs
more protection against Korea's feeble missile or two than it had
against 20,000 Soviet warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The scare campaign went cross-border last week. U.S. officials
were reported to have theorized that the Koreans have Montreal in
their sights. That gave La Belle Province a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   This is nonsense, and Prime Minister Jean Chretien shouldn't
shrink from saying so. ...''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Taking the opposite view, The National Post
got personal in an editorial the same day: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians ought to be reluctant about wishing Kim Jong-Il, the
`Dear Leader' of North Korea, a very happy 57th birthday. The
National Post revealed last week that North Korea is planning to
launch a nuclear missile attack on Montreal if tensions escalate
between the United States and the reclusive Stalinist state. With
this in mind, Lloyd Axworthy, the Foreign Affairs Minister, might
want to start thinking about joining the Americans' ballistic
missile defense system _ just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But with the story fast losing its legs,
along with its credibility, Mark Steyn, a columnist for The Post,
played it for laughs on Feb. 18, getting in some digs at Quebec
separatism: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``I gaze nervously up at the sky and wistfully regret my calls
in these columns for an imaginative solution to the Quebec issue.
...
</P>
<P>
   With Montreal reduced to a heap of ash, the pro-separatist
majority in the rest of the province can claim its rightful place
among the community of nations: for the Pequistes (separatists),
it's `Bienvenue au Quebec'; for the rest of us it's, `Bienvenue au
Kaboom!' I know I've occasionally expressed interest in partition,
but I'd assumed they had something in mind more precise than just a
massive crater between the Ontario border and the
St-Jean-sur-Richelieu. ...
</P>
<P>
   You have to admit that wimpy old Canada being the first NATO
country to get nuked to oblivion would be one of fate's droller

   TORONTO _ It's not easy being in the news business in Canada.
You stare at juicy American stories nearly every day while your own
pages fill with curling scores and wheat quotas. Oh, for a big,
page one blockbuster!
</P>
<P>
   In February, one of the two Canadian national newspapers now
locked in vicious competition thought it had a real scoop when it
breathlessly reported: ``U.S. believes North Korea would target
Montreal for a nuclear strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredible! The front-page article quoted Canadian legislators
just back from a NATO conference at the United States Army War
College. If tensions between North Korea and the United States
escalate, the Canadians said, Washington expected the wily
communists to pick a fight with America's wimpy non-nuclear
neighbor, knowing that dropping a nuke on say, Hoboken, would earn
them a nuclear drubbing.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few problems with the story. For one, the Army
College has no such scenario involving North Korea. ``Where it came
from, I don't know,'' said Lt. Col. Pete Pierce of the college
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the American press that hates to let go of a
good yarn. Even when the Canada bomb article bombed, newspapers
kept it going with the only weapon left in their arsenal _ humor.
Excerpts follow.

<P>
   _ By ANTHONY DePALMA
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The original report appeared Feb. 12 in The
National Post, the new flagship of the Southam newspaper chain. The
article had more prominence on the front page than news of the
expected acquittal of President Clinton that day:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Army officials say they expect Canada would be the first
target of a North Korean nuclear attack if tensions were to
escalate between the communist power and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to a war scenario being developed at the U.S. Army War
College, Montreal would be the Canadian city likely to be hit by
North Korea, which is suspected of having nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Three Canadian MPs were briefed about the war scenario during a
meeting of elected representatives from the 16 NATO countries in
Carlisle, Pa., last week, the National Post has learned.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army officials told the MPs they doubt North Korea would
attack the U.S. directly because it would result in massive nuclear
retaliation that would wipe the Asian nation off the map.
</P>
<P>
   American officials therefore think it more likely for North
Korea to hit U.S. interests indirectly by attacking a close ally
and a friend _ Canada _ that does not have nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The next day, the news hadn't exactly
stoked panic in Montreal. Au contraire, The Post reported:
Residents saw an opportunity to rid themselves of a debt-plagued
relic of the 1976 Olympics:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Montrealers, perhaps inured to doomsday scenarios by three
decades of dire warnings over the consequences of Quebec
separation, took news of their status as a potential nuclear target
in stride yesterday. Some callers to CJAD, a private English radio
station, pointed out the bomb would end the never-ending debate
over what to do with the Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   `That actually came up a couple of times,' said Lisa Durron, the
program's producer. `Over all, people thought it was a joke.' ...
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thought it was funny. ``One woman chastised me for
doing a show that might scare the children,'' said Tommy
Schnurmacher, CJAD morning host.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The Globe and Mail, The Post's national
competitor, stayed away from the story. But The Montreal Gazette
went after it, albeit skeptically: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that North Korea is likely to target Montreal in a
nuclear attack, as reported on the front page of the National Post
yesterday, was debunked yesterday by experts across the country.
</P>
<P>
   `It's absolutely bizarre, ' said Jim Bayer, director of the
Conflict Analysis and Management Program at Royal Roads College in
Victoria, B.C., `for any number of reasons, including picking on
poor old Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   `It seems to be one of these Dr. Strangelove scenarios that the
American military develop from time to time.'
</P>
<P>
   `Obviously the North Koreans can't reach Montreal,'' added David
Rudd, executive director of the Canadian Institute for Strategic
Studies. ``Their missiles can't even reach Hawaii.'''

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The Gazette said one of the visiting
lawmakers, David Price, was sticking with the story that he said he
got from the Americans: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``As Price recalls it, Montreal was singled out because an
attack on this city would affect the St. Lawrence Seaway and could
provoke a massive movement of people across the border.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But the Gazette also quoted a War College
spokeswoman, Carol Kerr, on how the misunderstanding might have
developed: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no discussion of North Korean scenarios. Nor do we
have a North Korean scenario. Perhaps the very futuristic
environment inspired some offline discussions while (the
legislators) were on tour.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Adding its two cents, The Toronto Star
surmised in an editorial Feb. 16 that the report was part of a
nefarious U.S. drive to drum up support for a ``Star Wars'' missile
defense: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon argues, against all logic, that the U.S. needs
more protection against Korea's feeble missile or two than it had
against 20,000 Soviet warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The scare campaign went cross-border last week. U.S. officials
were reported to have theorized that the Koreans have Montreal in
their sights. That gave La Belle Province a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   This is nonsense, and Prime Minister Jean Chretien shouldn't
shrink from saying so. ...''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Taking the opposite view, The National Post
got personal in an editorial the same day: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians ought to be reluctant about wishing Kim Jong-Il, the
`Dear Leader' of North Korea, a very happy 57th birthday. The
National Post revealed last week that North Korea is planning to
launch a nuclear missile attack on Montreal if tensions escalate
between the United States and the reclusive Stalinist state. With
this in mind, Lloyd Axworthy, the Foreign Affairs Minister, might
want to start thinking about joining the Americans' ballistic
missile defense system _ just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But with the story fast losing its legs,
along with its credibility, Mark Steyn, a columnist for The Post,
played it for laughs on Feb. 18, getting in some digs at Quebec
separatism: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``I gaze nervously up at the sky and wistfully regret my calls
in these columns for an imaginative solution to the Quebec issue.
...
</P>
<P>
   With Montreal reduced to a heap of ash, the pro-separatist
majority in the rest of the province can claim its rightful place
among the community of nations: for the Pequistes (separatists),
it's `Bienvenue au Quebec'; for the rest of us it's, `Bienvenue au
Kaboom!' I know I've occasionally expressed interest in partition,
but I'd assumed they had something in mind more precise than just a
massive crater between the Ontario border and the
St-Jean-sur-Richelieu. ...
</P>
<P>
   You have to admit that wimpy old Canada being the first NATO
country to get nuked to oblivion would be one of fate's droller
jests: I'd be splitting my sides laughing if I weren't loading up
the Honda Civic and heading for the Laurentian Autoroute.''

   Hello. Must You Leave So Soon? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, the armed religious movement that runs Afghanistan,
has a problem, and his name is Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile and
suspected terrorist with a $5 million bounty on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghans, citing culture and custom, have said publicly that
they cannot expel a guest like bin Laden from their country, as the
United States has demanded. On the other hand, a senior Taliban
official said last week ``his presence is not a benefit to the
people of Afghanistan.'' The Taliban will never get international
recognition or foreign aid as long as they harbor him.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears that ``there is friction between him and the
Taliban,'' senior U.S. officials say _ so much friction that bin
Laden is being held under Taliban control, moving from village to
village, deprived of his satellite telephone, while the Taliban's
leaders try to figure out how do deal with him without being seen
to cooperate with the United States.

   A New Leader Is Elected in Nigeria
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria chose a former military ruler, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo,
to lead its first civilian government in 16 years, hoping to put an
end to one of the darkest periods in Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Obasanjo, still the only soldier in his country
to have stepped down voluntarily from power, was blemished by
serious fraud and the refusal by his rival, Olu Falae, to concede
defeat. But most international observers said the cheating had not
been significant enough to alter the outcome, given the margin.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of leader the general will be remains unclear. He is
respected internationally for his diplomacy, but remembered at home
for his strong hand during his tenure from 1976 to 1979. And while
he is often seen in the West as someone who has defended democracy,
he also has close ties with corrupt, retired generals who clung to
power under previous military regimes.

   A Deal to Save Privately Owned Redwoods
</P>
<P>
   In a $480 million deal officials called as historically
significant as the creation of Yosemite National Park, the federal
and California governments have bought 10,000 acres of ancient
redwoods from Pacific Lumber Co., including the largest privately
owned stand of ancient redwoods in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the decade-long saga leading to the Headwaters forest deal,
which was completed minutes before a March 1 midnight deadline, is
not over.
</P>
<P>
   While plans to provide public access to the primordial rain
forest are already underway, environmentalists say they will
continue to protest on Pacific Lumber property and file lawsuits
against the company and the government.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a 50-year habitat conservation plan that will govern
Pacific Lumber's logging operations. Opponents say the plan is
riddled with loopholes that undermine its purpose of protecting the
endangered spotted owl, coho salmon and marbled murrelet, a sea
bird that nests on the tops of old redwoods.

   High-Tech Purchase Brings Arrest of 2 Chinese

<P>
   To hear the Chinese tell it, two men arrested in the United
States in recent weeks were seeking high-tech gyroscopes for a
railroad project.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the U.S. Customs Service, and the men were violating export
control laws that bar the export of the gyros, which can be used to
hone missile guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects, Collin Xu and Yao Yi, are accused of
attempting to buy strategic goods from a a Boston-area military
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest, officials say, they were referred to a dummy
company established by Customs. Now investigators are trying to
find out where in China the gyroscopes were headed.

   A State Police Chief Resigns After Comments About Race
</P>
<P>
   Police departments in a wide variety of communities nationwide
have been accused of routinely using racial stereotypes as a tool
with which to target people for suspicion of involvement in crime.
</P>
<P>
   With that controversy as a backdrop, and accusations that the
New Jersey State Police in particular had unfairly singled out
black drivers to be stopped on state highways, Gov. Christie
Whitman swiftly dismissed the head of the State Police after he was
quoted as saying it was naive to think race was not an issue in
drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's issue of The Star-Ledger of Newark quoted Col. Carl
Williams as saying, in a wide-ranging interview: ``Two weeks ago,
the president of the United States went to Mexico to talk to the
president of Mexico about drugs. He didn't go to Ireland. He didn't
go to England. Today, with this drug problem, the drug problem is
cocaine or marijuana. It is most likely a minority group that's
involved with that.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the day was out, Whitman had a reply of her own: ``I
have valued Williams' service, and his career record is an
honorable one. However, his comments today are inconsistent with
our efforts to enhance public confidence in the State Police. I
have therefore asked for his immediate resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Marine Pilot Exonerated In Italian Alps Collision
</P>
<P>
   A jury of eight Marine officers took just over seven hours to
conclude that when an Marine jet in the Italian alps hit the cables
of a gondola system 13 months ago, killing all 20 aboard the
skiers' transport, it was an accident, not a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's lawyer, Frank Spinner, said that the purpose of the
court martial was to discover truth, and that ``we believe their
finding displays an act of courage and true integrity.'' But
relatives of German victims, who would have been called to the
stand to testify on the impact of the deaths if there had been a
conviction, were bitter, as were people in Italy when they received
the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot understand how it will ever get into my mind that a
system like this calls itself just,'' said Emmi Aurich, through a
translator, after the trial. Her son and daughter-in-law were among
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Of the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, she said, ``I hope and I pray
that he will get punished for what he did one day but not as
vengeance, just as reconciliation for our dead people.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Ashby could have brought a prison term of
more than 200 years if he had been convicted. He could still get up
to a year for obstruction of justice, as could his navigator, if
prosecutors have better luck with the next jury and show that the
reason the two took a videotape out of the jet's cockpit after the
accident is that they had something to hide.

   A Convict's Memoir With No Remorse
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kaczynski, the convicted Unabomber, has written an
unrepentant memoir that tries to settle scores and correct what he
says is a distorted public image. The manuscript, sent to a New
York publisher from the the maximum-security prison in Colorado
where Kaczynski is serving a life sentence, does not admit that
Kaczynski was the elusive bomber. But the book, to be published
this spring, speaks of the Unabomber in admiring terms.
</P>
<P>
   In passing, Kaczynski tries to justify the campaign that killed
3 people and injured at least 22 others. Some people like his
brother David, he notes, claim that violence and the taking of
human life is not the way to resolve problems. ``As a matter of
fact,'' Kaczynski writes, ``history shows that it very often does
work.'' David Kaczynski alerted federal authorities to the
possibility that his brother was the Unabomber.

   A New Plan to Sell Waste Uranium
</P>
<P>
   For as long as the United States has been running nuclear
reactors and building nuclear bombs, it has been accumulating
depleted uranium, which is natural uranium with the most useful
kind, uranium-235, mostly taken out. All of it is in a chemical
compound that gives off toxic gas when exposed to water, and it is
stored in more than 50,000 steel canisters in various stages of
rusting away.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the Energy Department is asking the private sector
what it can do with the material, which comes to 1.5 billion
pounds. Uranium is about 30 percent more dense than lead, which
could make it useful for counterweights, or shielding radiation,
even though the uranium itself is slightly radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects to sell the uranium, or the fluorine it is mixed
with, at a price that would pay for emptying the canisters and
converting the contents into marketable forms. But sales might
defray part of the cost. With 1.5 billion pounds in hand, even

   The First Lady Keeps New York Guessing
</P>
<P>
   Will she or won't she? Hillary Rodham Clinton didn't say, but
she tantalized New York Democrats in her first visit to the city
since announcing that she was giving ``careful thought'' to running
next year for the Senate seat to be vacated by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot drop out of the political process and leave the
arena to those with very specific agendas,'' the first lady told
900 cheering Democratic women who seemed to be attending a campaign
rally rather than a lunch at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Most left hoping that Mrs. Clinton was referring to herself, and
that she would take her own advice.

   A Convict's Memoir With No Remorse
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kaczynski, the convicted Unabomber, has written an
unrepentant memoir that tries to settle scores and correct what he
says is a distorted public image. The manuscript, sent to a New
York publisher from the the maximum-security prison in Colorado
where Kaczynski is serving a life sentence, does not admit that
Kaczynski was the elusive bomber. But the book, to be published
this spring, speaks of the Unabomber in admiring terms.
</P>
<P>
   In passing, Kaczynski tries to justify the campaign that killed
3 people and injured at least 22 others. Some people like his
brother David, he notes, claim that violence and the taking of
human life is not the way to resolve problems. ``As a matter of
fact,'' Kaczynski writes, ``history shows that it very often does
work.'' David Kaczynski alerted federal authorities to the
possibility that his brother was the Unabomber.

   A New Plan to Sell Waste Uranium
</P>
<P>
   For as long as the United States has been running nuclear
reactors and building nuclear bombs, it has been accumulating
depleted uranium, which is natural uranium with the most useful
kind, uranium-235, mostly taken out. All of it is in a chemical
compound that gives off toxic gas when exposed to water, and it is
stored in more than 50,000 steel canisters in various stages of
rusting away.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the Energy Department is asking the private sector
what it can do with the material, which comes to 1.5 billion
pounds. Uranium is about 30 percent more dense than lead, which
could make it useful for counterweights, or shielding radiation,
even though the uranium itself is slightly radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects to sell the uranium, or the fluorine it is mixed
with, at a price that would pay for emptying the canisters and
converting the contents into marketable forms. But sales might
defray part of the cost. With 1.5 billion pounds in hand, even
pennies per pound would help.

 UNDATED: industrial complex.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock price of the Corrections Corporation of America, the
nation's largest private jailer, has increased tenfold since 1994.
The company's stock is now privately held. But Corrections Corp.
has created a popular real-estate investment fund to get a return
on all those new prisons being built at the rate of one a week.
</P>
<P>
   Unions representing prison guards are the fastest-growing public
employee associations in many states. In California last year, the
union was given a raise of 12 percent, which brought the salary for
a seasoned prison guard up to $51,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rare rural community that rejects a new prison in its
backyard, with the prospect of permanent, high-paying, benefit-rich
government jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The prisons in California, as in virtually every other state,
are near capacity, even though the state has built 21 new
institutions in the last 15 years. Soon, it will cost nearly $4
billion a year to run the state's prison system. Should the
Legislature propose some change in the law that might bring down
the growth in prisons, they are likely to hear howls of outrage
from the union that has most benefited from the growth in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have a society committed to building new prisons and
keeping them, it's very difficult to close them down,'' said Mauer.
``Particularly in rural areas that come to depend on them. It's
like trying to close a military base.''
</P>
<P>
   The states also have an incentive to keep people in jail a long
time. A federal law passed in 1994 provides matching funds to
states to keep violent criminals in prison longer by denying
parole. This act and other so-called truth-in-sentencing laws are
reasons why the ranks of prisoners will not soon drop, even as
crime levels off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got crime going in one direction, and social policy
going in the other,'' said Dr. Allen Beck, the Justice Department's
lead statistician on criminal justice trends.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that may finally slow prison growth, said Beck,
are budget concerns. It costs taxpayers $20,000 a year to house and
feed every new inmate _ and that does not include the cost of
building new prisons and jails. The states are spending nearly $30
billion to keep people in jail _ about double the rate of 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are starting to balk. California legislative leaders
say they will build no new prisons in coming years, but they have
not said what they will do with excess prisoners. In Washington
state, a bill that would abolish mandatory minimum prison terms for
drug offenders has gained support from judges, prosecutors and
tough-on-crime Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was a pioneer state in enacting laws requiring long
lockups, with no chance of early release or leeway for judges to
consider other options. But prisons now are the state's
fastest-growing part of the budget _ even as crime has nearly
bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be difficult to change the pattern, with new prisons
rising in depressed rural areas. Cleaning up after a crusade, some
lawmakers said, has proven much harder than they anticipated.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Later this month, the U.S. government will release new figures
showing how many Americans are behind bars, and the numbers will
reveal that the bull market for prisons is still charging ahead.
Nearly 1 of every 150 people in the United States is in prison or
jail, the Justice Department will announce, a figure that no other
democracy comes close to matching.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the total number of people locked up in federal and state
prisons and local jails will likely reach the 2 million mark,
almost double the number a decade ago, as the ranks of prisoners
grow enough each year _ to fill Yankee Stadium and then some. For
an American born this year, the chance of living some part of life
in a correction facility is 1 in 20; for black Americans, it is 1
in 4.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts failed to predict that the inmate population would
triple from 1980, and now nobody seems to know how to stop the
buildup. By all logic, prisons should be experiencing a few
vacancies, and the cost of arresting, prosecuting and putting away
an army of criminals should be at ebb. After all, the economy could
hardly be better, and crime has fallen steeply six years in a row.
But a prison peace dividend is nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the guessing game now is: At what point does the
world's largest penal system hit a plateau _ 2.5 million inmates, 3
million? Surely, if crime continues to fall, the number of new
prisoners must also fall.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. No matter how much crime plummets, the United States
will still have to add the equivalent of a new 1,000-bed jail or
prison every week _ for perhaps another decade, federal officials
say. Some even believe the prison boom could be permanent, at least
for another generation.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason is that so many of the new inmates are drug
offenders. In the federal system, nearly 60 percent of all people
behind bars are doing time for drug violations; in state prisons
and local jails, the figure is 22 percent. These numbers are triple
the rate of 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Americans do not use more drugs, on average, than people in
other nations; but the United States, virtually alone among Western
democracies, has chosen a path of incarceration for drug offenders.
More than 400,000 people are behind bars for drug crimes _ and
nearly a third of them are locked up for simply possessing an
illicit drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's internal gulag,'' is what Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the
nation's drug czar, calls the expanding mass of drug inmates. Many
of those have committed any number of crimes. But a growing number
of them have broken no laws other than the ones on drug use.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Congress and the states passed drug laws that
required judges to put people in prison _ even first-time
offenders, or those caught with small amounts of an illicit
substance. Mandatory minimum sentences, as they are called, leave
no room for a judge to consider special circumstances, or options
such as treatment instead of jail.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that more arrests would lead to more convictions,
which would put more people in jail, and the crime rate would fall.
That did happen.
</P>
<P>
   Another dividend was supposed to be a drop in drug use, but that
has not happened. Arrests of people who use drugs just hit an
all-time high, the FBI reported. At the same time, drug use has
gone up among the young, and for drugs like heroin or
methamphetamines. Over all, drug use has not budged for 10 years.
For virtually all other crimes, of course, the figures are stunning
_ with huge drops in murder, robbery and assault. Whether this is
because the United States will soon have 2 million people locked up
is subject to much debate.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the authorities who argue that the prison boom has
taken the worst criminals out of circulation _ and has thus been
the biggest factor in reducing crime _ are at a loss to explain the
drug-use figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in favor of the federal government ceasing and desisting
the war on drugs,'' said Dr. Morgan Reynolds, director of the
Criminal Justice Center at the Dallas branch of the National Center
for Policy Analysis, a free-market think tank.
</P>
<P>
   He described himself as being on the conservative side of the
debate over prisons and crime; he says the crime drop can be
directly attributed to the prison boom.
</P>
<P>
   But he is less sure that the federal government's war on drugs
has an effect on crime rates and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   For liberals and libertarians who have long claimed
incarceration has failed to do anything but run up the bill in the
drug war, conservative cover is welcome. Last week, Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., introduced a bill to restore discretion for judges
in sentencing low-level, nonviolent drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be getting to the point of diminishing returns _ the
more you expand the prison system, the more small fry you put in
there,'' said Marc Mauer, assistant director of the Sentencing
Project, a nonprofit group that has been critical of the prison
buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the architects of punitive drug policies now argue
that stuffing the prisons with ever more drug offenders is not a
wise investment. Edwin Meese, who was attorney general under
President Ronald Reagan, when most of the drug laws were rewritten,
has started to look favorably on treatment for low-level offenders
rather than jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders ought
to be reviewed,'' said Meese in an interview. ``We have to see who
has been incarcerated and what has come from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the laws that send drug offenders to prison with
reflexive certainty, there are now institutional incentives to keep
locking up more people _ a trend that some people call the prison
industrial complex.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Special prosecutor law finds few friends in high
places
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has a hammer raised to drive another nail
into the coffin of the special prosecutor law. The air was leaden
with skepticism when the justices recently reviewed the conviction
of Sun-Diamond Growers of California for giving illegal gratuities
to then-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an outgrowth of independent counsel Donald Smaltz's
madman pursuit of Espy. Smaltz filed a panorama of criminal charges
and tried to put the secretary in prison for what could have
amounted to a couple of lifetimes _ all because of a scatteration
of usually small indulgences.
</P>
<P>
   Espy had no business taking favors from agricultural companies
and associations. (He forgot he was no longer in Congress.) But the
favors were mostly trivial _ a ride in a company limo, Super Bowl
tickets, invitations to parties. There was never any evidence Espy
traded policies for the trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   A judge threw out eight counts and a jury quickly found against
the remaining 30. Smaltz, however, had earlier browbeat some
agribusinesses into guilty pleas and had convicted Sun-Diamond by
insisting any little gift to a public official is criminal even if
no bribery occurs or even is intended.
</P>
<P>
   It is that expansive reading of a vague statute that, judging
from their questions, most Supreme Court justices find dubious at
best. Sandra Day O'Connor suggested Smaltz's interpretation would
make it a crime to bake cookies for a senator or knit socks for a
public official.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, of course, has created the most telling case for
scrapping the independent counsel law, with investigations that
have spread like a virus through the political and private lives of
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Starr's excesses
against reluctant witness Susan McDougal have managed to make a
questionable character into a national martyr and are, in their
prosecutorial disproportion, almost alone reason enough for
chucking the statute. (As his roughhousing of Monica Lewinsky is,
too.)
</P>
<P>
   But Smaltz's outrages and the similarly overwrought prosecution
of former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros by
David Barrett are equally damning. Barrett is pressing 18 criminal
accounts against Cisneros for underreporting _ lying about, if you
insist _ how much he had paid a onetime mistress, as if the
difference mattered.
</P>
<P>
   There have been seven independent counsels sicced on the Clinton
administration, often on little more than speculation, and there
would have been more if Attorney General Janet Reno hadn't balked
at a few of the endless Republican demands to have still more
hounds unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning the Sun-Diamond conviction, Justice Stephen
Breyer wondered if, in matters such as questionable gifts, ethics
regulations aren't preferable to ``bringing the blunderbuss of
federal law into the prosecutor's arsenal, where they can prosecute
trivialities.''
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't make sense to you, it's probably because you
haven't heard a sane voice for so long.

 &HT;    (For release March 10, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ I have not seen anything as graphically gripping as the
infamous photograph published worldwide in 1981 of 33 Haitian
refugees' bodies washed up on a South Florida beach.
</P>
<P>
   What made it so gripping was that you could see them.
</P>
<P>
   But the greater part of the continuing Haitian refugee tragedy
are those you cannot see _ like the 40 or so who are presumed dead
after their boat capsized Satruday off the Florida coast. They
didn't wash up on a beach to shock the tourists; they simply
slipped beneath the waves and we really never knew they existed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling how many hundreds have drowned attempting to
escape the hellish depressiveness of Haiti, a country that has
little to no economy and has had no working government for almost
two years and likely has no prospect of one until November, if
then.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian President Rene Preval has been unable to form a
government since June 1997. The parliament in Port-au-Prince simply
cannot agree on a new prime minister and another round of elections
may be called _ with or without success.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming quite apparent that Haiti is not capable of
governing itself, at least democratically. So many attempts have
failed. The U.S., at center stage when it came to making a show of
landing troops in Haiti in 1994 to dispense with a military coup
leader, has been unsuccessful in founding an economy or
establishing political stability in the Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
   Like the uncontrollable child, the adopting parent shares the
blame for this dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, we didn't have enough of a mix when we just sent
soldiers to flex our muscles at dictator Raoul Cedras. We forced
him to flee the nation he took over, also by strength, from elected
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who, once returned to power,
proved to be a bust.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should have flown the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in right
behind those troops, because if Haiti needed any fixing after it
was rid of Cedras, it was in its economic base. There was talk, and
promise, of something like that when Aristide returned to office,
but no results really show.
</P>
<P>
   The one constant of the country, while its politics slide from
here to there, is poverty. Few natural resources remain, there are
no jobs, there is no economy, people cannot eat _ but they can
build crude boats and sail off to wash dead on a Florida beach or
drift lifelessly through the deepest waters of the Gulf Stream.
</P>
<P>
   The awkward and deadly Haitian boat departures began back when
the agony of Haiti could be blamed on the brutal Duvaliers. But
they haven't been around since 1986. Most of the refugees come
today just as they came earlier, not so much to escape a brutal
regime, but in search of a way to put clothes on their backs, food
on their tables.
</P>
<P>
   As we all know, the solution lies back in Port-au-Prince.
Internecine political squabbles, far more serious than the erotic
silliness that has captured Washington, D.C., prevent a government
from being formed.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. tries to dictate government in Kosovo, Baghdad
and elsewhere, one doesn't exist in Haiti and we don't seem to be
taking a serious interest in it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those are Haitians, not Kosovars, washing up on our
shores and drowning in our waters. It is under the immediate U.S.
sphere of influence and needs to be addressed at least as
diligently as we do the others.
</P>
<P>
   If it means some more arm-wrestling by the U.S., another
intrusion into Haitian affairs, then so be it _ because,
eventually, Haitian affairs become U.S. affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Those were U.S. Coast Guard boats out there looking for the 40
bodies.

 &HT;    Increasingly, our homes have become our castles
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coach-class airplane seats are more cramped than ever.
Freeways are packed, and restaurants are squeezing in more tables.
Offices have been downsized into cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   But at least there's one place where the elbow room is growing:
home sweet home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shrinking size of families and the aging of the
population, homes are getting more spacious. Now home builders are
watching consumers closely, trying to figure out whether the demand
for floor space will keep growing as rapidly as it did in the final
decades of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   At this century's midpoint, the average household size was 3.5
people. The typical home built in America's new suburbs in the
1950s was a one-story box with about 1,300 square feet. The average
veteran returning from World War II was delighted to get his family
into a home, even if it had just one bathroom and three tiny
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1960s and early 1970s, as affluence rose, so did
square footage. By the mid-1970s, the average new home had about
1,700 square feet and enough garage space for two cars.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, an economist might have predicted that home sizes
would start to shrink. After all, baby boomers were moving into
adulthood and striking out on their own, so their parents no longer
needed multiple bedrooms. And when they started their own families,
boomers had relatively few children. So why would they want homes
bigger than their parents had?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they could afford it,'' said Gopal Ahluwalia, director
of research for the National Association of Home Builders. Even
though the average household size has decreased to 2.6 people and
the bulk of the population is moving into middle or old age, square
footage is still rising because of two-income families,
better-paying jobs and lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, one new house in five had four or more
bedrooms. Today, a third have at least four bedrooms. The average
house being built this year will sprawl to 2,200 square feet and
have three bathrooms, Ahluwalia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are cocooning more these days,'' he said, referring to
the tendency to spend more time at home. The trend is to build
houses with media rooms, exercise areas and huge kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Home builders also report that many middle-aged
``empty-nesters'' are rejecting the notion of downsizing. Instead
of preparing for retirement, many people in their 50s and early 60s
are planning for a ``second adulthood,'' complete with a humongous
dream house.
</P>
<P>
   Builders are promoting these suburban castles as ``entertainment
houses'' that can help empty-nesters attract children and
grandchildren for visits, using bait that includes swimming pools
and basements full of pingpong tables, video games and exercise
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But can this trend toward bigness continue into the next
century? Will we be living in houses the size of strip shopping
centers by 2050?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Ahluwalia said. ``I think the average size
will stop at about 2,300 (square feet) in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   That prediction is based on demographics and common sense. Once
boomers start to move into their 70s and 80s, they finally will
start to downsize. Also, at some point, most people begin to feel
uncomfortable rattling around in a house that feels like a barn.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bigger, more will do. Ahluwalia predicts the next
trend will be to buy two 2,300-square-foot houses, rather than one
4,600-square-foot mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are buying second homes ... either at the beach or
in a ski area,'' he said. Why? ``Because they can afford it, and
they want to say, 'We have it.'''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Being 'littlest duckling' not all it's quacked up to
be
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I call it the ``duckling syndrome.'' There's the
mother duck at the front of the line and all the little ducklings
waddling behind her, the youngest one at the end.
</P>
<P>
   I'm the littlest duckling in my family, the baby. I have spent
my life following after older siblings and trying not to ruffle any
feathers.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has been written about birth order and how it affects
children. I've read much of it and don't remember most of it. I do
know the oldest child often is the high-achieving, angst-ridden,
overly responsible one. The middle child's existence typically is a
lifelong scream for attention. And the youngest many times is
spoiled, laid back, easygoing and the happiest of the bunch. You
see, by the time the last child comes along, the parents have
foregone all their high-falutin' parenting skills, relaxed, and
just allowed that baby to develop as he or she was meant to.
</P>
<P>
   Those stereotypes may hold some truth, but there are certain
burdens the youngest child must bear.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment we are born, someone is telling us what to do,
how to do it, and when to do it. Much of it doesn't come from the
parents, either. It's the siblings. Whether it's brothers or
sisters, they're there. And they resent you for popping into their
world uninvited. They resent their parents making them sit on the
couch and hold you while they take pictures for the baby book.
</P>
<P>
   They resent all the grown-ups making such a fuss over you just
because you can burp and wiggle. They resent that you are
permanently attached to their mother for the first six months of
your life.
</P>
<P>
   So, they get even . . . in little, deceptive, hidden ways. They
stand at your bassinet and watch you cry instead of going to get
mother. They pull the bottle out of your mouth on the way to the
back yard. They get inches away from your face on your second day
of life and tell you, ``I'm the boss of you and don't ever forget
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot for the youngest to overcome. We follow behind our
parents and siblings in the grocery store, at the zoo, in the park,
down the church aisle. There's always someone in front of us
leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine, the youngest of four sisters, is a grown woman
and has a daughter of her own. Yet she tells me of being on a trip
with a group of co-workers when they decided to go to a mall.
Everyone scattered and she found herself alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood there in that mall like I was 12 years old, waiting
for someone to come and tell me where to go. I will always be 12
years old in my mind!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Our parents treat us differently, too. We're their ``last
chance'' to get things right. We must be the perfect ones. Whatever
mistakes our older siblings made, we must not. Sometimes we're able
to pull this off, superficially. If nothing else, youngest children
learn early how to evaluate their environment.
</P>
<P>
   While older sister and brother are rebelling against mom and
dad, we sit in the background, observe and make mental notes. Where
our siblings confront, we cajole. We're not stupid, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also spend more time protecting the youngest. They keep
older siblings from bullying us when we're children, and they keep
distressing news from us when we're adults. To this day, my mother
will tell my older sister all the details of a medical problem, but
when I ask her, she'll say, ``I'm fine. Everything's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the opinions or advice of the youngest get taken
seriously. Often we're the background noise in family discussions.
We are forever given the pat-on-the-head, aren't-you-cute,
go-off-and-play treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The duckling syndrome. Sometimes the view from the end of the
line isn't all that pretty.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Cheap gas fuels call for monster cars
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I used to fear I was shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   What other explanation is there? I am driving a car that is
about the largest I've owned _ a four-door sedan that someone from
the passenger seat once dismissed as ``a relaxed-fit car'' _ yet I
feel small in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   On either side of me is a moving wall of fiberglass, miracle
plastic and steel. I look out my side window at these cars and
stare squarely into their hubcaps. When they pass me, it's like
going into a tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   But size is a relative thing. It turns out I am not getting
smaller. The traffic around me is getting bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: A milestone in car size was reached recently when Ford
unveiled the Excursion. So-named because walking around it to check
the tires feels like being on a hike.
</P>
<P>
   The Excursion is just short of 19 feet and weighs three and a
half tons.
</P>
<P>
   (Q: Where does a three-and-a-half-ton vehicle park? A: Anywhere
it wants.)
</P>
<P>
   It's 6.6 feet wide, which is just a little narrower than your
average Mr. Slurpee ice cream truck. Chimes that play ``Turkey in
the Straw'' endlessly are not part of the options package, although
I suppose you could add them if you really wanted.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 miles per gallon, the car is a rolling monument to the era
of 89-cents-a-gallon gasoline. Just as earlier cars with fins and
bumpers like chrome canoes were shrines to dime-a-gallon times.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect grandchildren who will be paying top dollar for fossil
fuels in bad neighborhoods around the world and great-grandchildren
who will wonder how the planet got so hot will wonder what we were
thinking. For right now, though, this is about the hottest thing on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   If they bellyache, we'll just tell them their soccer practices,
camping trips and garage bands made us do this. They should stop
whining and getting all moral because we needed serious bulkhead
room to shuttle them, their snotty-nosed friends and their equipage
all over town.
</P>
<P>
   By the time this level of explanation is necessary, we'll be old
and nobody will care about our excuses. We'll just complain until
they are sorry they asked.
</P>
<P>
   Kids.
</P>
<P>
   The Excursion seems too bland a name for such an imposing
behemoth. I suppose, though, calling it the Ford Godzilla would
invite all kinds of niggling copyright and marketing complications
from attorneys. Calling it the Land Barge would understate the
power of a V-10 engine. The Party Barge would seem irresponsible in
our selectively serious age.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Dreadnought would work for me. Surely, this is a car
that could accommodate gun turrets. Customizers take note.
</P>
<P>
   The Battlestar Suburbia, the Road Rhino, the Jurassic Ark ...
there are so many better possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, people who are paid a lot more than I came up with the
Excursion. The Excursion sounds like a walk in the park. This car
is more like a major deployment. There you go: the Deployment, the
Mobilizer, the Deterrent ... .
</P>
<P>
   Every age of great prosperity has its excesses. Some flush
societies use their windfall to build pyramids and cathedrals and
extravagant public buildings. Some build armies and work at taking
over their corner of the world. Some dress everyone up funny and
commission imposing objects of great beauty. Some have even built
decent schools for their children. It is the legacy of our time
that we used our wealth to build and buy the biggest, fattest cars
that have ever fallen into private hands.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I am no road-Puritan. When gas is cheap,
cars will be big. This is a law of nature and the Invisible Hand of
consumer economics. But I suspect our kids will find this a strange
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   They will look at the monster cars of the sport utility vehicle
showroom much as we once viewed the finned and chrome-spangled
Batmobile-looking artifacts that appear in old family photos.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I expect to continue feeling smaller on the
highway with each passing model year. If gas gets too much cheaper,
I'll have to scurry away to side-roads to stay out of the path of
the big creatures.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost enough to make you miss the old days when there was
something to the left of the decimal on gas-station signs.

 &HT;    No ifs, ands or `buts': Professor needs to cover it up
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ An associate professor at Ohio's Miami
University has taken exception to the school's ban on thong-style
swimwear and filed a civil rights suit charging that the recreation
center advisory committee who nixed his scanty attire is stifling
his First Amendment freedom of expression and his 14th Amendment
right to equal protection. My obvious question: What exactly is he
wanting to express, and from what (or whom) might he need
protection?
</P>
<P>
   This called for a legal opinion, but since lawyers charge more
for phone consultations than the psychic hotline, I did the next
best thing. I pulled out some of my old college textbooks and set
to work searching for the part about the rights of folks to let it
all hang out, but came up empty. I found freedom of religion,
speech, and the press, under the First Amendment, and the 14th even
mentioned ``gesturing and mimicking, belonging to organizations,
wearing buttons or raising signs, and handing out leaflets to
passersby.'' But nowhere did it address a citizen's right to prance
around a university pool decked out like September morn.
</P>
<P>
   As I read it, the associate professor and the committee are
having a difference of semantics. His definition of ``appropriate
swimwear'' is at odds with theirs and so far, they're winning.
Cover it up, they told him, or find yourself a new swimming hole.
Instead, he's decided to sue. Now, nobody's happy but the lawyers,
and a whole lot of money is going to be flushed down yet another
frivolous lawsuit toilet.
</P>
<P>
   This situation does not require litigation. All it needs is a
little common sense, a couple of bucks worth of film, and a Pentax
with a zoom lens. Result: One living color shot of the good
professor's nude backside posted on the rec center's bulletin
board, and even he would have to admit that the only bare bottoms
that don't ugly up the landscaping belong to 2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   We've all seen photos of people strutting around with their bums
hanging out and it ain't pretty. I even saw a real one once in a
yacht club restaurant in the Florida Keys. There I was, just
minding my own business, polishing off a bowl of conch chowder,
when I felt something brush my shoulder. I turned to see what it
was and there was one BIG nekkid (southern word for naked) butt
backed up right in my face while its owner chatted with the folks
at the next table. Talk about an appetite suppressant. Put me off
of conch chowder for the longest time.
</P>
<P>
   I still can't figure out what it is with folks who think that by
leaving half their clothes on the bathroom floor they're going to
provoke unbridled passion in all who take the time to cop a look in
their direction. Don't they
</P>
<P>
   know that imagination is far kinder than reality?
</P>
<P>
   Now, should comfort be the professor's priority (which I doubt
because who could be comfortable doing the butterfly stroke with a
string of dental floss stuck where it doesn't belong), then why not
join a nudist swim club? That makes a lot more sense. It always did
seem kind of a silly notion to get dressed just to get wet.
</P>
<P>
   Although I'm not suggesting everyone run out and shuck their
jeans and jump in the pond, I do believe that's a much more honest
and straightforward approach to comfort than taking off just enough
to incite a riot but stay out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the august professor; cover it up
fella'. Bare butts on big people are nothing but UGLY! If it's
dimples we want, we'll rent a Shirley Temple movie.

 &HT;    Portal craze was '98 news; now it's all about content
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Portals are like, you know, so over.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that New York-based Internet research firm Jupiter
Communications packed panel after panel with e-commerce and portal
players, like At Home, Excite, Lycos, Drugstore.com and
Ticketmaster Online, at its flagship conference last week in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Chairman and CEO Gene DeRose nevertheless told the
1,600-plus attendees that a ``content renaissance'' on the Web is
right around the corner. The trick, he said, is for the media
companies that post editorial content on the Web to rip a page from
Amazon.com, so to speak, and provide some e-commerce features to
transform mere readers into a fiercely loyal audience that will
drop by every day to read and spend money.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, portals were the key to Web profits. Portals such as
Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos were generating millions of page views
daily with what one analyst called ``sticky products'' designed to
keep users on their site for minutes, maybe even hours, at a time.
Portals offered search, e-mail, news, sports scores, weather
reports, stock quotes, live chats, free Web pages, local news and
shopping. Suddenly everyone wanted to be a portal, even sites that
had no business being portals in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is a new year, and like high-fashion dress
designers in Paris, it's time to toss last year's must-have trendy
frocks in favor of this year's trendy frocks that will be the
hippest and the coolest ever _ that is until next year rolls
around.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jupiter, this year's trend is compelling content
from media players such as newspapers, magazines, television
networks and cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so content is king again,'' sighed New York Times new
media guru Martin Nisenholtz, a veteran conference speaker who has
seen content go in and out of fashion more than once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not using the expression `Content is king,''' a Jupiter
analyst told him patiently. ``We're calling it a `content
renaissance,''' he said, hoping the new buzzword would catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' said Nisenholtz, ``can we say that content is
prince?''
</P>
<P>
   For those of you whose high school French is a bit rusty,
renaissance is French for ``rebirth.'' Jupiter's DeRose says media
companies that are expert storytellers have the potential to be big
Web winners in the end. People will eventually tire of reading
``just the facts m'am,'' news reports on the portal sites, and will
actively seek out more comprehensive and lively sources of news,
analysis and information.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, most content sites don't charge for their
content. (The Wall Street Journal Interactive is a notable
exception. Slate tried charging for content, but abandoned the plan
after only a year.) While good storytelling and other compelling
content can and will attract Web users, the trick, according to
Jupiter, is for content sites to start acting like commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if media companies borrow some of the chat,
search and community features stuck all over the portal sites and
apply them to their own ventures, they'll build readership and make
money.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to invent the wheel, and there's certainly no
need for every Web site to become a portal site. Strong content _
combined with a way of capturing data about readers and using that
data to offer e-mail news alerts, contests, chat and commerce _ is
the way of the future for media companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find out all you can about the people who visit your
service,'' said CBS SportsLine Chairman Mike Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Invite users to register so they can receive news flashes,
special offers or special commerce opportunities. Give them the
opportunity to post messages and chat with authors about breaking
news or special programming. Offer prizes to users who frequent an
area the most during a certain time period. Sell them mugs,
T-shirts, books related to special series or by writers who
contribute to the site. Jupiter also has research showing online
users aren't as bothered by a mixture of news and retailing online
as they are in offline media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call to media sites,'' said Jupiter analyst
Mark Mooradian. ``Some commerce sites are better at delivering
content than traditional media are. They have the demographics, and
they have the credit card info. Look at Amazon.com. Look at Land's
End. They have repeat users and millions of unique registered
users.''
</P>
<P>
   Mooradian's words weren't lost on Washingtonpost.com President
and Publisher Marc Teren, who said one of the Post's goals was to
build regular online users, as Jupiter suggests. ``We want to build
a relationship (with readers) and hold them over time and deliver
them to advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that content is not only prince, but the ultimate
``sticky product'' of the year.

 &HT;    Intel's Pentium III more evolutionary than revolutionary
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ PCs with the new Pentium III chip from Intel are on
shelves now. These new machines are the fastest yet, reasonably
priced and _ based on early reports _ relatively bug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy one.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? If the chip is a good one, and it is, and if the price
is right, and it is, why not rush to the store and take one home?
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to answer that question for yourself by the end
of this article.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know about the Pentium III is the internal
workings of the chip _ its architecture _ isn't all that different
from the Pentium II. In fact, if you have a Pentium II machine, the
new chip is so similar to the old one, odds are good you can simply
remove the old chip and plug in a new Pentium III with no problems
at all. But don't do that, either.
</P>
<P>
   Keep reading.
</P>
<P>
   The real changes in this newest Pentium from Intel are in what
is called its instruction set. The instruction set is really more
like a computer program than a part of the chip. It consists of
computer code that instructs the chip on how to compute. Without
the instructions, it would be an expensive and useless piece of
silicon about the size of a matchbook.
</P>
<P>
   The new instruction set will eventually allow Pentium III chips
to handle video much better (since computer games are loaded with
video, games will run much faster). The instructions _ called
Katmai New Instructions _ also let the chip do a better job with
speech recognition, a technology rapidly becoming practical and
useful.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the first reason why there's no need to rush to the
store today: Only software specially written to take advantage of
the new instruction set will get a speed boost. Your old programs
won't profit from this instruction set.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a few games take advantage of KNI (including
``Wargasm'' and ``Descent III''). As time goes on, that will
change. Video cards will be created that recognize the new
instructions, and Windows 2000 will have built-in support for KNI.
(Microsoft has said it will create a patch _ a tiny program
designed to improve an existing one _ that will let Windows 98 take
advantage of KNI.) Since Windows itself is a heavy user of graphics
and sound, the combination of the patch and the new chip should
make your PC run faster.
</P>
<P>
   MARK OF THE BEAST?
</P>
<P>
   When the Pentium III's specifications were first announced,
there was panic and protest among many computer enthusiasts.
Messages zipped through cyberspace as word got out that the new
chip has a built-in electronic serial number. Intel says the
purpose of the serial number _ which will identify the computer to
other computers on the Internet _ was to increase security. After
all, passwords and user names can be faked. But Intel said _ when
combined with the built-in serial number _ there would be less
chance of someone faking an electronic transaction or e-mail. But
for some computer folks, that serial number was the mark of the
beast. There was worry that the serial number would make it
impossible to have any privacy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's reaction was to create a small program that can be
downloaded from Intel's Web site (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.intel.com) that gives users control over the serial number.
Those who fear the number can invade their privacy can turn off the
serial number, and those who buy into Intel's argument that the
serial number actually protects privacy and security can leave it
turned on.
</P>
<P>
   BUY TODAY, LOSE OUT TOMORROW
</P>
<P>
   You've already learned most of the speed is yet to come, as
software programs take advantage of the new instruction set.
Depending on what figures you see and whom you believe, the new
machine should run about 5 percent to 8 percent faster (not enough
of a change for most people to notice) with programs that do not
take advantage of the new instruction set.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies will gear up to support the KNI instructions.
But at least as important is the fact Intel has said it expects to
offer Pentium III chips by the end of the year with speeds as fast
as 1 gigahertz (a little more than twice as fast as the
450-megahertz speed of the current PIII chips).
</P>
<P>
   So, if you buy a Pentium III today, you may find yourself with a
high-tech antique.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you decide the faster Pentium IIIs aren't important,
waiting makes sense. New chips and king-of-the-hill computers
command a premium price. Prices for slower Pentium IIIs will take a
nose dive as 1-gigahertz class machines are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   If you'll settle for a Pentium II, take note of Intel's
announcement last week that it will drop the price for that chip by
15 percent to 20 percent. That doesn't mean Pentium II PCs will
make the same percentage drop, since there's more to a computer
than a single chip, but it adds momentum to price drops already
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is true with automobiles, prices vary widely. But
some of the new Pentium IIIs sell for $2,000 or a bit more at the
bottom end of the price range. That's a good introductory price.
And, some people (especially those who have graphics-intensive
tasks to perform at work and who are lucky enough to use programs
that do or soon will take advantage of the new instruction set)
will pay it gladly.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us, the introduction of the Pentium III marks a
time when watching and waiting makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS ABOUT THE INTEL PENTIUM III
</P>
<P>
   _ A set of internal instructions will eventually make it a
better chip for games and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ A controversial built-in serial number makes transactions on
the Net more secure _ or invades your privacy (depending on whom
you believe).
</P>
<P>
   _ Initially, it will come in two speeds: 450 megahertz and 500
megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   _ Later versions (out by the end of the year) will be twice as
fast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Features in the chip should make new technologies such as
voice recognition work faster and better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since the basic design of the chip has not changed from the
Pentium II, it can be used as a direct replacement in most Pentium
II machines.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is backward-compatible: All the programs that are running
on your current PC should work just fine on a new Pentium III.

 &HT;    Get your pheromones, better sex life via e-mail
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``BOOST YOUR SEX APPEAL AND CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL AND SEX
LIFE FOREVER,'' said the message header.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless you've gotten e-mail like this, too. Maybe you read
it. Maybe you sent off for the stuff. Maybe you just ignored it, as
I did until just now.
</P>
<P>
   After all, an august computer columnist ought not to be nosing
around things like this. No telling where it might all end, but
given my luck it would end in the emergency room, the police
blotter or the gossip column.
</P>
<P>
   But I was feeling pretty down. My social life revolves around my
wife, my guinea pigs, and, blessedly but only occasionally, my
granddaughters. Sex appeal? In the eyes of a matronly walrus,
perhaps. Sex life? Well, that's private, and I wish it needed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   So, what the hey. Let's see what these sleazebags are peddling.
</P>
<P>
   What they are peddling are ``the natural human male/female
pheromone attractants and they are NOW available to YOU, legally.''
</P>
<P>
   I never knew pheromones were available to me at all, even
illegally. I never heard of the DEA raiding an underground
pheromone lab, or had anyone sidle up on a dark street corner and
whisper, ``Hey, big 'un, wanna dime bag 'a pheros? Finest kind _
Bolivian blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Pheromones, of course, are sexual attractants, but I assumed
they were limited to Mediterranean fruit flies. Florida, which is
bedeviled by these bugs, is always trying to use pheromones to lure
them to their deaths. I cannot see how my life would be improved by
my own personal cloud of fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
   But the aptly named purveyor of this stuff, Euphoria Products,
located, predictably, in Florida, claims humans have pheromones,
too, and all one needs for a wildly busy love life is an abundance
of them.
</P>
<P>
   According to my e-mail, this product, called HI-octane, contains
both male and female pheromones in a ``clear, odorless liquid,''
and the lovelorn are supposed to add it to their ``favorite perfume
or cologne.'' Despite this, the Euphoria folks say, ``This will not
attract same sex; but works as nature intended, attracting the
opposite sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like computer software. ``Hey, some clown back in
production dumped the male vat and the female vat together. We got
to figure out how to make this a feature and not a bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it might work just fine, but I wouldn't want to send
mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem. I don't have a favorite cologne. I
tried it when I was a kid. It stings when you put it on, it tends
to smell like old saddle leather steeped in cheap whiskey, and if
girls got close to me their eyes watered and they sneezed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the e-mail claims a little dab'll do ya, since the
stuff sells for $40 per 1/8-ounce bottle (buy two, get one free),
the likelihood of overdosing seems inevitable. A testimonial from
Dave J., who can scarcely be heard over the clamor of women, says,
``I'd like to know if your product is available in a larger
quantity so I can make sure I'm never without it!''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, you should beware of peddlers offering substitutes,
like maybe water buffalo pheromones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful,'' cry the folks at Euphoria. ``Animal pheromones
do NOT attract humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't e-mail wonderful?

 &HT;    With cable modem, the thrill returns
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those of you who know me, either from reading this
column or from having breakfast with me at the Waffle House,
understand _ despite the fact that I've messed around with gadgets
for my entire adult life _ I am not a bold man when it comes to
adopting new technology.
</P>
<P>
   I've never, for instance, stuck a deposit in an ATM, because I'm
sure it'll get lost somehow. I use a bald-headed man named Marvin,
not a computer, to figure my taxes. And my checkbook stays
unbalanced just fine without Quicken. My computer is slow and
clunky compared to what most people have and want. I'm happy with
old tech that is dependable and has proven its worth.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you ought to listen when something new catches my
eye. If I like it, you probably wil, too.
</P>
<P>
   Do yourself a favor. As soon as they're available in your
neighborhood _ and if you have the money to spare _ get a cable
modem and use it to connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I did a week ago. It made a big difference, but
maybe not in the ways you'd expect. In fact, what I expected and
what I got were two different things.
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you what I mean. I saw a cable modem as simply a way
to get Web pages to load faster and something that would let me
download new files quickly. Both those things turned out to be true
(I downloaded a new 15-megabyte copy of Netscape Navigator in the
time it took me to eat five cookies), and Web pages are fast now,
faster even than when I use the expensive T1 high-speed data line
at work.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, things that weren't practical before, like
downloading a new program just to see what it is like; looking at
video that appears as clear and stable as a TV signal (although
still in a tiny box on my screen); and listening to audio that is
of an almost high-fidelity quality, become possible.
</P>
<P>
   But something more important happened, too. I began treating the
Web the way I used to, way back in the beginning when it was new. I
was surfing again.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing used to be a big deal to a lot of us. We'd go to one Web
page, click on an interesting link, follow it, and then follow
another one. A person could literally go from beekeeping to Peru in
just a few minutes. A lot of what we found wasn't immediately
practical, but it was almost like getting a liberal arts education:
Some of the things I learned became important later on.
</P>
<P>
   It was very much like picking up a book out of boredom,
something you would have never read, and discovering something
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Then two things happened. The Web got useful _ something that I,
you too probably, use at work to find out boring stuff like the
gross national product of Mexico. So, instead of surfing, I'd head
right to the spot where the information was held. The second thing
that happened was that Web pages got big and complicated _ full of
video and sound _ and that meant they took forever to load at
analog modem speeds. So I hesitated before pressing a link just for
fun. Sometimes it took a couple of minutes for the page to build.
</P>
<P>
   Think of owning a cable modem as being data-rich. You have
enough bandwidth to squander some, to use it just for fun. And,
truthfully, with my old dial-up connection the Web wasn't much fun.
There were times when I could go to the kitchen to fix a sandwich
while I waited for a page to build.
</P>
<P>
   But now, thanks to my cable modem, I'm surfing again. And it's
just as much fun as it used to be. Get yourself a cable modem. The
surf is up.

 &HT;    Attention music fans: Guitar advice available for the plucking
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the most popular instruments for amateur
musicians is the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you played as a youngster, or maybe you'd like to learn.
But the notion of music lessons and the agony of being a beginner
may have discouraged you from trying to learn or relearn the
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the Web is a terrific resource for would-be
guitar players.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make some beautiful music together today, with the help of
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   To prove it really is ``worldwide,'' we'll start with a German
site called Guitar Online. Unless you feel like learning both
German and the guitar at the same time, go to http://guitaronline
</P>
<P>
   .notrix.de/ to get the English version of this page. You'll get
tips on playing the guitar, be able to download software that'll
help you learn the guitar and use it, and find links to other Web
sites devoted to the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called the Rob Balducci Web site, and it's a
terrific general purpose guitar enthusiast's site with some
commercial offerings thrown in. You'll find it at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .robbalducci.com/Overview.html. You'll be able to download music
or take online music lessons for free. Just click on the chord you
want to learn, and you'll get on-screen help.
</P>
<P>
   While you are there, make sure to drop by the links page at
http://www.robbalducci.com
</P>
<P>
   /links.html. That's where you'll find a lot of free and helpful
information (along with some links that offer lessons for money).
But there's enough free stuff here to keep you busy for a long
time. If you follow every link, you'll get information on playing
chords, picking, selecting a guitar, downloading chord charts, and
finding newsgroups and discussion areas where you can, uh, compare
notes with other guitar players.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called the Easy Guitar Download page and is at
http://www.music-company.co
</P>
<P>
   .at/easyguitar/download.html. Some of the content here is in
German (all I can figure is that the Germans love the guitar), but
there are English labels on most links and most of the content is
decidedly un-German. For instance, you'll find computerized help
for learning country-western and gospel songs here.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of downloading, there are plenty of places on the Web
where you can download useful programs and tools for the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, most guitar players use an electronic tuner that
allows them to tune each string perfectly, instead of relying on
the ear. These electronic gadgets listen to the sound of a strummed
string and then use a meter to indicate when the string is tuned
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll pay $20 or so for a cheap tuner at the store and a
lot more for a good one. You can save some money and use your
computer, a sound card and a microphone to do the same thing. Just
go to 
http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/Windowsguitartuner/download.sht
ml to download a program that will do all that for you.
</P>
<P>
   Finally let's stop by Jazz Guitar Online at
http://www.jazzguitar.com/.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a link there (or go directly to
http://www.jazzguitar.com/lessons.html) that offers a series of
free lessons you can download. This page also has commercial
products for sale, but just as is true with television or a
magazine, you can enjoy the free content without paying a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's play together.

 &HT;    Book profiles movers, shakers of Web
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're looking for a fun read about the recent rise
of the Internet, check out ``Architects of the Web.'' Written by
venture capitalist Robert Reid, the book chronicles the people and
companies that have powered the Internet's rising popularity in the
past five years. You'll find profiles of Marc Andreesen and Rob
Glaser, co-founder of Netscape and founder of RealNetworks and a
former Microsoft big shot, respectively. In a review, Fortune
magazine called the book ``well written and rich with detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some new games? You might want to check out the
latest issue of PC Gamer. The magazine this month features its
fifth annual PC Gamer Awards. The awards are divided into
categories, with a winner in each. The magazine did choose one
overall winner, and that was Sierra's ``Half-Life,'' a first-person
war game. Other winners included ``Rainbow Six,'' ``Grim
Fandango,'' ``StarCraft,'' ``Falcon 4.0'' and ``NBA Live 99.''
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   In its never-ending effort to turn famous old board games into
computer CDs, Hasbro Interactive has released several new titles.
They include ``Battleship,'' ``Scrabble'' and ``Grandmaster
Chess.'' Each is based on the board game of the same name and
retails for $15. These games are only available for Windows PCs.
</P>

 &HT;    A site for headache sufferers
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Headache sufferers now have their own home on the Web,
http://www.headaches.org.
</P>
<P>
   It costs $20 to join the organization that sponsors the site,
the National Headache Foundation, based in Chicago. The membership
fee includes a headache relief video. The site also offers lots of
free information. A comprehensive guide to headaches lists
different types of headaches, such as tension, migraine, cluster
and hormone. The site offers tips on how to choose a headache
doctor and what to expect on your first visit to that doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was started in 1970 as a nonprofit organization
focused on three goals: to offer information to headache sufferers,
their families and the physicians who treat them; to promote
headache research into potential causes and possible treatments;
and to teach the public that headaches are serious disorders and
that sufferers need understanding and continuity of care.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the organization includes a quarterly newsletter,
brochures about headache prevention, a list of physician members,
discounts on books, brochures and audio and video tapes, toll-free
access to the NHF office, breaking news developments, and
information about support groups near your home.

   NBA PLAYER LAUNCHES AMBITIOUS WEB SITE
</P>
<P>
   Sports teams have had their own Web sites since the Internet
became popular. Now individual players are taking the cue.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Spurs second-year power forward Tim Duncan has
launched http://www.slamduncan.com, known as The Official Tim
Duncan Website.
</P>
<P>
   The site lists a biography, stats and highlights. The bio
includes such must-have information as Duncan's shoe size (16),
what tattoos he wears, his favorite actor and what cars he drives
(a Yukon Denali and a Porsche).
</P>
<P>
   The Courtside page gives you the chance to e-mail Duncan, sign
his guest book, read about his charitable contributions and look at
the Spurs' 1999 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   For the true Duncan fan, the stats page lists Duncan's numbers
in the NBA as well as in his four seasons at Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the site will offer a public fan mail section
complete with Duncan's responses to e-mail and regular chat
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is apparently a movie and music lover. Ultimately, the
site will give visitors the chance to read his reviews of CDs and
movies.

   HERE'S HOW TO TREAT A CELL PHONE WITH RESPECT
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watched ``The X-Files'' last Sunday remembers Fox
Mulder waking up over and over to a series of annoying things, one
of which was a leaky water bed that shorted out his cell phone,
which was on the water-soaked rug. Mulder could have avoided a
shorted-out phone had he paid attention to the rules of cell phone
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at AirTouch, one of several cellular phone sellers on
the market, recently put out a list of cell phone tips, one which
was to keep your cell phone dry.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Read your owner's manual.
</P>
<P>
   _ Treat a cell phone like other electronic devices and keep it
and all parts and accessories away from children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't keep your phone in hot areas. High temperatures can
shorten the life of electronic devices, damage batteries, and warp
or melt some plastics.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the same time, don't store your cell phone in cold areas.
As the phone warms, moisture forming inside can damage the circuit
boards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never try to open your cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't keep your cell phone in dusty, dirty areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try not to drop, knock or shake your cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't use harsh chemicals or solvents to clean your phone. Use
a soft, cloth, lightly dampened with a soap-and-water solution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider getting your phone an annual service check-up.

 &HT;    Games play into PC choices
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Intel Corp. and AMD Inc. made a big to-do last
week when they introduced faster, more powerful processors _ the
Pentium III and K6-3.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? To run Microsoft Word or complex personal finance
programs? For many, the most important reason of all is that these
processors will help you dominate death matches in ``Quake II.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like a trivial thing, basing the purchase of a new
computer or upgrade on a single game, but as it has always been in
the history of computers, games are a primary motivator for
computer evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Games, in short, are a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it's often been the simplistic _ games such as
``Tetris'' and ``Solitaire'' glued millions to desktops. But
increasingly, it's violent first-person shooters such as ``Quake
II,'' ``Unreal'' and ``Half-Life'' that are upping the ante on how
much computing power is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To fully take advantage of a game such as ``Unreal'', you need a
fast processor, plenty of memory, a big enough hard drive to hold
the software, a 3D sound card that lets you hear the position of
your enemies and a speedy Internet connection to battle online.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all together, and you have a very powerful computer
system that, like the oversized, cartoonish weapons in ``Unreal,''
amount to computational overkill. In few other applications except
games do you need that kind of power. Who needs a $150 graphics
accelerator card to write a letter in Microsoft Word or to do a
Yahoo! search in Netscape Communicator?
</P>
<P>
   The computer demands of games are so great, in fact, that
magazines and Web sites that review computer systems regularly use
games such as ``Quake II'' ``Turok the Dinosaur Hunter'' and
``Descent: Freespace'' to benchmark systems _ the true test of a
computer's power is how many frames per second it can display a
3D-rendered character's head being blown off by a plasma cannon.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of people who planned to purchase a new computer for
the home in the next 12 months, 57 percent of respondents said they
would buy games for that computer.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that many people are using $1,500-$2,000 computer
systems as little more than game consoles is a bit confusing given
that a Sony PlayStation, which often offers better control in a
wide variety of games, sells for $129. And a coming generation of
consoles including Sega's Dreamcast and Sony's next PlayStation are
to offer processing, sound and graphics that will surpass PC
capabilities for less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   But high-end, resource-hogging games continue to be popular,
especially among early adopters and PC experts. The reason is that
PC games are playable over the Internet (Dreamcast will ship with a
modem, but so far console games have not made effective use of the
Net), they can be added to with downloaded patches and upgrades,
and they usually have rich graphics and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Gamers also like the demands these games place on their systems
_ nothing speaks more highly of a gamer's dedication than having
the fastest computer with the best graphic capabilities on which to
play.
</P>
<P>
   What console systems and PC games have shared is the ability to
create a demand for hardware based on a few popular titles. Sony
has had Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider Series, ``Resident Evil''
and ``Final Fantasy VII.'' Nintendo had ``Mario 64,'' ``Goldeneye:
007'' and ``The Legend of Zelda: Orinca in Time.'' And the PC has
had breakthrough games such as ``Quake,'' ``Unreal'' and ``Grim
Fandago.''
</P>
<P>
   While those console games have moved entire systems, the demands
of games for PCs have provoked gamers into buying powerful graphics
cards, better sound systems and faster processors.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is not new _ Origin System's ``Wing Commander''
games in the early '90s enticed gamers into purchasing Sound
Blaster-compatible sound cards to hear the digital soundtrack and
speech incorporated into the game.
</P>
<P>
   But more than ever, computer games are becoming the primary
motivator for the introduction of faster, more powerful computer
systems. Until the Internet evolves as more people get higher
bandwidth connections in the home, the dimly lit, spectacularly
detailed walls and skies of ``Unreal'' and ``Half-Life'' will be
where computer users get the most out of their machines.

 &HT;    Attention music fans: Guitar advice available for the plucking
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the most popular instruments for amateur
musicians is the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you played as a youngster, or maybe you'd like to learn.
But the notion of music lessons and the agony of being a beginner
may have discouraged you from trying to learn or relearn the
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the Web is a terrific resource for would-be
guitar players.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make some beautiful music together today, with the help of
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   To prove it really is ``worldwide,'' we'll start with a German
site called Guitar Online. Unless you feel like learning both
German and the guitar at the same time, go to http://guitaronline
</P>
<P>
   .notrix.de/ to get the English version of this page. You'll get
tips on playing the guitar, be able to download software that'll
help you learn the guitar and use it, and find links to other Web
sites devoted to the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called the Rob Balducci Web site, and it's a
terrific general purpose guitar enthusiast's site with some
commercial offerings thrown in. You'll find it at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .robbalducci.com/Overview.html. You'll be able to download music
or take online music lessons for free. Just click on the chord you
want to learn, and you'll get on-screen help.
</P>
<P>
   While you are there, make sure to drop by the links page at
http://www.robbalducci.com
</P>
<P>
   /links.html. That's where you'll find a lot of free and helpful
information (along with some links that offer lessons for money).
But there's enough free stuff here to keep you busy for a long
time. If you follow every link, you'll get information on playing
chords, picking, selecting a guitar, downloading chord charts, and
finding newsgroups and discussion areas where you can, uh, compare
notes with other guitar players.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called the Easy Guitar Download page and is at
http://www.music-company.co
</P>
<P>
   .at/easyguitar/download.html. Some of the content here is in
German (all I can figure is that the Germans love the guitar), but
there are English labels on most links and most of the content is
decidedly un-German. For instance, you'll find computerized help
for learning country-western and gospel songs here.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of downloading, there are plenty of places on the Web
where you can download useful programs and tools for the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, most guitar players use an electronic tuner that
allows them to tune each string perfectly, instead of relying on
the ear. These electronic gadgets listen to the sound of a strummed
string and then use a meter to indicate when the string is tuned
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll pay $20 or so for a cheap tuner at the store and a
lot more for a good one. You can save some money and use your
computer, a sound card and a microphone to do the same thing. Just
go to 
http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/Windowsguitartuner/download.sht
ml to download a program that will do all that for you.
</P>
<P>
   Finally let's stop by Jazz Guitar Online at
http://www.jazzguitar.com/.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a link there (or go directly to
http://www.jazzguitar.com/lessons.html) that offers a series of
free lessons you can download. This page also has commercial
products for sale, but just as is true with television or a
magazine, you can enjoy the free content without paying a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's play together.

 &HT;    Portal craze was '98 news; now it's all about content
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Portals are like, you know, so over.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that New York-based Internet research firm Jupiter
Communications packed panel after panel with e-commerce and portal
players, like At Home, Excite, Lycos, Drugstore.com and
Ticketmaster Online, at its flagship conference last week in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Chairman and CEO Gene DeRose nevertheless told the
1,600-plus attendees that a ``content renaissance'' on the Web is
right around the corner. The trick, he said, is for the media
companies that post editorial content on the Web to rip a page from
Amazon.com, so to speak, and provide some e-commerce features to
transform mere readers into a fiercely loyal audience that will
drop by every day to read and spend money.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, portals were the key to Web profits. Portals such as
Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos were generating millions of page views
daily with what one analyst called ``sticky products'' designed to
keep users on their site for minutes, maybe even hours, at a time.
Portals offered search, e-mail, news, sports scores, weather
reports, stock quotes, live chats, free Web pages, local news and
shopping. Suddenly everyone wanted to be a portal, even sites that
had no business being portals in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is a new year, and like high-fashion dress
designers in Paris, it's time to toss last year's must-have trendy
frocks in favor of this year's trendy frocks that will be the
hippest and the coolest ever _ that is until next year rolls
around.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jupiter, this year's trend is compelling content
from media players such as newspapers, magazines, television
networks and cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so content is king again,'' sighed New York Times new
media guru Martin Nisenholtz, a veteran conference speaker who has
seen content go in and out of fashion more than once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not using the expression `Content is king,''' a Jupiter
analyst told him patiently. ``We're calling it a `content
renaissance,''' he said, hoping the new buzzword would catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' said Nisenholtz, ``can we say that content is
prince?''
</P>
<P>
   For those of you whose high school French is a bit rusty,
renaissance is French for ``rebirth.'' Jupiter's DeRose says media
companies that are expert storytellers have the potential to be big
Web winners in the end. People will eventually tire of reading
``just the facts m'am,'' news reports on the portal sites, and will
actively seek out more comprehensive and lively sources of news,
analysis and information.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, most content sites don't charge for their
content. (The Wall Street Journal Interactive is a notable
exception. Slate tried charging for content, but abandoned the plan
after only a year.) While good storytelling and other compelling
content can and will attract Web users, the trick, according to
Jupiter, is for content sites to start acting like commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if media companies borrow some of the chat,
search and community features stuck all over the portal sites and
apply them to their own ventures, they'll build readership and make
money.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to invent the wheel, and there's certainly no
need for every Web site to become a portal site. Strong content _
combined with a way of capturing data about readers and using that
data to offer e-mail news alerts, contests, chat and commerce _ is
the way of the future for media companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find out all you can about the people who visit your
service,'' said CBS SportsLine Chairman Mike Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Invite users to register so they can receive news flashes,
special offers or special commerce opportunities. Give them the
opportunity to post messages and chat with authors about breaking
news or special programming. Offer prizes to users who frequent an
area the most during a certain time period. Sell them mugs,
T-shirts, books related to special series or by writers who
contribute to the site. Jupiter also has research showing online
users aren't as bothered by a mixture of news and retailing online
as they are in offline media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call to media sites,'' said Jupiter analyst
Mark Mooradian. ``Some commerce sites are better at delivering
content than traditional media are. They have the demographics, and
they have the credit card info. Look at Amazon.com. Look at Land's
End. They have repeat users and millions of unique registered
users.''
</P>
<P>
   Mooradian's words weren't lost on Washingtonpost.com President
and Publisher Marc Teren, who said one of the Post's goals was to
build regular online users, as Jupiter suggests. ``We want to build
a relationship (with readers) and hold them over time and deliver
them to advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that content is not only prince, but the ultimate
``sticky product'' of the year.

 &HT;    Intel's Pentium III more evolutionary than revolutionary
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ PCs with the new Pentium III chip from Intel are on
shelves now. These new machines are the fastest yet, reasonably
priced and _ based on early reports _ relatively bug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy one.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? If the chip is a good one, and it is, and if the price
is right, and it is, why not rush to the store and take one home?
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to answer that question for yourself by the end
of this article.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know about the Pentium III is the internal
workings of the chip _ its architecture _ isn't all that different
from the Pentium II. In fact, if you have a Pentium II machine, the
new chip is so similar to the old one, odds are good you can simply
remove the old chip and plug in a new Pentium III with no problems
at all. But don't do that, either.
</P>
<P>
   Keep reading.
</P>
<P>
   The real changes in this newest Pentium from Intel are in what
is called its instruction set. The instruction set is really more
like a computer program than a part of the chip. It consists of
computer code that instructs the chip on how to compute. Without
the instructions, it would be an expensive and useless piece of
silicon about the size of a matchbook.
</P>
<P>
   The new instruction set will eventually allow Pentium III chips
to handle video much better (since computer games are loaded with
video, games will run much faster). The instructions _ called
Katmai New Instructions _ also let the chip do a better job with
speech recognition, a technology rapidly becoming practical and
useful.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the first reason why there's no need to rush to the
store today: Only software specially written to take advantage of
the new instruction set will get a speed boost. Your old programs
won't profit from this instruction set.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a few games take advantage of KNI (including
``Wargasm'' and ``Descent III''). As time goes on, that will
change. Video cards will be created that recognize the new
instructions, and Windows 2000 will have built-in support for KNI.
(Microsoft has said it will create a patch _ a tiny program
designed to improve an existing one _ that will let Windows 98 take
advantage of KNI.) Since Windows itself is a heavy user of graphics
and sound, the combination of the patch and the new chip should
make your PC run faster.
</P>
<P>
   MARK OF THE BEAST?
</P>
<P>
   When the Pentium III's specifications were first announced,
there was panic and protest among many computer enthusiasts.
Messages zipped through cyberspace as word got out that the new
chip has a built-in electronic serial number. Intel says the
purpose of the serial number _ which will identify the computer to
other computers on the Internet _ was to increase security. After
all, passwords and user names can be faked. But Intel said _ when
combined with the built-in serial number _ there would be less
chance of someone faking an electronic transaction or e-mail. But
for some computer folks, that serial number was the mark of the
beast. There was worry that the serial number would make it
impossible to have any privacy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's reaction was to create a small program that can be
downloaded from Intel's Web site (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.intel.com) that gives users control over the serial number.
Those who fear the number can invade their privacy can turn off the
serial number, and those who buy into Intel's argument that the
serial number actually protects privacy and security can leave it
turned on.
</P>
<P>
   BUY TODAY, LOSE OUT TOMORROW
</P>
<P>
   You've already learned most of the speed is yet to come, as
software programs take advantage of the new instruction set.
Depending on what figures you see and whom you believe, the new
machine should run about 5 percent to 8 percent faster (not enough
of a change for most people to notice) with programs that do not
take advantage of the new instruction set.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies will gear up to support the KNI instructions.
But at least as important is the fact Intel has said it expects to
offer Pentium III chips by the end of the year with speeds as fast
as 1 gigahertz (a little more than twice as fast as the
450-megahertz speed of the current PIII chips).
</P>
<P>
   So, if you buy a Pentium III today, you may find yourself with a
high-tech antique.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you decide the faster Pentium IIIs aren't important,
waiting makes sense. New chips and king-of-the-hill computers
command a premium price. Prices for slower Pentium IIIs will take a
nose dive as 1-gigahertz class machines are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   If you'll settle for a Pentium II, take note of Intel's
announcement last week that it will drop the price for that chip by
15 percent to 20 percent. That doesn't mean Pentium II PCs will
make the same percentage drop, since there's more to a computer
than a single chip, but it adds momentum to price drops already
taking place.

<P>
   Just as it is true with automobiles, prices vary widely. But
some of the new Pentium IIIs sell for $2,000 or a bit more at the
bottom end of the price range. That's a good introductory price.
And, some people (especially those who have graphics-intensive
tasks to perform at work and who are lucky enough to use programs
that do or soon will take advantage of the new instruction set)
will pay it gladly.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us, the introduction of the Pentium III marks a
time when watching and waiting makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS ABOUT THE INTEL PENTIUM III
</P>
<P>
   _ A set of internal instructions will eventually make it a
better chip for games and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ A controversial built-in serial number makes transactions on
the Net more secure _ or invades your privacy (depending on whom
you believe).
</P>
<P>
   _ Initially, it will come in two speeds: 450 megahertz and 500
megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   _ Later versions (out by the end of the year) will be twice as
fast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Features in the chip should make new technologies such as
voice recognition work faster and better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since the basic design of the chip has not changed from the
Pentium II, it can be used as a direct replacement in most Pentium
II machines.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is backward-compatible: All the programs that are running
on your current PC should work just fine on a new Pentium III.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're looking for a fun read about the recent rise
of the Internet, check out ``Architects of the Web.'' Written by
venture capitalist Robert Reid, the book chronicles the people and
companies that have powered the Internet's rising popularity in the
past five years. You'll find profiles of Marc Andreesen and Rob
Glaser, co-founder of Netscape and founder of RealNetworks and a
former Microsoft big shot, respectively. In a review, Fortune
magazine called the book ``well written and rich with detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some new games? You might want to check out the
latest issue of PC Gamer. The magazine this month features its
fifth annual PC Gamer Awards. The awards are divided into
categories, with a winner in each. The magazine did choose one
overall winner, and that was Sierra's ``Half-Life,'' a first-person
war game. Other winners included ``Rainbow Six,'' ``Grim
Fandango,'' ``StarCraft,'' ``Falcon 4.0'' and ``NBA Live 99.''

   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   In its never-ending effort to turn famous old board games into
computer CDs, Hasbro Interactive has released several new titles.
They include ``Battleship,'' ``Scrabble'' and ``Grandmaster
Chess.'' Each is based on the board game of the same name and
retails for $15. These games are only available for Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several years, Disney has been exporting its famous
animation to computer CDs. The latest title is ``Winnie the Pooh &AMP;
Tigger Too.'' It's an animated storybook that features Christopher
Robin, Pooh and the gang. There are games, and the story of Pooh is
read aloud for little kids. Designed for ages 3-6, ``Winnie the
Pooh'' is available for both Macs and PCs.

 &HT;    Get your pheromones, better sex life via e-mail
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``BOOST YOUR SEX APPEAL AND CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL AND SEX
LIFE FOREVER,'' said the message header.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless you've gotten e-mail like this, too. Maybe you read
it. Maybe you sent off for the stuff. Maybe you just ignored it, as
I did until just now.
</P>
<P>
   After all, an august computer columnist ought not to be nosing
around things like this. No telling where it might all end, but
given my luck it would end in the emergency room, the police
blotter or the gossip column.
</P>
<P>
   But I was feeling pretty down. My social life revolves around my
wife, my guinea pigs, and, blessedly but only occasionally, my
granddaughters. Sex appeal? In the eyes of a matronly walrus,
perhaps. Sex life? Well, that's private, and I wish it needed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   So, what the hey. Let's see what these sleazebags are peddling.
</P>
<P>
   What they are peddling are ``the natural human male/female
pheromone attractants and they are NOW available to YOU, legally.''
</P>
<P>
   I never knew pheromones were available to me at all, even
illegally. I never heard of the DEA raiding an underground
pheromone lab, or had anyone sidle up on a dark street corner and
whisper, ``Hey, big 'un, wanna dime bag 'a pheros? Finest kind _
Bolivian blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Pheromones, of course, are sexual attractants, but I assumed
they were limited to Mediterranean fruit flies. Florida, which is
bedeviled by these bugs, is always trying to use pheromones to lure
them to their deaths. I cannot see how my life would be improved by
my own personal cloud of fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
   But the aptly named purveyor of this stuff, Euphoria Products,
located, predictably, in Florida, claims humans have pheromones,
too, and all one needs for a wildly busy love life is an abundance
of them.
</P>
<P>
   According to my e-mail, this product, called HI-octane, contains
both male and female pheromones in a ``clear, odorless liquid,''
and the lovelorn are supposed to add it to their ``favorite perfume
or cologne.'' Despite this, the Euphoria folks say, ``This will not
attract same sex; but works as nature intended, attracting the
opposite sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like computer software. ``Hey, some clown back in
production dumped the male vat and the female vat together. We got
to figure out how to make this a feature and not a bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it might work just fine, but I wouldn't want to send
mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem. I don't have a favorite cologne. I
tried it when I was a kid. It stings when you put it on, it tends
to smell like old saddle leather steeped in cheap whiskey, and if
girls got close to me their eyes watered and they sneezed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the e-mail claims a little dab'll do ya, since the
stuff sells for $40 per 1/8-ounce bottle (buy two, get one free),
the likelihood of overdosing seems inevitable. A testimonial from
Dave J., who can scarcely be heard over the clamor of women, says,
``I'd like to know if your product is available in a larger
quantity so I can make sure I'm never without it!''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, you should beware of peddlers offering substitutes,
like maybe water buffalo pheromones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful,'' cry the folks at Euphoria. ``Animal pheromones
do NOT attract humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't e-mail wonderful?

 &HT;    With cable modem, the thrill returns
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those of you who know me, either from reading this
column or from having breakfast with me at the Waffle House,
understand _ despite the fact that I've messed around with gadgets
for my entire adult life _ I am not a bold man when it comes to
adopting new technology.
</P>
<P>
   I've never, for instance, stuck a deposit in an ATM, because I'm
sure it'll get lost somehow. I use a bald-headed man named Marvin,
not a computer, to figure my taxes. And my checkbook stays
unbalanced just fine without Quicken. My computer is slow and
clunky compared to what most people have and want. I'm happy with
old tech that is dependable and has proven its worth.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you ought to listen when something new catches my
eye. If I like it, you probably wil, too.
</P>
<P>
   Do yourself a favor. As soon as they're available in your
neighborhood _ and if you have the money to spare _ get a cable
modem and use it to connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I did a week ago. It made a big difference, but
maybe not in the ways you'd expect. In fact, what I expected and
what I got were two different things.
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you what I mean. I saw a cable modem as simply a way
to get Web pages to load faster and something that would let me
download new files quickly. Both those things turned out to be true
(I downloaded a new 15-megabyte copy of Netscape Navigator in the
time it took me to eat five cookies), and Web pages are fast now,
faster even than when I use the expensive T1 high-speed data line
at work.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, things that weren't practical before, like
downloading a new program just to see what it is like; looking at
video that appears as clear and stable as a TV signal (although
still in a tiny box on my screen); and listening to audio that is
of an almost high-fidelity quality, become possible.
</P>
<P>
   But something more important happened, too. I began treating the
Web the way I used to, way back in the beginning when it was new. I
was surfing again.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing used to be a big deal to a lot of us. We'd go to one Web
page, click on an interesting link, follow it, and then follow
another one. A person could literally go from beekeeping to Peru in
just a few minutes. A lot of what we found wasn't immediately
practical, but it was almost like getting a liberal arts education:
Some of the things I learned became important later on.
</P>
<P>
   It was very much like picking up a book out of boredom,
something you would have never read, and discovering something
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Then two things happened. The Web got useful _ something that I,
you too probably, use at work to find out boring stuff like the
gross national product of Mexico. So, instead of surfing, I'd head
right to the spot where the information was held. The second thing
that happened was that Web pages got big and complicated _ full of
video and sound _ and that meant they took forever to load at
analog modem speeds. So I hesitated before pressing a link just for
fun. Sometimes it took a couple of minutes for the page to build.
</P>
<P>
   Think of owning a cable modem as being data-rich. You have
enough bandwidth to squander some, to use it just for fun. And,
truthfully, with my old dial-up connection the Web wasn't much fun.
There were times when I could go to the kitchen to fix a sandwich
while I waited for a page to build.
</P>
<P>
   But now, thanks to my cable modem, I'm surfing again. And it's
just as much fun as it used to be. Get yourself a cable modem. The
surf is up.

 &HT;    Games play into PC choices
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Intel Corp. and AMD Inc. made a big to-do last
week when they introduced faster, more powerful processors _ the
Pentium III and K6-3.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? To run Microsoft Word or complex personal finance
programs? For many, the most important reason of all is that these
processors will help you dominate death matches in ``Quake II.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like a trivial thing, basing the purchase of a new
computer or upgrade on a single game, but as it has always been in
the history of computers, games are a primary motivator for
computer evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Games, in short, are a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it's often been the simplistic _ games such as
``Tetris'' and ``Solitaire'' glued millions to desktops. But
increasingly, it's violent first-person shooters such as ``Quake
II,'' ``Unreal'' and ``Half-Life'' that are upping the ante on how
much computing power is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To fully take advantage of a game such as ``Unreal'', you need a
fast processor, plenty of memory, a big enough hard drive to hold
the software, a 3D sound card that lets you hear the position of
your enemies and a speedy Internet connection to battle online.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all together, and you have a very powerful computer
system that, like the oversized, cartoonish weapons in ``Unreal,''
amount to computational overkill. In few other applications except
games do you need that kind of power. Who needs a $150 graphics
accelerator card to write a letter in Microsoft Word or to do a
Yahoo! search in Netscape Communicator?
</P>
<P>
   The computer demands of games are so great, in fact, that
magazines and Web sites that review computer systems regularly use
games such as ``Quake II'' ``Turok the Dinosaur Hunter'' and
``Descent: Freespace'' to benchmark systems _ the true test of a
computer's power is how many frames per second it can display a
3D-rendered character's head being blown off by a plasma cannon.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of people who planned to purchase a new computer for
the home in the next 12 months, 57 percent of respondents said they
would buy games for that computer.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that many people are using $1,500-$2,000 computer
systems as little more than game consoles is a bit confusing given
that a Sony PlayStation, which often offers better control in a
wide variety of games, sells for $129. And a coming generation of
consoles including Sega's Dreamcast and Sony's next PlayStation are
to offer processing, sound and graphics that will surpass PC
capabilities for less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   But high-end, resource-hogging games continue to be popular,
especially among early adopters and PC experts. The reason is that
PC games are playable over the Internet (Dreamcast will ship with a
modem, but so far console games have not made effective use of the
Net), they can be added to with downloaded patches and upgrades,
and they usually have rich graphics and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Gamers also like the demands these games place on their systems
_ nothing speaks more highly of a gamer's dedication than having
the fastest computer with the best graphic capabilities on which to
play.
</P>
<P>
   What console systems and PC games have shared is the ability to
create a demand for hardware based on a few popular titles. Sony
has had Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider Series, ``Resident Evil''
and ``Final Fantasy VII.'' Nintendo had ``Mario 64,'' ``Goldeneye:
007'' and ``The Legend of Zelda: Orinca in Time.'' And the PC has
had breakthrough games such as ``Quake,'' ``Unreal'' and ``Grim
Fandago.''
</P>
<P>
   While those console games have moved entire systems, the demands
of games for PCs have provoked gamers into buying powerful graphics
cards, better sound systems and faster processors.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is not new _ Origin System's ``Wing Commander''
games in the early '90s enticed gamers into purchasing Sound
Blaster-compatible sound cards to hear the digital soundtrack and
speech incorporated into the game.
</P>
<P>
   But more than ever, computer games are becoming the primary
motivator for the introduction of faster, more powerful computer
systems. Until the Internet evolves as more people get higher
bandwidth connections in the home, the dimly lit, spectacularly
detailed walls and skies of ``Unreal'' and ``Half-Life'' will be
where computer users get the most out of their machines.

 &HT;    CONSUMER Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: There are Grammy Awards for record of the year, album of the
year and song of the year. What is the difference? _Becky A.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Grammys are presented by the National Academy of
Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences Inc. The song of the year is an award for
the songwriter; the record is for the song's performer and
producer; and the album is for the album's performer and producer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What requirements are needed to join the Alaska State
Troopers? _David V.
</P>
<P>
   A: Want to earn more than $3,500 a month for recruit positions
in exotic stations such as Ketchikan or Sitka? Alaska State Trooper
recruits must meet the following minimum requirements: a high
school diploma or GED; at least 21 years old; a valid Alaska
driver's license; and residency in Alaska. In addition, recruits
must never have been convicted of a felony or domestic violence or
have two or more driving-while-intoxicated offenses in the past 10
years. A long list of other ``must have nots'' includes use of
marijuana during the past two years. Sound like a fit? Contact the
Alaska Department of Public Safety, P.O. Box 111200, Juneau, Alaska
99811-1200 or visit www.dps.state.ak.us. Q: I have two daughters
and would like to have a third child. I have heard that the odds of
my third child being another girl are 90 percent. The theory is a
woman's body can chemically favor the conception of one sex or
another. Is there any scientific evidence to support this theory?
_Amber S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Nope, declares John Ashkenas, deputy editor of the American
Journal of Human Genetics. ``Generally the odds are the same for
every birth, as they are independent events.'' Trends in the sex
ratio? The National Center for Health Statistics says the birth
ratio for the sexes has remained about the same for 50 years. Live
births: 1,050 boys for every 1,000 girls. (Who's going to tell Pat
Boone?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please find out when Kate Spade will produce a line for the
males in this world. _ Lee Ullmann
</P>
<P>
   A: Good news for all you dandies. There is a new line by Kate
Spade, the woman's purse guru: the Jack Spade line. Jack, unlike
Kate, is a mythical person. For now, the best place to see the
entire Jack Spade line is the Soho Kate Spade store, 454 Broom St.,
New York. Select from Jack Spade messenger bags (a.k.a field bags),
weekend bags, raincoats, dopp kits, scarves and backpacks ranging
from $50 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw the ``Biography of Liberace'' on A&AMP;E recently. The
program mentioned a book that changed Liberace's life. Will you
please find out the name of that book, the author and where I can
find it?
</P>
<P>
   _ V.E. Walsh
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Magic of Believing,'' by Claude Bristol, a self
help/motivational author whose mantra is you can achieve whatever
you desire. The nimble-fingered showman read the tome during a low
career period and it snapped him into action. To purchase a copy,
call the Liberace Museum at (702) 798-5595. Eighteen of the 39
pianos owned by the legendary Liberace are on display at the
museum, along with several elaborate costumes (eat your heart out,
Elton John).
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter is getting married in June in upstate New York _
a garden wedding and reception. We hope to buy white umbrellas for
the guests, to shield from rain or sun. Do you have a suggestion
where I could look for about 100 inexpensive, white umbrellas? _
Norma Lehmann
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like a great setting. Adnet (339-9695) will order 100
white, 42-inch umbrellas for the event for a mere $5 each (give
them seven working days' notice). Minimum order is 84 umbrellas. If
you want to add a monogram to the umbrella, they can do that, too.
Closer to the site of the wedding, a sleek, push-button, white
umbrella is available from Uncle Sam Umbrella Shop, 161 W. 57th
St., New York. Ask for Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If someone changes a tip amount on a credit card, is this
considered a felony or a misdemeanor? He or she did not sign their
name to the card, nor has it been stolen. _D.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Felony theft involves amounts $1,500 and over; misdemeanor
theft, under that amount. Mack Martinez, criminal trial chief of
the Travis County District Attorney's office, says unless the
thefts can be aggregated, it is misdemeanor theft. (I think a card
payer would notice a $1,500 tip.) To report such activity, call the
Austin Police Department at 356-4249.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I lost 10 U.S. Saving Bonds in the mail when I was
transferred from Oklahoma to Washington, D.C. How do I go about
recovering these bonds? They have reached their seven-year
maturity. _Norbert Flores
</P>
<P>
   A: Not to worry. Lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed bonds can
be replaced free of charge if the Bureau of the Public Debt can
establish that the bonds have not been cashed. (Keep records of
bond serial numbers, issue dates, registration and Social Security
or taxpayer identification numbers in a safe place separate from
the bonds _ as you would with traveler's checks.) To replace these
bonds, complete Form PD F 1048 with whatever information you
remember, such as the approximate issue date, the complete names,
addresses, Social Security number that appeared on the bond and the
bond serial number. To obtain a form, ask for one at most
commercial banks or at www.savingsbonds.gov. Mail the completed
form to Bureau of the Public Debt, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328.
Replacement bonds will still show the original issue date. If it is
discovered your bonds have been cashed, an investigation will
ensue. Q: Is there a law requiring apartment complexes to hold your
security deposit in escrow and have it be interest-bearing? Some
apartments have that policy and some don't. _Marie Pfau
</P>
<P>
   A: ``No, there is no requirement in Texas law that landlords
invest these funds and pay tenants the interest,'' says Austin
Tenants' Council spokesman Bruce Rodenborn, although many states do
have such laws. If you find an apartment complex with this policy,
it is a perk. The landlord is required to return your security
deposit within 30 days of move-out along with an itemized list of
deductions (if any). Of course, that is hard to do if you have not
provided the landlord with your forwarding address.

 &HT;    CONSUMER Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: There are Grammy Awards for record of the year, album of the
year and song of the year. What is the difference? _Becky A.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Grammys are presented by the National Academy of
Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences Inc. The song of the year is an award for
the songwriter; the record is for the song's performer and
producer; and the album is for the album's performer and producer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What requirements are needed to join the Alaska State
Troopers? _David V.
</P>
<P>
   A: Want to earn more than $3,500 a month for recruit positions
in exotic stations such as Ketchikan or Sitka? Alaska State Trooper
recruits must meet the following minimum requirements: a high
school diploma or GED; at least 21 years old; a valid Alaska
driver's license; and residency in Alaska. In addition, recruits
must never have been convicted of a felony or domestic violence or
have two or more driving-while-intoxicated offenses in the past 10
years. A long list of other ``must have nots'' includes use of
marijuana during the past two years. Sound like a fit? Contact the
Alaska Department of Public Safety, P.O. Box 111200, Juneau, Alaska
99811-1200 or visit www.dps.state.ak.us. Q: I have two daughters
and would like to have a third child. I have heard that the odds of
my third child being another girl are 90 percent. The theory is a
woman's body can chemically favor the conception of one sex or
another. Is there any scientific evidence to support this theory?
_Amber S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Nope, declares John Ashkenas, deputy editor of the American
Journal of Human Genetics. ``Generally the odds are the same for
every birth, as they are independent events.'' Trends in the sex
ratio? The National Center for Health Statistics says the birth
ratio for the sexes has remained about the same for 50 years. Live
births: 1,050 boys for every 1,000 girls. (Who's going to tell Pat
Boone?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please find out when Kate Spade will produce a line for the
males in this world. _ Lee Ullmann
</P>
<P>
   A: Good news for all you dandies. There is a new line by Kate
Spade, the woman's purse guru: the Jack Spade line. Jack, unlike
Kate, is a mythical person. For now, the best place to see the
entire Jack Spade line is the Soho Kate Spade store, 454 Broom St.,
New York. Select from Jack Spade messenger bags (a.k.a field bags),
weekend bags, raincoats, dopp kits, scarves and backpacks ranging
from $50 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw the ``Biography of Liberace'' on A&AMP;E recently. The
program mentioned a book that changed Liberace's life. Will you
please find out the name of that book, the author and where I can
find it?
</P>
<P>
   _ V.E. Walsh
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Magic of Believing,'' by Claude Bristol, a self
help/motivational author whose mantra is you can achieve whatever
you desire. The nimble-fingered showman read the tome during a low
career period and it snapped him into action. To purchase a copy,
call the Liberace Museum at (702) 798-5595. Eighteen of the 39
pianos owned by the legendary Liberace are on display at the
museum, along with several elaborate costumes (eat your heart out,
Elton John).
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter is getting married in June in upstate New York _
a garden wedding and reception. We hope to buy white umbrellas for
the guests, to shield from rain or sun. Do you have a suggestion
where I could look for about 100 inexpensive, white umbrellas? _
Norma Lehmann
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like a great setting. Adnet (339-9695) will order 100
white, 42-inch umbrellas for the event for a mere $5 each (give
them seven working days' notice). Minimum order is 84 umbrellas. If
you want to add a monogram to the umbrella, they can do that, too.
Closer to the site of the wedding, a sleek, push-button, white
umbrella is available from Uncle Sam Umbrella Shop, 161 W. 57th
St., New York. Ask for Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If someone changes a tip amount on a credit card, is this
considered a felony or a misdemeanor? He or she did not sign their
name to the card, nor has it been stolen. _D.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Felony theft involves amounts $1,500 and over; misdemeanor
theft, under that amount. Mack Martinez, criminal trial chief of
the Travis County District Attorney's office, says unless the
thefts can be aggregated, it is misdemeanor theft. (I think a card
payer would notice a $1,500 tip.) To report such activity, call the
Austin Police Department at 356-4249.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I lost 10 U.S. Saving Bonds in the mail when I was
transferred from Oklahoma to Washington, D.C. How do I go about
recovering these bonds? They have reached their seven-year
maturity. _Norbert Flores
</P>
<P>
   A: Not to worry. Lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed bonds can
be replaced free of charge if the Bureau of the Public Debt can
establish that the bonds have not been cashed. (Keep records of
bond serial numbers, issue dates, registration and Social Security
or taxpayer identification numbers in a safe place separate from
the bonds _ as you would with traveler's checks.) To replace these
bonds, complete Form PD F 1048 with whatever information you
remember, such as the approximate issue date, the complete names,
addresses, Social Security number that appeared on the bond and the
bond serial number. To obtain a form, ask for one at most
commercial banks or at www.savingsbonds.gov. Mail the completed
form to Bureau of the Public Debt, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328.
Replacement bonds will still show the original issue date. If it is
discovered your bonds have been cashed, an investigation will
ensue. Q: Is there a law requiring apartment complexes to hold your
security deposit in escrow and have it be interest-bearing? Some
apartments have that policy and some don't. _Marie Pfau
</P>
<P>
   A: ``No, there is no requirement in Texas law that landlords
invest these funds and pay tenants the interest,'' says Austin
Tenants' Council spokesman Bruce Rodenborn, although many states do
have such laws. If you find an apartment complex with this policy,
it is a perk. The landlord is required to return your security
deposit within 30 days of move-out along with an itemized list of
deductions (if any). Of course, that is hard to do if you have not
provided the landlord with your forwarding address.
</P>

   _ Shirt look like you slept in it? Have an iron but no ironing
board? Ironing pads/blankets designed to sit on a bed, floor or
counter are available from the Lillian Vernon catalog at (800)
285-5555 or the Container Store.

 &HT;    The Boys of Summer fly south for spring training
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Professional baseball players from
around the country have headed south for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   They're not there to play on the beach or to perfect their tans
_ they are there to work.
</P>
<P>
   Teams flock to warm havens such as Florida and Arizona for their
yearly ritual of spring training. They'll stay until around Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since major-league baseball began, players have traveled
to warm climates in the late winter to practice their pitching,
hitting and fielding to get ready for the upcoming season. Babe
Ruth did it, Ty Cobb did it, Jackie Robinson did it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Atlanta Braves are doing it. Javy Lopez, Tom Glavine,
Andruw Jones and teammates are in their new spring training
ballpark in Orlando, which is near Walt Disney World. They're
getting ready for opening day on April 5. They get to play in a
relaxed setting where fans are invited in to watch their practices.
The ballpark is much smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Being in Orlando works out nicely for the Braves' children too,
who get to go to the nearby theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   For the Braves who have families here, especially ones with
young children who don't have to be in school, spring training is a
chance to spend time together. Families come down and stay with
players in rented houses for weeks at a time. While the Braves have
to be at the ballpark in the morning and early afternoon, they can
spend time with their families in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have kids, it makes it a lot easier,'' said pitcher
Rudy Seanez, who's staying in a house with his wife Dianna and two
daughters _ Katrianna, who's 2, and Lilianna, who's 6 months.
``Sometimes if you're in a house by yourself and you've had a hard
day, you go home and sulk. You've got no one to talk to. It's a lot
easier when your family is here. It makes you forget about the bad
things and keeps you busy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of spring training, the Braves have to narrow down
the roster from 40 players to 25. Twenty-five is the number they'll
keep until Sept. 1. In September, teams can expand the roster back
to 40, so they can give young players experience in real games and
rate their performances.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few questions about which relief pitchers the Braves
will keep to join Kerry Ligtenberg, John Rocker, Seanez and
newcomer Mike Remlinger in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   One problem the Braves now have is trying to adjust to the loss
of first baseman Andres Galarraga. ``The Big Cat'' has been
diagnosed with lymphoma, a form of cancer, in his lower back. He is
expected to get well eventually, but he will miss the entire 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, the Braves have moved Ryan Klesko from left field
to first base, and 40-year-old former Brave Otis Nixon _ who signed
during the offseason as a free agent _ will play left field.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYERS TO WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Some new faces to look for in this year's lineup are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Right fielder Brian Jordan signed with the Braves in the
offseason after spending the last seven years playing for the St.
Louis Cardinals. Jordan is known for playing great defense in the
outfield and being a solid power hitter. He had a career-high 25
home runs last year. He used to play safety for the Atlanta Falcons
and has been living in Atlanta during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bret Boone is the Braves new second baseman, who came over
from the Cincinnati Reds in a trade for pitcher Denny Neagle. Boone
is a seven-year veteran of the major leagues whose father (Bob
Boone), grandfather (Ray Boone) and brother (Aaron Boone) have all
played big-league baseball. Boone won a Gold Glove for playing
outstanding defense at second base last year and is coming off one
of his best offensive seasons ever: 24 home runs and 95 runs batted
in.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bruce Chen is a 21-year-old rookie pitcher who will be the
Braves fifth starter behind Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux, John Smoltz
and Kevin Millwood. Even though Chen is young and has only pitched
four games in the major leagues, the Braves think he is good enough
to get major-league hitters out night after night.
</P>
<P>
   SPRING SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   The Braves pitchers and catchers have been working out since
Feb. 18 and the remaining position players started working out on
Feb. 23. The Braves began a monthlong exhibition season with a game
against Georgia Tech on March 4. The Braves will return home to
Turner Field to play two exhibition games on April 2 and 3. The
season officially starts April 5 with a home game against the
Philadelphia Phillies.

 &HT;    Former Justice dead at 90
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Harry A. Blackmun, a retired U.S. Supreme Court
Justice, died last week in Arlington, Va. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun, a Republican, was appointed to the court by President
Nixon in 1970. He served 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rendering many decisions over the years, Blackmun is
remembered most for writing the Roe vs. Wade ruling. In it, he
stated women have a constitutional right to have abortions. He
received more than 60,000 pieces of hate mail from people who
didn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   To those who didn't know him, Blackmun might have seemed a
cranky old guy. On the bench, he often scowled and could snap at
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But when he took off the judicial robe, he was warm and funny.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   POLIO ON VERGE OF EXTINCTION
</P>
<P>
   Polio, a disease that has paralyzed hundreds of thousands of
children around the world, will be eliminated by next year,
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Polio is already extremely rare in the United States, where most
children are vaccinated. But children in other countries, such as
India, haven't gotten the vaccine. Now medical teams are blanketing
those countries, vaccinating children.
</P>
<P>
   In several more years, when it's clear the polio virus has been
wiped out worldwide, children will no longer be vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratories around the world are being asked to destroy or lock
up remaining stocks of polio virus. Scientists don't want a lab
accident or theft of the virus to start new infections.
</P>
<P>
   DISABLED STUDENT WINS CASE
</P>
<P>
   Schools around the country could be affected by a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that an Iowa school should pay the cost of nursing
care for a disabled student.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old student, Garret Frey, is in a wheelchair and
needs a nurse's assistance throughout the school day. The court
ruled that federal law requires public schools to provide special
education services, including medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a chance to have a free education,'' Frey said.
``It's going to help a lot of other kids. Not just me and other
kids in Iowa. It's going to help all over.''
</P>
<P>
   But school districts are worried that they can't afford to cover
those costs. Frey's school says it will cost about $40,000 a year
for the nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENTISTS TELL HOW WE SMELL
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe they have figured out how the nose knows.
</P>
<P>
   For years they've wondered how creatures can distinguish
thousands of odors with only about 1,000 smell sensors. Now, a
study of mice has found that mammals use multiple sensors to
identify different smells. The same sensors are triggered in
different combinations to identify different smells.
</P>
<P>
   The sensors can be compared to letters, which are used in
different combinations to create different words.
</P>
<P>
   The team of scientists reported the discovery in a medical
journal.

Joe DiMaggio had fresh flowers placed at Marilyn Monroe's grave;

Anderson. (750 words)

issues raised by the coming of 2000. This week: Will houses
continue to get bigger in the next century? (Geewax, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ An associate professor at
Ohio's Miami University has taken exception to the school's ban on
thong-style swimwear and filed a civil rights suit charging that
the recreation center advisory committee who nixed his scanty
attire is stifling his First Amendment freedom of expression and
his 14th Amendment right to equal protection. My obvious question:
What exactly is he wanting to express, and from what (or whom)
might he need protection? (Elizabeth Schuett, a teacher and writer
in Gibsonburg, Ohio, writes twice a week for Cox News Service)
MOVED.

<P>
   KABAT-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ From the moment ``the babies'' in
the family are born, someone is telling them what to do, how to do
it, and when to do it. Much of it doesn't come from the parents,
either. It's the siblings. Whether it's big brothers or sisters,
they're there. And they resent you for popping into their world
uninvited. So, they get even . . . in little, deceptive, hidden
ways. (Kabat, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ When gas is cheap, cars will
be big. This is a law of nature and the Invisible Hand of consumer
economics. But I suspect our kids will find this a strange legacy.
They will look at the monster cars of the sport utility vehicle
showroom much as we once viewed the finned and chrome-spangled
Batmobile-looking artifacts that appear in old family photos. In
the meantime, I expect to continue feeling smaller on the highway
with each passing model year. If gas gets too much cheaper, I'll
have to scurry away to side-roads to stay out of the path of the
big creatures. (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal) MOVED

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ I was AFAD before Susie Blair ever told me

AFADs cherish one another almost as much as we do our dogs.
(Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED FRIDAY.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ I fell asleep during Monica Lewinsky's
famous interview on ABC. Two hours listening to strangers talk
about sex is more tedious than might be supposed. (Rosenfeld, Cox

JUSTICE BLACKMUN BROUGHT COMPASSION TO THE HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
 (Eds, in lede, make brackets of the double parens.)

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Poor Joshua! Victim of repeated attacks by an irresponsible,
bullying, cowardly, and intemperate father, and abandoned by
respondents ((Winnebago County Department of Social Services,
Wisconsin)) who placed him in a dangerous predicament and who knew
or learned what was going on, and yet did essentially nothing
except ... `dutifully recorded these incidents in files.' It is a
sad commentary on American life, and constitutional principles ...
that this child, Joshua DeShaney, now is assigned to live out the
remainder of his life profoundly retarded ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Joshua and his mother, as petitioners here, deserve -- but now
are denied by this court -- the opportunity to have the facts of
their case considered in light of constitutional protection ....''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the words of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry A.
Blackmun in dissent in DeShaney vs. Winnebago (1989). They indicate
the depth of Blackmun's concern for the people who live with the
interpretations of the Constitution handed down by this nation's
highest court: ``Poor Joshua!''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his father's beating, half of Joshua's brain was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was left permanently paralyzed and severely retarded.
His mother sued, charging the social services department with
depriving her son of his life and liberty under the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Don Sullivan, Cheyenne, Wyo., attorney and former state
legislator, argued this case at the high court. In an interview
Friday, he said: ``I was disappointed at the outcome. I felt like
the lawyer who argued Plessy vs. Ferguson must have felt. The court
wasn't ready to handle the moral questions in the case. But
Blackmun understood that the law has consequences. I could tell by
his questions that he was favorably disposed to our position.'' (In
Plessy vs. Ferguson, 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a
Louisiana law that prohibited people of color from sitting in the
same railroad cars with whites.)
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Blackmun joined the high court, he wrote a
dissent to the majority opinion in Furman vs. Georgia (1972) which
nullified all death sentences in the United States until the states
adopted fair and consistent guidelines for imposing capital
punishment. He thought the court had overstepped its bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Feb. 22, 1994, the year Blackmun would retire from the
high court, he issued a remarkable 22-page dissent when the high
court refused to hear an appeal from a death row inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed and angry at his colleagues on the court for
streamlining the death penalty and limiting the high court's
judicial oversight to executions by the states, he wrote: ``From
this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of
death. For more than 20 years I have endeavored, indeed, I have
struggled along with the majority of this court, to develop
procedural and substantive rules that would lend more than the mere
appearance of fairness to the death penalty endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than continue to coddle the court's delusion that the
desired level of fairness has been achieved and the need for
regulation eviscerated, I feel morally and intellectually obligated
simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed. ...
The path the court has chosen lessens us all. I dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun is revered or hated as the author of Roe vs. Wade
(1973), a 7-2 decision which struck down abortion laws because they
violate a woman's right to privacy. Warren Berger, then chief
justice, presumably picked Blackmun to write the majority opinion
because Blackmun had been an attorney representing the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minn. Blackmun was the junior member of the court.
And his vote in conference to strike down the Texas and Georgia
abortion laws was flimsy, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Blackmun circulated his first draft opinion to the
court which sought to strike down the abortion laws as
unconstitutionally vague. Justice Byron White responded with a
three-page devastating criticism of Blackmun's vagueness argument.
Had the vagueness argument become the Roe vs. Wade decision, it
would not have become what Blackmun later called ``a landmark in
the progress of the emancipation of women.''

   As the end of the term approached, Blackmun still hadn't
completed his revised draft. Two new associate justices were
appointed to fill the seven member court: William Rehnquist and
Lewis Powell. Chief Justice Burger asked for reargument before the
full court, hoping to have enough votes to uphold the abortion
laws. The high court heard oral argument again. And this time
Blackmun's draft opinion was stronger and hinged on the right of
privacy to confirm a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.
Even Burger concurred with the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Peck, legal director for the Association of Trial Lawyers
of America, was a judicial fellow at the U.S. Supreme Court when
Blackmun was still an associate justice. He recalls that Blackmun
was one of the hardest working justices who wrote his own opinions
and did his own research and often worked late into the night.
``Blackmun,'' he said ``also enjoyed telling stories to people. It
showed his puckish nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Peck offers this insight: ``Blackmun was a diligent, careful
researcher. He found his voice gradually. He didn't have it in the
early years on the court. In his later years, he was much more
personal in his writings and allowed his emotions to be expressed
in decisions he wrote. He grew more suspicious of government power
and more supportive of individual rights. He was not a liberal in
the Black-Warren tradition, Blackmun became more liberal in a
conservative way.''
</P>
<P>
   Peck noted that Blackmun retained a humility while a justice on
the nation's highest court. He called himself ``Old No. 3'' because
he was President Nixon's third choice to serve on the court after
the defeated nominations of judges Clement Haynsworth and G.
Harrold Carswell.
</P>
<P>
   Carswell had such a poor record as a federal judge _ having one
of the highest reversal rates as a district judge _ that former
Sen. Roman Hruska, R-Neb., who led the fight for Carswell's
nomination, said of him that even the mediocre are ``entitled to a
little representation.''
</P>
<P>
   When Blackmun retired from the high court in 1994, the people
lost an ardent advocate. He understood, as he stated on
``Nightline'' in 1993, that ``behind every case are some individual
people.'' He died last Thursday at the age of 90. And now we mourn
his passing. The court sorely needs a people's justice as a member;
the people need someone on the court who understands how its
decisions impact our lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the flawless center fielder for the New York
Yankees who, along with Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, symbolized the
team's dynastic greatness across the 20th century and whose 56-game
hitting streak in 1941 made him an instant and indelible American
folk hero, died early Monday at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   He had recently spent more than three months at Memorial
Regional Hospital in Hollywood, undergoing surgery for lung cancer
last Oct. 14.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has idolized and immortalized its 20th-century
heroes, from Charles Lindbergh to Elvis Presley, no one embodied
the American dream of fame and fortune or created a more enduring
legend than Joe DiMaggio. He became a figure of unequaled romance
and integrity in the national mind because of his consistent
professionalism on the baseball field, his marriage to the
Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, his devotion to her after her death,
and the pride and courtliness with which he carried himself
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio burst onto the baseball scene from San Francisco in the
1930s and grew into the game's most gallant and graceful center
fielder. He wore No. 5 and became the successor to Babe Ruth (No.
3) and Lou Gehrig (No. 4) in the team's pantheon. DiMaggio was the
team's superstar for 13 seasons, beginning in 1936 and ending in
1951, and appeared in 11 All-Star Games and 10 World Series. He
was, as Roy Blount Jr. once observed, ``the class of the Yankees in
times when the Yankees outclassed everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He was called the Yankee Clipper and was acclaimed at baseball's
centennial in 1969 as ``the greatest living ballplayer,'' the man
who in 1,736 games with the Yankees had a career batting average of
.325 and hit 361 home runs while striking out only 369 times, one
of baseball's most amazing statistics. (By way of comparison,
Mickey Mantle had 536 homers and struck out 1,710 times; Reggie
Jackson slugged 563 homers and struck out 2,597 times.)
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's game was so complete and elegant that it
transcended statistics; as The New York Times said in an editorial
when he retired, ``The combination of proficiency and exquisite
grace which Joe DiMaggio brought to the art of playing center field
was something no baseball averages can measure and that must be
seen to be believed and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio glided across the vast expanse of center field at
Yankee Stadium with such incomparable grace that long after he
stopped playing, the memory of him in full stride remains
evergreen. He disdained theatrical flourishes and exaggerated
moves, never climbing walls to make catches and rarely diving
headlong. He got to the ball just as it fell into his glove, making
the catch seem inevitable, almost preordained. The writer Wilfred
Sheed wrote, ``In dreams I can still see him gliding after fly
balls as if he were skimming the surface of the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   His batting stance was as graceful as his outfield stride. He
stood flat-footed at the plate with his feet spread well apart, his
bat held still just off his right shoulder. When he swung, his
left, or front, foot moved only slightly foward. His swing was pure
and flowing with an incredible follow-through; Casey Stengel said,
``He made the rest of them look like plumbers.''
</P>
<P>
   At his peak, he was serenaded as ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio'' by Les
Brown and saluted as ``the great DiMaggio'' by Ernest Hemingway in
``The Old Man and the Sea.'' He was mentioned in dozens of films
and Broadway shows; the sailors in ``South Pacific'' sing that
Bloody Mary's skin is ``tender as DiMaggio's glove.'' Years later
he was remembered by Paul Simon, who wondered with everybody else,
``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? Our nation turns its lonely
eyes to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to anything written, spoken or sung about him, he
confessed that he was puzzled by Simon's lyrics and sought an
answer when he met Simon in a restaurant in New York. ``I asked
Paul what the song meant, whether it was derogatory,'' DiMaggio
recalled. ``He explained it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When injuries eroded his skills and he could no longer perform
to his own standard, he turned his back on his $100,000 salary _ he
and his rival Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox then drew the
largest paychecks in sports _ and retired in 1951 with the dignity
that remained his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   His stormy marriage to Marilyn Monroe lasted less than a year,
but they remained one of America's ultimate romantic fantasies: the
tall, dark and handsome baseball hero wooing and winning the woman
who epitomized Hollywood beauty, glamour and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   He was private and remote. Even Monroe, at their divorce
proceedings, said he was given to black moods and would tell her,
``Leave me alone.'' He once said, with disdain, that he kept track
of all the books written about his storied life without his
consent, and by the late 1990s knew that the count had passed 33.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he could be proud, reclusive and vain in such a composed,
almost studied way that his reclusiveness contributed to his
mystique. In the book ``Summer of '49,'' David Halberstam wrote
that DiMaggio ``guards his special status carefully, wary of doing
anything that might tarnish his special reputation. He tends to
avoid all those who might define him in some way other than the way
he defined himself on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio joined the Yankees in 1936, missed three years while he
served in the Army Air Forces in World War II, then returned and
played through the 1951 season, when Mickey Mantle arrived to open
yet another era in the remarkable run of Yankee success. In his 13
seasons, DiMaggio went to bat 6,821 times, got 2,214 hits, knocked
in 1,537 runs, amassed 3,948 total bases and reached base just
under 40 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, baseball fans argued over who was the better pure
hitter, DiMaggio or Williams. Long after they had both retired,
Williams said: ``In my heart, I always felt I was a better hitter
than Joe. But I have to say, he was the greatest baseball player of
our time. He could do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did it all with a sureness and coolness that seemed to
imply an utter lack of emotion. DiMaggio was once asked why he did
not vent his frustrations on the field by kicking a bag or tossing
a bat. The outfielder, who chain-smoked cigarettes and had suffered
from ulcers, replied: ``I can't. It wouldn't look right.''
</P>
<P>
   But he betrayed his sensitivity in a memorable gesture of
annoyance in the sixth game of the 1947 World Series after his long
drive was run down and caught in front of the 415-foot sign in
left-center field at Yankee Stadium by Al Gionfriddo of the
Brooklyn Dodgers. As DiMaggio rounded first base, he saw Gionfriddo
make the catch and, with his head down, kicked the dirt. The angry
gesture was so shocking that it made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In the field, DiMaggio ran down long drives with a gliding
stride and deep range. In 1947, he tied what was then the American
League fielding record for outfielders by making only one error in
141 games. He also had one of the most powerful and precise
throwing arms in the business and was credited with 153 assists in
his 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime manager, Joe McCarthy, once touched on another
DiMaggio skill. ``He was the best base runner I ever saw,''
McCarthy said. ``He could have stolen 50, 60 bases a year if I let
him. He wasn't the fastest man alive. He just knew how to run bases
better than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Three times DiMaggio was voted his league's most valuable
player: in 1939, 1941 and 1947. In 1941, the magical season of his
56-game hitting streak, he won the award even though Williams hit
.406.
</P>
<P>
   In each of his first four seasons with the Yankees, DiMaggio
played in the World Series, and the Yankees won all four. He
appeared in the Series 10 times in 13 seasons over all, and nine
times the Yankees won. And although he failed to get enough votes
to make the baseball Hall of Fame when he became eligible in 1953,
perhaps because his aloofness had alienated some of the writers who
did the voting, he sailed into Cooperstown two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Whitey Ford was a rookie pitcher in 1950 when he first saw Joe
DiMaggio, and he later remembered: ``I just stared at the man for
about a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Paul DiMaggio was born on Nov. 25, 1914, in Martinez,
Calif., a small fishing village 25 miles northeast of the Golden
Gate. He was the fourth son and the eighth of nine children born to
Giuseppe Paolo and Rosalie DiMaggio, who had immigrated to America
in 1898 from Sicily. His father was a fisherman who moved his
family to North Beach, the heavily Italian section near the San
Francisco waterfront, the year Joe was born.
</P>
<P>
   The two oldest sons, Tom and Michael, joined their father as
fishermen; Michael later fell off his boat and drowned. But the
three other sons became major league outfielders by way of the
sandlots of San Francisco. Vince, four years older than Joe, played
11 seasons with five teams and led the National League in
strikeouts six times. Dominic, three years younger than Joe, was
known as the Little Professor because he wore eyeglasses when he
played 10 seasons with the Boston Red Sox, hitting .298 for his
career. Of the three, Joe was the natural.
</P>
<P>
   He started as a shortstop in the Boys Club League when he was
14, dropped out of Galileo High School after one year and joined
Vince on the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, the
highest level of minor-league baseball. It was late in 1932, and
Joe was still 17 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, in his first full season with the Seals, he hit
.340 with 28 home runs and knocked in 169 runs in 187 games. He
also hit safely in 61 games in a row, eight years before he made
history in the big leagues by hitting in 56. He tore up the league
during the next two seasons, hitting .341 and .398. But he injured
his left knee stepping out of a cab while hurrying to dinner at his
sister's house after a Sunday doubleheader and was considered
damaged goods by most of the teams in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   He got his chance at the majors because two scouts, Joe Devine
and Bill Essick, persisted in recommending him to the Yankees. The
general manager, Ed Barrow, talked it over with his colleagues. And
for $25,000 plus five players, the Yankees bought him from the
Seals.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was left in San Francisco for the 1935 season to heal
his knee and put the finishing touches on his game, then was
brought up to New York in 1936 to join a talented team that
included Lou Gehrig, Bill Dickey, Tony Lazzeri, Red Rolfe, Red
Ruffing and Lefty Gomez. It was two years after Babe Ruth had left,
and an era of success had ended.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the rookie from California was arriving with a contract
for $8,500, and a new era was beginning. It was delayed because of
a foot injury, but DiMaggio made his debut on May 3 against the St.
Louis Browns. He went on to play 138 games, got 206 hits with 29
home runs, batted .325 and drove in 125 runs. In the fall, the
Yankees made the first of four straight trips to the World Series _
they would go on to play in 23 out of 29 Series through 1964 _ and
the rookie hit .346 against the Giants and made a spectacular catch
in deepest center field in the Polo Grounds before a marveling
crowd of 43,543, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's luster was sometimes dimmed by salary disputes. In
1937 he hit .346 with 46 home runs and 167 RBI and the following
year he held out for $40,000, but was forced to sign for $25,000.
DiMaggio's holdout lasted a couple of weeks into the season; when
he returned, he was booed. When he began the 1941 season, he had
missed four of his first five openers because of injury or salary
fights, and many fans resented it. ``He got hurt early in his
career, more than he ever let on,'' Phil Rizzuto once said.
</P>
<P>
   He also had to endure the casual bigotry that existed when he
first came up. Many of his teammates called him the Big Dago, and
Life magazine, in a 1939 article intending to compliment him, said:
``Although he learned Italian first, Joe, now 24, speaks English
without an accent, and is otherwise well adapted to most U.S.
mores. Instead of olive oil or smelly bear grease he keeps his hair
slick with water. He never reeks of garlic and prefers chicken chow
mein to spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   But he energized the fans by leading the league in hitting in
1939 (at .381) and again in 1940 (with .352). Then in 1941, he put
together what has since been known simply as The Streak, and
fashioned perhaps the most enduring record in sports. Streaks were
nothing new to DiMaggio. He had hit in those 61 straight games for
the Seals, in 18 straight as a rookie with the Yankees, in 22
straight the next year and in 23 straight the year after that. In
fact, in 1941, he hit safely in the last 19 games in spring
training, and he kept hitting for eight more games after the
regular season opened.
</P>
<P>
   The Streak began on May 15, 1941, with a single in four times at
bat against the Chicago White Sox. The next day, he hit a triple
and a home run. Two weeks later, he had a swollen neck but still
hit three singles and a home run in Washington. The next week
against the St. Louis Browns, he went 3 for 5 in one game, then 4
for 8 in a doubleheader the next day with a double and three home
runs. His streak stood at 24.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, he broke the Yankees' club record of 29 games. On
June 26, he was hitless with two out in the eighth inning against
the Browns, but he doubled, and his streak reached 38. On June 29,
a doubleheader against Washington, DiMaggio lined a double in the
first game to tie George Sisler's modern major league record of
hitting in 41 straight games and then broke Sisler's record in the
second game by lining a single. On July 1, with a clean single
against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, he matched Willie Keeler's
major league record of 44 games, set in 1897 when foul balls didn't
count as strikes. The next day he broke it with a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   As DiMaggio kept hitting safely, radio announcers kept an
excited America informed, Bojangles Robinson danced on the Yankee
dugout roof at the Stadium for good luck and Les Brown recorded
``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio ... we want you on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Streak finally ended on the steamy night of July 17 in
Cleveland's Municipal Stadium before 67,468 fans. The pitchers were
Al Smith and Jim Bagby Jr., but the stopper was the Indians' third
baseman, Ken Keltner, who made two dazzling backhand plays deep
behind third base to rob DiMaggio of hits. It is sometimes
overlooked that DiMaggio was intentionally walked in the fourth
inning of that game, and that he promptly started a 16-game streak
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In 56 games, DiMaggio had gone to bat 223 times and delivered 91
hits for a .408 average, including 15 home runs. He drew 21 walks,
twice was hit by pitched balls, scored 56 runs and knocked in 55.
He hit in every game for two months, and struck out just seven
times.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, fourth in the American League when the streak
began, were six games in front when it ended, and won the pennant
by 17.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was passing milestones in his personal life, too. In
1939, he had married an actress, Dorothy Arnold. In October 1941,
his only child, Josephe Jr., was born. He is survived by his son;
his brother, Dominic; two granddaughters and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1942, DiMaggio enlisted in the Army Air Forces and
spent the next three years teaching baseball in the service. Along
with other baseball stars like Bob Feller and Williams, he resumed
his career as soon as the war ended, returning to the Yankees for
the 1946 season and a year later leading them back into the World
Series. His most dramatic moments came in the season of 1949, after
he was sidelined by bone spurs on his right heel and did not play
until June 26. Then he flew to Boston to join the team in Fenway
Park, hit a single and home run the first two times he went to bat,
hit two more home runs the next day and another the day after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees entered the final two days of that season trailing
the Red Sox by one game. They had to sweep two games in Yankee
Stadium to win the pennant, and they did. There were poignant
moments before the first game when 69,551 fans rocked the stadium
and cheered their hero, who was being honored with a Joe DiMaggio
Day. He was almost too weak to play because of a severe viral
infection, but he did, and he hit a single and double before
removing himself from center field on wobbly legs.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees won yet another World Series in 1951, he
retired and eased into a second career as Joe DiMaggio, legend. It
included cameo roles as a broadcaster, a spring training instructor
with the Yankees and a coach with the Oakland Athletics,
appearances at old timers' games, where he was invariably the last
player introduced, and a larger role, with surprising impact, as a
mellow and credible pitchman on television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   He had long since created an image of a loner both on and off
the playing field, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s when he
lived in hotels in Manhattan and was considered something of a man
about town. He once was characterized by a teammate as the man
``who led the league in room service.'' But he spent many evenings
at Toots Shor's restaurant in Manhattan, where he hid out at a
private table far in the back while Shor protected him from his
public.
</P>
<P>
   But his legend took a storybook turn in 1952, the year after he
retired from the Yankees, when DiMaggio, whose marriage to Dorothy
Arnold had ended in divorce in 1944, arranged a dinner date with
Marilyn Monroe in California. They were married in San Francisco on
Jan. 14, 1954, and spent nine months trying to reconcile their
differences before they divorced in October. DiMaggio always seemed
tortured by Monroe's sex goddess image. He protested loudly during
the making of Billy Wilder's ``The Seven Year Itch'' when the
script called for her to cool herself over a subway grate while a
sudden wind blew her skirts up high.
</P>
<P>
   But when the actress seemed on the verge of an emotional
collapse in 1961, DiMaggio brought her to the Yankees' training
camp in Florida for rest and support. And when she died of an
overdose of barbiturates at the age of 36 on Aug. 4, 1962, he took
charge of her funeral and for the next 20 years sent roses three
times a week to her crypt in the Westwood section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When DiMaggio made an unexpected and dramatic return to the
public scene in the 1970s as a dignified television spokesman for
the Bowery Savings Bank of New York and for Mr. Coffee, a
manufacturer of coffee makers, he did it with remarkable ease for a
man who had been obsessed with privacy, who had once confided that
he always had ``a knot'' in his stomach because he was so shy and
tense.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the stage fright that had rattled him during earlier
sorties into broadcasting. Instead, he was the epitome of
credibility, the graying and trustworthy hero who had hit his home
runs and was now returning to extol the virtues of saving money and
brewing coffee. He promptly became a familiar and comforting
presence for a generation of baseball fans who never saw him play.
</P>
<P>
   For some years he lived in San Francisco with his widowed sister
Marie in a house in the Marina District that he had bought for his
parents in 1939 and that he and his sister had both shared with
Marilyn Monroe. When the damp San Francisco climate troubled the
arthritis in his back, he began to spend most of his time in
Florida, where he established his home. He played golf and made
selected excursions to Europe and the Far East, where the demand
for his appearance and his autograph returned high dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to take the most pleasure in establishing a
children's wing, called the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, at
Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. And he seemed to
relish the invitations back to Yankee Stadium, where he frequently
threw out the first ball on Opening Day, tall but slightly stooped,
dressed elegantly, as always, in a dark business suit, walking to
the mound and lobbing one to the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was there on the day the season ended this year, as the
Yankees set a team record with their 114th victory, that he was
acclaimed on yet another Joe DiMaggio Day, the timeless hero and
the symbol of Yankee excellence, acknowledging the cheers of Yankee
players and fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of cheering that accompanied him through life
and that he had quietly come to expect. It recalled the time when
he and Marilyn Monroe, soon after their wedding, took a trip to
Tokyo. She continued on to entertain American troops in Korea, and
said with fascination when she returned, ``Joe, you've never heard
such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   And Joe DiMaggio replied softly, ``Yes, I have.''

1941 .... A STREAK FOR THE AGES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tommy Henrich walked toward home plate. It was the first inning
of the second game of a doubleheader in 1941, and the Yankees'
right fielder was preparing to face Jack Wilson, the Boston Red Sox
right-hander. Suddenly, Henrich heard a voice behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe comes out,'' Henrich related, ``and the first time in his
life he shouted at me, `Tom, you got my ball bat?' I said, `I got
one of your bats, but it's the one I've been using.' He looked at
it and said, `Someone stole my ball bat.'''
</P>
<P>
   The day before, against the Washington Senators, DiMaggio had
broken George Sisler's American League record by hitting in his 42d
consecutive game. Now he was a hit away from tying Willie Keeler's
major league record of 44 in a season, but he didn't have his game
bat, his 36-ounce, 36-inch weapon of choice.
</P>
<P>
   In his first time up against Wilson, using another of his bats,
DiMaggio lashed a line drive to right-center field that was caught.
``If it had been my ball bat,'' he said to Henrich as they went to
the outfield, ``it would've been in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Henrich suggested to DiMaggio that he use the bat Henrich had
been using. DiMaggio took it in his hands but said, ``I don't want
to use your bat.'' After making another out in his second time up,
though, DiMaggio relented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third time he batted,'' Henrich said, ``he used it and got
a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, Henrich recalled, some fans in Newark
discovered that a young man from their city had somehow stolen the
bat. They reclaimed it and returned it to DiMaggio, and he used it
for the remainder of the most famous streak in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   On July 17 in that fabled season of 1941, Al Smith and Jim Bagby
of Cleveland held DiMaggio without a hit, stopping the streak at 56
games. For all of his greatness during his 13-year career, DiMaggio
will be remembered many years into the future for a record that
many people in baseball feel will never be broken.
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth's career record of 714 home runs was broken, his
season record of 60 and Roger Maris' of 61, too. Someone even came
along and surpassed Lou Gehrig's consecutive-games streak of 2,130,
which people were convinced would never even be approached.
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak? Come back at the end of
the next millennium, many believe, and the line will still be in
the record book: Most Games, Consecutive, 1 or more hits . . . 56,
Joe DiMaggio, NY May 15-July 16, 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that one's going to stand the test of time,'' said
Tony Gwynn, the best hitter of this time. ``But all records are
made to be broken. Someone's going to come along and get on a roll,
at least get close enough to mention Joe DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pete Rose hit in 44 consecutive games in 1978, DiMaggio's
name was mentioned all right, and the challenge proved too great
for Rose, who would end his career with the most hits in history.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 seasons since then, only seven players have reached 30
games, including three the last two years _ Eric Davis, Sandy
Alomar Jr. and Nomar Garciaparra. All three were stopped at
precisely 30. Only one player since Rose has gone beyond 34, and
that was Paul Molitor with 39 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable to watch him and see how he handled
himself,'' Jay Bell said of Molitor. ``If anybody was going to be
able to catch Rose and then DiMaggio, it was going to be Molly, and
he fell short.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, now with the Arizona Diamondbacks, knows about hitting
streaks because in 1992, with the Pittsburgh Pirates, he had the
National League's longest streak. But it was only 22 games long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-two was hard enough,'' Bell said. ``I can't even think
of what it would be like to do 30. If Molly couldn't do it and Rose
couldn't, I don't know that anybody can do it. I can't imagine that
one being broken. It will be tough to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   No one on the Yankees paid much attention to DiMaggio's streak
until he had reached somewhere around 30, Henrich recalled. Then
they took it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was up to 37,'' Henrich related as if it were yesterday,
``and we were facing Eldon Auker. We were ahead by two runs in the
last of the eighth, and DiMaggio is the fourth hitter. Johnny Sturm
is already out, and Red Rolfe is at bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought struck Henrich that if Rolfe reached base, he could
hit into a double play and DiMaggio, who had not had a hit in his
first three times up, would not bat again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Joe McCarthy and said, `If Rolfe gets on, is it OK
if I bunt?''' Henrich recounted. ``McCarthy thought for three or
four seconds and said OK Rolfe got a base on balls, and I bunted.
DiMaggio came up and hit a line drive to right field. That got him
past 37.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, an eight-time batting champion, has never gone past 25.
``And that happened my second year in the big leagues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting streaks are unforgiving. Hitting streaks don't allow
makeups. Fail to hit in one game, the batter starts over. For a
player to match DiMaggio's feat, he has to get at least one hit in
56 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to his mind-boggling 70 home runs, Mark McGwire went
nine games without hitting a home run in late July and early
August, and he hit only two home runs in a longer span of 19 games
in that period. But then he hit 15 home runs in the next 22 games,
breaking Maris' record with the 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have an off day,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   A hitter, Bell said, ``can have four great at-bats during the
course of a game, sting the ball four consecutive times and still
make four outs, so there has to be some luck involved.''
</P>
<P>
   If a game is rained out after five innings and the streaker
doesn't have a hit in two at-bats, his streak is finished because
the game is official.
</P>
<P>
   A home run hitter doesn't have to hit a home run in that game;
he has the next game and more games after that. A player in a
consecutive-game playing streak doesn't have to get a hit; he just
has to show up during the game. Rain-shortened games don't work
against him as long as he is in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually a guy will come along who may possibly break it,''
Gwynn said, ``but the game I see on an everyday basis, I don't see
anyone doing it. The game is so specialized now. If you don't get
it the first at-bat, you see the long man, the setup guy, the
closer. That plus the scrutiny you have to go through if you're
fortunate enough to get close.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, DiMaggio didn't have a slew of reporters, microphones
and cameras dogging his every step before and after every one of
those 56 games. Sammy Sosa seemed to thrive on the attention during
the home run race last season; McGwire did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They barely talk about it until you get to 30,'' Gwynn said.
``Then when you get to 30, they talk about it every day. It's going
to take a guy who's mentally tough, who'll talk about it before the
game and after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio didn't talk about the streak. ``He never mentioned
it,'' Henrich said. ``He wouldn't do that. Certainly he was proud
of what he was doing, but he didn't show it. We didn't talk to him
about it, either. DiMaggio wasn't that type of fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was pressure on DiMaggio during the streak, Henrich
said, it was when it reached the low 40s, as he approached the
records. Henrich wondered how pitchers today would treat a player
threatening DiMaggio's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if some pitcher would do what Johnny Babich was going
to do,'' Henrich said. ``Babich said, `I'll stop him.' He did it by
not throwing the ball over the plate. But McCarthy gave him the hit
sign on 3-0, and he hit a line drive to center and kept it going. I
don't think any pitcher would have the gall not to pitch to a guy
and live with that the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's life has ended, but his streak will live long after
him.

<P>
   For years, Joe DiMaggio had fresh flowers placed at Marilyn
Monroe's grave; now he takes her memory to his grave. During the
baseball memorabilia boom, he sold himself as an icon for the
millions of dollars he never made as a player, but he never sold
his memories of the Hollywood goddess he was married to for 274
days.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a book publisher talked to him about writing his
autobiography, he declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want me to write about Marilyn,'' he once said. ``I don't
want to do that. I'll never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's maintaining your privacy, which Joe DiMaggio did even
better than he played baseball.
</P>
<P>
   You can still see him on television in grainy black-and-white
newsreel film, but only today's old-timers really saw him swing a
bat with that sweeping follow-through and really saw him run down
deep fly balls in Yankee Stadium in the days when center field was
much bigger than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did everything so easily,'' his first Yankee manager, Joe
McCarthy, once said. ``You never saw him make a great catch. You
never saw him dive for a ball. He didn't have to. He was already
there to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   He inspired songs. His 56-game hitting streak prompted Les
Brown's band to record ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio.'' Paul Simon sang,
``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   He even inspired literature. In Ernest Hemingway's ``Old Man and
the Sea,'' the old Cuban fisherman says: ``I would like to take the
great DiMaggio fishing. They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe
he was as poor as we are and would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's father had come over from Sicily and settled in
Martinez, Calif., where the great DiMaggio was born across the bay
from San Francisco. He would have a 61-game hitting streak as an
18-year-old outfielder for the San Francisco Seals in the Pacific
Coast League before joining the Yankees in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would get The San Francisco Chronicle at 5 in the
morning,'' he once said. ``If I had a good day, he'd wake my mother
up. If I didn't, he'd let her sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother was usually awakened. In 13 seasons interrupted by
three years in the Army for World War II, he batted .325 with 361
homers and 1,573 runs batted in as the Yankees won 10 American
League pennants and nine World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walked into the clubhouse, the lights flickered,''
Pete Sheehy, the legendary Yankee clubhouse man, often said. ``Then
he'd turn to me and say, `Half a cup.'''
</P>
<P>
   He meant half a cup of coffee. Years later he emerged as ``
Coffee,'' shilling for a coffee maker, and as a longtime spokesman
for the Bowery Savings Bank. Although not yet 33 after the 1951
season, he had turned down the Yankees' offer to continue his
$100,000 salary even as a part-time player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer Joe DiMaggio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's maintaining your pride, as he did the night his 56-game
hitting streak was stopped in Cleveland when Ken Keltner played a
deep third base for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keltner was daring me to bunt,'' he once said. ``I hadn't
bunted during the streak.''
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't bunt that night as Keltner turned two sizzling
grounders into outs.
</P>
<P>
   In the years when the St. Louis Browns were in the American
League, DiMaggio was sitting in the dugout at steaming Sportsman's
Park before a Sunday afternoon doubleheader when he was asked how
he was always able to perform at such a high level. He gestured
toward the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some of these people,'' he said quietly, ``never saw me
play before.''
</P>
<P>
   That's maintaining your ego, which all the great ones have, with
dignity. His teammate Bobby Brown, later the American League
president, best described DiMaggio's blend of ego with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe goes through life scared to death people will ask for his
autograph,'' Brown said. ``And scared to death they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   He could laugh, too. He often told about the time he hit a home
run off Bobo Newsom's fastball. Connie Mack, the Philadelphia A's
manager, ordered Newsom never to throw DiMaggio a fastball again.
His next time up, he hit a curveball for another homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I rounded third base,'' he remembered, ``I heard Bobo yell,
`Hey, Mack, he hit yours farther than he hit mine.'''
</P>
<P>
   But now Joe DiMaggio, fulfilling Paul Simon's song, has really
``left and gone away.'' And taken Marilyn Monroe with him.

<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the flawless center fielder for the New York
Yankees who, along with Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, symbolized the
team's dynastic greatness across the 20th century and whose 56-game
hitting streak in 1941 made him an instant and indelible American
folk hero, died early Monday at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   He had recently spent more than three months at Memorial
Regional Hospital in Hollywood, undergoing surgery for lung cancer
last Oct. 14.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has idolized and immortalized its 20th-century
heroes, from Charles Lindbergh to Elvis Presley, no one embodied
the American dream of fame and fortune or created a more enduring
legend than Joe DiMaggio. He became a figure of unequaled romance
and integrity in the national mind because of his consistent
professionalism on the baseball field, his marriage to the
Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, his devotion to her after her death,
and the pride and courtliness with which he carried himself
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio burst onto the baseball scene from San Francisco in the
1930s and grew into the game's most gallant and graceful center
fielder. He wore No. 5 and became the successor to Babe Ruth (No.
3) and Lou Gehrig (No. 4) in the team's pantheon. DiMaggio was the
team's superstar for 13 seasons, beginning in 1936 and ending in
1951, and appeared in 11 All-Star Games and 10 World Series. He
was, as Roy Blount Jr. once observed, ``the class of the Yankees in
times when the Yankees outclassed everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He was called the Yankee Clipper and was acclaimed at baseball's
centennial in 1969 as ``the greatest living ballplayer,'' the man
who in 1,736 games with the Yankees had a career batting average of
.325 and hit 361 home runs while striking out only 369 times, one
of baseball's most amazing statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's game was so complete and elegant that it
transcended statistics; as The New York Times said in an editorial
when he retired, ``The combination of proficiency and exquisite
grace which Joe DiMaggio brought to the art of playing center field
was something no baseball averages can measure and that must be
seen to be believed and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   At his peak, he was serenaded as ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio'' and
summoned as ``the great DiMaggio'' by Ernest Hemingway in ``The Old
Man and the Sea.'' He was mentioned in dozens of films and Broadway
shows; the sailors in ``South Pacific'' sing that Bloody Mary's
skin is ``tender as DiMaggio's glove.'' Years later he was
remembered by Paul Simon, who wondered with everybody else, ``Where
have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? Our nation turns its lonely eyes to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   When injuries eroded his skills and he could no longer perform
to his own standard, he turned his back on his $100,000 salary _ he
and his rival Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox then drew the
largest paychecks in sports _ and retired in 1951 with the dignity
that remained his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio joined the Yankees in 1936, missed three years while he
served in the Army Air Forces in World War II, then returned and
played through the 1951 season, when Mickey Mantle arrived to open
yet another era in the remarkable run of Yankee success. In his 13
seasons, DiMaggio went to bat 6,821 times in 1,736 regular-season
games, got 2,214 hits for a .325 average, hit 361 home runs,
knocked in 1,537 runs, amassed 3,948 total bases and reached base
just under 40 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Three times DiMaggio was voted his league's most valuable
player: in 1939, 1941 and 1947. In 1941, the magical season of his
56-game hitting streak, he won the award even though Williams hit
.406.
</P>
<P>
   In each of his first four seasons with the Yankees, DiMaggio
played in the World Series, and the Yankees won all four. He
appeared in the Series 10 times in 13 seasons over all, and nine
times the Yankees won. And although he failed to get enough votes
to make the baseball Hall of Fame when he became eligible in 1953,
perhaps because his aloofness had alienated some of the writers who
did the voting, he sailed into Cooperstown two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Dimaggio married an actress, Dorothy Arnold. In October
1941, his only child, Joe Jr., was born. He is survived by his son;
his brother, Dominic; two granddaughters and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1942, DiMaggio enlisted in the Army Air Forces and
spent the next three years teaching baseball in the service. Along
with other baseball stars like Bob Feller and Williams, he resumed
his career as soon as the war ended, returning to the Yankees for
the 1946 season and a year later leading them back into the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   His legend took a storybook turn in 1952, the year after he
retired from the Yankees, when DiMaggio, whose marriage to Dorothy
Arnold had ended in divorce in 1944, arranged a dinner date with
Marilyn Monroe in California. They were married in San Francisco on
Jan. 14, 1954, and spent nine months trying to reconcile their
differences before they divorced in October. DiMaggio always seemed
tortured by Monroe's sex goddess image. He protested loudly during
the making of Billy Wilder's ``The Seven Year Itch'' when the
script called for her to cool herself over a subway grate while a
sudden wind blew her skirts up high.
</P>
<P>
   But when the actress seemed on the verge of an emotional
collapse in 1961, DiMaggio brought her to the Yankees' training
camp in Florida for rest and support. And when she died of an
overdose of barbiturates at the age of 36 on Aug. 4, 1962, he took
charge of her funeral and for the next 20 years sent roses three
times a week to her crypt in the Westwood section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For some years he lived in San Francisco with his widowed sister
Marie in a house in the Marina District that he had bought for his
parents in 1939 and that he and his sister had both shared with
Marilyn Monroe. When the damp San Francisco climate troubled the
arthritis in his back, he began to spend most of his time in
Florida, where he established his home. He played golf and made
selected excursions to Europe and the Far East, where the demand
for his appearance and his autograph returned high dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to take the most pleasure in establishing a
children's wing, called the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, at
Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. And he seemed to
relish the invitations back to Yankee Stadium, where he frequently
threw out the first ball on Opening Day, tall but slightly stooped,
dressed elegantly, as always, in a dark business suit, walking to
the mound and lobbing one to the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was there on the day the season ended this year, as the
Yankees set a team record with their 114th victory, that he was
acclaimed on yet another Joe DiMaggio Day, the timeless hero and
the symbol of Yankee excellence, acknowledging the cheers of Yankee
players and fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of cheering that accompanied him through life
and that he had quietly come to expect. It recalled the time when
he and Marilyn Monroe, soon after their wedding, took a trip to
Tokyo. She continued on to entertain American troops in Korea, and
said with fascination when she returned, ``Joe, you've never heard
such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   And Joe DiMaggio replied softly, ``Yes, I have.''

<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the flawless center fielder for the New York
Yankees who, along with Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, symbolized the
team's dynastic greatness across the 20th century and whose 56-game
hitting streak in 1941 made him an instant and indelible American
folk hero, died early Monday at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   He had recently spent more than three months at Memorial
Regional Hospital in Hollywood, undergoing surgery for lung cancer
last Oct. 14.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has idolized and immortalized its 20th-century
heroes, from Charles Lindbergh to Elvis Presley, no one embodied
the American dream of fame and fortune or created a more enduring
legend than Joe DiMaggio. He became a figure of unequaled romance
and integrity in the national mind because of his consistent
professionalism on the baseball field, his marriage to the
Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, his devotion to her after her death,
and the pride and courtliness with which he carried himself
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio burst onto the baseball scene from San Francisco in the
1930s and grew into the game's most gallant and graceful center
fielder. He wore No. 5 and became the successor to Babe Ruth (No.
3) and Lou Gehrig (No. 4) in the team's pantheon. DiMaggio was the
team's superstar for 13 seasons, beginning in 1936 and ending in
1951, and appeared in 11 All-Star Games and 10 World Series. He
was, as Roy Blount Jr. once observed, ``the class of the Yankees in
times when the Yankees outclassed everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He was called the Yankee Clipper and was acclaimed at baseball's
centennial in 1969 as ``the greatest living ballplayer,'' the man
who in 1,736 games with the Yankees had a career batting average of
.325 and hit 361 home runs while striking out only 369 times, one
of baseball's most amazing statistics. (By way of comparison,
Mickey Mantle had 536 homers and struck out 1,710 times; Reggie
Jackson slugged 563 homers and struck out 2,597 times.)
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's game was so complete and elegant that it
transcended statistics; as The New York Times said in an editorial
when he retired, ``The combination of proficiency and exquisite
grace which Joe DiMaggio brought to the art of playing center field
was something no baseball averages can measure and that must be
seen to be believed and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio glided across the vast expanse of center field at
Yankee Stadium with such incomparable grace that long after he
stopped playing, the memory of him in full stride remains
evergreen. He disdained theatrical flourishes and exaggerated
moves, never climbing walls to make catches and rarely diving
headlong. He got to the ball just as it fell into his glove, making
the catch seem inevitable, almost preordained. The writer Wilfred
Sheed wrote, ``In dreams I can still see him gliding after fly
balls as if he were skimming the surface of the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   His batting stance was as graceful as his outfield stride. He
stood flat-footed at the plate with his feet spread well apart, his
bat held still just off his right shoulder. When he swung, his
left, or front, foot moved only slightly foward. His swing was pure
and flowing with an incredible follow-through; Casey Stengel said,
``He made the rest of them look like plumbers.''
</P>
<P>
   At his peak, he was serenaded as ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio'' by Les
Brown and saluted as ``the great DiMaggio'' by Ernest Hemingway in
``The Old Man and the Sea.'' He was mentioned in dozens of films
and Broadway shows; the sailors in ``South Pacific'' sing that
Bloody Mary's skin is ``tender as DiMaggio's glove.'' Years later
he was remembered by Paul Simon, who wondered with everybody else,
``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? Our nation turns its lonely
eyes to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to anything written, spoken or sung about him, he
confessed that he was puzzled by Simon's lyrics and sought an
answer when he met Simon in a restaurant in New York. ``I asked
Paul what the song meant, whether it was derogatory,'' DiMaggio
recalled. ``He explained it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When injuries eroded his skills and he could no longer perform
to his own standard, he turned his back on his $100,000 salary _ he
and his rival Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox then drew the
largest paychecks in sports _ and retired in 1951 with the dignity
that remained his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   His stormy marriage to Marilyn Monroe lasted less than a year,
but they remained one of America's ultimate romantic fantasies: the
tall, dark and handsome baseball hero wooing and winning the woman
who epitomized Hollywood beauty, glamour and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   He was private and remote. Even Monroe, at their divorce
proceedings, said he was given to black moods and would tell her,
``Leave me alone.'' He once said, with disdain, that he kept track
of all the books written about his storied life without his
consent, and by the late 1990s knew that the count had passed 33.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he could be proud, reclusive and vain in such a composed,
almost studied way that his reclusiveness contributed to his
mystique. In the book ``Summer of '49,'' David Halberstam wrote
that DiMaggio ``guards his special status carefully, wary of doing
anything that might tarnish his special reputation. He tends to
avoid all those who might define him in some way other than the way
he defined himself on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio joined the Yankees in 1936, missed three years while he
served in the Army Air Forces in World War II, then returned and
played through the 1951 season, when Mickey Mantle arrived to open
yet another era in the remarkable run of Yankee success. In his 13
seasons, DiMaggio went to bat 6,821 times, got 2,214 hits, knocked
in 1,537 runs, amassed 3,948 total bases and reached base just
under 40 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, baseball fans argued over who was the better pure
hitter, DiMaggio or Williams. Long after they had both retired,
Williams said: ``In my heart, I always felt I was a better hitter
than Joe. But I have to say, he was the greatest baseball player of
our time. He could do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did it all with a sureness and coolness that seemed to
imply an utter lack of emotion. DiMaggio was once asked why he did
not vent his frustrations on the field by kicking a bag or tossing
a bat. The outfielder, who chain-smoked cigarettes and had suffered
from ulcers, replied: ``I can't. It wouldn't look right.''
</P>
<P>
   But he betrayed his sensitivity in a memorable gesture of
annoyance in the sixth game of the 1947 World Series after his long
drive was run down and caught in front of the 415-foot sign in
left-center field at Yankee Stadium by Al Gionfriddo of the
Brooklyn Dodgers. As DiMaggio rounded first base, he saw Gionfriddo
make the catch and, with his head down, kicked the dirt. The angry
gesture was so shocking that it made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In the field, DiMaggio ran down long drives with a gliding
stride and deep range. In 1947, he tied what was then the American
League fielding record for outfielders by making only one error in
141 games. He also had one of the most powerful and precise
throwing arms in the business and was credited with 153 assists in
his 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime manager, Joe McCarthy, once touched on another
DiMaggio skill. ``He was the best base runner I ever saw,''
McCarthy said. ``He could have stolen 50, 60 bases a year if I let
him. He wasn't the fastest man alive. He just knew how to run bases
better than anybody.''

KUBRICK: THE RECLUSIVE MOVIEMAKING GENIUS 
</HEADLINE>
  By IVOR DAVIS 
 World rights 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If Stanley Kubrick had never been born, a masochistic Hollywood
would have had to invent him: A remote and godlike figure with a
formidable intellect and a cold heart, who every 10 years or so
made a movie his way just to show up the dummies in Los Angeles for
the money-grabbing, yes men he thought they were.
 &HT;    Kubrick died Sunday at the age of 70 in his home outside London
leaving a $100-million legacy_his latest film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
a psychological thriller starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman
which is due to open in July, two years later than expected.
 &HT;    Steven Spielberg called him ``The grand master of filmmaking. He
copied no one while we scrambled to catch up with him.''
 &HT;    The eccentric director of such unforgettable films as ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (l964), ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (l968) and ``A
Clockwork Orange'' (l971), made movies his way. It is ironic that
producers of the Oscars are now scrambling to do a segment for the
awards ceremony, which airs March 21, while in his lifetime Kubrick
paid scant attention to Hollywood.
 &HT;    In l997, all of film town turned out to honor Kubrick with the
D.W. Griffith Award from the Directors Guild of America, putting
him in the company of Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock and Akira
Kurosawa. That night Kubrick was 6,000 miles away in England. He
sent them a taped thank you.
 &HT;    He hasn't set foot in his native United States since 1968. He
lived with his third wife, German artist Christiane, in
Childwickbury Manor, Hertfordshire. One reason he kept his distance
from Hollywood is his refusal to fly. He was most comfortable on a
bicycle. Despite having been nominated for an Oscar countless times
he never won the statuette and seemed happiest when he was furthest
from other filmmakers.
 &HT;    His life was a bundle of contradictions: A man in love with
technology and the future who was not even a comfortable passenger
in an automobile; a licensed pilot who wouldn't step into an
airplane; a Jew married to a woman who as a child was a member of a
Hitler youth group.
 &HT;    In an interview with Playboy magazine in 1960 he attributed his
fear of flying and his other phobias to his growing sense of the
fragility of life and his own mortality, an obsession which he
shared with that other great though very different auteur
filmmaker, Woody Allen.
 &HT;    ``This shattering recognition of our own mortality,'' he told
the magazine, ``is at the root of far more mental illness than I
suspect even psychiatrists are aware.''
 &HT;    Despite the fact that his work was often dark, pessimistic, even
misanthropic, his films were wildly anticipated by film buffs and
seldom disappointing. His last released film was ``Full Metal
Jacket'' (1987).
 &HT;    His ``Eyes Wide Shut'' was supposed to be shot in a year. But
Kubrick shot the film for over two years_calling the stars back to
England for countless new scenes. He ordered his stars to say only
that the picture was about sexual obsession and jealousy.
 &HT;    ``Mr. Kubrick has written that line down for us,'' Kidman said,
``and that's all we are allowed to say. If I say anything else I'll
get in trouble.''
 &HT;    The rumor mill of course has been working overtime. Is the story
really about Cruise and Kidman themselves? Does Cruise, the darling
of the American box office, actually appear in one scene in a
dress?
 &HT;    But the question that interested Kubrick fans worldwide was why
it took so long for him to work again. The answer was as simple as
bad luck_and maybe even worse timing.
 &HT;    Kubrick planned to come back to the screen early in the '90s
with a pet project, his take on the Nazi era and the German sweep
across Europe. He was well into the planning phase of shooting his
epic in Denmark when Steven Spielberg's ``Schindler's List'' came
along, and Kubrick dropped his project like a hot blini.
 &HT;    It was a question of ``once bitten.'' In 1986 Oliver Stone's
Vietnam film ``Platoon'' picked up seven Oscars and took the shine
off Kubrick's ``Full Metal Jacket'' which came out a year later.
Though many critics thought ``Jacket'' the more profound of the two
films, the public response was disappointing.
 &HT;    Such perhaps were the penalties of working so far from the
mainstream. A biographer, New York-based film teacher Vincent
Lobrutto, admitted he never got to meet Kubrick: ``I wrote to him
but he never responded. I've always appreciated that he didn't make
it difficult for me to talk to other people about him.''
 &HT;    Lobrutto has great admiration for Kubrick. ``He is arguably one
of the greatest film directors ever,'' he says. ``What he does is
create his own world. People don't understand him as a person.
There's a lot of The Bronx in him. All the myths and rumors spread
on the Internet about how remote he is, how he doesn't communicate
with the outside world, I found it to be the opposite. He does
contact people but only in connection with his films. His entire
life is funneled into his films.''
 &HT;    The cast in ``Full Metal Jacket'' was taken to an abandoned
factory on the edge of London, had their heads shaved and were
drilled and humiliated for weeks in best Marine style before they
even began rehearsals.
 &HT;    Top actors still want to work with Kubrick for the chance to be
part of cinema history. Cruise said recently of ``Eyes Wide Shut'':
``It's just a damned miracle that he wanted me and Nic to do
this.''
 &HT;    Kubrick was an original offscreen as well as on. His defiance of
the conventional and the bureaucratic was consistent. Former Marine
drill instructor Lee Ermy, who starred in ``Full Metal Jacket,''
tells of how he learned his lines as he was pelted with tennis
balls and oranges by a Kubrick aide to improve his concentration.
 &HT;    Ermy also remembers scouting locations with Kubrick in a new
$50,000 Mercedes. ``Stanley spotted a place. He got so excited he
turned the car over in a ditch with us all trapped inside. Totally
ignoring us, he clambered out yelling, 'Mark that spot. That's the
one I want.'''
 &HT;    In Kubrick's world one played by the maestro's rules, which
meant long, long hours of rehearsal, all of it videotaped, followed
by more long hours of discussion over what the tape reveals.
 &HT;    ``When people say, 'Oh Stanley is so controlling, he doesn't
allow anything, he makes all the decisions.' It's not so,'' Kidman
says. ``He's actually quite open. He creates an environment where
obviously it's the director and his vision. But he wants to hear
your ideas. He's so very into improvisation and working together.
He listens and then obviously, he makes the decisions and guides
you.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Feb. 27, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

 &HT;    What does it take to win an Oscar?
 &HT;    Well, if you're an actor it helps to be very, very good. But to
a considerable extent what counts is not what you do but what your
character does. Certain lines of work are much more Oscar-worthy
than others.
 &HT;    Given the choice between a physician and an insurance adjustor,
for example, go with the doctor _ if Edward G. Robinson didn't get
even a nomination for ``Double Indemnity'' (1944), chances are no
insurance man will ever win a statuette.
 &HT;    Likewise, pick the whore with a heart of gold over the airline
stewardess, and the self-sacrificing mother over nearly any other
job you can think of.
 &HT;    So, in a year in which jobs such as beleaguered G.I., ruler of
England and classical musician seem to be on the upswing, test your
knowledge of past occupational pluses and minuses with this handy
quiz. 
 -0- 
 HEART OF GOLD OPTIONAL  
 &HT;    This is a rare year in which no woman has been nominated for
playing a prostitute. But playing ``bad girls'' has been a good way
for actresses to hook up with Oscar since Helen Hayes first
committed ``The Sin of Madelon Claudet'' (1931).
 &HT;    But what about these other performances involving the oldest
profession?
 &HT;    1. Call girl Bree Daniel was an Oscar-winning role in a 1971
film named after the detective investigating her. Who was the
actress, and what was the movie?
 &HT;    2. Before she became a demure television mom, Shirley Jones was
good-girl-gone-bad Lulu Bains in what 1960 film?
 &HT;    3. ``Butterfield 8'' (1960) took its name from a call girl's
telephone number. Name the Oscar-winning actress and the character.
 &HT;    4. Woody Allen discovers that his adopted son was the biological
child of a prostitute in a 1995 film which he wrote and directed.
Name the film, and also the actress _ daughter of another
well-known actor _ who took home an Oscar.
 &HT;    5. Jo Van Fleet deserts her son to become a madam _ and an Oscar
winner _ in a 1955 film. What was the film, and who played the son?
 ORDER IN THE COURT  
 &HT;    John Travolta and Robert Duvall both hoped to be the latest in a
line of Oscar-winning attorneys for their work in ``A Civil
Action'' (1998), but only Duvall was nominated, as Best Supporting
Actor.
 &HT;    The odds were always better for defense attorney Duvall than for
plaintiff's attorney Travolta, however: All the Oscar-winning
lawyers were male defense attorneys _ no prosecutors need apply,
nor any women.
 &HT;    If you love movies, you should overrule any objection to
answering these:
 &HT;    6. Walter Matthau won a Best Supporting Actor statuette as
disreputable lawyer Willie Gingrich in 1966. What was the movie,
and what was his area of practice?
 &HT;    7. Attorney Hans Rolfe, defending accused Nazis in 1961's
``Judgment at Nuremberg,'' won an Oscar for which actor?
 &HT;    8. The Best Actor award for 1993 went to an actor who played
attorney Andrew Beckett in a film named after Beckett's city of
residence. Name the actor and the film.
 &HT;    9. Gregory Peck became the screen's iconic lawyer as the hero of
a 1962 adaptation of a classic novel. Name the movie and the
character.
 &HT;    10. In ``A Free Soul'' (1931), lawyer Stephen Ashe delivers the
longest uninterrupted monologue in American film history. What
actor won the Oscar for his pains?
 WRITER'S BLOC  
 &HT;    It was an upset when Joseph Fiennes didn't get nominated as the
title character in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' since screenwriters
naturally do well depicting other writers.
 &HT;    Can you place these other, luckier actors who played writers?
 &HT;    11. What actor had a tough time, as author Don Birnam, getting
through ``The Lost Weekend'' (1945), and why?
 &HT;    12. Who won his only statue as a reporter chasing a story from
Florida to New York in a 1934 comedy classic?
 &HT;    13. What actor won his only Oscar as a tabloid reporter in ``The
Philadelphia Story'' (1940), and what did the character really want
to do?
 &HT;    14. What real-life author did Jason Robards portray in 1977's
``Julia?''
 &HT;    15. George Sanders won as a cynical theater columnist in the
Best Picture of 1950. What was it?
 ACTING UP  
 &HT;    The Academy seems to favor performers who play stage actors over
those who play screen actors, perhaps because the latter hits too
close to home. So, at least, the theory has gone since the snubbing
of the classic ``Sunset Boulevard'' (1950).
 &HT;    Can you pick up on the following cues?
 &HT;    16. Who won for playing an actor in 1977's ``The Goodbye Girl,''
and what role did he play within the movie?
 &HT;    17. Who won a Best Actor award in 1947 for playing an actor
consumed by his onstage persona in ``A Double Life,'' and what role
did he play within the movie?
 &HT;    18. Who won as a hammy stage diva in ``Bullets Over Broadway''
(1994)?
 &HT;    19. What real-life actor did Martin Landau portray in ``Ed
Wood'' (1994), and what film was he making at the end of the movie?
 &HT;    20. What noteworthy actress won her first Oscar as a young
actress in ``Morning Glory'' (1933)?
 AND THE FIELD  
 &HT;    21. Name the only Oscar-winner ever to cop a statue for playing
an accountant.
 &HT;    22. What actress won an Oscar as a maid-turned-congresswoman?
 &HT;    23. Who won the Best Actor Oscar for playing a butcher?
 &HT;    24. Who won a Best Actress Oscar as a janitor?
 &HT;    25. Who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar as a valet?
 -0-

 &HT;    2. Shirley Jones won an Oscar as Lulu Bains in ``Elmer Gantry''
(1960).
 &HT;    3. Elizabeth Taylor played prostitute Gloria Wandrous in
``Butterfield 8.''

 MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY: ONE SPECIAL `ED'  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Matthew McConaughey in a scene from
``EDtv.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Life in the fast lane actually began in an express lane.
 &HT;    Matthew McConaughey was in a Texas A&AMP;P store the first time he
really felt famous.
 &HT;    ``I was getting some produce and I went to the quickie checkout
line,'' the actor recalls. ``Suddenly I was staring at myself on
the cover of Vanity Fair.''
 &HT;    McConaughey approached the checkout girl, who didn't bother to
look up. He tossed down the magazine near the register and said,
``Good-looking kid, huh?''
 &HT;    ``Oh yeah,'' the girl gushed. ``He's really a babe.''
 &HT;    Then she looked up into those steel-blue eyes and nearly passed
out.
 &HT;    ``I said, `Darlin', I'll be buying that magazine,''' he recalls
with a chuckle.
 &HT;    The checkout girl exclaimed, ``I'll be buying one, too.''
 &HT;    Three years later, the only thing that hasn't changed is
McConaughey's laid-back attitude. He's been up in Hollywood, and
he's been down. He's been on every cover and in every magazine.
 &HT;    Now he's Ed in ``EDtv,'' a guy who consents to have his entire
life filmed for a television show _ a subject about which
McConaughey knows a little something.
 &HT;    The Texan actor arrives for a day of interviews at the San
Francisco Ritz-Carlton wearing tight, faded jeans and a T-shirt
that reads, ``I Survived Matthew's Birthday Party and All I Got Was
This Lousy T-shirt.''
 &HT;    Just turned 30, McConaughey tosses off a beaming smile and sits
down. He's got those same deep-blue eyes and the same molasses-slow
drawl as ever _ the only thing missing is what used to be a head of
luscious brown locks, now replaced by half-inch stubble.
 &HT;    And no, it isn't for ``U-571,'' the submarine movie he's
currently filming.
 &HT;    ``I actually cut it all off before signing for the film,'' he
admits. ``I just get these hankerings.''
 &HT;    The former hair is still on display in ``EDtv,'' the Ron Howard
film set to open on March 26. It's a quirky film, sort of the flip
side to ``The Truman Show'' (1998), and McConaughey is very high on
it.
 &HT;    ``I think this movie is about how the public thinks they can
interfere in the life of someone who is famous,'' McConaughey says.
``It's like if you come into someone's living room or if you're up
on that big screen, people feel like they know you. They don't know
you, but they still have an opinion on what your life should be.
They have an opinion on who you should date. Your life becomes a
real-life soap opera.''
 &HT;    McConaughey speaks from experience. Ever since he caught the
public eye in ``A Time to Kill'' (1996) _ in fact, as soon as he
was cast _ he has been a fan magnet.
 &HT;    ``I remember walking through the Third Street Promenade in Los
Angeles the Friday afternoon that `A Time to Kill' came out,'' he
recalls. ``Out of 1,000 people, I'd say 999 ignored me _ they
didn't even look at me.''
 &HT;    Three days later, he walked down the same street.
 &HT;    ``Suddenly 999 people were staring at me,'' the actor says. ``It
was very unnerving. I was like, `What's going on?' In an instant my
life had changed, and suddenly I wasn't comfortable.''
 &HT;    The press has relentlessly tried to dig into his personal life,
which McConaughey insists on keeping private. A particular focus
has been his relationship with Sandra Bullock, his ``Time to Kill''
co-star and, since last year, fellow resident of Austin, Texas.
Both have repeatedly said that they're friends and nothing more.
 &HT;    ``Sandra and I laugh about the rumors,'' he says. ``Sandy and I
say, `If all the talk was true, I guess we have five kids by now
and we've been married a couple of times.'
 &HT;    ``I do want to get married someday,'' he adds, ``but right now
I'm having a good time. I live in Texas, Louisiana and Los Angeles.
I like to wander around in my van with my dog _ I'm not ready to
settle down yet. If it happens, it happens.''
 &HT;    If it does, McConaughey has plenty of good role models for
settling down. He grew up the youngest of three brothers in Uvalde,
Texas, where his father was in the oil business and his mother was
a teacher.
 &HT;    ``My parents had a real love affair and created a warm group,''
he recalls. ``We were a family in cutoffs, building tree houses.''
 &HT;    As a child, he adds, he cared more about football than about
acting.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't a dramatic kid,'' he says. ``You weren't really
allowed that many moods in our family. If you came to breakfast
with a frown on your face, Mom would pop the table.''
 &HT;    He smacks the coffee table to demonstrate.
 &HT;    ``Mom would say, `What's your problem?''' he recalls. ``You'd
see the dust on the table flying. And Mom would say, `Go back to
bed, get up and start over, young man.'''
 &HT;    McConaughey enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin, where
he was a psychology and philosophy major heading toward law school.
 &HT;    ``Law school was something I was expected to do,'' McConaughey
says. ``I could understand why my parents wanted me to become a
lawyer, I could justify it to myself _ but I wasn't sleeping well
with it. I didn't have this passion for it.''
 &HT;    Instead he wound up playing lawyers in ``A Time to Kill'' and
``Amistad'' (1998). He'd already changed his major to directing for
his junior year when another option came to the fore, in the form
of a role in the low-budget ``Dazed and Confused'' (1993).
 &HT;    McConaughey took to acting like a duck to water.
 &HT;    ``I just fell in love with it,'' he says. ``I appreciated that
it was an art.''
 &HT;    A couple of years spent scuffling for his next big role ended
when novelist John Grisham vetoed Woody Harrelson as the star of
the film version of his book, ``A Time to Kill.'' Director Joel
Schumacher decided to try a new face, and suddenly McConaughey was
on the cover of that supermarket Vanity Fair.
 &HT;    ``I made an immediately splash with this intense kind of boom
and all this hype,'' he says. ``It's like I had a banner on me
saying, `Here's the New Guy.' I had to prove myself as an actor.''
 &HT;    That wasn't always easy. ``Contact'' (1997) did big box office,
but ``The Newton Boys'' (1998) flopped. ``Amistad'' was more
successful, but still counted as a disappointment.
 &HT;    ``I had all the hoopla when I started acting,'' McConaughey says
matter-of-factly. ``It's only natural that I would have a drop. All
I can say is that I did some films I was really happy about, and I
was proud to be a part of them.''
 &HT;    Next up is the World War II submarine film ``U-571,''
co-starring Bill Paxton and Jon Bon Jovi. After that, McConaughey
hopes to finally tackle a long-delayed role as motorcycle-stunt
star Evel Knievel.
 &HT;    In the meantime, though, he'll settle for being able to make
movies and at the same time live a somewhat private life. Which
doesn't mean that he doesn't like to meet his fans once in a while.
 &HT;    ``There's still a `Dazed and Confused' subculture that's kind of
the coolest group to get recognized by,'' he says.
 &HT;    Are they conscious?
 &HT;    ``Just enough,'' McConaughey says, laughing. ``I was in a pub in
Amsterdam and someone across the room screamed, `I think I just
heard that Matthew guy, man.'
 &HT;    ``Another guy said, `Man, you sound just like this guy in this
film, ``Dazed and Confused.'' You don't look like him, but you
sound just like him.'
 &HT;    ``I just said, `Nah, you've had too much to drink.'''

 Includes a color slide of Big Bird and assorted Muppets in a scene
from the children's television series, ``Sesame Street.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Muppets, where are you?'' Max Spelling asks. ``I think you're
hiding.''
 &HT;    Max, age 3, has been pacing the halls of the Kaufman-Astoria
Studios in Queens, N.Y., for 15 minutes, and if he has to wait
another second he'll burst. He wants to meet Big Bird, Elmo and
Rosita.
 &HT;    Finally, a Children's Television Workshop publicist emerges from
an elevator.
 &HT;    ``Who's your favorite Muppet?'' the publicist asks.
 &HT;    ``All of them,'' Max says instantly. ``I love all of them.''
 &HT;    Down a couple of halls and through a few doors we walk, with Max
growing increasingly excited. And then ...
 &HT;    ``Hey, Daddy!'' Max shouts, his eyes open wide. ``Look!''
 &HT;    Before him stands the beloved ``Sesame Street'' universe.
There's Maria's Fix-It Shop, Mr. Hooper's store, the famous 123
Sesame Street stoop, Oscar the Grouch's garbage can and Big Bird's
nest.
 &HT;    ``This is so cool,'' Max says breathlessly.
 &HT;    Over in an area called The Arbor, the ``Sesame Street''
production crew is preparing to shoot a scene featuring Big Bird,
three children dressed as ``birdkateers,'' two Muppets _ Tully and
Rosita _ and Maria, a human character played for 27 years by
actress Sonia Manzano. They're rehearsing a scene in which Bolo the
parrot is trying to learn the ``A-B-C'' song.
 &HT;    Max races over to Manzano.
 &HT;    ``Do you remember me?'' he asks. ``I see you on the television
all the time.''
 &HT;    ``Sure, hi, how are you?'' Manzano says with equal enthusiasm.
``I'm glad you could come today.''
 &HT;    Max sits down to watch everyone work, and everyone prays that
Max doesn't ruin any takes by laughing, whining or trying to help
Bolo sing.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' the director says. ``Let's bird up.''
 &HT;    And with that Caroll Spinney, the man inside the Big Bird
costume, dons Big Bird's head. The puppeteers operating Bolo,
Rosita and Tully assume their positions beneath a table.
 &HT;    They perform the scene several times. At one point, Big Bird
flubs a line.
 &HT;    ``Oh, poo,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``You said `Poo!''' Rosita says, as puppeteer Carmen Osbahr
laughs in character.
 &HT;    ``I'm so embarrassed,'' Big Bird says, burying his head in his
feathers.
 &HT;    Max smiles and laughs along with everyone else, not realizing
that he's just witnessed an outtake never to be seen on television.
Ever.
 &HT;    Fortunately, there are thousands of charming, thoughtful,
amusing and educational moments to be found in the nearly 4,000
``Sesame Street'' episodes aired to date. And, hard as it may be to
believe, ``Sesame Street'' celebrates its 30th anniversary this
year, with no end in sight.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, two generations of children have been raised on
``Sesame Street.'' The show has won 71 Emmys and spawned countless
spinoff products. It reaches 10 million American viewers a week,
and airs in 38 other countries as well.
 &HT;    This year, the show introduced a new 15-minute, stand-alone
segment, ``Elmo's World,'' while the Muppets _ created by the late
puppeteer Jim Henson _ are appearing in ``A Brief History of Motion
Pictures,'' a two-minute short running in movie theaters
nationwide.
 &HT;    Why keep fiddling with something so successful?
 &HT;    ``We revamp it every year,'' says Joan Ganz Cooney, CTW
co-founder and originator of ``Sesame Street'' and its classic
sibling, ``Electric Company.''
 &HT;    ``Constantly changing the show is a big reason why it's an
evergreen,'' she adds, speaking by telephone from her home in
Southampton, N.Y. ```Sesame Street' remains the only children's
show that's truly curriculum-based and researched every year to
make sure it's doing what we want it to do and what it should be
doing.
 &HT;    ``I think the characters are so impactful on children,'' Cooney
says. ``The Muppets are real to children and they're devoted to
Elmo, Big Bird and Cookie Monster. The genius of Jim Henson was to
infuse the Muppets with human qualities, and that creates a
devotion children don't quite have to other characters like the
Teletubbies or Barney.''
 &HT;    The computer generation is as interested in ``Sesame Street'' as
were the children of 1969, Cooney believes.
 &HT;    ``Children still like to learn, and they know `Sesame Street' is
teaching them something,'' she says. ``Parents find something
interesting, too. Some of them grew up on the show and they trust
it, trust us. There's something for them in watching the show with
their children.''
 &HT;    Now 69 and a grandmother of five, Cooney serves as chairman of
CTW's board and remains ``Sesame Street's'' guiding force. She does
not, however, consider herself responsible for educating millions
of kids.
 &HT;    ``I don't have much hubris about that,'' she says. ``I do think
we changed childhood in America in the following way: Kindergarten
started teaching much more after the first `Sesame Street'
generation arrived in school.
 &HT;    ``Children definitely began to learn more about numbers and the
alphabet in kindergarten, because they learned them on `Sesame
Street,''' she explains. ``I'm very proud of that, but don't take a
lot of bows. Part of that has to do with my wishing we'd had a
greater impact on inner-city schools. There are still problems
there.
 &HT;    ``On a personal level,'' she adds, ``I'm always happy to meet
people who talk about growing up on `Sesame Street' or `Electric
Company,' who talk about their kids growing up on `Sesame Street.'
 &HT;    ``That's wonderful. Sitting with my granddaughter, who's 2,
brings it home for me more than anything else.'''
 &HT;    Michael Loman, a former public-school teacher, is currently in
his sixth season as ``Sesame Street's'' executive producer. His
background also includes stints as a writer/producer of ``Happy
Days'' and ``Newhart.''
 &HT;    ```Sesame Street' works because it has a collaborative
imprint,'' he says. ``It involves the writers, producers and
performers. It also involves our research department _ we
constantly test the show with children at day-care centers. We
watch how they react, what they like and don't like and, most
importantly, we watch what they learn.
 &HT;    ``It's a huge responsibility when you present a show for little
children,'' Loman says. ``Everything has to be safe _ nothing can
lead to the wrong conclusion and nothing should scare the kids.
Finally, we have to make the show entertaining.
 &HT;    ``That combination _ educational, safe and entertaining _ is why
`Sesame Street' has been on for 30 years and why it's still
popular.''
 &HT;    The 65-year-old Spinney has been with ``Sesame Street'' since
its inception. In addition to portraying Big Bird, he manipulates
Oscar the Grouch and provides Oscar's voice.
 &HT;    Though such friends and collaborators as Henson, songwriter Joe
Raposo and writer Jeff Moss have died, Spinney says, the thrill of
puppeteering and the joy of educating children remain as powerful
as the day Henson hired him.
 &HT;    ``It's still wonderful,'' he says. ``I didn't take the courses
one needs to become a teacher, though I'd thought about teaching
when I was a kid. I always did want to be a performer, though.
 &HT;    ``As it turned out,'' Spinney says, ``I'm kind of both teacher
and performer, and I can't beat the audience _ the children of the
world.
 &HT;    ``I can't picture stopping.''
 &HT;    Back on set, Max is running out of steam. He's met his Muppet
pals, posed for pictures, shaken Big Bird's hand and sat on a stool
in Mr. Hooper's store.
 &HT;    As Maria and Big Bird wave goodbye, Max smiles.
 &HT;    ``I'll see you soon,'' he says. ``Bye-bye.''
 &HT;    In a taxi heading back to Manhattan, Max recounts his favorite
parts of his ``Sesame Street'' visit. He can't wait to tell his
friends at school about his day.
 &HT;    ``That was so cool, Daddy,'' he says. ``Can we do it again
tomorrow?''

DAVE MATTHEWS STAYS GROUNDED IN MUSIC, JUST BEING HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ For a musician, life on the road can mean a lot
of unfamiliar faces. Unless you're Dave Matthews that is. Of the
familiar faces that Dave Matthews sees at his East Coast concerts,
there are a couple he describes as ``two of his more decorative
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She a body piercer and he's a body tattoer. ...I certainly
enjoy seeing them,'' says Matthews, who is taking a break from
working with his band to do an acoustic tour with his friend,
guitarist Tim Reynolds. They'll play at the Pantages Theatre on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Matthews sees this decorative couple so often is
amazing, considering how fast tickets go to the Dave Matthews Band
concerts. Last year, two dates at Madison Square Garden in New York
City (38,500 tickets) sold out in an hour. The same thing for two
Philadelphia dates. Tickets were gone for a Chicago date (nearly
20,000 tickets) in 11 minutes. Last summer, DMB played to over a
million people on 53 dates.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to tell Graydon Brown, a 20-year-old sophomore at
the University of California, Santa Barbara, how hard it is to get
Matthews tickets. The Valencia native, who has been a fan since
1994, will be home tonight when Matthews and Reynolds play there.
He spent a night camped out trying to get tickets to the show in
Santa Barbara. ``It sold out in five minutes,'' he says. ``A lot of
the people that I know who are fans of his go to his concerts every
time he comes around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Sandler, music director at 103.1-FM, an album alternative
station describes fans of the DMB as ``real rabid, like
Deadheads.'' His concerts are like a big party, says Brown, who
describes the crowds as mostly college age, 18 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   And what's the draw? ``I like how he changes things up, says
Brown. ``With his music, it always sounds different. He does a lot
of improvising. I've never heard a song that sounds exactly the
same at any of his shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandler says Matthews' tunes are not typical pop songs.
``There's a lot more to them. ... They are songs that don't wear on
you after you hear them for a while. In fact, if anything, they get
better with playing. I think they grow on you more and more.
Certain songs you play and people start complaining that you hear
it too much. That never happen with Dave Matthews songs.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Matthews admits he's a bit mystified by his
popularity and the legions of ``Daveheads.'' ``I have no idea why
I'm successful, and I'll work my ass off until I get fired,'' he
jokes. He does think that there is a spontaneity in the band that
helps keep things fresh and ``hopefully helps keep things fresh for
the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, there is nothing about Matthews that is
easily classifiable. If you've only heard his seductive single
``Crash Into Me,'' which features a breathy melodic top over a
rhythmic bottom, then you're just beginning to hear the disparate
influences that make up his music _ jazz, rock, world music. Some
of this can be attributed to his upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews was born in South Africa on Jan. 9, 1967. He moved to
outside New York City at age 2 when his father, a physicist, took a
job in the U.S. Matthews' father died when he was 10, and the
family returned to South Africa for much of the '80s. So Matthews
was exposed to both pop and African sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love melodies, so I was attracted to the Beatles and Bowie.
I was raised on listening to classical and choral stuff, but I also
loved a lot of African music and the rhythms in stuff by Hugh
Masekela and others. And I grew up on Bob Dylan and Bob Marley,''
he says. ``A little while before the band got together, I got
interested in American jazz, though I was interested in African
jazz before that.''
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the U.S. in 1987 (he had become a citizen at
13), Matthews held odd jobs, then worked as bartender in
Charlottesville, Va., while keeping his musical ambitions to
himself. In 1990, he formed the band after approaching a couple of
local jazz musicians, saxman Leroi Moore and drummer Carter Moore.
What they heard in Matthews was an unusual guitar sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played for years,'' Matthews explains. ``When I got obsessed
in my playing, my inspirations were not so much listening to other
guitarists but different types of music _ African music, Indian
music, Irish music. I didn't get into the guitar part of those
kinds of music, but I got into the rhythms they were playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without having to get the courage to put a band together in my
teens, I wanted a relatively full but simple sound that I could
sing over. So I tried to cover percussive and melodic spaces with
the guitar, really in a naive way, but just as big a sound ... with
as little work as possible. So I got into this percussive thing
that I'm into, sort of splitting the guitar in two. One being a
punchy part to keep a grove and the other the roots to it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The DMB was hardly an overnight success. Instead of trying to
get a record contract right away, their manager put them out on the
road for a few years. Part of the reason was necessity, Matthews
points out. `Some of the band members had families to support.''
But all that touring helped give DMB its strong fan base.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the band's self-released debut album, ``Remember Two
Things,'' which sold at a rate of more than 10,000 copies per month
_ an incredible feat, considering it was distributed exclusively
from the band's office. Their major-label debut, ``Under the Table
and Dreaming'' was a hit, as have been the follow-up albums.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews' latest album, ``Live at Luther College,'' debuted at
No. 2 on the Billboard chart when it was released last January. Not
bad for a live acoustic concert that he recorded with Tim Reynolds
nearly three years ago, especially since Matthews allows taping at
most of his concerts and the bootleg of this show has been around
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa still has a hold on Matthews. ``The music there is
inspirational to me. Sort of reminiscent in a funny way of Irish
music, melancholy but also so powerful. ... I think that there's
something ancient about it that's inspirational. If it comes out in
any way in my singing _ however limited it is _ I'll be pretty
grateful that I could help convey it.''
</P>
<P>
   But partly growing up there also opened his eyes to the
political struggles that were going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was pretty politically active in the church in South
Africa,'' Matthews says. ``You definitely have to take a side in
that country. There was no middle ground. ... It wasn't the
situation like here in America where you can say, `It doesn't
involve me,' which in a lot of ways is a cop-out. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``(The situation in South Africa) made me acutely aware of
racism. It also made be aware of it coming back to the States. So I
see the racism here much more glaringly than I would have if I had
just grown up here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Matthews doesn't like to preach. ``I get annoyed by
self-righteous people,'' he says, though he might occasionally
``talk about something in my concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   That his band is racially mixed may be message enough for now,
though Matthews would like to bring more ideas to his music in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, touring keeps Matthews occupied _ ``I get ants
in my pants,'' he says _ and after taking a month off from this
tour, he's going out with the rest of the band on a summer tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for me to keep working and hope that I won't lose
sight of inspirations and not get too caught up in why people got
into what the band is doing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And keeping himself grounded is important to Matthews, who says
he avoids ``spending too much time in too many extravagant
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not denying that I'm really in an unusual position and
that my life is different from a lot of people's. But I like to
focus on not getting caught up in that. I think I could very
easily. I think it's for selfish reasons that I try to hold on to
simple things.''
</P>
<P>
   And he credits his family with helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family and friends, people that know me well, will be the
first to tell me if my feet seem to be raising above the ground and
my head is starting to get lost in the clouds. They'll be the first
to burst my bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the low-key Matthews was on the road, of course,
calling from Salt Lake City, ``scratchy voice and all.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his mother reportedly saying he could have a
career in comedy, Matthews brightens and does an imitation denying
she ever made that statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be as silly as the next person,'' Matthews admits,
but he doesn't see a career in comedy ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could represent me on that,'' he says. ``You could say,
`When I spoke to David, he was particularly mundane.' ''

 By BRIDGET BYRNE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is one angel who's having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Roma Downey's year has started well: ``Touched by
an Angel'' continues as a hit, and she herself is widely recognized
as a key to the show's success. The media frenzy surrounding her
divorce from director David Anspaugh has died down, and she's
enjoying a morning at a Los Angeles hotel, alternating between
being interviewed and playing with her 2-year-old daughter, Reilly
Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Downey, who plays Monica on the hit CBS series, is also a witty,
bright-spirited woman, as quick with her lip as she is easy on the
eyes. Monica may be a bit of a goof, a touch naive and in need of
guidance from her boss, Tess (Della Reese), but the actress who
plays her has a pretty sensible head on her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Over ``a nice cup of tea'' at the hotel, where she's staying
while attending an awards show, Downey finds herself, inevitably,
talking about fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important that whatever your sense of identity is not
be wrapped up in something that fleeting,'' the Irish actress says.
</P>
<P>
   Her own fame caught her more or less by surprise. When she
auditioned for the role in 1994 Downey didn't expect much, even
after winning the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be just a pilot and a few shillings in my
pocket and on to the next thing,'' she recalls. ``I had no idea it
would totally transform my life.''
</P>
<P>
   That pilot episode, in which Monica actually wore wings and
flew, never aired. But CBS had sufficient faith in the chemistry
between Downey and Reese to give the show another chance to get off
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had you told me several years ago that I would become a kind
of a double act with this larger-than-life black singer from
Detroit, I would have thought you were crazy,'' Downey says,
laughing. ``And yet that day I met her ... There is a Van Morrison
line where he says `Hey, I recognize your soul,' and I really felt
that with her.''
</P>
<P>
   The two actresses clicked right away _ they're close enough that
Reese, who moonlights as a minister, is Reilly's godmother _ but
Downey is quick to credit the show's success to executive producer
Martha Williamson, who revamped it after the pilot was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave it a spiritual base,'' Downey says. ``She's for real.
The pilot had a slightly more tongue-in-cheek approach, as if it
was saying `If there were angels, they could be like this.' Her
show says, `There are angels, there is a God.'''
</P>
<P>
   The show, now the network's top-rated drama, is in its fifth
season. Downey admits that she has trouble evaluating it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that my life has changed,'' she says, ``but in
the middle of it all I had a child, so it's often hard for me to
try to distinguish between whether the change in my life occurred
because I became a television star or the more profound change in
my life occurred because I became a mother. And the fact they
happened simultaneously ... you know, I really couldn't tell you
how one defines the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress lives in Salt Lake City, where the series is shot,
and she's convinced that the double transition would have been even
harder if she had remained in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   However, she admits that she likes some of the trappings of
Tinseltown _ ``limousines and flowers and everything you would
associate with star treatment. But my day-to-day life isn't made up
of that,'' says the actress, who admits that she's always loved to
dress up.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she can do so in beautiful couturier clothes, such
as the strapless, midnight-blue gown by Richard Tyler that she wore
to the Golden Globes. But beyond the glamorous surface, she says
with a laugh, her life is actually at times a little lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been single and famous before,'' she says, ``and
it's very strange. You would think it would be the time of your
life. You would think `God, you could have your pick,' but `Where
and when am I ever going to meet anyone?' is the question that
screams in my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I ever were to,'' she adds, ``how can I trust that it's
me that he's interested in and not the perception of me? So, sweet
surrender, I'm putting it out there _ I'm not looking for anyone,
but ... ''
</P>
<P>
   And she finishes the sentence with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Home life with Reilly _ who, while her mother is being
interviewed, successively watches videos, plays with her nanny and
takes a bath _ is Downey's greatest joy, she says, but she also
finds great satisfaction in her work as an actress, a career which
once seemed an impossible dream.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Northern Ireland township of Derry, she grew up in
an era blighted by the region's sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to do,'' she recalls. ``There was no cinema
_ gone. There was no theater _ burnt down. There never had been an
ice rink. There were no bowling alleys. There was very little even
in the way of sports arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``So one's energies were taken up, really, sitting in people's
living rooms, making conversation, listening to music, reading,
hanging out on the corner and making up stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey's first memories of acting are of being in the chorus of
a pantomime ``Aladdin'' as a child, and then of dancing the role of
the Beast opposite Beauty in a ballet duet, wearing a homemade
papier-mache head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember getting to take it off at the end when she kissed
me,'' she recalls, ``and I was always kind of red and
bothered-looking. As I'd been oxygen-deprived for 15 minutes, it
was hard to look handsome and triumphant.''
</P>
<P>
   But that part of her life ended when her mother died. Downey was
only 10, and though she continued to perform in school plays, her
teachers didn't encourage her to aspire to an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nuns said `You could be a great art teacher,''' she
recalls. ``And you go `Oh, they must know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Downey did in fact study at Brighton Art College in England, but
found art too solitary an experience. She soon realized that she
preferred the more collaborative process of acting.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her mid-30s, Downey has played Monica in more than 100
episodes, and she believes that the character has evolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, frankly, she has to show some maturation,'' the
actress says. ``Otherwise, if it does last another five years, I'm
going to look like the stupidest used-to-be-ingenue on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   In one episode this season, Downey played not only Monica but
also her counterpart Monique, ``a devil in a black business suit
and high heels _ with an American accent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another offbeat episode in the works is tentatively titled
``Black Like Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' Downey explains, ``Monica has found herself in
various situations where she takes the audience with her on a
journey with some lesson to be learned, and we are going to do a
show very specifically about racism where Monica will become black.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have been doing a series of makeup tests because,
obviously, we don't want to look foolish and, obviously, we don't
want to insult _ and, of course, we're running it all by Della!''

ACADEMY AWARDS QUIZ: OSCAR GOES TO WORK

 Includes a color slide of Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes in a
scene from ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
 By S. BURELISON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    What does it take to win an Oscar?
 &HT;    Well, if you're an actor it helps to be very, very good. But to
a considerable extent what counts is not what you do but what your
character does. Certain lines of work are much more Oscar-worthy
than others.
 &HT;    Given the choice between a physician and an insurance adjustor,
for example, go with the doctor _ if Edward G. Robinson didn't get
even a nomination for ``Double Indemnity'' (1944), chances are no
insurance man will ever win a statuette.
 &HT;    Likewise, pick the whore with a heart of gold over the airline
stewardess, and the self-sacrificing mother over nearly any other
job you can think of.
 &HT;    So, in a year in which jobs such as beleaguered G.I., ruler of
England and classical musician seem to be on the upswing, test your
knowledge of past occupational pluses and minuses with this handy
quiz. 
 -0- 
 HEART OF GOLD OPTIONAL  
 &HT;    This is a rare year in which no woman has been nominated for
playing a prostitute. But playing ``bad girls'' has been a good way
for actresses to hook up with Oscar since Helen Hayes first
committed ``The Sin of Madelon Claudet'' (1931).
 &HT;    But what about these other performances involving the oldest
profession?
 &HT;    1. Call girl Bree Daniel was an Oscar-winning role in a 1971
film named after the detective investigating her. Who was the
actress, and what was the movie?
 &HT;    2. Before she became a demure television mom, Shirley Jones was
good-girl-gone-bad Lulu Bains in what 1960 film?
 &HT;    3. ``Butterfield 8'' (1960) took its name from a call girl's
telephone number. Name the Oscar-winning actress and the character.
 &HT;    4. Woody Allen discovers that his adopted son was the biological
child of a prostitute in a 1995 film which he wrote and directed.
Name the film, and also the actress _ daughter of another
well-known actor _ who took home an Oscar.
 &HT;    5. Jo Van Fleet deserts her son to become a madam _ and an Oscar
winner _ in a 1955 film. What was the film, and who played the son?
 ORDER IN THE COURT  
 &HT;    John Travolta and Robert Duvall both hoped to be the latest in a
line of Oscar-winning attorneys for their work in ``A Civil
Action'' (1998), but only Duvall was nominated, as Best Supporting
Actor.
 &HT;    The odds were always better for defense attorney Duvall than for
plaintiff's attorney Travolta, however: All the Oscar-winning
lawyers were male defense attorneys _ no prosecutors need apply,
nor any women.
 &HT;    If you love movies, you should overrule any objection to
answering these:
 &HT;    6. Walter Matthau won a Best Supporting Actor statuette as
disreputable lawyer Willie Gingrich in 1966. What was the movie,
and what was his area of practice?
 &HT;    7. Attorney Hans Rolfe, defending accused Nazis in 1961's
``Judgment at Nuremberg,'' won an Oscar for which actor?
 &HT;    8. The Best Actor award for 1993 went to an actor who played
attorney Andrew Beckett in a film named after Beckett's city of
residence. Name the actor and the film.
 &HT;    9. Gregory Peck became the screen's iconic lawyer as the hero of
a 1962 adaptation of a classic novel. Name the movie and the
character.
 &HT;    10. In ``A Free Soul'' (1931), lawyer Stephen Ashe delivers the
longest uninterrupted monologue in American film history. What
actor won the Oscar for his pains?
 WRITER'S BLOC  
 &HT;    It was an upset when Joseph Fiennes didn't get nominated as the
title character in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' since screenwriters
naturally do well depicting other writers.
 &HT;    Can you place these other, luckier actors who played writers?
 &HT;    11. What actor had a tough time, as author Don Birnam, getting
through ``The Lost Weekend'' (1945), and why?
 &HT;    12. Who won his only statue as a reporter chasing a story from
Florida to New York in a 1934 comedy classic?
 &HT;    13. What actor won his only Oscar as a tabloid reporter in ``The
Philadelphia Story'' (1940), and what did the character really want
to do?
 &HT;    14. What real-life author did Jason Robards portray in 1977's
``Julia?''
 &HT;    15. George Sanders won as a cynical theater columnist in the
Best Picture of 1950. What was it?
 ACTING UP  
 &HT;    The Academy seems to favor performers who play stage actors over
those who play screen actors, perhaps because the latter hits too
close to home. So, at least, the theory has gone since the snubbing
of the classic ``Sunset Boulevard'' (1950).
 &HT;    Can you pick up on the following cues?
 &HT;    16. Who won for playing an actor in 1977's ``The Goodbye Girl,''
and what role did he play within the movie?
 &HT;    17. Who won a Best Actor award in 1947 for playing an actor
consumed by his onstage persona in ``A Double Life,'' and what role
did he play within the movie?
 &HT;    18. Who won as a hammy stage diva in ``Bullets Over Broadway''
(1994)?
 &HT;    19. What real-life actor did Martin Landau portray in ``Ed
Wood'' (1994), and what film was he making at the end of the movie?
 &HT;    20. What noteworthy actress won her first Oscar as a young
actress in ``Morning Glory'' (1933)?
 AND THE FIELD  
 &HT;    21. Name the only Oscar-winner ever to cop a statue for playing
an accountant.
 &HT;    22. What actress won an Oscar as a maid-turned-congresswoman?
 &HT;    23. Who won the Best Actor Oscar for playing a butcher?
 &HT;    24. Who won a Best Actress Oscar as a janitor?
 &HT;    25. Who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar as a valet?

 MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY: ONE SPECIAL `ED'  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes a color slide of Matthew McConaughey in a scene from
``EDtv.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Life in the fast lane actually began in an express lane.
 &HT;    Matthew McConaughey was in a Texas A&AMP;P store the first time he
really felt famous.
 &HT;    ``I was getting some produce and I went to the quickie checkout
line,'' the actor recalls. ``Suddenly I was staring at myself on
the cover of Vanity Fair.''
 &HT;    McConaughey approached the checkout girl, who didn't bother to
look up. He tossed down the magazine near the register and said,
``Good-looking kid, huh?''
 &HT;    ``Oh yeah,'' the girl gushed. ``He's really a babe.''
 &HT;    Then she looked up into those steel-blue eyes and nearly passed
out.
 &HT;    ``I said, `Darlin', I'll be buying that magazine,''' he recalls
with a chuckle.
 &HT;    The checkout girl exclaimed, ``I'll be buying one, too.''
 &HT;    Three years later, the only thing that hasn't changed is
McConaughey's laid-back attitude. He's been up in Hollywood, and
he's been down. He's been on every cover and in every magazine.
 &HT;    Now he's Ed in ``EDtv,'' a guy who consents to have his entire
life filmed for a television show _ a subject about which
McConaughey knows a little something.
 &HT;    The Texan actor arrives for a day of interviews at the San
Francisco Ritz-Carlton wearing tight, faded jeans and a T-shirt
that reads, ``I Survived Matthew's Birthday Party and All I Got Was
This Lousy T-shirt.''
 &HT;    Just turned 30, McConaughey tosses off a beaming smile and sits
down. He's got those same deep-blue eyes and the same molasses-slow
drawl as ever _ the only thing missing is what used to be a head of
luscious brown locks, now replaced by half-inch stubble.
 &HT;    And no, it isn't for ``U-571,'' the submarine movie he's
currently filming.
 &HT;    ``I actually cut it all off before signing for the film,'' he
admits. ``I just get these hankerings.''
 &HT;    The former hair is still on display in ``EDtv,'' the Ron Howard
film set to open on March 26. It's a quirky film, sort of the flip
side to ``The Truman Show'' (1998), and McConaughey is very high on
it.
 &HT;    ``I think this movie is about how the public thinks they can
interfere in the life of someone who is famous,'' McConaughey says.
``It's like if you come into someone's living room or if you're up
on that big screen, people feel like they know you. They don't know
you, but they still have an opinion on what your life should be.
They have an opinion on who you should date. Your life becomes a
real-life soap opera.''
 &HT;    McConaughey speaks from experience. Ever since he caught the
public eye in ``A Time to Kill'' (1996) _ in fact, as soon as he
was cast _ he has been a fan magnet.
 &HT;    ``I remember walking through the Third Street Promenade in Los
Angeles the Friday afternoon that `A Time to Kill' came out,'' he
recalls. ``Out of 1,000 people, I'd say 999 ignored me _ they
didn't even look at me.''
 &HT;    Three days later, he walked down the same street.
 &HT;    ``Suddenly 999 people were staring at me,'' the actor says. ``It
was very unnerving. I was like, `What's going on?' In an instant my
life had changed, and suddenly I wasn't comfortable.''
 &HT;    The press has relentlessly tried to dig into his personal life,
which McConaughey insists on keeping private. A particular focus
has been his relationship with Sandra Bullock, his ``Time to Kill''
co-star and, since last year, fellow resident of Austin, Texas.
Both have repeatedly said that they're friends and nothing more.
 &HT;    ``Sandra and I laugh about the rumors,'' he says. ``Sandy and I
say, `If all the talk was true, I guess we have five kids by now
and we've been married a couple of times.'
 &HT;    ``I do want to get married someday,'' he adds, ``but right now
I'm having a good time. I live in Texas, Louisiana and Los Angeles.
I like to wander around in my van with my dog _ I'm not ready to
settle down yet. If it happens, it happens.''
 &HT;    If it does, McConaughey has plenty of good role models for
settling down. He grew up the youngest of three brothers in Uvalde,
Texas, where his father was in the oil business and his mother was
a teacher.
 &HT;    ``My parents had a real love affair and created a warm group,''
he recalls. ``We were a family in cutoffs, building tree houses.''
 &HT;    As a child, he adds, he cared more about football than about
acting.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't a dramatic kid,'' he says. ``You weren't really
allowed that many moods in our family. If you came to breakfast
with a frown on your face, Mom would pop the table.''
 &HT;    He smacks the coffee table to demonstrate.
 &HT;    ``Mom would say, `What's your problem?''' he recalls. ``You'd
see the dust on the table flying. And Mom would say, `Go back to
bed, get up and start over, young man.'''
 &HT;    McConaughey enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin, where
he was a psychology and philosophy major heading toward law school.
 &HT;    ``Law school was something I was expected to do,'' McConaughey
says. ``I could understand why my parents wanted me to become a
lawyer, I could justify it to myself _ but I wasn't sleeping well
with it. I didn't have this passion for it.''
 &HT;    Instead he wound up playing lawyers in ``A Time to Kill'' and
``Amistad'' (1998). He'd already changed his major to directing for
his junior year when another option came to the fore, in the form
of a role in the low-budget ``Dazed and Confused'' (1993).
 &HT;    McConaughey took to acting like a duck to water.
 &HT;    ``I just fell in love with it,'' he says. ``I appreciated that
it was an art.''
 &HT;    A couple of years spent scuffling for his next big role ended
when novelist John Grisham vetoed Woody Harrelson as the star of
the film version of his book, ``A Time to Kill.'' Director Joel
Schumacher decided to try a new face, and suddenly McConaughey was
on the cover of that supermarket Vanity Fair.
 &HT;    ``I made an immediately splash with this intense kind of boom
and all this hype,'' he says. ``It's like I had a banner on me
saying, `Here's the New Guy.' I had to prove myself as an actor.''
 &HT;    That wasn't always easy. ``Contact'' (1997) did big box office,
but ``The Newton Boys'' (1998) flopped. ``Amistad'' was more
successful, but still counted as a disappointment.
 &HT;    ``I had all the hoopla when I started acting,'' McConaughey says
matter-of-factly. ``It's only natural that I would have a drop. All
I can say is that I did some films I was really happy about, and I
was proud to be a part of them.''
 &HT;    Next up is the World War II submarine film ``U-571,''
co-starring Bill Paxton and Jon Bon Jovi. After that, McConaughey
hopes to finally tackle a long-delayed role as motorcycle-stunt
star Evel Knievel.
 &HT;    In the meantime, though, he'll settle for being able to make
movies and at the same time live a somewhat private life. Which
doesn't mean that he doesn't like to meet his fans once in a while.
 &HT;    ``There's still a `Dazed and Confused' subculture that's kind of
the coolest group to get recognized by,'' he says.
 &HT;    Are they conscious?
 &HT;    ``Just enough,'' McConaughey says, laughing. ``I was in a pub in
Amsterdam and someone across the room screamed, `I think I just
heard that Matthew guy, man.'
 &HT;    ``Another guy said, `Man, you sound just like this guy in this
film, ``Dazed and Confused.'' You don't look like him, but you
sound just like him.'
 &HT;    ``I just said, `Nah, you've had too much to drink.'''

 Includes a color slide of Big Bird and assorted Muppets in a scene
from the children's television series, ``Sesame Street.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Muppets, where are you?'' Max Spelling asks. ``I think you're
hiding.''
 &HT;    Max, age 3, has been pacing the halls of the Kaufman-Astoria
Studios in Queens, N.Y., for 15 minutes, and if he has to wait
another second he'll burst. He wants to meet Big Bird, Elmo and
Rosita.
 &HT;    Finally, a Children's Television Workshop publicist emerges from
an elevator.
 &HT;    ``Who's your favorite Muppet?'' the publicist asks.
 &HT;    ``All of them,'' Max says instantly. ``I love all of them.''
 &HT;    Down a couple of halls and through a few doors we walk, with Max
growing increasingly excited. And then ...
 &HT;    ``Hey, Daddy!'' Max shouts, his eyes open wide. ``Look!''
 &HT;    Before him stands the beloved ``Sesame Street'' universe.
There's Maria's Fix-It Shop, Mr. Hooper's store, the famous 123
Sesame Street stoop, Oscar the Grouch's garbage can and Big Bird's
nest.
 &HT;    ``This is so cool,'' Max says breathlessly.
 &HT;    Over in an area called The Arbor, the ``Sesame Street''
production crew is preparing to shoot a scene featuring Big Bird,
three children dressed as ``birdkateers,'' two Muppets _ Tully and
Rosita _ and Maria, a human character played for 27 years by
actress Sonia Manzano. They're rehearsing a scene in which Bolo the
parrot is trying to learn the ``A-B-C'' song.
 &HT;    Max races over to Manzano.
 &HT;    ``Do you remember me?'' he asks. ``I see you on the television
all the time.''
 &HT;    ``Sure, hi, how are you?'' Manzano says with equal enthusiasm.
``I'm glad you could come today.''
 &HT;    Max sits down to watch everyone work, and everyone prays that
Max doesn't ruin any takes by laughing, whining or trying to help
Bolo sing.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' the director says. ``Let's bird up.''
 &HT;    And with that Caroll Spinney, the man inside the Big Bird
costume, dons Big Bird's head. The puppeteers operating Bolo,
Rosita and Tully assume their positions beneath a table.
 &HT;    They perform the scene several times. At one point, Big Bird
flubs a line.
 &HT;    ``Oh, poo,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``You said `Poo!''' Rosita says, as puppeteer Carmen Osbahr
laughs in character.
 &HT;    ``I'm so embarrassed,'' Big Bird says, burying his head in his
feathers.
 &HT;    Max smiles and laughs along with everyone else, not realizing
that he's just witnessed an outtake never to be seen on television.
Ever.
 &HT;    Fortunately, there are thousands of charming, thoughtful,
amusing and educational moments to be found in the nearly 4,000
``Sesame Street'' episodes aired to date. And, hard as it may be to
believe, ``Sesame Street'' celebrates its 30th anniversary this
year, with no end in sight.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, two generations of children have been raised on
``Sesame Street.'' The show has won 71 Emmys and spawned countless
spinoff products. It reaches 10 million American viewers a week,
and airs in 38 other countries as well.
 &HT;    This year, the show introduced a new 15-minute, stand-alone
segment, ``Elmo's World,'' while the Muppets _ created by the late
puppeteer Jim Henson _ are appearing in ``A Brief History of Motion
Pictures,'' a two-minute short running in movie theaters
nationwide.
 &HT;    Why keep fiddling with something so successful?
 &HT;    ``We revamp it every year,'' says Joan Ganz Cooney, CTW
co-founder and originator of ``Sesame Street'' and its classic
sibling, ``Electric Company.''
 &HT;    ``Constantly changing the show is a big reason why it's an
evergreen,'' she adds, speaking by telephone from her home in
Southampton, N.Y. ```Sesame Street' remains the only children's
show that's truly curriculum-based and researched every year to
make sure it's doing what we want it to do and what it should be
doing.
 &HT;    ``I think the characters are so impactful on children,'' Cooney
says. ``The Muppets are real to children and they're devoted to
Elmo, Big Bird and Cookie Monster. The genius of Jim Henson was to
infuse the Muppets with human qualities, and that creates a
devotion children don't quite have to other characters like the
Teletubbies or Barney.''
 &HT;    The computer generation is as interested in ``Sesame Street'' as
were the children of 1969, Cooney believes.
 &HT;    ``Children still like to learn, and they know `Sesame Street' is
teaching them something,'' she says. ``Parents find something
interesting, too. Some of them grew up on the show and they trust
it, trust us. There's something for them in watching the show with
their children.''
 &HT;    Now 69 and a grandmother of five, Cooney serves as chairman of
CTW's board and remains ``Sesame Street's'' guiding force. She does
not, however, consider herself responsible for educating millions
of kids.
 &HT;    ``I don't have much hubris about that,'' she says. ``I do think
we changed childhood in America in the following way: Kindergarten
started teaching much more after the first `Sesame Street'
generation arrived in school.
 &HT;    ``Children definitely began to learn more about numbers and the
alphabet in kindergarten, because they learned them on `Sesame
Street,''' she explains. ``I'm very proud of that, but don't take a
lot of bows. Part of that has to do with my wishing we'd had a
greater impact on inner-city schools. There are still problems
there.
 &HT;    ``On a personal level,'' she adds, ``I'm always happy to meet
people who talk about growing up on `Sesame Street' or `Electric
Company,' who talk about their kids growing up on `Sesame Street.'
 &HT;    ``That's wonderful. Sitting with my granddaughter, who's 2,
brings it home for me more than anything else.'''
 &HT;    Michael Loman, a former public-school teacher, is currently in
his sixth season as ``Sesame Street's'' executive producer. His
background also includes stints as a writer/producer of ``Happy
Days'' and ``Newhart.''
 &HT;    ```Sesame Street' works because it has a collaborative
imprint,'' he says. ``It involves the writers, producers and
performers. It also involves our research department _ we
constantly test the show with children at day-care centers. We
watch how they react, what they like and don't like and, most
importantly, we watch what they learn.
 &HT;    ``It's a huge responsibility when you present a show for little
children,'' Loman says. ``Everything has to be safe _ nothing can
lead to the wrong conclusion and nothing should scare the kids.
Finally, we have to make the show entertaining.
 &HT;    ``That combination _ educational, safe and entertaining _ is why
`Sesame Street' has been on for 30 years and why it's still
popular.''
 &HT;    The 65-year-old Spinney has been with ``Sesame Street'' since
its inception. In addition to portraying Big Bird, he manipulates
Oscar the Grouch and provides Oscar's voice.
 &HT;    Though such friends and collaborators as Henson, songwriter Joe
Raposo and writer Jeff Moss have died, Spinney says, the thrill of
puppeteering and the joy of educating children remain as powerful
as the day Henson hired him.
 &HT;    ``It's still wonderful,'' he says. ``I didn't take the courses
one needs to become a teacher, though I'd thought about teaching
when I was a kid. I always did want to be a performer, though.
 &HT;    ``As it turned out,'' Spinney says, ``I'm kind of both teacher
and performer, and I can't beat the audience _ the children of the
world.
 &HT;    ``I can't picture stopping.''
 &HT;    Back on set, Max is running out of steam. He's met his Muppet
pals, posed for pictures, shaken Big Bird's hand and sat on a stool
in Mr. Hooper's store.
 &HT;    As Maria and Big Bird wave goodbye, Max smiles.
 &HT;    ``I'll see you soon,'' he says. ``Bye-bye.''
 &HT;    In a taxi heading back to Manhattan, Max recounts his favorite
parts of his ``Sesame Street'' visit. He can't wait to tell his
friends at school about his day.
 &HT;    ``That was so cool, Daddy,'' he says. ``Can we do it again
tomorrow?''

 Includes a color slide of Roma Downey in a scene from ``Touched by
an Angel.'' 
 By BRIDGET BYRNE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is one angel who's having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Roma Downey's year has started well: ``Touched by
an Angel'' continues as a hit, and she herself is widely recognized
as a key to the show's success. The media frenzy surrounding her
divorce from director David Anspaugh has died down, and she's
enjoying a morning at a Los Angeles hotel, alternating between
being interviewed and playing with her 2-year-old daughter, Reilly
Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Downey, who plays Monica on the hit CBS series, is also a witty,
bright-spirited woman, as quick with her lip as she is easy on the
eyes. Monica may be a bit of a goof, a touch naive and in need of
guidance from her boss, Tess (Della Reese), but the actress who
plays her has a pretty sensible head on her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Over ``a nice cup of tea'' at the hotel, where she's staying
while attending an awards show, Downey finds herself, inevitably,
talking about fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important that whatever your sense of identity is not
be wrapped up in something that fleeting,'' the Irish actress says.
</P>
<P>
   Her own fame caught her more or less by surprise. When she
auditioned for the role in 1994 Downey didn't expect much, even
after winning the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be just a pilot and a few shillings in my
pocket and on to the next thing,'' she recalls. ``I had no idea it
would totally transform my life.''
</P>
<P>
   That pilot episode, in which Monica actually wore wings and
flew, never aired. But CBS had sufficient faith in the chemistry
between Downey and Reese to give the show another chance to get off
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had you told me several years ago that I would become a kind
of a double act with this larger-than-life black singer from
Detroit, I would have thought you were crazy,'' Downey says,
laughing. ``And yet that day I met her ... There is a Van Morrison
line where he says `Hey, I recognize your soul,' and I really felt
that with her.''
</P>
<P>
   The two actresses clicked right away _ they're close enough that
Reese, who moonlights as a minister, is Reilly's godmother _ but
Downey is quick to credit the show's success to executive producer
Martha Williamson, who revamped it after the pilot was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave it a spiritual base,'' Downey says. ``She's for real.
The pilot had a slightly more tongue-in-cheek approach, as if it
was saying `If there were angels, they could be like this.' Her
show says, `There are angels, there is a God.'''
</P>
<P>
   The show, now the network's top-rated drama, is in its fifth
season. Downey admits that she has trouble evaluating it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that my life has changed,'' she says, ``but in
the middle of it all I had a child, so it's often hard for me to
try to distinguish between whether the change in my life occurred
because I became a television star or the more profound change in
my life occurred because I became a mother. And the fact they
happened simultaneously ... you know, I really couldn't tell you
how one defines the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress lives in Salt Lake City, where the series is shot,
and she's convinced that the double transition would have been even
harder if she had remained in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   However, she admits that she likes some of the trappings of
Tinseltown _ ``limousines and flowers and everything you would
associate with star treatment. But my day-to-day life isn't made up
of that,'' says the actress, who admits that she's always loved to
dress up.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she can do so in beautiful couturier clothes, such
as the strapless, midnight-blue gown by Richard Tyler that she wore
to the Golden Globes. But beyond the glamorous surface, she says
with a laugh, her life is actually at times a little lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been single and famous before,'' she says, ``and
it's very strange. You would think it would be the time of your
life. You would think `God, you could have your pick,' but `Where
and when am I ever going to meet anyone?' is the question that
screams in my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I ever were to,'' she adds, ``how can I trust that it's
me that he's interested in and not the perception of me? So, sweet
surrender, I'm putting it out there _ I'm not looking for anyone,
but ... ''
</P>
<P>
   And she finishes the sentence with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Home life with Reilly _ who, while her mother is being
interviewed, successively watches videos, plays with her nanny and
takes a bath _ is Downey's greatest joy, she says, but she also
finds great satisfaction in her work as an actress, a career which
once seemed an impossible dream.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Northern Ireland township of Derry, she grew up in
an era blighted by the region's sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to do,'' she recalls. ``There was no cinema
_ gone. There was no theater _ burnt down. There never had been an
ice rink. There were no bowling alleys. There was very little even
in the way of sports arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``So one's energies were taken up, really, sitting in people's
living rooms, making conversation, listening to music, reading,
hanging out on the corner and making up stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey's first memories of acting are of being in the chorus of
a pantomime ``Aladdin'' as a child, and then of dancing the role of
the Beast opposite Beauty in a ballet duet, wearing a homemade
papier-mache head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember getting to take it off at the end when she kissed
me,'' she recalls, ``and I was always kind of red and
bothered-looking. As I'd been oxygen-deprived for 15 minutes, it
was hard to look handsome and triumphant.''
</P>
<P>
   But that part of her life ended when her mother died. Downey was
only 10, and though she continued to perform in school plays, her
teachers didn't encourage her to aspire to an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nuns said `You could be a great art teacher,''' she
recalls. ``And you go `Oh, they must know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Downey did in fact study at Brighton Art College in England, but
found art too solitary an experience. She soon realized that she
preferred the more collaborative process of acting.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her mid-30s, Downey has played Monica in more than 100
episodes, and she believes that the character has evolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, frankly, she has to show some maturation,'' the
actress says. ``Otherwise, if it does last another five years, I'm
going to look like the stupidest used-to-be-ingenue on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   In one episode this season, Downey played not only Monica but
also her counterpart Monique, ``a devil in a black business suit
and high heels _ with an American accent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another offbeat episode in the works is tentatively titled
``Black Like Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' Downey explains, ``Monica has found herself in
various situations where she takes the audience with her on a
journey with some lesson to be learned, and we are going to do a
show very specifically about racism where Monica will become black.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have been doing a series of makeup tests because,
obviously, we don't want to look foolish and, obviously, we don't
want to insult _ and, of course, we're running it all by Della!''

PAROLE BOARD CHIEF MISSES POINT, MAKES ONE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas parole board chairman Victor Rodriguez
scored a hit and a miss in testimony before two House committees
last week on two emotional issues _ murder and clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was on target when he questioned the need for creating
a life-without-parole sentencing option for Texas' most heinous
criminals. But he missed the point when he defended the secretive
way in which the Board of Pardons and Paroles handles requests for
commutations of death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a misconception that I suspect is pretty widespread,
Texas doesn't have a life-without-parole sentence _ at least in a
literal sense.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an issue that comes up every time the Legislature
meets, and it is attracting some interest again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some death penalty opponents may view the life-without-parole
option as an opportunity to reduce the number of executions in
Texas. Under that theory, some juries may be encouraged to sentence
fewer capital murderers to death if they had assurances a convict
who was spared the death chamber would never again be released into
the free world.
</P>
<P>
   Other advocates of the option have a different viewpoint. They
consider it another way to ``get tougher'' on crime. Short of
lethal injection, what sounds tougher _ in a constitutional sense,
anyway _ than locking up criminals and throwing away the key?
</P>
<P>
   But, in reality, as Rodriguez pointed out in his testimony to
lawmakers, a life-without-parole option would have little impact on
public safety because Texas law already requires capital murderers
sentenced to life in prison to serve 40 calendar years before they
can even be considered for parole. And _ depending on the political
climate of the distant future _ those who are still alive may not
even be released then.
</P>
<P>
   Most other violent offenders have to serve at least half of
their sentences _ or 30 years of a life sentence _ before they can
be released.
</P>
<P>
   Most of today's death row inmates, had they been sentenced to
life, would be in their 60s or 70s before they could become
eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   While that's not exactly a life sentence, it would come pretty
close for many convicts. And most convicted murderers, having
reached their senior years after decades of incarceration, would no
longer be considered a major threat to other people.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining behind bars, however, they would increase the
taxpayers' cost for health and nursing care in the state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   But since public safety is one thing and retribution is another,
the debate will continue.
</P>
<P>
   One important thing that the Legislature should do, regardless,
is change state law to require all juries to be informed of how the
parole laws can affect incarceration time. Some judges already are
letting juries know, for example, that a capital murderer sentenced
to life in prison has to serve at least 40 years, but other juries
remain in the dark and can only guess what ``life'' or any other
prison term may actually mean.
</P>
<P>
   During his tour of House committees, meanwhile, Rodriguez also
continued to defend the parole board's secretive way of deciding
clemency requests from death row inmates, which the panel almost
never grants.
</P>
<P>
   The board's long-standing practice of voting on clemency
applications over the telephone or by fax machine without holding
public meetings was sharply criticized in two high-profile capital
cases last year, including the execution of Houston pickax
murderess and professed born-again Christian Karla Faye Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Both a federal judge and a state judge recently ruled that the
clemency process was constitutional, but both judges also
criticized the secretive way the parole board operated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other state board and commission must meet to take any
action, however insignificant, yet the Board of Pardons and Paroles
decides a plea for mercy from death without ever meeting,'' state
District Judge Scott McCown of Austin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, has filed bills that
would open up clemency proceedings, require board members to state
reasons for their decisions and establish criteria _ including a
convict's rehabilitation _ for granting clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parole board has taken steps to make minor changes
in its proceedings, Rodriguez told legislators that the board
didn't intend to meet in public because the courts had ruled the
panel wasn't constitutionally required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we want to do more for someone who has committed the
most heinous crime against our people?'' Rodriguez asked the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez missed the point, as state Rep. Robert Puente, D-San
Antonio, reminded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that it's the inmate's right to a hearing
necessarily. It's the public's right to know how your board makes
decisions,'' Puente said.
</P>
<P>
   If the people of Texas are going to take the lives of convicted
murderers, the people have every right to know how their
representatives on the parole board decide whether a murderer
deserves mercy.

`SHAKESPEARE,' NOT SPIELBERG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The great Steven Spielberg, it seems, is starting
his victory lap a tad early. Before heading west for another
coronation in Hollywood, the movie maker is planning a swing
through here.
</P>
<P>
   Major face time with Vice President Al Gore is envisioned, as
befits one of the Clinton administration's most dilligent
supporters. And then _ can this be true? _ he wants to lay a wreath
at the Tomb of the Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that. For the impressario of ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' it is a nice gesture, but it's hard not to sense more than
a morsel of self-equation with a head of state on an official visit
here, the traditional movie world's confusion about its place in
the American pantheon. Such a gesture, after all, would not occur
to a poet or a giant of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   This is Spielberg, however, and this is the movies. Moreover,
this is the end of the century, the middle of another cycle of
multi-media awe (every bit of it appropriate and ultimately
inadequate) for the people who fought World War II. And I haven't
talked to a soul who knows movies from the inside who isn't
positive ``Saving Private Ryan'' is a cinch to get the Oscar for
best picture this month.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its immense merits, it is simply inconceivable that
the Academy could reject it, given its reverential and realistic
depiction of Omaha Beach and Normandy. And yet, it is hard to find
movie people who truly believe it is the best picture.
</P>
<P>
   To use last year as analogy, ``Saving Private Ryan'' is
``Titanic.'' It uses D-Day as James Cameron used the long-ago
tragedy as the setting for another story that would not be up for
an Oscar by itself, even if Academy Awards were free of their
business and political taint. They are triumphs of cinematography
in the service of honest depiction.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, if you want to see the full story of Titanic or of
Normandy told for their intrinsic merit, ``A Night to Remember''
and ``The Longest Day,'' hold up just fine after more than three
decades, and each keeps its sub-plots in their place.To use this
year as analogy, ``Private Ryan'' is like ``Elizabeth'' in the
sense that each is a great movie in a setting of which Hollywood
never tires: the costume drama and the war picture. Indeed, the
best picture choices, all five, are in one or the other this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   The difference with ``Elizabeth'' is that film maker Shekhar
Kapur couldn't give a hoot about history. He has used classic movie
form _ costume, palace intrigue, pageantry, atrocity _ to the
fullest in the service of a vision of England's great queen through
the lens of today's feminism.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason his movie is up for best picture really has less
to do with its look or story than with the astonishing success of
Cate Blanchett in portraying Elizabeth with a depth that goes miles
beyond the basically boilerplate nature of the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know anyone who thinks ``Elizabeth'' will win, just as I
don't know anyone who thinks ``Private Ryan'' will lose. But I also
don't know anyone who thinks ``Private Ryan'' will win for reasons
beyond its shattering first half-hour and what that tribute in
blood represents as depicted in its last half-hour. And I also
don't know anyone who doesn't see superior art and drama, as well
as greater depth, in the other nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg has done what he's done and bless him for it, but his
film doesn't come close in creativity, meaning, and achievement to
his own ``Schindler's List.'' And it doesn't touch ``Life is
Beautiful'' or ``The Thin Red Line.'' ``Private Ryan'' simply,
though powerfully, is. But Roberto Benigni's clownish father
shielding a son from the horror of the Holocaust celebrates the
human spirit in direct conflict with evil. And Terrence Malick has
taken Guadalcanal (as horrific as Normandy) and both respected it
as well as used it to dramatize the assault war represents on
nature as well as the nature of man.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate achievement last year for my money is what
happened a few years ago after writer Marc Norman's son, studying
Elizabethan drama, wondered how Shakespeare was motivated to write
``Romeo and Juliet'' and whether he might have been in love.With
the aid of Britain's genius playwright, Tom Stoppard, and John
Madden's direction that cut their what-if script like a diamond,
``Shakespeare in Love'' is a tribute to inventive creativity, to
imagination itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is bawdy and beautiful, hilarious and profound, a great play
about an even greater play. My movie moment of the year comes not
on Omaha Beach but at an Elizabethan theater in London, as the
premiere of Romeo ends and the audience is stunned into silence
before the cheers start.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's Academy is like the rest of us in this country.
Uncomfortable with art, we take refuge in the celebration of
extravagance or of patriotism most of the time.Even as we know
better. No matter what the already cast votes say, ``Good Will
Hunting'' was the best picture last year and ``Shakespeare in
Love'' is everything a movie can be.

BUSH'S LATEST COMMITTEE OFFERS MORE PROSPECTING THAN EXPLORATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's announcement that he will form a committee
to explore whether he will run for president has virtually nothing
to do with his decision on whether he will run for president.
</P>
<P>
   He has already decided to run. And he has said so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to run,'' he told a historian for the Daughters of
the Republic of Texas in Austin last week, according to an
Associated Press report. And that's just one example.
</P>
<P>
   But the unveiling of an exploratory committee was a big deal
anyway, for at least three reasons: money, cash and checks.
</P>
<P>
   With the documents on file and the bank account open, Bush can
start raising and spending money on polling and travel and on other
early phases of a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The governor told reporters in the back yard of the governor's
mansion last week that he has ``a compelling reason to consider
running for president: I want the 21st century to be prosperous,
and I don't want anybody being left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement could just as easily apply to his budding
campaign: Other candidates have made it clear that they will run
for the Republican nomination for president, and Bush doesn't want
to be left behind in the last fund-raising sweepstakes of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   If he can quickly raise the $25 million that oddsmakers say is
the threshold for a healthy White House contender, he will be even
more of the dominant force that early voter surveys show him to be
in the GOP contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's timing creates an ethical wrinkle, though. Like the
state's lawmakers, Bush can't accept political contributions for a
state campaign while the Texas Legislature is in session. That rule
went into effect a few years ago after a wealthy businessman with
an interest in pending legislation passed some fat checks to state
senators right there in the Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But now that he has an exploratory committee for a federal
campaign, Bush can receive contributions of up to $1,000 each from
the same people who can't give money to the account he can use as
governor or as a candidate for re-election to the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   It means that lobbyists involved in the electric utility
deregulation fight, or any other issue on the griddle in Austin,
can show their utmost respect and admiration for Bush's
presidential aspirations by sending a $1,000 check right about the
time Bush decides whether to sign the bills they are interested in.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there would be any connection between supporting Bush
for president and hoping he takes preferred action on a new law. No
connection at all. No sir.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bush has already decided to run, why the ruse, the
charade, the gamesmanship involved in saying that he is merely in
the exploring mode? And why the media frenzy every time he takes an
incremental step?
</P>
<P>
   Well, in the current setup, Bush can stay true to his pledge
that he will concentrate on Texas and its lawmaking process until
the legislative session ends in May _ while signaling supporters
and contributors and pundits, all the way to New Hampshire and
Iowa, that the race is definitely on.
</P>
<P>
   And because those voter surveys show Bush reaping so much
political profit by carrying out this slow seduction _ while other
candidates make their umpteenth campaign stop at the coffee shop in
Derry, N.H. _ why not keep the tease going a little bit longer?
</P>
<P>
   Even more, the gradual unfolding of the ``Another Bush For
President'' campaign provides the news media with the kind of
prefabricated drama that makes for easy video and easy headlines.
We know what is going to happen, but that doesn't stop it from
being a screamer when it happens, because it still means so much:
``Clinton Acquitted.'' ``Racist Convicted In Dragging Murder.''
``Bush Kicks Off White House Campaign, Part III.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, speculation about Bush running for president is at
least a year and a half old. After Bob Dole's loss to President
Clinton in 1996, Republicans started looking around for fresh,
successful faces and found one whose father had already occupied
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 to last month, the biggest political development for
Bush was his landslide re-election in 1998. It showed that he could
be a record-breaking winner in a multiethnic state. His worries
about how a presidential race might mess up his family's life and
expose him unfairly to scandalous allegations, look like they
weren't substantial after all.
</P>
<P>
   The news, therefore, is that the fellow slotted to run for
president is now collecting money to do just that. Updates will be
posted as they occur.

HOW MUCH CHLORINE IS IN SEA WATER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I recently read that the most plentiful element in sea water
is chlorine. If this is true can you please explain how it is
possible?
</P>
<P>
   T.B., Nashua, N.H. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is the ocean salty?
</P>
<P>
   J.B., Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With thanks to Dr. David Ross, Senior Scientist at the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution in Falmouth, Mass.: When it comes to
sea water, the Os have it. And then the Hs. Then come the Cls. The
oxygen in H20 makes up 85.7 percent of sea water by weight.
</P>
<P>
   The hydrogen is 10.8 percent. Chlorine is the next most
plentiful element. But it's a distant third, only a meager 1.9
percent of sea water. Its molecular partner in salt, sodium, is
about 1 percent of sea water. Together with other salts like
magnesium chloride (.13 percent), and calcium chloride ( .04
percent), the total salinity in sea water averages 3.5 percent. In
areas of high evaporation like the Persian Gulf or Red Sea, the
total can be as high as 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some inland bodies of water have much higher salinity. Utah's
Great Salt Lake ranges between 10 and 17 percent salt. The Dead Sea
is between 30 and 33 percent salt.
</P>
<P>
   All that salt in the water came from land, eroded out of rocks
and soil and washed into the sea for billions of years. Other
elements like iron, aluminum, strontium, cobalt, even gold, also
washed out of rocks and into the oceans. But most of those elements
are reactive. They tend to attach to organisms through biological
processes. So they're hard to find in sea water as independent
elements. Salt, on the other hand _ or sodium chloride _ is not as
reactive, so it isn't absorbed by organic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How fast do snowflakes fall?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``The really rimed crystals can buzz right along like a blur,
at a lightning-like nine miles per hour.'' says Nolan Doesken,
Assistant Climatologist for the state of Colorado and author of
``The Snow Booklet. ``A nice little stellar crystal, the favorite
magical snowflake with the arms that everybody draws, will float
down more gently, at one to one-and-a-half m.p.h.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he know? Doesken and his fellow flake freaks photograph
falling flakes, factoring in wind conditions, and figuring out how
fast snow falls.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a rimed crystal? That's a snowflake that picked up one
or more tiny particles of supercooled water on it's way down.
Supercooled water is colder than 32 degrees Fahrenheit but not yet
frozen. If it's really pure and doesn't have any imperfections to
serve as condensation nuclei, water can get down to 40 degrees
below zero Fahrenheit before freezing.
</P>

   Doesken says that in clouds, supercooled droplets often occur at
temperatures of 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. But when a snowflake
bumps into them on its descent, those droplets attach to the
crystal and freeze. That kind of ice is called rime. The more rime
that freezes onto a snowflake as it drops, the heavier the flake is
and the faster it falls.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not sleet or hail, which are bigger, more solid
pellets of ice. It's still a snowflake crystal, with a kind of a
crust frozen on.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Coast storms are usually heavily rimed, with high fall
velocities,'' Doesken adds. ``Your snow in New England isn't so
much drifting down as hightailing it down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the air that brings snow to the East Coast is
rich in moisture compared with snow clouds elsewhere.

THE MILITARY: WAY OUT OF HARM'S WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a policy with roots that go back to Vietnam, wind their
way through the Marine barracks in Beirut, the streets of
Mogadishu, and into Khobar Towers. It is called, in the peculiar
parlance of the military, ``force protection.''
</P>
<P>
   It's meaning is clear enough: that our military objective should
be to avoid having US service members killed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Any sane person would applaud efforts to keep the casualties of
war to a minimum. But there is a concern that the US commitment to
force protection _ built in part on fear of the public's reaction
to loss of life _ has undercut our foreign military presence. In
short, are we becoming a nation that speaks loudly and carries a
small stick?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a pervasive feeling in the Pentagon that we cannot
tolerate casualties,'' says Bernard Trainor, a retired Marine Corps
general and former director of the national security program at
Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School. ``Force protection . .
. is an integral part of the planning process.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the force protection policy can be seen in our
refusal to go into Rwanda to stop the massacre of as many as
800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu rebels in the mid 1990s;
it was present in America's reluctance to send troops to Bosnia,
and in our decision not to go into Afghanistan and hunt down Osama
bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire terrorist believed to be the
mastermind of the bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
and the man some think responsible for the bombing of Khobar Towers
in Dhahran that killed 19 US soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And many believe it is why we have not sent troops to Kosovo _
an issue that may well take center stage again soon, depending on
the outcome of the peace talks that resume March 15. Says Trainor,
``The planning for Bosnia and Kosovo has been heavily influenced by
force protection.''
</P>
<P>
   If the military becomes too cautious, it can be a detriment to
implementing policy, whether strategic or moral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internationally, one would be on safe ground to say there are
questions about the wherewithal of the United States to act like a
superpower,'' says Richard Shultz, director of the international
security studies program at the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   John Hillen, a senior fellow in political military studies at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says allies in
Bosnia ``derisively refer to the US contigent as the turtles
because we have to go around in full battle rattle and have to
travel in convoys of at least four.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe our decision not to go to Rwanda in 1994 to stop
the genocide of Tutsis by Hutu rebels as the result of the death of
18 servicemen in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993. We had gone there as
part of a United Nations effort to bring food and stability to the
East African country torn apart by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that our aversion to casualties led us to a
major mistake in not intervening in Rwanda,'' says Michael
O'Hanlon, a fellow in foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution. ``And the behavior was shameful, and it is a blight on
the the Clinton administration and Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that a good strategic and moral foreign
policy needs to be built on a foundation of corpses, but by simply
risking casualties _ rather than steering clear of hot spots or
relying exclusively on high technology, stand-off weapons like the
cruise missile that can be fired hundreds of miles from the target
_ a different message is sent to friend and foe alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is definitely the view in some Persian Gulf
states that the US won't be willing to back them up for the long
term,'' says Shultz at the Fletcher School.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the October 1993 case of the Navy vessel USS Harlan
County, which was attempting to dock in Port-au-Prince with 218 US
and Canadian military advisers to help restore ousted Haitian
president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. When confronted with an
anti-American mob of pistol-waving goons, the ship came about and
sailed away. That humiliation resulted in another year of military
rule, another year of murder and rape in Haiti before American
troops _ in much larger numbers _ returned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why is our military so averse to casualities? What underlies
this dramatic change in attitude from, say, the days of World War
II?
</P>
<P>
   Much of it stems from Vietnam where more than 58,000 Americans
died in a war that became increasingly unpopular at home and was
broadcast into living rooms every night. The outrage over the
deaths of Americans for a seemingly meaningless country half a
world away is something that haunts the military to this day.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, military operations are evaluated for the
likelihood of success, the amount of time it will take to achieve
success, and the risk of casualties in order to accomplish the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The military's objection to putting our troops in harm's way is
often obscured in rhetoric that does not even mention force
protection. ``They start asking what our exit strategy is going to
be,'' says Trainor. ``It used to be you would go in and deal with
the immediate future. Figuring out when to get out comes in due
course, but that is just absolutely part of the Pentagon culture
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will also bristle at becoming involved in
humanitarian missions that do not have readily apparent strategic
importance. ``They will say, `This is not what we are about. We are
about fighting wars. These humanitarian or peacekeeping missions
are our operations,' '' says Shultz. ``The one service that has a
different view about this is the Marine Corps. They are willing to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is not alone in its recently found aversion to
shedding any American blood overseas; on this matter, it is in sync
with the White House and President Clinton who, after all, opposed
the Vietnam War and, while he was Rhodes scholar, wrote to an ROTC
colonel thanking the officer for ``saving me from the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, arguably, times the Pentagon could be prodded into
action by a leader able to make a forceful argument to the public.
``It takes PR campaign by a president to set the bar higher,'' says
the Brooking Instition's O'Hanlon. But Clinton is disinclined to
play that role.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere could that type of argument been made better
than in a pursuit of bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``With someone like Osama bin Laden, one can make strong
argument we should have risked special forces last summer and gone
in and seized him, and instead we fired cruise missiles, that if we
got very lucky, would have accomplished something,'' says O'Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton was feckless to do anything more, he could not
afford a tragedy in the desert. Our special forces are far better
than they were in 1980 (when the military was humiliated in a
botched attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran). We might have
had some casualties, but bin Laden is really dangerous,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Many specialists believe Americans would be more willing than
politicians and generals to sacrifice many sons and daughters for a
worthy goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of casulaties prevents us from doing things we could
do,'' says Shultz. ``If you would say to the American public,
`Osama bin Laden is a problem. He will support people who blow up
the World Trade Center and try put chemical weapons in there. This
is what is at stake and we need to go after him and it may put
Americans at risk,' they would understand and we could use
something other than cruise missiles to go after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one articulates it because inside the Beltway culture
there is a view that _ short of being invaded _ the country will
not tolerate losses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question,'' says Hillen, ``that a lot of Americans have
trouble answering is: What is worth dying for?'''

BLACK BRITONS SEE A NATION BLIND TO RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Michael Cole, a native of Nigeria who lived briefly in
the United States but has called London his home for most of his
life, says there is a difference between American racism and that
which he has experienced here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw what happened to that poor man in Texas,'' said Cole,
referring to James Byrd Jr., who was chained to the back of a
pickup truck and dragged to his death, an attack for which one
white man has been convicted and two others face trial. ``That
would never happen in Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he feels physically safer in Britain, Cole believes
there is more opportunity for blacks to scale the educational and
economic pyramid in the United States, which is why he sent his
children to live there. His son is studying at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, while his daughter is at the University
of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism is more entrenched in Britain,'' said Cole, who makes
his living as a limousine driver. ``It's at the bottom of
everything. My two children would never be as successful here as
they are in America. America has big problems, but America has
confronted its racism. England won't do it. They pay lip service.''
</P>
<P>
   Rare though it was, it was an act of racial violence that has
led many people here and the British government to confront racism
like never before. In 1993, Stephen Lawrence, 18, a black high
school student, was attacked and stabbed to death by a gang of
whites as he stood at a bus stop in South London. The police
bungled the investigation, allowing the suspects to escape
prosecution and galvanizing a minority community that has long
complained that police treat violence against them less seriously
than crimes against whites.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a government inquiry into the Lawrence slaying
concluded that London's Metropolitan Police, the largest police
force in Britain, is ``riven with pernicious and institutionalized
racism.'' Former High Court judge William Macpherson, who led the
probe, made a further point, saying the institutional racism of
London police is a symptom of a wider problem in British society.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's views are echoed by many black people here.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and informal conversations over the last six
months, there was a consensus among blacks that while the United
States has far more racial violence and racial polarization,
Britain's racism is more subtle and more pervasive, and is
exacerbated by a class system that limits access to education and
jobs and blocks social advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities in Britain say subtle racism here excludes them from
many institutions of a society that is 94 percent white and defines
itself by those institutions and their traditions. Blacks complain
that they are in, but not of, British society.
</P>
<P>
   Those who hail from former British colonies, such as Jamaica,
say Britain was more than willing to exploit their homelands during
the heady days of the British Empire, and to use them to rebuild
after World War II, but is not willing to embrace them as anything
but second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   According to government statistics, blacks are stopped randomly
and searched by police at a rate five times that of whites. But
Carl Joseph says those statistics do not convey the reality he
lives with. Last month, Joseph, a 27-year-old black butcher in
Birmingham, sued the police after they stopped and questioned him,
but never charged him, 34 times in two years.
</P>
<P>
   He lost.
</P>
<P>
   There are many who share the views of Enoch Powell, the great
parliamentary orator who died last year and whose political career
fell into disrepute in 1968 when he warned that Britain would
collapse if it continued to allow minorities from the colonies to
settle here. But when whites who share Powell's view that the
arrival of minorities since the 1950s has contributed to Britain's
loss of power and status were interviewed, they declined to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, but if you say that, everyone says you're a
racist,'' said one woman, a realtor in Highgate, a middle class
London neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, author of ``True Colours,'' a recently
published book about race relations in Britain, said denial is
common. She said most British people compare themselves favorably
with more overtly racist societies, and they believe that because
so many minorities are trying to emigrate here, complaints about
racism must be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been writing on race for 12 years and I have never met
anyone who believes that he or she is a racist,'' she said. ``We
black Britons are constantly reminded that we never had slavery,
apartheid, gas ovens, or lynching, that this country is not nasty
Germany or violent, racist America.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, since 1991, there have been at least two dozen racially
motivated murders in Britain, most of them in London. Civil rights
activists believe the true figure is much higher.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, Britain is a much more integrated and tolerant
society than America. The most popular TV newscaster is Trevor
McDonald, a black man born in Trinidad. Interracial couples are
common. As Alibhai-Brown points out, more than half of British-born
black men have a white partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have de facto integration,'' she said. ``There is a third
race emerging which will be reflected for the first time in next
year's census.''
</P>
<P>
   This is impressive in a country of 58 million that is so white,
and which has had a sizable minority population for only a
half-century. And yet racial and ethnic stereotyping, xenophobia,
and epithets are tolerated here and often appear in the popular
press, especially the tabloids that sell the most. Japanese are
routinely referred to as ``nips,'' the Irish as ``paddies,''
Germans as ``krauts.''
</P>
<P>
   Minorities are concentrated in English urban centers, with few
in Scotland and Wales or the English countryside. In London, where
more than 7 million people live and where 20 percent of the
population is minority, there are few black faces in the news
media, which are concentrated in London. Less than 2 percent of the
National Union of Journalists membership is nonwhite. Among the
staffs of 16 national newspapers, there are only 30 minority
reporters. Alibhai-Brown, who writes for The Independent, is the
only nonwhite columnist.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, the anchor on Independent TV, is an anomaly. At the
British Broadcasting Corp., 1,550 of its 20,000 employees, or 7.4
percent, are minorities, but its only black TV anchor, Moira
Stewart, has just been demoted. BBC insiders say the numbers are
deceiving, as few minorities are involved in programming.
</P>
<P>
   As Gary Robertson, who hosts a current affairs program on BBC
radio, put it, ``Most of the black people here are serving us
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   In London's myriad courthouses, the only black faces are usually
in the defendant's dock. Only about 5 percent of lawyers are
minorities, and only nine of some 1,000 judges in the highest
courts. Only 3 percent of London's police officers and 4 percent of
its firefighters are minorities. The National Health Service is is
more reflective of the population it serves. In London, 31 percent
of doctors and 29 percent of nurses are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere are blacks more conspicuous by their absence than in
the military and the police; minorities make up less than 2 percent
of the nation's police officers and 1 percent of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action is illegal here, considered reverse
discrimination. But minorities complain that the police, military,
and other institutions have never proved they really want them to
join the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The military last year launched a campaign to recruit more
blacks. But as white soldiers handed out leaflets and chatted with
passersby in Brixton, London's traditional black neighborhood,
blacks seemed more bemused than interested.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Rose, 19, a black student from Brixton, said he wouldn't
join the military because he does not believe he would have the
same opportunity as whites. Instead, he wants to become a civil
rights lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Like many blacks here, Rose was offended when, as part of the
recruitment drive, Prince Charles was dispatched to talk to some
black recruits. As the cameras rolled, Charles told the black
soldiers he knew how they felt, because he had been teased for
being a royal when he joined the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to compare his situation to the way black people are
treated in this country shows just how much in denial the British
establishment is about racism,'' said Rose.
</P>
<P>
   If Rose becomes a civil rights lawyer, he will find far fewer
statutes at his disposal than his American counterparts. The police
and other governmental agencies, for example, are excluded from
anti-discrimination laws, something the government has vowed to
change. Civil damages in discrimination suits, meanwhile, are
paltry compared with those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking privately, a London lawyer said that when he advises
corporate clients on their liability if they are found to
discriminate in hiring or business practices, ``most often the
reaction is, `We'll take our chances.' '' The risk of litigation is
so low that most companies don't worry about whether they are being
discriminatory, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that increasing numbers of Britons are
acknowledging that racism is a major problem. Recent polls show
that a majority of whites believe they receive better treatment
from the police than blacks. There are more newspaper articles and
radio and TV documentaries about racism than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest plays in London is ``The Color of Justice,''
which uses transcripts from the Lawrence inquest to paint an
unsettling portrait of official indifference and subtle racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think we're becoming more enlightened,'' said
Alibhai-Brown. ``We'll have to wait and see.''

IT IS WISE TO USE SAVINGS TO PAY A DEBT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My question is the classic dilemma: Should I use my savings
to pay a debt? I have a $53,000 CD paying 6.13 percent and maturing
in May 2000. At maturity, the value will be $59,000. This money is
not earmarked for any particular purpose, and I have other funds
for emergencies and retirement. I also have a mortgage at 7.125
percent with a current balance of $80,000. If I continue my current
schedule of regular payments plus prepayments, the balance will be
down to about $60,000 by the time the CD matures. I am seriously
thinking that I should take the CD proceeds and eliminate the
mortgage debt. That would mean losing the tax deduction, which came
to $6,000 in 1998. I am in the 28 percent tax bracket. Do you agree
with my thinking of paying down the debt?
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Sharon, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. At least at this point, this one's pretty easy to figure out.
Most people who present this question add an element of
uncertainty, which entails the debatable question of the likely
return on the funds that would be used to pay off the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But since CD rates are locked in, this one's pure mathematics.
Of course, you'll have to wait until May 2000 to see what the rates
on CDs are at that point, and also recalculate the tax benefit as
of that date, but it sounds to me that you'd probably be best off
keeping the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But let's suppose you could do the deal right now, having
$59,000 in the bank and $60,000 due on the mortgage. You would be
getting $3,616 from the CD, plus a tax deduction that's worth
$1,177 in your 28 percent tax bracket. That comes to $4,783. In
contrast, you would pay $4,203 in mortgage interest if you
maintained the mortgage. The upshot? You would be $580 ahead by not
paying off the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one additional wrinkle that you'll have to calculate
yourself. This involves the standard deduction that you would get
if you didn't itemize deductions. For tax year 1998, most people
who don't itemize will get a standard deduction of $4,250 if filing
singly, $6,250 filing as head of household, or $7,100 if married
filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   If you did not have the mortgage interest deduction, would you
still benefit by itemizing deductions? If so, the arithmetic above
pertains. But if not, you'll have to calculate the net tax effect
of the prepayment after using the applicable standard deduction,
and it could be that the arithmetic would change.
</P>
<P>
   But even if that calculation brings the numbers closer, and even
if it means you'd even gain a small amount of money by prepaying,
there's one final factor you should consider.
</P>
<P>
   This is the additional financial flexibility that you would have
by retaining the savings and continuing to plug away at the
mortgage. It sounds as if you've got your financial planning pretty
well worked out, but why not retain that additional financial
security, providing the cost is small?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 54 and we hope to retire in six
months. Our combined pensions will amount to $42,000 annually. Mine
has a modest cost-of-living adjustment and my wife's does not. We
estimate our post-retirement annual requirements at $72,000, and
that I will earn $20,000 a year from part-time employment during
the first five years of retirement. At age 60, we would go into
full retirement, and at age 62 my wife would be eligible for $8,000
a year in Social Security benefits. We have a $750,000 portfolio of
which $200,000 is in taxable large-cap stock accounts and the
remainder is in tax-deferred accounts, all but 15 percent of which
is also invested in large-cap stock funds. The rest of the
tax-deferred accounts are in utilities, fixed accounts, and the
technology sector. What do you think of our plan?
</P>
<P>
   E.L., Orange, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds to me as if you've got the world by the tail. Since
you'll need to draw only $10,000 a year from your savings during
the first five years of your retirement, you can simply divert
about $160,000 of your taxable holdings to fixed-income
investments.
</P>
<P>
   If you realized an average 6.5 percent from the fixed-income end
of the portfolio, that would supply the requisite $10,000 in yield
alone, and you wouldn't have to worry a great deal about
withdrawing principal against a sour market.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave you with $590,000 to continue growing during
those first five years of retirement. You might expect those
accounts to be worth about $867,000 by the time you enter full
retirement (based on 8 percent annual growth in that segment of the
portfolio).
</P>
<P>
   At that point (when you would be allowed to withdraw from the
tax-deferred accounts without penalty) you could divert half of
that pool, or roughly $433,500, from the stock investments to
fixed-income funds. This would bring your fixed-income yield up to
$38,177, giving you a total income stream of $80,177, plus whatever
cost-of-living adjustments have been made on your pension.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, those adjustments would be sufficient to bring the
total to $83,467, because that's the amount of money you would need
after five years to deliver the same buying power as $72,000 today,
based on an assumption of 3 percent average inflation.
</P>
<P>
   When your wife's Social Security kicks in two years later, you
could use part of it to bring you up to $88,550 (which continues
the ugly trail of that assumed inflation) and the balance . . .
well, a special vacation, a treat, or you could emulate the
grasshopper and shovel it into those stock accounts, providing more
insurance against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is, with the stock accounts amounting to $433,500
at age 60 and presumably continuing to grow as the years progress,
you should have a very, very handsome buffer against most of the
financial slings and arrows that life provides.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, I'm going to nag you about your lack of
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   I edited much of your list of investments, but it works out to
$82,500, or 11 percent of the total portfolio, that is invested
outside the large-cap stock sector. Even if you immediately moved
$160,000 into fixed-income securities as I suggest above, you would
still be too reliant on the large caps.
</P>
<P>
   The prescription is the usual one: Keep no more than 60 percent
of the stock portfolio in large caps, spreading the balance among
small- and mid-caps, international stocks, and sector funds.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite in the latter is the health-care sector; you already
have a relatively small position in a technology fund, and I like
that idea as well. Why not go with 10 percent each in small-cap
stocks, mid-cap stocks, and international stocks, and 5 percent
each in technology and health-care funds?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you recommend: term life insurance, or whole life? I
always thought that for young and healthy people, whole life is
best.
</P>
<P>
   A.S., West Hills, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not an expert on life insurance, but I would provide this
general point of view: If you are a disciplined saver, over the
long haul you would almost certainly do better if you bought term
life insurance and at the same time invested the difference in cost
between term life and whole life in a conservative no-load stock
mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the key word here is disciplined. The advantage of whole
life over term life is that the former builds cash value _ whole
life is more expensive, but a portion of the premium goes into your
cash value account.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have the discipline to maintain a regular savings
program on your own, buying whole life insurance is a fairly
painless way to build your net worth, simply by paying your whole
life insurance premiums as they fall due.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, over the last 30 years or so dozens of different kinds
of hybrid life insurance policies have been developed, some of
which allow you to specify how your cash accumulation will be
invested. So it's now no longer a term vs. whole life debate. Me, I
still like term.

BRIAN WILSON'S GETTING GOOD VIBRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ High in the Hollywood hills, tucked in a private,
gated neighborhood, lives Brian Wilson, the composer and child-like
spirit behind the Beach Boys. A white, contemporary Corvette sits
in the driveway of his impressive stone mansion, which sits across
the street from the fortresslike home of Shaquille O'Neal of the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just met him once,'' says Wilson, a devoted, stay-at-home
basketball viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Up the street is the home of rocker John Fogerty, though Wilson
doesn't see much of him, either.
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon sun starts to set, Wilson, a noted recluse, is
tapping away at one of the three pianos in his ornately furnished,
antique-filled home. He has just finished a phone call, then dashed
to the piano to unwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of glued to the piano,'' he says after a few minutes.
``I can't do anything without a piano. I have to be at a piano all
the time. It's something I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Widely perceived as an eccentric genius, Wilson, 56, even has a
piano in his garage. He has never studied classical music (``except
for the `Switched-On Bach' album that I play now and then,'' he
says, laughing), but instead cites such pop influences as Phil
Spector, the Four Freshmen, Rosemary Clooney, and ``of course Chuck
Berry _ you can't forget him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is very open about his emotional problems _ he's been
called an LSD casualty and reportedly suffered physical abuse as a
child _ but is heading out on a concert tour that stops at the
Berklee Performance Center June 21. (No ticket information is
available yet). The date was announced at a recent Berklee
function, but Wilson says he does not yet know of it. His wife,
Melinda, who coordinates his business affairs, says the show has
been booked, but that Brian is only told of the next three or four
dates in his schedule, so as not to worry him that the tour could
be too long.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson will be backed by the band the Wondermints, with possibly
a horn section added. He'll dip into songs from last year's solo
album, ``Imagination'' (which saw one tune cowritten with Jimmy
Buffett), but the bulk of the set will consist of Beach Boys hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are familiar with them and they're good tunes. I'm
proud of my tunes,'' says Wilson, sitting on a couch with a blanket
drawn across his legs. With his nervous, darting eyes, he looks
vulnerable, and he tends to answer questions with short, sometimes
awkward, replies. But he's also extremely polite and gives the
impression that he still loves music, even if he has a right to be
cynical, since his solo albums have sold much less than his Beach
Boys records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected my last solo album to sell a lot better than it
did. I don't know what to do. I'm just heartsick about it,'' Wilson
says. ``I was so hurt that it didn't sell, but dammit, maybe the
next one will.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next one, he says, ``Maybe we'll make a real rock 'n'
roll record if we can get up the nerve. More uptempo stuff, like
Phil Spector's things.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for his tour, Wilson has changed his diet to include
more vegetables and fruits (``I have to get off red meat pretty
soon'') and is doing a lot of walking to build stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get my life in a niche,'' he says. ``I walk on a
treadmill and I walk uphill in the neighborhood. I've been doing
that for three or four months now. I'm in pretty good shape. My
body is feeling strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my emotions are still tattered and screwed up,'' he adds.
``I've got a lot of screwed-up, mixed-up feelings about life. I
can't figure it out, so I just go and keep doing my exercises and
think, `This is good for me. This is good for me. Keep doing this.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's continued search for stability includes a new family.
He has two grown-up daughters (Carnie and Wendy were in the
early-'90s group Wilson Philips) from a previous marriage. He and
his new wife, Melinda, adopted two young girls, Daria and Delanie,
each 3 years old. They were running around the house as he spoke,
though each was with a nanny.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who is no longer involved with controversial therapist
Dr. Eugene Landy, has been seeing another psychiatrist weekly for
the past five years and uses two anti-depressants.
</P>
<P>
   Although known for having experimented with the hallucinogen LSD
in the '60s, Wilson now advises young people, ``Don't do that.
Don't take acid. . . . Acid shattered my head to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   About his overall mental health, he says, ``I'm trying to figure
out when I was happy in my life, because I feel a little bit
confused at this time. . . . But things are better than they were a
few years ago. I was dumping (emotional baggage) real heavy back
then. But I'm getting through it. I'm getting through this last
phase of dumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going pretty well, except for the scared feelings
that I get. I get my fair dose of scareds. It's just something I
have to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   He termed his last album, ``Imagination,'' a record ``that can
heal emotional wounds.'' It featured a collaboration with former
Bostonian Andy Paley (with whom Wilson wrote another batch of songs
that may be released eventually) as well as the Buffett
collaboration, ``South American,'' about a man longing to chase his
dreams in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real experience to work with (Buffett), one I'll
remember for quite some time,'' says Wilson. ``He wrote the lyrics
to the song and sang on the record. He's a quick study. He's
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The album, which runs the gamut from the poignant ``Cry'' (a
ballad penned after a quarrel with Melinda) to the uplifting
``Happy Days'' (``my favorite song on the album,'' he says) also
contains the masterful vocal harmonies for which he is known. He
multi-tracked the lead vocals and harmonies many times to get the
trademark sound he first carved out with the Beach Boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tedious. Oh boy, it was something else,'' he says.
``Every five seconds, I'm going, `Oh, I can't get these notes
right.' I'd stop the machine, roll it again, then stop again. As I
remember, there were some days that I never thought I'd get through
it and get the session done, but I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson remains blissfully unaware of most modern trends (``I
listen to oldies-but-goodies stations,'' he says) and is ``totally
out of touch with hip-hop.'' But his name keeps popping into the
spotlight _ most recently when the popular rock band Garbage won
his permission to use his Beach Boys lyric ``don't worry, baby'' in
one of their songs; and when the boxed set of the sessions for
``Pet Sounds'' (his most famous Beach Boys album and an
experimental precursor to the Beatles's ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band'') was nominated for a Grammy this year for best
historical album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul McCartney sent me a message congratulating me for `Pet
Sounds' being nominated,'' says Wilson. ``I was really pumped up by
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is also pumped up by the thought of rejoining the Beach
Boys after his tour: ``I've had dreams about going back and
rejoining them _ of starting a brand new life and career.''
</P>
<P>
   He was shocked by the sudden death last year of younger brother
Carl (another Beach Boy founder), apologizing that ``Carl and I had
drifted apart. . . . We were close in 1966 when we did `Good
Vibrations,' but he and I later kept our distance from each other
for some crazy reason.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also had his ups and downs with Beach Boys singer Mike
Love, his cousin. Love successfully sued him three years ago,
claiming that he wrote a number of lyrics for Beach Boys songs for
which Brian got credit. Still, Wilson calls him a ``genius singer''
and someone he'd like to work with again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike got me good. I had to give him some money,'' says Wilson.
``But he deserved it. There are no hard feelings. Hard feelings
just drag you down at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BRIAN WILSON ON THE RECORD:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _On ``Pet Sounds,'' his 1966 masterpiece with the Beach Boys:
``When I hear it today, I say, `Oh my God, I did that? How could I
do that?' In your youth, you burn off a lot of energy and get down
to the nitty-gritty.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _On his influence: ``I run into people on the street and at
restaurants. They'll walk up to me and say, `Brian, you'll never
know what your music has meant to me.' It's such a pump-up, such a
great feeling. It makes me very proud that I've made someone
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _His favorite artists: ``I still like Paul McCartney. I think
his music is so good. And, of course, I mention Phil Spector at
least 100 times a day, thinking of his great records.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Top Ten hits by the Beach Boys (in chronological order):
``Surfin' U.S.A.,'' ``Surfer Girl,'' `Be True to Your School,''
``Fun, Fun, Fun,'' ``I Get Around,'' ``When I Grow Up (To Be a
Man),'' ``Dance, Dance, Dance,'' ``Help Me, Rhonda,'' ``California
Girls,'' ``Barbara Ann,'' ``Sloop John B,'' ``Good Vibrations,''
``Wouldn't It Be Nice,'' ``Rock and Roll Music,'' ``Kokomo.''

CRIME AND COMEDY DO PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the piquant vernacular of his native England, Guy Ritchie's
life these days ``is the nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   His first film, ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' has
been the biggest thing to come out of his homeland since the Spice
Girls, recently nominated as best British film by the British
Academy of Film and Television Arts. It was also one of the few
films to emerge from this year's snow-capped Sundance Film Festival
with an avalanche of well-deserved hype.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie's gaudy filmmaking style and sharp ear for dialogue are
drawing favorable comparisons to Martin Scorsese and Quentin
Tarantino. And in the tabloids at home and abroad, he has been been
linked in lust _ which he strenuously denies _ with none other than
Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Ritchie with a smile, ``I suppose it's all
downhill from here, d'ya know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' which opens Friday, is
the 30-year-old filmmaker's swaggering debut. A London crime-caper
comedy, the film stars Jason Flemyng, Nick Moran, Jason Statham,
and Dexter Fletcher as a quartet of would-be players who get played
when Moran's card shark Eddie loses a rigged high-stakes poker game
against vicious underworld boss Hatchet Harry (P. H. Moriarty).
Eddie not only loses the 100,000 pounds raised by his buddies to
get him into the game, but finds himself 500,000 pounds in the hole
to Harry. Either the boys pay up within a week, or Harry's debt
collector, Big Chris (Vinnie Jones), will start removing fingers as
collateral. Singer Sting also has a featured role, as Eddie's
tough-as-nails bartender father.
</P>
<P>
   It's a slice of ``Mean Streets,'' seasoned with ``Reservoir
Dogs,'' plus a zesty dash of ``GoodFellas''; of course, movies
about witty, razor-tongued lowlifes will always draw such
parallels. But ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' written and
directed by Ritchie, is as quintessentially British as royal
inbreeding. This is the England of soccer hooligans, the Krays, and
way too many pints hoisted in bloodied fists. Set in London's
ferocious East End, this is bare-knuckle Britian stripped of its
Merchant-Ivory manners and mores, revealing all the nasty little
things that happen behind the queen's back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ritchie steered clear of turning his film into a bloodfest _
which is saying a lot, given that various folks are knocked off
with everything from car doors to sex toys to very noisy, very big
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like gratuitous violence, and I didn't think we needed
it,'' Ritchie said. ``I don't like when people have to cover their
eyes and turn away from the screen; it's a nasty trick to pull on
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his characters have a definite taste for violence, and
they're the sort of colorful thugs and mugs Ritchie and the film's
stars have known most of their lives. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bare-knuckle Britain &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These are characters we've all met along in our travels, and
Guy decided to stick them in a film,'' said Statham, who plays
Bacon. He was recently in Boston, along with Ritchie and Flemyng,
to talk up the film. ``These are stories we've heard just by living
life in London. It's a pretty colorful place, and you're gonna meet
all kinds of blokes.''
</P>
<P>
   With his closely buzzed hair and voice like steel wool, Statham
is one of those blokes. He's new to this acting thing, having spent
a good chunk of his 31 years as a street huckster with an eye for
suckers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to sit on a crate with a suitcase full of jewelery and
perfume. That's a trade I've been involved in since I was 9 years
old,'' said Statham, who re-creates his former life in the film's
opening. ``That's how I put bread on the table. I'm not proud of
it, but I'm not unproud of it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Statham was not Ritchie's only unconventional casting choice.
For Big Chris, Ritchie got Vinnie Jones, a notorious British soccer
star who once chomped a journalist on the nose _ think Dennis
Rodman with a rap sheet. And for thick-necked Barry the Baptist,
named for his propensity for drowning his victims, Ritchie cast
Lenny McLean, a well-known British boxer. (McLean died last year,
and the film is dedicated to him.)
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie wanted his cast to create a ``perfect balance'' of
acting expertise and streetwise experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this movie, I wanted authenticity. I'm more interested in
him,'' he said, pointing at Statham, ``than your stereotypical
English thespian. In America, you have Al Pacino, who can play a
gangster, but it just doesn't work that way in the UK. You have to
have people that are from a working-class background and understand
that ethic. You pretty much have to hire gangsters to play
gangsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the blending of professionals and novices never undermined
the production, said Flemyng, who plays Tom. If anything, he said,
it added to the film set's loose ambience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people, when they're filming, think a serious set is
conducive to productive work and anything else is trivializing,
which is so not true,'' said Flemyng, 32, an established actor who
has appeared in such films as ``Alive and Kicking'' and ``Rob
Roy.'' ``If you're working out of joy, excitement, and fun, the
work reflects that. And that mood is set from the top down.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top was Ritchie, who admitted the film's crew had far
more experience than he himself. He always knew he wanted to make
feature films, even when he was spending his days directing what he
called ``crappy'' videos for German rave bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the UK, we don't have film school like films school over
here, so there's only one option, and that's videos. They're
basically short films and narrative-based. I did them for a year,
and I think it's important not to do them longer than a year,
because then you're only recognized as a video director.''
</P>
<P>
   With his video days in a rearview mirror, Ritchie is now
mentioned alongside Scorsese and Tarantino, even though he isn't
sure how to take such comparisons. ``It depends how they mean it,
doesn't it? If it's thought to be a derivative thing, then it's not
good; if it's `in the same arena as,' then it's much better. People
like to compartmentalize these things, and I understand that.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not affected by Boyle &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he scoffs at those who liken his film to Danny Boyle's edgy,
hilarious 1996 junkie opus, ``Trainspotting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one thing I'm confident of it's that I had no
influence from `Trainspotting,' '' he said. ``As far as influence
goes, Tarantino has, Scorsese certainly has, the Coen brothers
have. But I'm not influenced by Danny Boyle's filmmaking techniques
in the slightest.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, like Boyle's film, ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels'' was a small film that blew up with moviegoers. It cost a
measly $1.6 million, and has pulled in more than $20 million _ a
ransom by British standards, Ritchie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came out in August in the UK, and it's done better than any
other English film this year,'' said Ritchie. ``Obviously, that
puts pressure on No. 2. To a degree, I didn't want too much stink
on the first one because then it seems like you can only slide on
the second film.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie has begun work on that second film, tentatively called
``Diamonds,'' a James Bond-esque thriller. He wanted to call it
``Helter Skelter,'' but thought audiences would confuse it with the
Vincent Bugliosi book, and 1976 TV miniseries, about the August
1969 murders by Charles Manson and his ragtag ``family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's a great name, and I've always loved the
track (by the Beatles),'' he said. ``I just think `Helter Skelter'
for the name of a film is the nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he can't get the film title he wants, Ritchie finally
has something he has never enjoyed before _ job security. Beyond
``Diamonds,'' he has guarantees for two more films. That means,
Ritchie says, he'll be drawing a salary for the next five years,
which isn't bad for a man who less than a year ago was so broke he
was resigned to ``kipping'' (that's ``sleeping'' to us Yanks) on
the floor of a friend's flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all been pretty gratifying, but after all the struggle,
it now seems like everything is happening very fast,'' Ritchie
said. ``But I'm not complaining. This is where I want to be. It's a
good thing, d'ya know what I mean?''

HILLARY CLINTON WOULD HAVE TOUGH RACE IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TADHG DOOLEY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ President Clinton is still popular among New
Yorkers, but First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton would not have a
free ride to the Senate is she decides to run for the seat being
vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000, according to a recent
Siena College poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which surveyed 556 New Yorkers in February before the
televised Monica Lewinsky interview, revealed that President
Clinton's approval rating was still comfortably high at 68 percent.
However, only 43 percent of those polled approved of the first
lady's possible bid for a Senate seat in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This was the most surprising result of the survey, said Thomas
O. Kelly II, codirector of the Siena Research Institute in Colonie,
N.Y., an Albany suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means is that she won't have a head start in the
race should she run,'' Kelly said. ``(The race) might not be quite
the cakewalk that supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton believe.''
The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady has said she is considering a run for the Senate
seat, even though she is not a resident. New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani is widely considered to be the frontrunner for the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found that some of President Clinton's proposals,
such as investing some Social Security funds in the stock market,
were poorly received.
</P>
<P>
   On that issue, 61 percent disapproved of the president's plan,
while two thirds of the respondents favored the Republican
suggestion that people be allowed to manage a percentage of their
own Social Security accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But on Clinton's plan of using some of the federal surplus to
support Social Security, those polled backed the president.
</P>
<P>
   On a state level, 61 percent approved of the way New York Gov.
George Pataki was handling his job. This number is down from 74
percent in December, the first of the monthly polls taken by the
research institute.

SLAYING OF TOURISTS SHOWS ANTI-US SENTIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ The killing of eight foreign tourists in Uganda
provides grim new evidence of rising hostility against Western
interests in a region fragmented by diverse and intertwined
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The victims _ four Britons, two Americans, and two New
Zealanders _ were abducted and slain Monday in Bwindi National
Park, the forests that draw visitors hoping to see rare mountain
gorillas. Notes attached to their bodies read: ``Americans and
British, we don't want you on our land. You support the enemy.''
Hutu extremists are suspected.
</P>
<P>
   That enemy: Rwanda and Uganda, neighboring states entangled in
three overlapping African wars. Washington regards the two
countries as strategic allies.
</P>
<P>
   But Rwanda and Uganda are surrounded by nations and diverse
rebel militias that despise Rwanda's and Uganda's governments and
would prefer to see them overthrown. All blame Washington and
Britain for keeping the two states afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is strong resentment for anybody with unquestionable
support for Uganda and Rwanda,'' said Jan van Eck, an expert on
Central African conflict at the University of Cape Town. ``The US
and Britain have become the enemy in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   That US policy in Africa could bring retaliation was made clear
by the bombs that ripped through American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania last August. Such acts of terrorism were previously
unheard of in the region, and many African analysts believe the
attacks were sparked by Washington's stance against Sudan, which it
has branded as a sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in Uganda last week, analysts say, reflects a
different strain of anti-American hostility. But the two attacks
may have a common denominator. Washington sends military and other
assistance to Uganda and Rwanda primarily to bolster them against
Sudan, which shares Uganda's northern border. That support is
unpopular in the region, particularly among displaced Rwandan Hutu
militias and at least seven African states that regard Uganda and
Rwanda as the aggressors in a seven-month war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutu militias suspected of attacking the tourists in Uganda
belong to a group known as the Interahamwe. In 1994, these rebels
led a three-month spree in Rwanda that killed from 500,000 to a
million people, most of them ethnic Tutsi. When the Tutsi-led
military took power, the rebels fled to eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The Interahamwe have launched cross-border attacks into Rwanda
and Uganda, whose president, Yoweri Museveni, they regard as the
main Tutsi sponsor. They are also suspected of carrying out attacks
against Westerners in retaliation for US support of the two states.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutu ``have seen the US as the bogeyman ever since the Tutsi
came to power,'' said Peter Rosenblum, director of Harvard
University's human rights program. ``They have been threatening
Americans and other Westerners in Rwanda ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 18, 1997, for example, four armed men suspected of being
Hutu rebels attacked a house in Uganda run by the aid agency
Doctors of the World. Three Spanish health workers were killed, and
an American, Nitin Madhav, was shot eight times and subsequently
lost his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, abducted four foreign tourists and seven Congolese
guides were abducted during a gorilla trek in Uganda's Bwindi
National Park. Two Swedes and one New Zealander are still missing.
Hutu rebels are suspected.
</P>
<P>
   In the attack last week, 31 foreign tourists were abducted from
Bwindi early Monday, allegedly by Hutu rebels. The attackers took
14 of their captives on a long trek toward Congo, and killed eight
with clubs and machetes. The remaining six were released with a
message warning the West to stop supporting Rwanda's government.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan officials, working with FBI officials who flew into the
country, launched a massive search into eastern Congo for the
abductors. Lieutenant Colonel Benon Biraro of the Ugandan Army said
Rwandan troops killed 15 rebels in Congo Wednesday. There was no
independent confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Hutu threat, Rwanda and Uganda are embroiled in a
deepening multinational war in the middle of the African continent.
The two countries covet eastern Congo, across their borders, as a
security buffer against attacks by Hutu, Sudanese, and other
militia groups.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Rwanda and Uganda sponsored a rebel insurgency
against President Laurant Kabila of Congo. A handful of countries
rallied to Kabila's defense, and, once again, the countries now
fighting Rwanda and Uganda have deepening reasons to despise their
Western backers.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of the region last year, Susan Rice, the US
assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, was repeatedly
rebuffed by one head of state after another. The Zimbabwean
president, Robert Mugabe, for example, made her wait outside his
office for hours before admitting her.
</P>
<P>
   Rice and her advisers ``were shaken by the response in a fair
number of African capitals,'' said Peter Takirumbudde, a Ugandan
director of the Africa program for Human Rights Watch. ``The
response was so hostile in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and
Angola.'' In backing Kabila in opposition to Rwanda and Uganda,
``those countries see the role they are playing in Congo as pay
back,'' Takirumbudde said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutu make up 85 percent of the Rwandan population, Tutsis 14
percent. The Hutu struggle against Rwanda and Uganda is based on a
desire to regain power over a tiny ruling minority, backed by the
United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But some African leaders have more personal reasons. During his
tour of Africa last year, President Clinton praised the vision and
courage of Uganda's Museveni, who is seen in Washington as one of
the two or three most influential and promising African leaders.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe furious. Having freed his
own country from white rule in 1980, Mugabe sees himself as a
father of African liberation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mugabe is very sensitive to any overshadowing,'' Van Eck said.
Mugabe backed Kabila, at least in part, because ``he sees Museveni
as attempting to build a Tutsi empire'' in eastern Congo, Van Eck
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and Western diplomats are hesitant to read too much
into the latest attack on the tourists. Even if it fits into a
pattern of violent Hutu extremism, it is too soon to say whether it
indicates that that violence is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   But James Woods, a former senior US military adviser on Africa,
says it is cause for concern. ``There is a strong strain of
anti-Americanism in the Congo. They are asking, `Why are you
Americans doing this to us?' '' Woods said, referring to US backing
for Rwanda and Uganda.

HILLARY CLINTON WOULD HAVE TOUGH RACE IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TADHG DOOLEY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ President Clinton is still popular among New
Yorkers, but First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton would not have a
free ride to the Senate is she decides to run for the seat being
vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000, according to a recent
Siena College poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which surveyed 556 New Yorkers in February before the
televised Monica Lewinsky interview, revealed that President
Clinton's approval rating was still comfortably high at 68 percent.
However, only 43 percent of those polled approved of the first
lady's possible bid for a Senate seat in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This was the most surprising result of the survey, said Thomas
O. Kelly II, codirector of the Siena Research Institute in Colonie,
N.Y., an Albany suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means is that she won't have a head start in the
race should she run,'' Kelly said. ``(The race) might not be quite
the cakewalk that supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton believe.''
The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady has said she is considering a run for the Senate
seat, even though she is not a resident. New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani is widely considered to be the frontrunner for the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found that some of President Clinton's proposals,
such as investing some Social Security funds in the stock market,
were poorly received.
</P>
<P>
   On that issue, 61 percent disapproved of the president's plan,
while two thirds of the respondents favored the Republican
suggestion that people be allowed to manage a percentage of their
own Social Security accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But on Clinton's plan of using some of the federal surplus to
support Social Security, those polled backed the president.
</P>
<P>
   On a state level, 61 percent approved of the way New York Gov.
George Pataki was handling his job. This number is down from 74
percent in December, the first of the monthly polls taken by the
research institute.

GUN MAKERS THINK SMALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With 30 states now allowing concealed weapons, gun
makers, including Massachusetts' Smith &AMP; Wesson, are mounting a
major marketing effort to sell powerful new pistols that fit in the
palm of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   These ultracompacts are less than 7 inches long and can hold as
many as 10 large-caliber cartridges. They are being pitched by the
industry as ``Modern Mini-Mines,'' ``Stealth Weapons,'' and
``Glock's New Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more killing power per ounce, per bullet, per buck,
than any other gun,'' said David Kairys, a Temple University law
professor and a researcher on gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of these ``pocket rockets'' is no coincidence,
according to the National Rifle Association, which credited its
successful drive for state concealed-weapons laws in the mid-1990s
with creating a new market for guns. Earlier models lacked the
firepower or were harder to conceal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy to conceal. Easy to Fire. Easy to acquire,'' says a
Beretta ad for its new Cougar pistol. ``Small in a very big way,''
reads the new ad for the Glock 26 and 27. ``Lighter. Completely
concealable. Plenty of fire power,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ad from Smith &AMP; Wesson, which is based in
Springfield, highlights the new 9mm Chief's Special as smaller than
a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Recent government statistics show that the number of compact
weapons used in crimes almost tripling since 1995, a fact that
gun-control advocates say is likely to be used by cities such as
Boston that plan to sue gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The cities are expected to argue in court that these types of
pistols are part of an industry trend toward designing, marketing,
and selling weapons with bigger firepower and greater wounding
potential, according to academics and lawyers familiar with gun
industry litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guns incorporate all the features of enhanced lethality
that contributed to the upsurge of violence that began in the late
'80s,'' said Tom Diaz, author of ``Making a Killing: The Business
of Guns in America,'' and a former congressional staffer
specializing in gun-control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Requests for comment from Smith &AMP; Wesson were referred to trade
industry representatives. Other Northeast manufacturers of ``pocket
rockets'' are Connecticut-based Colt's Manufacturing Corp., and
SIGARMS of Exeter, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Painter, executive director of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, said the gun industry is not making more-dangerous or
more-lethal guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any industry, we are producing more-efficient products,
as all industries do when they develop new technologies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the smaller pistols would be attractive to criminals,
Painter said, that does not mean the industry targets that
population. ``It is one of the most absurd notions that any
industry would market a product to criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Feldman, president of American Shooting Sports Council,
another gun-industry trade group, said, ``It's not the
manufacturer's responsbility to keep guns out of the hands of
criminals, it's the responsiblity of the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry literature reveals that the real boost in sales and
technological innovations that led to the small-pistol revolution
started three years ago when the NRA wrapped up a drive to pass
state ``right-to-carry'' laws, allowing gun owners to legally carry
a concealed weapon.
</P>
<P>
   According to the literature, these law changes across the nation
created an economic windfall for the industry at a time when sales
of hunting and sport-shooting guns were declining.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Interarms Inc., a handgun-marketing firm, called the
concealed weapon movement ``the most important star on the
horizon.'' It released a nationwide survey of dealers that found
more than 80 percent were selling more firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Shooting Industry magazine reported, ``The guns
that are selling during this sales trough in the industry'' are
because of the new concealed weapons laws.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA campaign continues, and legislation to allow concealed
weapons continues in many states, including Minnesota, Kansas, New
Mexico, Nebraska, Colorado, and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of compact pistols already are being tied to crime,
according to data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ATF does not categorize its statistics by gun size
or caliber, an analysis by the Violence Policy Center, a Washington
gun-control research group, showed that in 1995, 2,497 guns that
fit the definition of a ``pocket rocket'' were recovered by the
ATF.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, that number had almost tripled, with 6,909 such weapons
traced to crimes. A total of 13,681 were traced to crimes between
1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Vince, former director of the ATF's gun-tracing unit who
runs a Maryland consulting group called Crime Gun Solutions, said
he believes the agency's figures are conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just beginning to see criminals gravitating toward these
weapons that are smaller and more powerful and easily
concealable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done for criminals is increased their chance of
being more effective, of hitting their target and hitting it
repeatedly.''

FAITHFUL CUSTOMERS DEMANDING BETTER DEALS _ AND GETTING THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After aggressively pursuing new customers with perks and
discounts, telecommunications and credit card companies are waking
up to the cry of loyal customers who say they're being taken for
granted and want some of these special deals.
</P>
<P>
   Faithful customers say they are being treated as fools and they
are lighting up company phone lines and clogging e-mail files after
hearing about neighbors and colleagues getting $100 ``win-back''
checks, free cell phones and low introductory credit card rates
just for being new _ not old _ customers.
</P>
<P>
   And while the extravaganza of deals has created a new breed of
fickle consumer, who jumps from one deal to the next, loyal
customers can't help but feel slightly ripped off even as they
grumble that all these bargain-hunters ought to get a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bread and butter customers are finding out about these
deals,'' said Susan Fournier, associate professor of marketing at
the Harvard Business School. ``And they start to feel alienated and
aggravated.''
</P>
<P>
   Fournier said she was miffed four months ago when she discovered
a friend was getting AT&AMP;T's long-distance plan of a dime a minute
with no monthly charge for the first six months. She was paying $5
a month for the same 10 cents a minute plan.
</P>
<P>
   She got on the phone with AT&AMP;T and demanded, ``I want the same
deal or I'm outta here.'' (She got it.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed some companies are starting to respond, especially as
they feel more secure in the marketplace. Bell Atlantic Mobile last
year started offering longtime wireless customers the same
promotions, such as free off-peak calling time, as new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   In its new emphasis on rewarding loyalty, John Palmer, marketing
director for Bell Atlantic's Northeast region, said longtime
customers are also being given greater benefits, such as two months
of free voice-activated calling. New customers get one month of
that perk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to take the risk that our customers are looking
for other deals,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   In a program like the airlines' frequent-flyer programs, AT&AMP;T
plans this spring to debut a new loyalty rewards offer that will
cut across all of its long-distance, local, Internet and wireless
services, said marketing director Vincent Raguseo. Loyal customers
will get financial perks for their longevity with the company and
for the amount of their usage in different services.
</P>
<P>
   Raguseo said AT&AMP;T heard loud and clear from loyal customers who
weren't happy about being ignored. He said the company itself
wasn't pleased about the chronic switchers or ``churners,'' as they
are known in the telecommunications world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's largest credit card issuers, First USA,
based in Wilmington, Del., began offering in the past couple years
special cards for long-term cardholders who are jazz enthusiasts,
bicyclists or scuba divers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Unkle, spokesman for First USA, said members received
discount tickets and hobby newsletters. In the next year, he said,
the company hopes to unveil other new loyalty programs to reduce
the number of ``rate-hoppers'' who jump from one low-introductory
teaser rate to another.
</P>
<P>
   The howl of the loyal customer isn't usually heard in business
world, said many marketing specialists. In the past, companies
assumed, often accurately, that most people were too lazy to
switch.
</P>
<P>
   Also, consumers in generations past were less aware of what
their neighbor was paying for the same product or service,
according to marketing executives. They didn't live in today's
information-saturated environment where the news media and Internet
offer many price comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bund, senior lecturer at the Sloan School of Management
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who specializes in
marketing, said there is a new respect for the ``good buyer'' who
knows how to research information for monetary advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's culturally acceptable to talk about, even admirable, to
talk about how smart a shopper you are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Deighton, a marketing professor at the Harvard Business
School, agreed that consumers are more knowledgeable about the
marketplace and companies realize they can't just bank on inertia
to keep a customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies need to use price to retain customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially so in industries such as long-distance or
cellular phones, where switching is so easy. It's not like Internet
or cable services, where switching means you get a new e-mail
address or wait for a visit from an installer.
</P>
<P>
   James Levine, a retired engineer, said he had always heard about
bargain-hunting in the telecommunications world, mostly from a
colleague who got about $130 in checks within two years after
switching back and forth between AT&AMP;T and MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Levine got into the deal-hunting game with his new cell phone.
After getting a free phone with a one-year contract with Bell
Atlantic Mobile last year, he shopped around and found a better
deal with Cellular One at $9.95 a month. Cellular One also offered
him $50 to switch. Bell Atlantic Mobile couldn't match the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Levine believes, however, that marketers are making a mistake if
they don't start thinking about ``loyal-customer presents.'' He
said customers like him will always be hunting for the best deal.
When his cell phone contract expires in June, he'll be on the phone
with competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's fun,'' he confessed. ``You actually haggle.
It's a game. It's a marvelous game.''

I'S ROCKET SCIENCE AT BU'S PHYSICS LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAC DANIEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daniel Cotton, a 34-year-old assistant research professor at
Boston University, is coming down with something. His shirt is
wrinkled, his tie is askew, and he's coughing.
</P>
<P>
   His mind, however, is not on his health. It's pondering his
satellite. With a few short weeks to launch day, Cotton said
space-based nightmares are keeping him awake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream about the launch and see it tip over and go out of the
control,'' he said of the satellite, which currently sits in a
locked room at Boston University's Center for Space Physics. ``On
launch day, it's either going to be fat and happy or there's going
to be something wrong. And that's all I really think about.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4 1/2 years ago, Cotton came up with a novel idea, a means
of surveying the earth's ionosphere and thermosphere in three
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   It was an experiment that could help advance solar-terrestrial
studies and provide a better understanding of space weather, as
well as the ionosphere and the thermosphere, the ever-changing
outer layers of atmosphere that play large roles in ground-based
communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going from an X-ray to a CAT scan,'' said Cotton.
``We'll be seeking far more detail.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the only reasonable means to perform such research
was through suborbital rocket launches, packages that returned to
earth after 10 minutes of flight, snatching small amounts of data
from the skies. An orbital satellite would be perfect, but
prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton and other BU officials knew this, and consequently timed
their proposal to jibe with NASA's announcement of a new program to
provide money to have universities build, test and operate
inexpensive scientific satellites.
</P>
<P>
   It was precedent-setting news at BU when Cotton's proposal,
co-written with his peers at BU's Center For Space Physics, won
approval from NASA. But then came the hard part. They had to
actually build the device that, up to then, was just an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a huge task,'' said Cotton, whose passion is
tweaked more by research than the wonkish detail involved in
building a satellite. ``Here I am, a research scientist, and I was
suddenly in charge of getting a space bus built.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the TERRIERS satellite (Tomographic Experiment using
Radiative Recombinative Ionospheric EUV and Radio Sources) sits on
the fifth floor of a Boston University building on Commonwealth
Avenue. Stored in a ``clean room'' to avoid instrument
contamination by dust or hand oils, it is being tested and readied
for liftoff on April 7 from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, where Steely Dan songs are playing and a picture of
the Star Wars character Yoda adorns the computer, is the
satellite's command center. The mission commander is 23-year-old
Janine Lyn, and the room is often packed with a select group of
physics or astronomy students who came to BU never thinking they'd
have a chance to play such vital roles in a major space research
program _ let alone to operate a satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guidance counselor said to me during summer orientation:
Would you rather flip burgers at the student union or control a
satellite?'' said Emily Lyman, a 19-year-old freshman from Albany,
N.Y. ``I chose the satellite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing experience for a freshman year,'' said Jeremy
Coombs, 18, a freshman from New Britain, Conn. ``It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The program would have been unheard of just a few years ago.
Students rarely got involved in such expensive projects. But
through NASA's Universities Space Research Association _ which
hopes to demonstrate that successful satellites can be built
cheaply and differently _ the dream for students like Lyman and
Coombs has become reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some students started at zero,'' Cotton said. ``It's a
completely student-run project.''
</P>
<P>
   BU officials said the program is already a success, even though
the satellite is still on the ground. With the awarding of the
TERRIERS satellite grant, the university built the research tools
while an outside contractor built the ``bus,'' the satellite
vehicle on which the experiments will be carried.
</P>
<P>
   And while all of BU's instrument package came in under budget
and on time, the contractor that made the satellite was both late
and over budget.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of BU's satellite project is about $4 million. If this
had been contracted more traditionally, the project could have been
10 to 20 times more expensive, according to Dr. Supriya
Chakrabarti, an associate professor of astronomy at BU and co-head
of the TERRIERS program with Cotton. BU was the primary contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the program first began, colleagues had said that for $4
million all you cold build were toys,'' said Chakrabarti. ``So now
we've proved them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But the crux of the program _ and the real worry _ has yet to
begin. In 1996, when an Ariane 5 rocket blew up seconds after
liftoff, 10 years of work by researchers at the University of New
Hampshire blew up with it.
</P>
<P>
   The TERRIERS satellite will be sent out to California later this
month in a huge purple container. It will be launched much like a
guided missile from an aircraft at 50,000 feet. Launch is scheduled
for 8 p.m. Pacific time on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the satellite will orient itself to the sun,
begin charging its batteries and start feeding data back to a BU
rooftop. And Prof. Cotton may finally get some rest.

   NATCHEZ, Miss. _ Its thin-walled classrooms were put up to
educate ``Negroes'' at a time when emancipation was a
quarter-century old, but integration was still a dream deferred.
</P>
<P>
   As Holy Family School, it endured for decades, held together by
the firm love of its nuns, and now calls itself the oldest black
Catholic school in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When the orders of nuns began to die out, the school hired lay
teachers and raised tuition. Yet the parents paid, despite their
poverty, despite the fact that most weren't Catholic, because even
after desegregation, Holy Family was still the best education in a
city that clung to its antebellum past.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the factories left, and with them, many
students. After 109 years, Holy Family faced its first real threat
of closing. Everything, it seemed, had left the school behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except the problems,'' says Sister Marie Santry.
</P>
<P>
   The problems, and Sister Marie.
</P>
<P>
   A compact bustle of gray hair and bright eyes, she arrived here
from Ipswich, Mass. 18 months ago because she asked the church to
send her where she was needed most. As much schmoozer and
saleswoman as nun, she has made it her mission as principal to save
this ramshackle success story, in steps however small. It was that
mission that brought her knocking at the door of Boston College
last summer, wondering whether that Catholic institution _ one of
the nation's wealthiest _ could help one so much less well-endowed.
</P>
<P>
   Two vanfuls of BC students arrived in early March, driving 48
hours straight to spend spring break here. They brought with them
$6,000 in donations. They put paint on walls that hadn't seen a
fresh coat in years, built a sandbox on a playground that is
otherwise a barren stretch of cement, repaired two sets of fallen
stairs. And they left having hatched plans to solicit more money,
schoolbooks and supplies, as well as to set up a scholarship fund
and an endowment to help pay back a $100,000 loan the school took
out to stave off closing last fall.
</P>
<P>
   As the uniformed Holy Family students, ages 2 to 12, watched
their visitors from the north sweep in with paintbrushes and
hammers, Sister Marie insisted that the BC students are her
school's best hope for survival. The BC students, and the families
here, marvel more at the miracle of Sister Marie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the grounds _ the fact that people would send
their children here says something about the quality of the
education,'' said Jeanenne Angelini, a junior at BC's School of
Education. ``As far as teaching, it's the best school I've ever
seen. The teachers have such a rapport with the students.''
</P>
<P>
   The grounds have never been grand. The classrooms, serving 120
preschool to grade 6 pupils, are in three uninsulated halls behind
the faded facade of Holy Family Church, on a corner of Natchez far
removed from the town's exquisitely preserved Civil War-era
mansions.
</P>
<P>
   A staircase outside the kindergarten classroom had to be sealed
off with tape, so dilapidated that it can lead only to danger.
First- and second-graders learn in a dank basement. Upstairs,
bricks burst out of a crack in the wall outside the fifth and sixth
grades. In the library, the map and encyclopedias are dated 1949,
and in classrooms, teachers have carefully taped together torn
pages in books that were cast-offs. Teachers' salaries range from
$7,000 to $13,000, full time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even the decorations seem defiant against decay. The
shutters outside a preschool classroom are so brightly yellow one
could almost miss the peeling paint on the walls behind. And each
year, city officials say, students continue to score higher on
standardized tests than those in the public schools. Its reputation
is such that some families have sent five and six generations to
Holy Family.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of discipline and self-sufficiency start early.
</P>
<P>
   In a kindergarten classroom, Sister Carmen Molina, the only nun
beyond Sister Marie to still teach here, is leaning over a table of
students reading first-grade books.
</P>
<P>
   She gets up and pauses over students looking up words in the
dictionary to match photographs on the wall. Diandra Young, newly
6, stumbles sounding out ``exercise.'' Another student jumps in,
and Sister Carmen gently scolds, ``Children, you can't wait for
someone else to give you the answer. You have to sound it out
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is the best school in the city,'' says Charles
Toussaint, whose son is in kindergarten. ``I'll be reading a book
with him, I get ready to help him with a word, he knows it already.
That's the result of what the teachers are doing here. The kids
like learning. That tradition of studying carries on.''
</P>
<P>
   Legend has the seeds for Holy Family planted by a black porter
working the docks on the Mississippi when the first bishop of
Natchez arrived by steamer in 1841. Carrying his bags, the porter
asked the bishop to teach him to read.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop started a black school, but it closed during the
Civil War. Then in 1890, a Dutch priest brought three nuns from
Pennsylvania to help him start a new one. While the sisters went
door to door enrolling students, he went north looking for money to
build the school.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Mississippi were still segregated until the 1960s.
This being the poorest state in the country, even white schools
were underfunded, and black schools even more so. Holy Family,
which was open to whites but remained all-black, became the school
parents wanted to send their children to, whether or not they were
Catholic. Today, 89 percent are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents send their children here because they know that the
students who come here are always the best students when they
leave. They're the ones that become the student leaders,'' says
Larry L. ``Butch'' Brown, mayor of Natchez for 8 years. ``This
ought to be the model for American early childhood education, it
could be the model. It's just woefully unfunded.''
</P>
<P>
   That was how Sister Marie found it when she arrived in August
1997. The basic problem was the same as in many Catholic schools
today: not enough young women entering religious orders. The
Sisters of the Holy Spirit, who staffed Holy Family for 80 years,
have begun to die off, and are stretched thin to attend to as many
schools as possible. Holy Family was down to three nuns teaching in
1996, and now one. Lay teachers require salaries, and that means
higher tuition, which is currently $1,700 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But in Natchez, the problems are complicated by the local
economy. Several paper and rubber factories have closed during the
past few years, and last year, Mayor Brown says, the town took a
hit when Fidelity Tire laid off 400 people. The town's biggest
industry is now the tourists strolling the verandas of the
antebellum homes.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, several students could no longer pay tuitions and
left. Others moved with their families toward better jobs. Then
there were problems particular to the school, such as the tax
bills. When the school hired lay teachers, it had to pay payroll
taxes. ``The way (the parents) saw it, they could pay the taxes or
they could pay the teachers,'' said the priest at Holy Family
Church, Father John Tyne. ``They thought it was more important to
pay the teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Marie arrived from her native Ipswich, having returned
from a mission in Japan, and immediately set about fixing the books
as well as the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old enough to be too old to ask,'' as she describes herself,
she slams her hip to open doors stuck in the humidity, and briskly
straightens the curtains she bought at Wal-Mart (``just to freshen
things up for the children.'').
</P>
<P>
   She fixed the tax problem, borrowing $100,000 from the Josephite
order that runs Holy Family Church to pay the bill. The IRS, she
said, forgave the penalty portion of the bill, deciding there was
no malfeasance intended. (``Faith moves mountains and the IRS,''
she says, smiling.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers do such wonderful work here, and without this,
the students won't have the same opportunities,'' she says.
Ideally, she would like to do more than recruit paying students;
she would like to have scholarships. ``I don't want to have to turn
away any student.''
</P>
<P>
   She has used her world connections to get donations of all
sizes: $700 from a family in Japan who had heard about her travails
from a nun who came to visit here, another $200 from a Navy base
where she once worked in Hawaii. And when she went to BC for a
principal's leadership training, she asked whether anyone there
could help. BC sent her to the School of Education, where the
students jumped to the challenge. Forty-two applied to make the
trip, and 20 were chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The week at Holy Family provided them lessons, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a lot, but what they have they make so much
of,'' says Natalie Corrigan, a junior from New Jersey. ``In my
elementary school, there was always a storage closet full of
supplies. They don't have storage closets here.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the students have started a campaign to allow
students to contribute points on their meal cards toward helping
Holy Family. They have gotten donations from potluck suppers, and
from soliciting parents.
</P>
<P>
   At Holy Family, one preschool classroom sits empty, a reminder
that it still can't afford the teachers it needs. And without those
students coming in, some parents and teachers fear the school won't
have enough students to feed the higher grades.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, have watched Holy Family triumph before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really in tough financial shape,'' says Joyce Trask, who
came here after 30 years in the public schools. ``But every time we
get in a tight spot, we have some sort of blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, it might be in the form of a tiny nun and her 20
young helpers.

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW UNDERMINED MOST BY STARR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is anything Republicans have learned, it's that a vote
to extend the soon-to-expire independent counsel law is also a vote
of confidence for the person who turned the law into a big
political liability for the GOP: Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   And the last thing Republicans need is to be perceived as a
supporter of the man with the lowest favorability rating of any
public figure involved in the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr arguably did more damage to the Republican Party than to
Clinton by taking the virtually unlimited independent counsel's
mandate so far beyond previous self-imposed boundaries that it
represented a modern-day Inquisition, one that spawned more terror
than justice.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Starr's massive misuse and abuse of the law during a
five-year investigation that began with Whitewater and degenerated
into a stained blue dress, five Republicans might not have lost
their seats in the House of Representatives last November, two GOP
House speakers might not have been forced to resign, and some
Republicans might not have had certain aspects of their private
lives exposed.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Republicans and Democrats have been holding joint
press conferences and issuing joint statements saying the
independent counsel law, due to expire at the end of June, should
not be renewed _ in any form.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, some Republicans ostensibly tried to separate Starr
from the law, defending his actions while condemning the law for
not remaining apolitical _ as if that were its fault. Indeed, it
was Starr's misuse of the OIC that has cost the law its political
support.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to explain why most Democrats, including the
Clinton administration, are opposed to the same law they backed for
renewal the last time around. While US Attorney General Janet Reno,
who approved more independent counsels for investigations than any
of her predecessors, is currently silent on the issue, President
Clinton knows that opposing the law has the approval of the
electorate. He need not worry about a public backlash if he agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the public apparently views Starr's out-of-control
exploitation of the law as more of a threat to the nation than the
shameful, reckless, adulterous affair Clinton had with Monica S.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Republicans, there are basically two reasons so many
of them oppose the law so strongly.
</P>
<P>
   One is that they were hurt by the political fallout from Starr's
report, which was the basis of the GOP-led impeachment campaign
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Second is that the Republicans know that the Democrats, when it
is their turn to control Congress, could use the independent
counsel against them in the same way Starr used it against Clinton,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their friends, associates, and
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   While there are some members of both parties who favor amending
or modifying the law rather than ending it, that possibility has
grown increasingly remote. With so many different ideas likely to
emerge during debates over changes, it is more likely that a
congressional debate could break down along party lines, creating
yet another schism between the Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest, and perhaps wisest, approach to the law is to
simply allow it to expire without much debate or fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, ending this law would be a quiet but fitting way to
bury a sad and shameful chapter in our history. Perhaps that is
what members of both parties have in mind _ a short, brief ceremony
to note its death and move on to the business of the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would send Starr a message that both parties, as
well as the nation's populace, want him to disappear as quietly as
they expect the independent counsel law to disappear. But if he
continues his obsessive pursuit of the Clintons _ amid rumors that
he might still consider seeking indictments against them _ Starr's
fall could be harder than any other Republican who sought to bring
down the president.
</P>
<P>
   Current investigations of possible criminal violations by the
OIC could easily escalate if Starr continues his pursuit of the
Clintons and their associates.
</P>
<P>
   As the GOP House and Senate members found out, there is very
little public support for such partisan use of taxpayers' money.
And there is even less public support for a man who humiliated the
nation before the rest of the world as he helped to lead a failed
Republican movement to bring down a president the GOP could not
defeat at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, with the burial of this ugly law, a more efficient,
nonpolitical law to investigate high-level allegations might arise.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Starr's prosecutorial career, and the law he abused,
is relegated to history, there is that hope.

KAZAN'S LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elia Kazan had a choice in 1952: to stand with the Communists or
to stand against them. He chose to stand against them, and
Hollywood's Stalinists have reviled him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   On March 21, Kazan will receive the Oscar for lifetime
achievement at the Academy Awards. For the man who launched the
careers of James Dean and Marlon Brando, the director of such
acclaimed motion pictures as ``Gentleman's Agreement,'' ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``On the Waterfront,'' and ``East of
Eden,'' it is an honor long overdue. For years Kazan's enemies have
kept him from receiving such awards; he was snubbed, for example,
by the American Film Institute and the Los Angeles Film Critics
Association. It reportedly took an impassioned plea by Karl Malden
(another Kazan discovery) to break the blackball at the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan-haters intend to protest outside the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion on Oscar night, and would like to see him humiliated _ or
worse _ inside the auditorium when he receives his award. ``I'll be
watching, hoping someone shoots him,'' says Abraham Polonsky, who
was blacklisted in the 1950s for his Communist sympathies. ``It
would no doubt be a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard Hollywood left supposedly despises Kazan because he
``named names'' before the House Un-American Activities Committee.
In the early 1930s, when he worked for the Group Theater in New
York, Kazan had been one of a cell of nine Communist Party members.
In his testimony 17 years later, he identified the others,
describing how they had been expected to do the party's bidding in
the theater world and how they had taken orders from paid party
commissars. By 1952 hardly any of this was news. Nor was Kazan the
only member of the cell to testify. Playwright Clifford Odets, one
of the Group Theater's founders, appeared before the committee a
few weeks after Kazan did.
</P>
<P>
   There was no joy in naming names. Kazan detected a ``sadistic
streak'' in the HUAC inquisitors, he would later write, and
``concluded that what these fellows were conducting was a
degradation ceremony, in which the acts of informing were more
important than the information conveyed.'' He wrestled with his
conscience before and after his HUAC appearance; indeed, as he put
it in his autobiography, ``here I am, 35 years later, still
worrying over it.''
</P>
<P>
   But however disasteful cooperating with the committee may have
been, cooperating with the Communist Party and the Soviet Union _
which is what refusing to testify or taking the Fifth amounted to _
would have been infinitely worse. Kazan had left the party in 1935,
disgusted by its rigid authoritarianism and conspiratorial secrecy.
He knew that the Communists were not just another political party;
they were an arm of Stalin's foreign policy and their purpose was
to promote Soviet interests in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Already in 1935 it was becoming clear that what Soviet Communism
had brought about _ and therefore what the American Communist Party
stood for _ was purge trials, mass murder, and the wholesale
destruction of liberty. By the time of the HUAC hearings, the
horrors of Stalinism were so patent that no one could pretend that
party membership was merely a profession of idealistic concern for
the downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 17 years of watching the Soviet Union turn into an
imperialist power,'' Kazan asked himself, ``was that truly what I
wanted here?'' Up to that point he hadn't spoken out, but ``wasn't
what I'd been defending ... by my silence a conspiracy working for
another country?''
</P>
<P>
   At every turn, American Communists and fellow-travelers
undeviatingly toed the Soviet line. They defended the purge trials,
the Hitler-Stalin pact, the Rosenbergs. Was Moscow against the
Marshall Plan? They denounced it. Did Moscow oppose the US defense
of South Korea? Then they would oppose it too.
</P>
<P>
   And by the same token, they would acclaim hardened Communists
like the Hollywood Ten as heroes while blackening Kazan's name as a
``ratfink'' and ``informer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Kazan was not detested for naming names.
If he had identified members of the American Nazi Party, the left
would have lionized him. If he had testified before a committee
investigating the Klan, Hollywood would have cheered.
</P>
<P>
   No: Kazan was loathed because he was anti-Communist. (ital) That
(unital) was his unforgivable sin. (ital) That (unital) was why he
had to be showered with contempt. When he was called upon to choose
sides in the great moral conflict of our time, Kazan came down
against the totalitarians. For that he has been hated since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Only recant, Kazan's foes now say, and we'll call off the
protest. ``If he apologized,'' says Polonsky, the
Communist-sympathizing ex-screenwriter, ``nothing would take place.
It would be accepted that people make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   How vile these people are. Kazan apologize! It is Polonsky who
should beg forgiveness _ he and all the leftists who made excuses
and averted their gaze as 20th-century communism drowned half the
planet in misery. Human beings died by the tens of millions, and
America's Communists and fellow-travelers sided with the killers.
They were the real betrayers. Theirs is the indelible shame. To be
hated by Polonsky and his ilk is a signal achievement, one for
which Kazan deserves our gratitude and applause.

FAITHFUL CUSTOMERS DEMANDING BETTER DEALS _ AND GETTING THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After aggressively pursuing new customers with perks and
discounts, telecommunications and credit card companies are waking
up to the cry of loyal customers who say they're being taken for
granted and want some of these special deals.
</P>
<P>
   Faithful customers say they are being treated as fools and they
are lighting up company phone lines and clogging e-mail files after
hearing about neighbors and colleagues getting $100 ``win-back''
checks, free cell phones and low introductory credit card rates
just for being new _ not old _ customers.
</P>
<P>
   And while the extravaganza of deals has created a new breed of
fickle consumer, who jumps from one deal to the next, loyal
customers can't help but feel slightly ripped off even as they
grumble that all these bargain-hunters ought to get a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bread and butter customers are finding out about these
deals,'' said Susan Fournier, associate professor of marketing at
the Harvard Business School. ``And they start to feel alienated and
aggravated.''
</P>
<P>
   Fournier said she was miffed four months ago when she discovered
a friend was getting AT&AMP;T's long-distance plan of a dime a minute
with no monthly charge for the first six months. She was paying $5
a month for the same 10 cents a minute plan.
</P>
<P>
   She got on the phone with AT&AMP;T and demanded, ``I want the same
deal or I'm outta here.'' (She got it.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed some companies are starting to respond, especially as
they feel more secure in the marketplace. Bell Atlantic Mobile last
year started offering longtime wireless customers the same
promotions, such as free off-peak calling time, as new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   In its new emphasis on rewarding loyalty, John Palmer, marketing
director for Bell Atlantic's Northeast region, said longtime
customers are also being given greater benefits, such as two months
of free voice-activated calling. New customers get one month of
that perk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to take the risk that our customers are looking
for other deals,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   In a program like the airlines' frequent-flyer programs, AT&AMP;T
plans this spring to debut a new loyalty rewards offer that will
cut across all of its long-distance, local, Internet and wireless
services, said marketing director Vincent Raguseo. Loyal customers
will get financial perks for their longevity with the company and
for the amount of their usage in different services.
</P>
<P>
   Raguseo said AT&AMP;T heard loud and clear from loyal customers who
weren't happy about being ignored. He said the company itself
wasn't pleased about the chronic switchers or ``churners,'' as they
are known in the telecommunications world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's largest credit card issuers, First USA,
based in Wilmington, Del., began offering in the past couple years
special cards for long-term cardholders who are jazz enthusiasts,
bicyclists or scuba divers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Unkle, spokesman for First USA, said members received
discount tickets and hobby newsletters. In the next year, he said,
the company hopes to unveil other new loyalty programs to reduce
the number of ``rate-hoppers'' who jump from one low-introductory
teaser rate to another.
</P>
<P>
   The howl of the loyal customer isn't usually heard in business
world, said many marketing specialists. In the past, companies
assumed, often accurately, that most people were too lazy to
switch.
</P>
<P>
   Also, consumers in generations past were less aware of what
their neighbor was paying for the same product or service,
according to marketing executives. They didn't live in today's
information-saturated environment where the news media and Internet
offer many price comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bund, senior lecturer at the Sloan School of Management
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who specializes in
marketing, said there is a new respect for the ``good buyer'' who
knows how to research information for monetary advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's culturally acceptable to talk about, even admirable, to
talk about how smart a shopper you are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Deighton, a marketing professor at the Harvard Business
School, agreed that consumers are more knowledgeable about the
marketplace and companies realize they can't just bank on inertia
to keep a customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies need to use price to retain customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially so in industries such as long-distance or
cellular phones, where switching is so easy. It's not like Internet
or cable services, where switching means you get a new e-mail
address or wait for a visit from an installer.
</P>
<P>
   James Levine, a retired engineer, said he had always heard about
bargain-hunting in the telecommunications world, mostly from a
colleague who got about $130 in checks within two years after
switching back and forth between AT&AMP;T and MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Levine got into the deal-hunting game with his new cell phone.
After getting a free phone with a one-year contract with Bell
Atlantic Mobile last year, he shopped around and found a better
deal with Cellular One at $9.95 a month. Cellular One also offered
him $50 to switch. Bell Atlantic Mobile couldn't match the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Levine believes, however, that marketers are making a mistake if
they don't start thinking about ``loyal-customer presents.'' He
said customers like him will always be hunting for the best deal.
When his cell phone contract expires in June, he'll be on the phone
with competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's fun,'' he confessed. ``You actually haggle.
It's a game. It's a marvelous game.''

IT'S ROCKET SCIENCE AT BU'S PHYSICS LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAC DANIEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daniel Cotton, a 34-year-old assistant research professor at
Boston University, is coming down with something. His shirt is
wrinkled, his tie is askew, and he's coughing.
</P>
<P>
   His mind, however, is not on his health. It's pondering his
satellite. With a few short weeks to launch day, Cotton said
space-based nightmares are keeping him awake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream about the launch and see it tip over and go out of the
control,'' he said of the satellite, which currently sits in a
locked room at Boston University's Center for Space Physics. ``On
launch day, it's either going to be fat and happy or there's going
to be something wrong. And that's all I really think about.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4 1/2 years ago, Cotton came up with a novel idea, a means
of surveying the earth's ionosphere and thermosphere in three
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   It was an experiment that could help advance solar-terrestrial
studies and provide a better understanding of space weather, as
well as the ionosphere and the thermosphere, the ever-changing
outer layers of atmosphere that play large roles in ground-based
communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going from an X-ray to a CAT scan,'' said Cotton.
``We'll be seeking far more detail.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the only reasonable means to perform such research
was through suborbital rocket launches, packages that returned to
earth after 10 minutes of flight, snatching small amounts of data
from the skies. An orbital satellite would be perfect, but
prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton and other BU officials knew this, and consequently timed
their proposal to jibe with NASA's announcement of a new program to
provide money to have universities build, test and operate
inexpensive scientific satellites.
</P>
<P>
   It was precedent-setting news at BU when Cotton's proposal,
co-written with his peers at BU's Center For Space Physics, won
approval from NASA. But then came the hard part. They had to
actually build the device that, up to then, was just an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a huge task,'' said Cotton, whose passion is
tweaked more by research than the wonkish detail involved in
building a satellite. ``Here I am, a research scientist, and I was
suddenly in charge of getting a space bus built.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the TERRIERS satellite (Tomographic Experiment using
Radiative Recombinative Ionospheric EUV and Radio Sources) sits on
the fifth floor of a Boston University building on Commonwealth
Avenue. Stored in a ``clean room'' to avoid instrument
contamination by dust or hand oils, it is being tested and readied
for liftoff on April 7 from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, where Steely Dan songs are playing and a picture of
the Star Wars character Yoda adorns the computer, is the
satellite's command center. The mission commander is 23-year-old
Janine Lyn, and the room is often packed with a select group of
physics or astronomy students who came to BU never thinking they'd
have a chance to play such vital roles in a major space research
program _ let alone to operate a satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guidance counselor said to me during summer orientation:
Would you rather flip burgers at the student union or control a
satellite?'' said Emily Lyman, a 19-year-old freshman from Albany,
N.Y. ``I chose the satellite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing experience for a freshman year,'' said Jeremy
Coombs, 18, a freshman from New Britain, Conn. ``It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The program would have been unheard of just a few years ago.
Students rarely got involved in such expensive projects. But
through NASA's Universities Space Research Association _ which
hopes to demonstrate that successful satellites can be built
cheaply and differently _ the dream for students like Lyman and
Coombs has become reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some students started at zero,'' Cotton said. ``It's a
completely student-run project.''
</P>
<P>
   BU officials said the program is already a success, even though
the satellite is still on the ground. With the awarding of the
TERRIERS satellite grant, the university built the research tools
while an outside contractor built the ``bus,'' the satellite
vehicle on which the experiments will be carried.
</P>
<P>
   And while all of BU's instrument package came in under budget
and on time, the contractor that made the satellite was both late
and over budget.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of BU's satellite project is about $4 million. If this
had been contracted more traditionally, the project could have been
10 to 20 times more expensive, according to Dr. Supriya
Chakrabarti, an associate professor of astronomy at BU and co-head
of the TERRIERS program with Cotton. BU was the primary contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the program first began, colleagues had said that for $4
million all you cold build were toys,'' said Chakrabarti. ``So now
we've proved them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But the crux of the program _ and the real worry _ has yet to
begin. In 1996, when an Ariane 5 rocket blew up seconds after
liftoff, 10 years of work by researchers at the University of New
Hampshire blew up with it.
</P>
<P>
   The TERRIERS satellite will be sent out to California later this
month in a huge purple container. It will be launched much like a
guided missile from an aircraft at 50,000 feet. Launch is scheduled
for 8 p.m. Pacific time on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the satellite will orient itself to the sun,
begin charging its batteries and start feeding data back to a BU
rooftop. And Prof. Cotton may finally get some rest.

`SHAKESPEARE,' NOT SPIELBERG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The great Steven Spielberg, it seems, is starting
his victory lap a tad early. Before heading west for another
coronation in Hollywood, the movie maker is planning a swing
through here.
</P>
<P>
   Major face time with Vice President Al Gore is envisioned, as
befits one of the Clinton administration's most dilligent
supporters. And then _ can this be true? _ he wants to lay a wreath
at the Tomb of the Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that. For the impressario of ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' it is a nice gesture, but it's hard not to sense more than
a morsel of self-equation with a head of state on an official visit
here, the traditional movie world's confusion about its place in
the American pantheon. Such a gesture, after all, would not occur
to a poet or a giant of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   This is Spielberg, however, and this is the movies. Moreover,
this is the end of the century, the middle of another cycle of
multi-media awe (every bit of it appropriate and ultimately
inadequate) for the people who fought World War II. And I haven't
talked to a soul who knows movies from the inside who isn't
positive ``Saving Private Ryan'' is a cinch to get the Oscar for
best picture this month.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its immense merits, it is simply inconceivable that
the Academy could reject it, given its reverential and realistic
depiction of Omaha Beach and Normandy. And yet, it is hard to find
movie people who truly believe it is the best picture.
</P>
<P>
   To use last year as analogy, ``Saving Private Ryan'' is
``Titanic.'' It uses D-Day as James Cameron used the long-ago
tragedy as the setting for another story that would not be up for
an Oscar by itself, even if Academy Awards were free of their
business and political taint. They are triumphs of cinematography
in the service of honest depiction.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, if you want to see the full story of Titanic or of
Normandy told for their intrinsic merit, ``A Night to Remember''
and ``The Longest Day,'' hold up just fine after more than three
decades, and each keeps its sub-plots in their place.To use this
year as analogy, ``Private Ryan'' is like ``Elizabeth'' in the
sense that each is a great movie in a setting of which Hollywood
never tires: the costume drama and the war picture. Indeed, the
best picture choices, all five, are in one or the other this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   The difference with ``Elizabeth'' is that film maker Shekhar
Kapur couldn't give a hoot about history. He has used classic movie
form _ costume, palace intrigue, pageantry, atrocity _ to the
fullest in the service of a vision of England's great queen through
the lens of today's feminism.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason his movie is up for best picture really has less
to do with its look or story than with the astonishing success of
Cate Blanchett in portraying Elizabeth with a depth that goes miles
beyond the basically boilerplate nature of the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know anyone who thinks ``Elizabeth'' will win, just as I
don't know anyone who thinks ``Private Ryan'' will lose. But I also
don't know anyone who thinks ``Private Ryan'' will win for reasons
beyond its shattering first half-hour and what that tribute in
blood represents as depicted in its last half-hour. And I also
don't know anyone who doesn't see superior art and drama, as well
as greater depth, in the other nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg has done what he's done and bless him for it, but his
film doesn't come close in creativity, meaning, and achievement to
his own ``Schindler's List.'' And it doesn't touch ``Life is
Beautiful'' or ``The Thin Red Line.'' ``Private Ryan'' simply,
though powerfully, is. But Roberto Benigni's clownish father
shielding a son from the horror of the Holocaust celebrates the
human spirit in direct conflict with evil. And Terrence Malick has
taken Guadalcanal (as horrific as Normandy) and both respected it
as well as used it to dramatize the assault war represents on
nature as well as the nature of man.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate achievement last year for my money is what
happened a few years ago after writer Marc Norman's son, studying
Elizabethan drama, wondered how Shakespeare was motivated to write
``Romeo and Juliet'' and whether he might have been in love.With
the aid of Britain's genius playwright, Tom Stoppard, and John
Madden's direction that cut their what-if script like a diamond,
``Shakespeare in Love'' is a tribute to inventive creativity, to
imagination itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is bawdy and beautiful, hilarious and profound, a great play
about an even greater play. My movie moment of the year comes not
on Omaha Beach but at an Elizabethan theater in London, as the
premiere of Romeo ends and the audience is stunned into silence
before the cheers start.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's Academy is like the rest of us in this country.
Uncomfortable with art, we take refuge in the celebration of
extravagance or of patriotism most of the time.Even as we know
better. No matter what the already cast votes say, ``Good Will
Hunting'' was the best picture last year and ``Shakespeare in
Love'' is everything a movie can be.

RACIAL PROFILING ONLY `DESCRIBES' ITS PERPETRATOR

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
``They've got a war on drugs so that the police can bother me.'' 
_ From ``Changes'' by Tupac Shakur 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey Police Police Superintendent Carl Williams was dead
wrong when he stated in a newspaper article a week ago that a
majority of drug traffickers in his state are black and Latino.
</P>
<P>
   What he should've said is blacks and Latinos are more likely to
get arrested by his troops. His cavalier attitude is why Governor
Christine Whitman fired his sorry self.
</P>
<P>
   Like too many ineffective police leaders, Williams slapped an
ugly untruth about two communities that gets repeated so often, it
almost sounds like gospel. He spat out statistics that tell only
part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Latinos get sent to prison on drug charges at
a rate of 81 times more than whites, according to 1998 study by the
state attorney general's office. For blacks, the rate was 39 times
that of whites.
</P>
<P>
   That's because they're all aspiring Pablo Escobars, right?
Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics show that blacks
get shoddy treatment under the law when it comes to drug offenses.
In 1994, the most recent year figures were available, 38 percent of
those arrested for drug trafficking were black and 62 percent were
white. The stats don't include Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to convictions, blacks had a much higher rate: 63
percent of the convictions in state courts, compared to 37 percent
for whites.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the scary part: 52 percent of the convicted blacks got
prison sentences, compared to 38 percent of convicted whites. And,
on average, blacks were given a longer maximum sentence: 68 months
compared with 54 months for whites.
</P>
<P>
   Why the unfair, dare I say racist, treatment?
</P>
<P>
   It's because street-corner dealers in communities of color are
easy targets for police.
</P>
<P>
   It's because Latinos and blacks, who are disproportionately
poor, end up getting court-appointed lawyers who treat their cases
in assembly-line fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It's because of racial profiling _ a practice Williams's police
force allegedly used. The Justice Department is investigating
allegations that New Jersey state police pull over drivers for DWB
or DWL _ Driving While Black and Driving While Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was spurred after a county judge in 1996 found
that brown-skinned drivers are 4.8 times more likely than whites to
be stopped on the lower half of the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Though Williams denied his force used racial profiling, several
troopers have filed discrimination lawsuits against the State
Police, saying they were trained to spot black and Latino
motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Williams reasoned that because 63 percent of the drug suspects
arrested in New Jersey were black or Latino that ``it's most likely
a minority group involved with'' drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of logic, why don't police set up shop in
minority communities and do all their arrests there? Clearly, if
police stop a disproportionately high number of blacks and Latinos,
chances are they're going to find drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, poor communities are ravaged by the drug culture.
There, marijuana and crack are consumed to numb despair. But it's
the recreational users, yuppies and bored rich people, who create
the demand for drugs. National statistics reported by the American
Bar Association show that 75 percent of drug users are white.
</P>
<P>
   The real enemy of the drug war is leaders like Williams. They
poison us with faulty statistics and mislead their troops, making
them think they're going to make the big bust if they catch the
dude with dreadlocks driving the Pinto. Big-time dealers are savvy
about racial profiling, so they find ``mules'' that police wouldn't
suspect _ women and white people.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are a lot of hard-working cops trying to catch the
ones responsible for bringing drugs into neighborhoods _ suburban
and urban alike _ there are too many who get off on cuffing
jueveniles, pawns used in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The war on drugs shouldn't be fought in Lawrence, or Framingham,
or Roxbury, where teen dealers carry packets of crack hidden under
their tongues. It should be fought at the borders. Help the
governments of Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Jamaica, and the Dominican
Republic establish legitimate industries. The thousands of
Peruvians and Colombians who toil in coca fields would gladly leave
for better-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Take the billions spent on building new prisons and pour that
money into after-school programs. Pay mentors who will keep
juveniles from getting swept into the street trade.
</P>
<P>
   And, find police superintendents who won't mislead their troops
thinking they're going to win the drug war by cuffing the kid
ditty-bopping down the street.

60 MINUTES OF SHAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Make no mistake: Edward R. Murrow, Fred Friendly and Dick Salant
are dead _ and spinning.
</P>
<P>
   If you tuned in to CBS Sunday night you saw the squandered
legacy of newsmen who used television to bring depth and texture to
the most difficult issues of our times. The McCarthy hearings.
Migrant workers. Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   If you watched ``60 Minutes'' you saw just how high a price CBS
News was willing to pay, in journalistic integrity and human
decency, to score a larger market share.
</P>
<P>
   Watch Mike Wallace interview Louise Woodward if you must, but
understand what you are seeing: This is not a serious inquiry into
the violent death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen. This is a cheap
skirmish in the networks' rating war.
</P>
<P>
   ABC gets the presidential mistress; CBS hits back with the
killer nanny. Barbara Walters scores Monica; Mike Wallace snags
Louise. The infamous get their platform; the shameless get their
exclusive. And broadcast news courts blindness from yet another
journalistic black eye.
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer a pretense that these ``interviews'' are
designed as anything other than marketing tools for TV shows
addicted to celebrity, earned and unearned. Viewers knew what they
were watching Wednesday night was not news; it was pre-packaged
entertainment, the promotional kickoff for a quickie book to let
Monica and the media bottom-feeders cash in.
</P>
<P>
   People tuned in, not because they expected Barbara Walters to
elicit news. They tuned in because they knew she'd elicit tears.
When the cameras stopped rolling, Monica offered Barbara one of the
scarves she now knits in her spare time; Barbara offered Monica a
slot on the vacuous chat show she now co-hosts in her spare time. A
fair exchange: one piece of fluff for another.
</P>
<P>
   But Louise Woodward is not Monica Lewinsky. She is a felon, not
a flake. She did not leave a tawdry mess in her wake; she left a
tiny coffin. A new haircut and a new round of teary denials will
not alter the fact that a jury convicted her of killing an infant
in her care.
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes'' would have viewers believe that it operates on a
higher journalistic plane than TV news magazines that stage gas
tank explosions. To slap a veneer of newsworthiness on its
interview with Woodward, CBS hides behind a ``new'' opinion of the
cause of Matty's death on Feb. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that this theory is offered by a doctor who came no
closer to the case than some medical records provided by ``60
Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the conclusion that Matty died of strangulation,
not a fractured skull and shaken baby syndrome, is unsupported by
any testimony at trial. Not from Matty's treating physicians. Not
from the medical examiner. Not from medical experts called by
prosecution or defense.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Floyd Gilles of Children's Hospital in Los Angeles is
entitled to hold any opinion he likes about the evidence against
Louise Woodward. Or O.J. Simpson. Or Julius and Ethel Rosenberg,
for that matter. But what makes his opinion worthy of our attention
more than two years after Matthew Eappen was laid to rest, more
than one year after Louise Woodward was convicted in his death,
more than one month after she settled a wrongful death suit?
</P>
<P>
   What makes his speculations any more newsworthy than the vile
assertion by one of Woodward's lawyers a while back that the
``evidence'' did not rule out Brendan Eappen, age 2 at the time of
his brother's death, as the killer?
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when CBS and Mike Wallace were better than
this. He did not make his reputation, as Walters and Diane Sawyer
did, wringing confessions out of leggy blondes. (Walters on
``20/20'' asking Donna Rice where she had sex with Gary Hart:
``What everybody wants to know, of course, is, Donna, whether it
was aboard the yacht, the Monkey Business?'' Sawyer on ``Prime Time
Live'' asking Marla Maples about Donald Trump: ``Was it the best
sex you've ever had?'')
</P>
<P>
   Wallace admits to being 79. Don Hewitt, ``60 Minutes'' executive
producer, is 76. Is this really how they want to wind up their
careers, inflicting pain on a family that, after more than two
years in the spotlight, is still capable of being shocked by what
passes for journalism in America?
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens should know there's no statute of limitations on
this stuff. Last week _ I kid you not _ Diane Sawyer interviewed
the women who killed for Charlie Manson _ 30 years after the
crimes.

FAITHFUL CUSTOMERS DEMANDING BETTER DEALS _ AND GETTING THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After aggressively pursuing new customers with perks and
discounts, telecommunications and credit card companies are waking
up to the cry of loyal customers who say they're being taken for
granted and want some of these special deals.
</P>
<P>
   Faithful customers say they are being treated as fools and they
are lighting up company phone lines and clogging e-mail files after
hearing about neighbors and colleagues getting $100 ``win-back''
checks, free cell phones and low introductory credit card rates
just for being new _ not old _ customers.
</P>
<P>
   And while the extravaganza of deals has created a new breed of
fickle consumer, who jumps from one deal to the next, loyal
customers can't help but feel slightly ripped off even as they
grumble that all these bargain-hunters ought to get a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bread and butter customers are finding out about these
deals,'' said Susan Fournier, associate professor of marketing at
the Harvard Business School. ``And they start to feel alienated and
aggravated.''
</P>
<P>
   Fournier said she was miffed four months ago when she discovered
a friend was getting AT&AMP;T's long-distance plan of a dime a minute
with no monthly charge for the first six months. She was paying $5
a month for the same 10 cents a minute plan.
</P>
<P>
   She got on the phone with AT&AMP;T and demanded, ``I want the same
deal or I'm outta here.'' (She got it.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed some companies are starting to respond, especially as
they feel more secure in the marketplace. Bell Atlantic Mobile last
year started offering longtime wireless customers the same
promotions, such as free off-peak calling time, as new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   In its new emphasis on rewarding loyalty, John Palmer, marketing
director for Bell Atlantic's Northeast region, said longtime
customers are also being given greater benefits, such as two months
of free voice-activated calling. New customers get one month of
that perk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to take the risk that our customers are looking
for other deals,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   In a program like the airlines' frequent-flyer programs, AT&AMP;T
plans this spring to debut a new loyalty rewards offer that will
cut across all of its long-distance, local, Internet and wireless
services, said marketing director Vincent Raguseo. Loyal customers
will get financial perks for their longevity with the company and
for the amount of their usage in different services.
</P>
<P>
   Raguseo said AT&AMP;T heard loud and clear from loyal customers who
weren't happy about being ignored. He said the company itself
wasn't pleased about the chronic switchers or ``churners,'' as they
are known in the telecommunications world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's largest credit card issuers, First USA,
based in Wilmington, Del., began offering in the past couple years
special cards for long-term cardholders who are jazz enthusiasts,
bicyclists or scuba divers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Unkle, spokesman for First USA, said members received
discount tickets and hobby newsletters. In the next year, he said,
the company hopes to unveil other new loyalty programs to reduce
the number of ``rate-hoppers'' who jump from one low-introductory
teaser rate to another.
</P>
<P>
   The howl of the loyal customer isn't usually heard in business
world, said many marketing specialists. In the past, companies
assumed, often accurately, that most people were too lazy to
switch.
</P>
<P>
   Also, consumers in generations past were less aware of what
their neighbor was paying for the same product or service,
according to marketing executives. They didn't live in today's
information-saturated environment where the news media and Internet
offer many price comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bund, senior lecturer at the Sloan School of Management
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who specializes in
marketing, said there is a new respect for the ``good buyer'' who
knows how to research information for monetary advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's culturally acceptable to talk about, even admirable, to
talk about how smart a shopper you are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Deighton, a marketing professor at the Harvard Business
School, agreed that consumers are more knowledgeable about the
marketplace and companies realize they can't just bank on inertia
to keep a customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies need to use price to retain customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially so in industries such as long-distance or
cellular phones, where switching is so easy. It's not like Internet
or cable services, where switching means you get a new e-mail
address or wait for a visit from an installer.
</P>
<P>
   James Levine, a retired engineer, said he had always heard about
bargain-hunting in the telecommunications world, mostly from a
colleague who got about $130 in checks within two years after
switching back and forth between AT&AMP;T and MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Levine got into the deal-hunting game with his new cell phone.
After getting a free phone with a one-year contract with Bell
Atlantic Mobile last year, he shopped around and found a better
deal with Cellular One at $9.95 a month. Cellular One also offered
him $50 to switch. Bell Atlantic Mobile couldn't match the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Levine believes, however, that marketers are making a mistake if
they don't start thinking about ``loyal-customer presents.'' He
said customers like him will always be hunting for the best deal.
When his cell phone contract expires in June, he'll be on the phone
with competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's fun,'' he confessed. ``You actually haggle.
It's a game. It's a marvelous game.''

LET'S SEE WHAT MONICA CAN DO FOR BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What will we do without Monica to kick around? Not that a
Monica-less America seems an imminent prospect.
Monicamonicamonicamonicamonica. But it has to stop sometime,
doesn't it? Please?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lucianne Goldberg, Linda Tripp's literary
co-conspirator, has spoken out, saying that we should put Monica
behind us and talk about Social Security. This seems a generous
sentiment, especially coming from a woman who stood to gain so much
from the Monica mess but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   I was in the car, flipping the radio dial, when I heard
Goldberg's statement on Rush Limbaugh's radio program. Suddenly
everything fell into place. That's exactly what's wrong with this
country. Too much talk about Monica, too little about Social
Security. Why should this be?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Monica's story has sex, sleaze, scandal. What does the
Social Security story have? Huge, incomprehensible figures and a
lot of anxiety and uncertainty about the financial future of
millions of Americans. That's all. Somehow the subject doesn't seem
as compelling as what Monica did or didn't do with, or to, the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any way to make the Social Security story as
interesting as Monicagate? Maybe Matt Drudge will ferret out a tape
of Monica and Handsome having a heated discussion about the pros
and cons of privatization. Until then, there must be other ways to
make Social Security sexy.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion. Perhaps it would be fitting if Hugh Hefner, who
just turned 72, addressed the issue in Playboy. Remember that
endless series of editorials he wrote _ and may still be writing,
for all I know _ about the sexual revolution? He could do the same
for Social Security. And each month the featured Playmate could
call attention to a Social Security-related issue in provocative
yet tasteful photos: ``Miss March, Kimberlee Lou Nutsedge, believes
that at least half of projected federal budget surpluses should be
used to shore up Social Security reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to Monica. All roads lead to her. Much merriment ensued
when it was revealed that Monica's biographer, Andrew Morton,
suggested she start life anew in Boston. Local commentators
gleefully pointed out that Monica would not be at home in Boston or
welcomed here.
</P>
<P>
   I think we need Monica. This town is suffering from a severe
celebrity shortage. Genuine celebrities are as thin on the ground
as giant pandas. There's been so much talk about making Boston a
world-class city, although why anyone who loves Boston would wish
for such a horrible fate is beyond me. But if local boosters are
bent on world-class status, they should invite Monica to move here.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is read the local gossip columns to see the
scope of the celebrity shortage. The people who report and write
them have some of the toughest jobs in local journalism.
Celebrity-wise, Boston isn't LA or New York or even Washington,
D.C. Local TV personalities are huge celebrities in this town. And
restaurateurs. And hairdressers, for God's sake. They may be nice
people, but they're not real, genuine, top-of-the-line celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   The big celebrities we get in Boston are usually passing through
on their way to somewhere else. (Was that Leonardo DiCaprio at the
airport?) Or they're on a publicity tour. We used to have a few
big-name sports celebrities, but lately it seems all we hear about
are guys who used to play here and now are much more famous because
they play in New York or LA.
</P>
<P>
   Let's invite Monica to move to Boston. Maybe the city should
establish a one-year celebrity-in-residence position. Monica could
be the first. Her presence would certainly give a new dimension to
the Duck Tour.

 UNDATED: ... innocence now.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rimes is one of the lucky ones who seem destined, on the
strength of very real talent, to make a grown-up career in the
music business. The vast majority of teen sensations are being
groomed to make someone a fast buck as the flavor of the week.
Trans Continental, the Orlando. Fla., teen hit factory that's
turned out the Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync, and Britney Spears, has
four new and very familiar-sounding pop acts coming through the
mill: Lyte Funky Ones, C Note, Take 5, and Innosense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning we took it real seriously,'' says Kid David
Corey, program director at KISS-108 FM, of the teen pop acts. ``Now
I react differently, hearing the fifth, sixth group. C Note sounds
just like the Backstreet Boys. BWitched sounds just like the Spice
Girls. These artists are so producer-driven _ they sing and dance
well, but it takes more than that to have a career. I give it
another six to eight months.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright has now worked with two consecutive waves of teen
musicians, and he believes there will continue to be a market for
teen acts. ``There's a new crop of kids _ 7-, 8-, and 9-year-olds _
who are too young for Backstreet Boys, and they'll need music of
their own. And it's so supported by parents. We had a gansta-rap
situation, with killings, and a lot of negativity. Hard rock was
in. There was a cry in America for more positive images. Pop radio
is finally pop again. And parents are giving their kids more money
to buy records and go to concerts.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Greater expectations &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing the slew of up-and-coming performers, Wright
says, is that the bar has been raised so high. ``Backstreet Boys
have sold 10 million records, and 'N Sync has done 7 million. Based
on those numbers, a lot of the majors are going to say, `If you're
not doing that kind of business, we're not going to continue to
fund you.' Plus, a traveling entourage for a young act _ with
tutors, chaperones, etc. _ involves 15, 16 people. There are vocal
coaches and choreographers. It can be very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   So, paradoxically, time is not on the young star's side. Neither
are the statistics for enduring success, or emotional well-being.
When, at the height of the New Kids' success, Joey McIntyre saw his
face on a toy marble rolling down the hall, he was scared to death:
``It felt prophetic. It felt like that was my proverbial head
getting cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, in psychologist Berglas's view, is that the
young stars ultimately begin to see themselves _ and their value _
as a product, not a person. And the only way to circumnavigate
these psychological pitfalls, in Berglas's experience, is
``subordination of the ego to a greater good. Real religious
involvement, or real community involvement. Family. There's a
religious and familial asterisk that seems to keep people
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the advantage of a strong, supportive family, it has
taken McIntyre years to reclaim his identity. ``I was so anxious,''
he says. ``I had no idea why I was doing anything. Did I want to be
famous, back on top again? Did I want to get love that way? Then I
finally relaxed, and let it be. That kind of patience gave me the
energy to get what I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience, however, is not a defining feature of youth. Spears is
fretting over the time lost while she's been recuperating. ``After
I make up for all the stuff I've missed _ I had a talk-show
performance in London every day, and we had to cancel everything _
I'll come back to the US.'' There's a video to finish. And then ``I
start my own tour in July,'' says Spears, who's been on the road
opening for 'N Sync. ``I'm really, really excited about that! Then
after that I'll start a new record.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Spears finds time, she says, to attend church every
Sunday, and is planning a slumber party with her friends before
jetting off to Europe. At the suggestion that she seems to be
keeping her feet on the ground amid the sudden onslaught of fame,
Spears says ``Oh, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   And then she adds, ``But call me a year from now.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT'S NEW IN TEEN ACTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new teen acts are clearly created in the

FATHER KNOWS WORST 
</HEADLINE>

 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SINGLE &AMP; SINGLE 
By John le Carre. Scribner. 
345 pp. $26 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most writers, no matter how artful their camouflage, write the
same story again and again. Some do it for love and some for money;
in either case, if they are worthy of the task, we don't mind
seeing the return of the familiar beast. From John le Carre, we've
come to welcome it in all its guises: the old headquarters hero of
British intelligence who's lost his joe somewhere in the field; the
bright young female agent who further complicates matters; the
moral clarity and heartstopping pace that finish off the job. Oh,
and the exquisite foreign sheen that hovers over a le Carre
journey. Returning, I always feel I've been walking lonely London
streets at 3 a.m., or packing heat to protect me from a crisis of
the soul, or tasting the wind outside Istanbul from the back of a
motorbike bent for hell.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of his new novel, that machine is a BMW idling
loudly inside a palatial foyer, and it's emblematic of the getaway
wealth that procured it. Despite a lot of well-hyped fears to the
contrary, the end of the Cold War didn't slow down le Carre; no
fool he, this former queen's agent knew that, when the Berlin Wall
fell, the machinations of intelligence East and West would merely
seek refuge beneath its rubble. Or maybe try to sell it, piece by
piece. So it is that ``Single &AMP; Single'' sets its sights on filthy
lucre: the spell it casts and the prisoners it takes, whether in
its false promises to the desperate or its poisonous allure to the
power-hungry. This is a story of venture capitalism in a new global
regime, where the cowboys on all sides are as reckless as ever and
the profits are tallied in flesh and blood.
</P>
<P>
   In more ways than one, as it turns out: One of the lewder deals
being tossed around herein concerns the vast sums to be made in
human blood supplies. But when the story opens, it's the spilling
of one fellow's in particular that has our attention. Alfred
Winser, chief legal officer to the London financial house of Single
&AMP; Single, has found himself bound, on his knees, on a hilltop in
southern Turkey, about to be executed for his firm's alleged crimes
against their biggest clients. The guy holding the automatic is a
terrifying man named Alix Hoban, with Soviet intelligence in his
past and a look in his eyes as empty as space itself. This
agonizing sequence sets the stage as well as the tempo of the
novel, which backtracks to the wildly speculative last days of
communist Russia in order to unravel its tangled web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Single &AMP; Single'' is acceptably solid le Carre in the
post-Smiley days: not up to the psychic ache of ``The Perfect
Spy,'' say, but as satisfying in its way as such later works as
``The Night Manager.'' At its heart is a sweet giant of a man
passing himself off as Oliver Hawthorne, who in four years on the
lam has trained himself as a magician and now spends his days
entertaining children. He used to make coins disappear on a grander
scale: As the junior half of Single &AMP; Single, he watched his
father, Tiger, turn the investment house into a money-laundering
operation that could orchestrate every trick in the book. Wary of,
eventually sickened by, his father's finesse with odious
commodities, Oliver calls for a customs agent one night on a return
trip from Istanbul _ and lands in the welcoming arms of the
white-haired Nat Brock, who's probably as trustworthy as anyone in
Oliver's life.
</P>
<P>
   This familiar triangle _ Tiger, Oliver, and Brock _ offers the
melancholy, displaced paternal relationships that le Carre
understands so well; it also allows a couple of subplots to thrive
simultaneously. Tiger disappears after the news breaks of his
lawyer's murder, but before he goes, he manages to transfer more
than 5 million pounds into an account for Oliver's young daughter _
a child whose existence Oliver had thought was a secret from his
father. Brock's intention is to use Oliver to bring in Tiger: An
old-school Foreign Office man with a heart as well as a conscience,
Brock wants to gain access through Tiger to the criminal conspiracy
British intelligence refers to as Hydra _ many-headed and
pernicious, its reach extending everywhere from drugs and murder to
police corruption. The prototypical le Carre good replacement
father, Brock is as hard-boiled as he is noble: ``In our world,
Brock liked to preach, you did best to think dirty and double it.''
</P>
<P>
   All this action is set up in the first 100 pages of ``Single &AMP;
Single,'' which returns with dizzying acumen to the Soviet Union of
the last months before the fall in 1991 _ a world where blood and
scrap metal and oil were equally valuable resources, where dealers
and middlemen traded their souls for the numbers being crunched in
their dreams. Nobody can deliver this sort of arcane financial
milieu with such riveting (and moral) force as le Carre, who can
make a deal cemented in a West End office reverberate to the gates
of hell. He achieves that level of consequence here with icons of
innocence: the beautiful, doom-ridden Zoya, Hoban's reluctant wife;
her father, Yevgeny Orlov, ``Moscow's patriarchal fixer,'' who
still believes in something besides money; the children, specific
or anonymous, for whom Oliver could weave his magic spells. Quieter
but just as insistent is the innocence, sullied and then reclaimed,
of Oliver himself: The son who betrays the father, then tries to
save his life.
</P>
<P>
   As much as le Carre is lauded for the labyrinthine intelligence
of his fiction, what's more often overlooked is his expertise as a
set designer. ``Single &AMP; Single'' has a captivating physicality
about it, from that opening moment in the Turkish hills to the
plush and formidable inner sanctums of Tiger's offices. The
dialogue, cold-blooded and wry and often spoken between
translators, sounds nearly flawless. The only persistent failure
that tugs at one's sleeve is le Carre's relative inattention to a
few important characters: Bernard Purlock, Brock's British nemesis,
is too dangerous to be this vaguely drawn. Usually le Carre's women
are either sanctified or doomed, and delivered with a bit too much
remove. That's the problem here with Zoya, who in some ways is the
dark conscience of the novel, as well as with Brock's supergirl
agent, a Scottish woman named Aggie. Such sketchiness can't help
affecting the novel as a whole: What elevates le Carre's fiction
from merely first-rate suspense is the thick dimensions of his
characters, all of whom ought to be crafted with equal precision.
</P>
<P>
   With its various forms of sorcery and deception, ``Single &AMP;
Single'' possesses that resoundingly moody finish that le Carre
mastered a lifetime of novels ago. Rife with the themes of love and
regret, it most of all gives us each of its Singles in prismatic
relation to the other. ``You kill your father once and that's it,''
thinks Oliver in the midst of his disaffection. Well, not in John
le Carre country, where Oedipus is set loose, then tailed, down a
road that never ends.

KIDS AND GROWN-UPS ARE WILD ABOUT `HARRY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Kathleen Sweeney was bored with her book club's selection for
the January meeting. Hard as she tried, she couldn't seem to muddle
through ``The Puttermesser Papers,'' a cerebral collection of
stories by Cynthia Ozick.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, desperate to read ``something that grabbed me,'' the
37-year-old Sweeney reached for a children's book she'd bought for
her 11-year-old nephew, a novel called ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone,'' by J. K. Rowling (Scholastic/Arthur A. Levine).
</P>
<P>
   The book snared her and wouldn't let her go. ``I couldn't put it
down and stayed up until 2 a.m. to finish it,'' says the Somerville
business analyst. ``It's better than most adult fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out a lot of adults share Sweeney's taste in literature.
``Harry Potter'' (in Britain, where the book was first published,
the title is ``Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''),
Rowling's engrossing first novel about witchcraft and wizardry, may
have been written for 8- to 12-year olds, but it's developed a
secondary following among grown-ups. Since it was published in the
United States last September (it came out in the United Kingdom in
1997), adult readers have been so enthusiastic about ``Harry
Potter'' that the book has found its way to The New York Times
bestseller list 12 weeks running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter,'' which is the first title in a planned
seven-part series, is in first place on the Independent Booksellers
List, ahead of even John Grisham's ``The Testament.'' The British
publisher has also released the book with a more grown-up-looking
jacket to capitalize on the adult market.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is a fantasy about an orphan named Harry who spends
the first 10 years of his life in a gloomy cupboard under the
stairs in the home of his vile uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs.
Dursley. The Dursleys are Muggles (everyday people who dwell in the
human world), and they aren't exactly pleased that Harry is not.
(He's a wizard, though he doesn't yet know it himself.)
</P>
<P>
   Harry's fortunes change, however, when he receives an invitation
to attend the exclusive Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
a kind of sorcery prep school steeped in tradition where the list
of school supplies includes ``1 cauldron (pewter, standard size
2)'' and ``an owl OR a cat OR a toad.''
</P>
<P>
   It is at Hogwarts that Harry faces his limitations and fears
(``I'll bet I'm the worst in the class,'' he confides miserably to
a friend ), and earns his first broomstick, a sporty Nimbus Two
Thousand. Here he meets his first intellectual snob (``I'm
particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know,'' she sniffs
one day, annoying the other students); he gets a taste of British
class consciousness when a fellow student cautions him that at
Hogwarts ``some wizarding families are much better than others'' _
and ultimately he faces a terrifying villain.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from customer comments on the Amazon.com Web site,
children and adults are equally enchanted by the book's characters
and story line. Comments range from a girl in Massachusetts who
shares that ``me and all my friends all love this book'' to the
adult reader in Hawaii who writes ``Not since reading Madeleine
L'Engle's `A Wrinkle in Time' as a kid in fifth grade have I ever
been so entranced by a book.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's adult readers range from parents who were turned on
to it by their kids, to others, like Katherine French of Cambridge,
who has two young daughters but ``bought it primarily for myself.''
The book was recommended to French by a friend after she complained
she hadn't read a novel with a strong plot in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so longing for good fiction,'' says French, director of
Sherman and 808 galleries at Boston University. ``And with this
one, the writing, the rhythm of it, the beat, magically draw you in
where you think: This is so well written. It reminds me of the best
of E. B. White, like `Charlotte's Web.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No lesser a Muggle than Caroline Seitz _ wife of the former US
ambassador in London _ has gone wild over the book. When the book's
British publisher, Bloomsbury, held a children's party in January
to launch the paperback version of the second book in the Harry
Potter series, Seitz, who still lives in London, could not keep
herself away. Seitz, 56, and her 49-year-old friend Victoria
Legge-Bourke _ the former social attache of the British Embassy in
Washington _ swept into the party in full witch regalia, sporting
stuffed white owls on their shoulders attached with Velcro strips,
and gold and silver sprinkles on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we carried brooms and wands,'' said Seitz, in a telephone
interview from London, noting that ``Harry Potter'' so delighted
her that she ``promptly bought a dozen copies for friends and
family _ aged 20 to 80 _ in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I love the book for the same reasons all adults do,''
says Seitz. ``You know, a friend of mine said to me, with a
noticeable sigh: `Life is so daily.' It's the reason this book is
really appealing. It is grounded in everyday reality, yet puts an
amazing spin of enchantment over daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Harry Potter'' has been so much in demand by adults in
England, where it won the British National Book Award, that
Bloomsbury has issued its special adult edition.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was prompted ``by anecdotal evidence of pin-striped
businessmen sitting on the tube reading the book behind their
newspaper,'' says Rosamund de la Hey, children's sales and
marketing manager for Bloomsbury, in a telephone interview. ``And
we were getting letters from kids saying, `Dad's pinched my book!'
''
</P>
<P>
   Adult versions have also come out in Germany and Italy, says
Christopher Little, Rowling's literary and film agent, in an
interview from London. (Warner Bros. has purchased the rights to
the first two books in the series.) Says Little: ``I've never,
never, never seen anything like this before. Everyone is clamoring
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The author herself acknowledges that she didn't expect the book
to be so hugely popular among adults, but ``having said that,
without being arrogant, it isn't hugely surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote `Harry' for me, says Rowling, in a telephone interview
from her home in Edinburgh. ``I never fantasized about what a
9-year-old would like. It's my humor, not an adulterated version of
my humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a shrewd marketing strategy on the part of Scholastic
hasn't hurt the book's sales figures either. The book's publicity
literature prominently features the fact that the author has had an
almost Potteresque rags-to-riches rise to fame. ``J. K. Rowling was
a struggling single mother when she wrote the beginnings of `Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' on scraps of paper at a local
cafe,'' a press release says.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing tactics bemuse Rowling, 33, who has already
completed the third book in the series. ``To be honest, it was
taken out of my hands,'' she says. ``It is all true. I was as poor
as you can get. And I did write in cafes, to get out of the house,
and I only had money for one cup of coffee at a time. This is not a
complaint; I'm not ashamed of having gone through that. I'm quite
proud of it. But I don't want to dwell on it. The book really saved
my sanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the strategy has obviously worked. ``I love the idea of
somebody writing a book on napkins,'' says local fan Sweeney.
``It's a romantic image. It gives you hope that anyone can fit that
kind of creativity into their lives, under fairly oppressive
circumstances.''

`WHAT DREAMS' A WASTE; `BARRIO' THE REAL THING

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``What Dreams May Come'' _ Robin Williams stars in
a treacly tale of life in the hereafter. Believe me, if it's filled
with the cotton-candy colors and unbearable aphorisms that populate
this moronic concoction, I'd just as soon accept Flannery
O'Connor's view (in ``Wise Blood'') that ``them's that dead stay
that way.'' Cuba Gooding Jr. is wasted in a throwaway role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down for the Barrio'' _ This low-budget action picture has
some technical flaws and awkward dramatic sections, but the
realistic footage of LA street gang _ and the pure conviction of
the filmmakers _ more than makes up for its shortcomings.

   DVD UPDATE: ``Armageddon'' might not have rocked too many
critics' Top 10 lists, but it's become a favorite of the DVD set.
It tops the video sales list for the third week in a row. ``I shot
`Armageddon' with DVD in mind,'' director Michael Bay told Video
magazine. ``Because of my background in commercials, I've always
been aware of the degradation factor you get with broadcast and, to
a lesser extent, with film transfers. With DVD, you get none of
that. And the sound fidelity is unmatched.''

STAYING AFLOAT IN A SEA OF SORROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If &UR;  &LR; the old Yiddish saying _ ``If you want to make God laugh,
tell him your plans'' _ is true, then Julia Sweeney must have made
the heavens rumble with gales of guffaws a few years ago. It was
1994, and Sweeney, newly divorced and still smarting from the
critical and commercial bludgeoning of her first film, ``It's
Pat,'' had just moved into a new Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Then her younger brother Mike was diagnosed with lymphoma. With
no insurance and his health deteriorating, he moved in with
Sweeney. Her parents then left their Spokane, Wash., home, and also
moved in with Sweeney to help take care of Mike. And if coping as a
thirtysomething suddenly invaded by her parents, and the
devastating decline of her beloved brother, weren't enough, three
weeks before Mike's death Sweeney herself was diagonosed with
cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Humor kept Sweeney afloat in this sea of sorrow, and the wry,
poignant observations about the most difficult year of her life
became an acclaimed one-woman show, ``God Said `Ha!' '' _ the title
of which was inspired by that Yiddish adage. Her performance, which
played for six weeks on Broadway, is now a film, which opens
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people ask me if the show helped me get over it, I say,
`No, it didn't, it didn't help at all, it had nothing to do with
it, it's completely separate,' '' said Sweeney with mock shrillness
during a Boston visit last fall. ``But in a way it did; I took this
sad experience, and this is what I made it into. Yet in some ways,
it's still going on, so it's not like it ever really came to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I resist saying it's been cathartic,'' she said. ``I
don't like people who do stuff because it's cathartic to them. I
don't want to be like Suzanne Somers starring in my own life
story.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sweeney, ``God Said `Ha!' '' was created
``organically.'' Shortly before learning of her brother's illness,
Sweeney was invited by her friend Kathy Griffin (of TV's ``Suddenly
Susan'') to join an alternative comedy group. ``We had to tell
stories for 15 minutes, the stories had to be true, and it had to
be the first time you used it as material,'' she recalled. ``It
didn't have to be recent, but you couldn't know where the jokes
were, and it couldn't have the rhythm of stand-up. It was like
group therapy with really funny people doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   After her brother and parents moved in, Sweeney would slip off
to the group and perform. At first, she wouldn't discuss the
details of her life, because she ``didn't want to bring the
audience down.'' But as the pressures at home began to mount,
Sweeney found she couldn't avoid talking about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't give a (expletive) anymore,'' she said. ``I
needed to get up there and rant. My parents didn't even know where
I was going.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Genesis of a show &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her performance became such a rave, Sweeney put together a
45-minute tape as a showcase for television casting directors. With
the encouragement of friends, Sweeney turned the performance into a
one-woman stage show. After her brother's death, the show premiered
in San Francisco to enthusiastic reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into show business because I saw Lily Tomlin'' do her
one-woman show, ``The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the
Universe,'' Sweeney, 39, said. ``So I always wanted to do something
like that. I just never thought I would just talk as myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of talking about herself meant talking about her parents,
Bob and Jeri Sweeney, and how their presence in her home thoroughly
disrupted her life. That included her mother's controlling
tendencies, and her father's drinking. But Sweeney assumed her
parents would never find out about the show _ until a review of her
performance found its way to Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, a bunch of their friends had moved to San
Francisco, so that's how they found out about it,'' said the
refreshingly pleasant Sweeney with a laugh. ``They didn't hear it
from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents soon booked a flight to San Francisco to see the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having heart attacks that day,'' Sweeney said. ``I kept
thinking I had to work myself into this big, `You know, this is my
art, and I can't worry about hurting your feelings because this is
what I have to say, and in the end, it's more important for me to
express myself than worry about hurting your feelings.' That's what
I really believe as an artist and writer, but who wants to say that
to their parents?''
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, she took them to dinner and read parts of the
performance she thought might offend them. When her mother finally
said, ``You know, we can handle a lot,'' Sweeney said their
reaction became ``one of the best parts of this whole story. They
just wanted me to do well. My mom would even make jokes like,
`Well, I'm going to put together my own one-woman show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's brother died in April 1995, at 31. But her
performance, and now the film, have helped to keep him alive, she
said. He is present in her performance, including his quip after
her diagnosis that Sweeney had a case of ``sympathy cancer.'' After
several surgeries and radiation treatments, Sweeney said, she is
now cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   Yet looking back on her experience, Sweeney wishes she had
spoken more about her own ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel emotionally that much about my cancer until this
last year. My cancer experience was so colored by Mike's cancer
experience that I never got to feel sorry for myself, or say, `Oh,
that was (expletive) for me,' '' she said. ``At the time, all I
could think was how it wasn't nearly as bad as what Mike had to go
through. So I think I sound too flip about my cancer, just a
little. I just wish I had a couple less jokes about it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`The kid thing' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She also wished she addressed ``the kid thing.'' Her surgeries,
which included a hysterectomy, left her unable to have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I didn't have anything where I needed to have a
biological kid. But now I wish I could just be pregnant. I feel
like I'm missing this really important life experience for women,
this `real woman experience' that I don't get to have,'' she said.
``It's not like I'm really down about it, but I just wish in the
show I had addressed that. It would have been OK to let that be
sad. I think that was part of my defense then, that I wouldn't let
myself let that be sad.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sweeney conducted this interview, she was still reeling
from the loss of her longtime friend Phil Hartman, the actor and
fellow ``Saturday Night Live'' alum who was shot to death last May
by his wife, Brynn, who then killed herself. Hartman, who had been
Sweeney's mentor since their days with the famed LA comedy troupe
the Groundlings, helped Sweeney deal with her brother's death and
her own illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still talk about Phil all the time. He was really a big part
of my life, a really important person in my life,'' she said. ``My
boyfriend, Carl, said to me that in the last year, we'd spent the
Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, New Year's Eve, and Easter
with the Hartmans. Their kids played with my boyfriend's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I still can't believe it, I just can't believe it.
It's still like, `What?' '' Sweeney said. ``I can't make sense of
it. I think I'll just still be figuring it out for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman is casually mentioned in the film when Sweeney frets
about finding something polite to say about his 1994 comedy,
``Houseguest,'' which she hated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I thought about it, I felt bad because I say something
derogatory about `Houseguest,' '' Sweeney said. ``But you know
what? Phil thought `Houseguest' was bad, too.''

`STRANGE WORLD' SEEMS QUITE FAMILIAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
STRANGE WORLD 
Starring: Tim Guinee, Vivian Wu, Krisin Lehman 
On: ABC, four-week Tuesday run Tuesday at 10 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone ought to produce a TV show called ``The Xerox-Files.''
At its center would be a Hollywood renegade, gloomy and handsome,
whose obsessive mission in life is to investigate ``criminal abuses
of script cloning.'' In his heart, this laconic hero would know
that behind every ``Friends'' rip-off, behind every blue-lit cop
show with blurry moral lines, behind every office ensemble sitcom
set at a media outlet, there is a conspiracy, a massive and demonic
plot by a syndicate of entertainment honchos, to make the public
believe they actually have imagination. He would even have in his
possession taped evidence of the abduction of the muse and papers
that verify a bankruptcy of inspiration. But, steeped in the
mellow, decaf-latte-soaked world of Southern California, our secret
agent would be only a green pawn in their green game, a helpless
jump-roper in a Lala land of bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning _ of people, not of TV series concepts _ is actually one
of the themes of ``Strange World,'' a dreary new ABC series that
aspires to be another ``X-Files.'' The show, which premiered Monday
night at 10, is a shameless Attempt by former ``X-Files'' producer
Howard Gordon to replicate his hugely successful Fox
science-fiction series. It's a ponderous hour filled with portent,
paranoia, and muddy political intrigue, and it contains enough dim
lighting and rainfall to give you a prolonged case of Seasonal
Affective Disorder. And it also has its very own version of
Cigarette Smoking Man, a magically elusive and mysteriously
powerful person whom we know only as Asian Woman.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Strange World'' plot turns around Paul Turner, a former
Army scientist employed by some shady military officials to look
into ``criminal abuses of science.'' Those investigations will
comprise the episode-by-episode story lines, but then, in true
``X-Files'' fashion, there will be an ongoing conspiracy drama
about Turner himself. During the Gulf War, he was exposed to
chemical weapons that have left him with an unnamed degenerative
disease involving anemia and skin lesions. His only hope is a
miracle drug, supplied to him on a dose-by-dose basis by Asian
Woman and her syndicate of Enigmatic People. We can only wait,
probably, in the manner of ``The X-Files,'' until the 12th of
Never, to find out who ``they'' are and why ``they'' have their eye
on Turner.
</P>
<P>
   As Turner, Tim Guinee is perfectly gaunt, haunted, and unshaven,
giving his drug-dependent character a tinge of junkie affect. He
looks like a pained Michael J. Fox after a year on the streets, and
you may find yourself wishing him some fast relief. ``There is a
reason you were chosen,'' Asian Woman tells him, but only the most
patient viewers will want to stick around to learn what it is. The
fate of ``Strange World'' is uncertain, once ``NYPD Blue'' returns
in April.

BROWSING IN THE NEW RELIGIOUS MARKETPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
WORKING ON GOD 
By Winifred Gallagher 
Random House, 340 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This rich and intelligent book treads on some very familiar
ground. The idea that material success doesn't necessarily add up
to personal happiness has become a recurring theme in the
cornucopia of books about America's yearning for spiritual
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   But Winifred Gallagher, a New York-based writer struggling to
find her own spiritual niche, leads us on an intimate and revealing
pilgrimage into America's restless soul. The result is an honest
and sometimes poignant appraisal of a religious revolution afoot in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher comes up with a useful term to describe a population
of spiritual seekers who aren't always found inside the
neighborhood church, synagogue, or mosque: neoagnostics.
</P>
<P>
   As Gallager explains at the beginning of ``Waiting on God,''
these people ``are well-educated skeptics who have inexplicable
metaphysical feelings. They regard religion as belief in the
unbelievable. Yet they sense something important that eludes their
most trusted tools of intellect and learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Science and technolgy, which we are led to believe can
eventually provide the answers to most (if not all) of our
problems, have left us further disconnected and alienated. The age
of reason has not quieted our clamoring souls. And at the end of
the day, as Gallagher skillfully chronicles, a hefty paycheck, a
late-model luxury sedan, even our families aren't enough to
eliminate the gnawing sense of emptiness that has come to
characterize the lives of many comfortable Americans.
</P>
<P>
   This sense of societal anomie has fueled a spiritual crusade
that extends in many directions: to Buddhist retreat centers, to
healing services in Christian churches, and to contemporary Shabbat
services in synagogues. It is a quest for meaning that is often
messy, often complex, and very hard to define.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neoagnostics are America's most subdued, neglected religious
group, yet they are one of its most powerful,'' Gallagher writes.
``They are everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   What Gallagher does very well is document how a vast slice of
America is no longer interested in or willing to be bound by
institutions, creeds, or family tradition. They want experiences
that touch them to the core. Meanwhile, she notes, the religious
services in many houses of worship have become rote, dull, and
lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   While Gallagher's childhood religion was Roman Catholicism, she
also finds comfort in a Zen monastery, a conservative Jewish
synagogue, and a liberal Episcopal congregation. Though clergy in
the pulpit may not like it, this type of blending or layering of
religion is rapidly becoming a central hallmark of our nation's
religious landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``In religion as in politics, scholarship and the arts,
sophisticated citizens of a global society no longer look to a
single source for all the good ideas, much less Truth,'' Gallagher
shrewdly notes.
</P>
<P>
   America's growing diversity _ with immigrants from Asia, Africa,
and Latin America _ has brought with it a dizzying array of faith
experiences and created a huge religious marketplace in which many
Americans are eager to browse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than being a complete worldview or infallible arbiter
of right and wrong, each tradition has become a `toolbox,' ''
Gallagher writes. ``A person roots through a chest labeled
`Christianity' or `Judaism,' or even `Catholic' or `Orthodox,'
ignores the elements that don't seem significant or `right' _
perhaps second-class status for outsiders _ and uses the ones that
do _ sacraments, say, or keeping kosher.
</P>
<P>
   ``With them people build up-to-date, customized religious
structures that, like a renovated Victorian house or a brand-new
log cabin, retain the oomph of tradition. Other individuals borrow
elements from an Asian faith, or from the new `theologies'
developed by women, say, or gay people.''
</P>
<P>
   The one shortcoming of Gallagher's otherwise fine effort to
cover this postmodern spirituality is that in the rush to show the
eclectic nature of today's spiritual journeys she occasionally
bounces from topic to topic so quickly she loses the reader. In a
few breathless paragraphs, we're sailing with the spiritual leader
of the world's Orthodox Christians on the Black Sea, listening to
renowned Harvard sociobiologist E. O. Wilson preach in New York,
and hearing the challenges facing the founder of a bank for the
poor in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   We're left trying to catch our breath. But that's just a minor
quibble in an outstanding piece of writing that shows the strength
and beauty of America's beating religious heart.

I'M OK, YOU'RE OK, Y2K? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The message, it seems, is everywhere. A sign outside a church
asks, ``Are you ready for Y2K or the Rapture?'' The past week's
newspapers were full of warnings from US Senator Robert Bennett, a
Utah Republican, that the Y2K issue ``exposes the vulnerability of
nearly every major sector of the economy.'' And The Drudge Report
recently posted the screaming headline: ``Americans Urged to Stock
Up Before Y2K Strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The century-flip computer problem that could conceivably wreak
havoc on everything from our banking system to Russia's nuclear
arsenal clearly has us worried. In a recent survey by the Media
Studies Center, 53 percent of the respondents said Y2K is one of
the most important issues facing the country. A smaller study
released by Dr. Michelle Weil and Dr. Larry Rosen, coauthors of the
book ``TechnoStress,'' indicated widespread fear about the safety
of credit cards and bank accounts as our sophisticated, high-tech
nation battles the bug. It's might versus byte.
</P>
<P>
   But is that all there is to the Y2K scare? Or has the computer
bug become a convenient catchall for channeling our free-floating
anxiety about the unknown? Is it a manageable, even face-saving way
for a modern people to express their most primitive fears about the
future?
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is the ``first apocalyptic prediction in history (in which
we know) that something will happen on that date,'' says Stephen
O'Leary, an associate professor of communications at the University
of Southern California. ``It becomes the perfect blank slate on
which to project our millennial fears.''
</P>
<P>
   The mental health industry is already gearing up to deal with
Y2K. Jerilyn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders Association
of America, says, ``People are uncomfortable with change and the
unknown,'' and those ``who are normally anxious people are going to
have heightened sensitivity and anxiety.'' Carol Goldberg, a
clinical psychologist who focuses on stress management, concurs,
saying, ``People may project some of their anxieties and fears and
blame Y2K as a scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   At a January public forum on Y2K held in New York City, one
speaker rose to propound the socially acceptable view of the issue.
``I don't think Y2K is a religious problem,'' she declared. ``It is
a technological problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same forum _ sponsored by the Media Studies Center _
the very first citizen speaker sounded less than cooly rational.
She asserted that if everyone withdrew $3,000 from their savings
accounts, ``The banks would all go under, and the people are not
being told that. . . . Nobody knows what's going on with anything.
Out of town, they've already stocked up with money, food, water.''
</P>
<P>
   That same brand of fear _ ostensibly rooted in a computer
dilemma, but tinged with a more fundamentalist panic _
characterizes a substantial amount of the Y2K alarm. It's obvious
in the the words of Y2K analyst Gary North, who counsels on his Web
site that Y2K ``may be the biggest problem that the modern world
has ever faced. I think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's embedded in the advice of Jim Lord, a retired Navy officer
and software engineer whose survival recommendations include
everything from buying gold to leaving population centers. Whatever
it is that he envisions people running from, it's bigger than a
computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had in the last 40 or 50 years a number of events which
have provided support for an apocalyptic worldview by shifting the
evidentiary base for the apocalyptic argument,'' says O'Leary,
citing the founding of the state of Israel, the development of
nuclear weapons, and growing environmental fears. Now, he says, Y2K
``is kind of the classic. . . . They're secularizing that religious
fear by focusing on the computer panic as the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Landes, a history professor at Boston University, is the
director of the Center For Millennial Studies, which was founded in
1996. ``One of the things that motivated us to start the center
(is) that there is nothing more important to anyone alive than what
the future is,'' says Landes. He believes ``a fairly high level of
concern is appropriate,'' in the case of Y2K. Yet, he characterizes
some of the fear as ``a modern secular version of religious stuff
that some of us think happened around the year 1000.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Quinby, the author of ``Millennial Seduction: A Skeptic
Confronts Apocalyptic Culture,'' says Y2K is a fitting millenn

NEW KIDS ON THE CLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began, like all fads, without much fanfare. Several years
ago, teenage singers began trickling onto the pop music scene. A
Brandy album here. A Fiona Apple record there. Then, in 1997,
Hanson opened the floodgates with the astonishing success of
``MMMBop.'' In the last 12 months the trickle has become a
full-blown gush, as the latest wave of teen musicians crests in a
massive pop music trend.
</P>
<P>
   Five of last week's Top 10 singles on the Hot 100 Billboard
charts are by teen artists _ R &AMP; B singer Monica; pop sensation
Britney Spears; a pair of harmonizing quintets, Backstreet Boys and
'N Sync; and the R &AMP; B singer/TV star Brandy. On the R &AMP; B charts,
19-year-old Foxy Brown was in the No. 2 position, just behind
Lauryn Hill. Even classical music has two new teen stars:
12-year-old Welsh singer Charlotte Church and 19-year-old violin
prodigy Hilary Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   We're watching the latest teen-idol craze, and if history is any
indication, the window of opportunity is a small one. The mad dash
to cash in on the phenomenon is in full stride, and music-industry
suits are out to break the next Britney or 'N Sync before the trend
reaches its inevitable saturation point. At least a dozen
major-label debut albums by under-20 performers are slated for
release in the coming months (see accompanying story). The small
percentage with genuine talent may make the transition from teen
sensation to adult artist; most of the wannabes will have a
painfully brief shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they sustain careers or bottom out fast, all of them
will have to deal with the unique challenges of achieving stardom
at a tender age. Ogled, handled, insulated, and rich, teen stars
grow up outside conventional reality and everyday experience. And
according to both the experts and the historical record _ remember
Tanya Tucker? or Leif Garrett? _ well as some of the underage icons
themselves, the social and emotional fallout can be debilatating.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting perky atop the latest teen-dream heap is 17-year-old
Britney Spears, a button-cute veteran of the new-defunct Mickey
Mouse Club television show (as are two members of 'N Sync and Keri
Russell of TV's ``Felicity''). Spears's album of funky-lite
dance-pop, ``. . . Baby One More Time,'' and its first single
debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's album and single charts
simultaneously; that's a first for a new artist. Five weeks later
the album, which has posted record-breaking sales gains each week,
was still at No. 1. The single was just last week bumped out of the
top spot _ by 18-year-old Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked so hard and have totally dreamed of this,''
Spears says on the phone from home in Kentwood, La., where she's
nursing a twisted knee. ``I'm like, God has totally blessed me.''
These two weeks at home to recuperate are a godsend as well, says
Spears, a polite, bubbly teen who peppers her conversation with
``Yes, ma'am'' and ``No ma'am.'' Normally Jive, her record label,
lets her come home for a visit every six weeks. ``I've slept and
slept and slept. When I'm on the road, no matter where I was, I'd
wake up early and do phoners (telephone interviews),'' Spears says,
when asked to describe a typical day. ``In London, I'd do TV show
after TV show and interview after interview. I eat lunch in the van
while someone's doing my hair. At night, I'd come in and sleep from
around 2 to 6. They could work me to death and I wouldn't say
anything. But I was like, `Y'all, I get delirious if I don't get 10
hours.' I was feeling really sick. I finally said, `Look, I need to
rest more.' So they're gonna give me a day here and there to
rest.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pleasing the starmakers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spears seems happy to put in the long hours required to fuel the
starmaking machinery _ after all, girls who dress up to look like
you and boys who scrawl prom invitations on their bare chests make
for powerfully flattering stuff. Not to mention the thrill of
capping a trip to Jack-in-the-Box with a stop at Cartier.
</P>
<P>
   But the suddenly and massively successful teenager pays a price,
according to Harvard Medical School psychologist Steven Berglas.
``The young stars are totally amazed at themselves,'' says Berglas,
whose books include ``The Success Syndrome: Hitting Bottom When You
Reach the Top'' and who has worked with prominent rock bands,
models, and executives. ``They're kids. They have no idea where
their power comes from. There's not a sense of self-esteem
predicated on picking yourself up and dusting yourself off, as the
song goes. Success that is hard-won is rewarding, but success that
appears to be an act of God is frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that these youngsters are cultivated by
those closest to them for public consumption, says Berglas, and
you've got a recipe for disaster. ``They walk into an interview and
have their hair pushed, they're told to walk that way, to change
their clothes, their look,'' Berglas says. ``They become observers
of themselves. It's not a comforting experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Former New Kid on the Block Joey McIntyre, who just released his
first post-Kids solo album, concurs. ``The ride up was great, but
once you're there it's crazy,'' says the 26-year-old McIntyre, who
was 15 when the Boston-based New Kids became global superstars.
``It gets so big. Everybody's tugging at you and you want to be
everything to everyone. Everybody's telling you, and you're even
telling yourself, that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But
part of me just wanted to have a regular life. I couldn't wait to
get out on the corner and hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre credits strong family ties, especially consistent
parenting, with keeping him grounded. Johnny Wright, who manages
Britney Spears and 'N Sync and was tour manager for the New Kids,
has seen it go both ways. ``Back in the New Kids days it wasn't
bad,'' Wright says on the phone from Orlando (a Cape Cod native,
Wright moved south five years ago). ``We had a `friends bus' that
came out with us, and family came out on the road, too. So even
though they didn't go to the prom and football games, they were
surrounded. It's the same with 'N Sync. But I've seen situations
where teens start making money and the parents simply stop being
parents. They become friends. They stop saying no, because they
don't want to stop the money flow.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of actual friends? Spears says she ``doesn't really
have time to meet anybody. It's kind of good because I'm so busy.''
She did have a boyfriend, she explains, ``but it just didn't work
out with me traveling. I'm not good on the phone. I don't know . .
.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
More fame, less love &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The more popular you are, paradoxically, the less affection
can break through,'' Berglas explains. ``The hardest thing for the
star to discern is `do they love me for what I am?' In a way, the
feeling of human connection is destroyed by having this universal
appeal. It's hard to forge a relationship.'' That complex
psychological dynamic is compounded by the simple logistical
restrictions of being a performer on the road _ where teens have
tutors rather than attending school, and a busload of grown-up
handlers instead of classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old country singer LeAnn Rimes, who recorded her
first record when she was 11, left public school in sixth grade.
She's just now beginning to look back. ``I'm really just learning
to make friends,'' says Rimes on the phone from Los Angeles, where
she's recently begun work on a new record. Rimes was 14 when her
album ``Blue'' debuted at No. 1 on the country charts. ``For the
last few years I was around the same group of people _ my band, my
mom and dad. It was great. They were my best friends. But I'm not
the same as a normal 16-year-old. I feel 30. I'm trying to get back
some of that innocence now.''

VAIL STRUGGLES THROUGH A DOWN YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Note use of italics in graf 4. HAS ART)  
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Like most of Colorado's ski resorts, Vail fidgeted
nervously through the first two months of the winter season.
Because of the peculiar La Nina effect, storms slammed California's
Sierra Nevada but left the Rocky Mountains high, dry and relatively
free of snow.
</P>
<P>
   When the snowstorms finally began to arrive with regularity in
January _ light dustings, not the powder dumps common to the
Rockies _ Vail knew it would be fighting an uphill battle on
perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   There's 5 feet of snow at Vail? How could that possibly stack up
to the 15 feet at Lake Tahoe or the 13 feet at Mammoth? Why even
leave California?
</P>
<P>
   But Vail officials feel they can build a strong case for
consideration. It's based on their effort in recent years to
broaden the appeal of the ski area, one of the most popular in
Colorado. (BEGIN ITALICS)Yes, there may not be six inches of new
powder out there every other day, but the skiing is still very
good, and are you aware of everything else there is to do out
there?(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that people were taking fewer vacations and spending
more time in one destination,'' Vail Resorts spokeswoman Chelsea
Stewart said of recent surveys conducted by the company. ``They
were also bringing more family members. We tried to create more
options, so if Grandma comes along to watch the little one, there's
something for her to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe so, but if you can talk Grandma into sprawling onto
an inner tube for a precipitous plunge down a banked sledding run,
you're one persuasive soul.
</P>
<P>
   The tubing run is one of the more popular attractions at
Adventure Ridge, a play park in a reasonably flat area at the top
of Vail's gondola lift. On a recent Sunday afternoon, it teemed
with activity _ skiers accounting for only a small portion of it.
</P>
<P>
   In a relatively confined area, there is an ice-skating rink,
guided snowmobile tours, laser tag, rentals of snowshoes and snow
bikes, and a racetrack for miniature snowmobiles. Students in ski
and snowboard school tumble this way and that, their equipment
often a hopeless tangle.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the tubes.
</P>
<P>
   On a steep hill, several runs have been laid out, each with
banked sides like a bobsled track. Vail officials said they had a
lot of visitors asking about sledding opportunities in the area.
This attraction, in its third year, was the response to that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most bothersome aspect of sliding down a
snow-covered hill on any device is having to lug it back to the
top. That issue is addressed here by a cable tow that latches onto
a strap and tugs each tube to the top of the run.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, it's not unusual for first-timers to balk at
plunging off the edge until a few more tubers have slid safely to
the bottom, offering evidence that mayhem is not imminent. Personal
experience attests to the fact that those tubes fly down that face,
but beyond the initial terror, the primary effect is a peeling off
of years. On this particular afternoon, in fact, dads and moms
seemed to be racing their little ones to the cable tow for another
go at it.
</P>
<P>
   Vail keeps the area at the top of the gondola open until 11 p.m.
_ and then provides ample reasons to be there. One restaurant,
sponsored by Kendall Jackson wines, offers dinner on white
tablecloths with wait service _ a refreshing break from the
cafeteria monotony of most on-mountain eateries. Another
establishment, sponsored by Baileys, serves as kind of an adult
warming hut. Outside, near the ice-skating rink, a giant fire pit
blazes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sun deck _ which features live entertainment most
afternoons _ a bar, a pizza joint and an evening buffet. And for
those revelers who can't quite leave the office entirely behind,
there is even a business center with access to e-mail, faxes,
teleconferencing and other modern-day intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   A nonski gondola pass costs $15 daily ($10 for children under
12), but there is no charge to ride to the top after 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Vail's mind-boggling array of alternatives to skiing
itself, skiers and snowboarders don't exactly get short shrift. The
mountain here is really more like a broad ridge. There are runs
down the front, down the west side and even off the back, where
advanced skiers can negotiate one of eight bowls. The entire layout
covers 4,644 acres and features 174 trails.
</P>
<P>
   Another Vail strategy has been an aggressive targeting of the
international market. Resort officials report that foreign visitors
to the company's four major properties (Vail, Breckenridge, Beaver
Creek, Keystone) represented 15 percent of last year's lift-ticket
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Vail and Beaver Creek played host to the 1999 World Alpine
Skiing Championships _ Europe's winter-sports Super Bowl _ in early
February. That meant the presence of ABC's cameras, ESPN's cameras
and a media contingent that numbered in the quadruple digits. The
overseas TV market alone was estimated at a half-billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the benefit is not immediately felt, Vail stands ready
to greet the international ski vacationer. Its ski and snowboard
school offers instruction in more than 30 languages, including
Croatian and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   The layout of this area is attractive, too. Although Vail does
hug I-70 (detractors in more secluded resorts refer to it as ``A
Freeway Runs Through It''), the long, narrow strip of village
between the interstate and the base of the mountain has plenty of
charm.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it was laid out in a European mountain theme, with
narrow, winding streets along which stand small eateries, bars,
shops and galleries. Gore Creek babbles down the middle. But
perhaps the most appealing feature is the lack of cars: Most of the
streets are designated for pedestrians only, and a free shuttle
transports visitors along the edge of the village.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether these attributes and Vail's broad range
of winter-sports offerings have been sufficient to attract visitors
in customary numbers this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Vail Resorts' Paul Witt said business was off about 7 percent at
the end of December. He could not provide figures for subsequent
attendance; the company is privately held, Witt said, and only
reveals such numbers quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   It is his sense, however, that Vail has rebounded from the blahs
of early season. ``Certainly, the world championships were
extremely successful for us,'' Witt said, ``and the new snow always
draws more people to the slopes.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as people find out about it.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Jacob of the Vail Valley Tourism and Convention Bureau
said of the perceptions battle: ``It's hard for us because people
all want it to be a dump every day. Unfortunately, Mother Nature
doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent mild storms _ usually dropping two or three inches at
a time _ have generated good conditions, even though the snow
levels have been lagging about 5 percent to 10 percent below
normal.
</P>
<P>
   At least one recent event helped perk up spirits around here. On
the first day of the world championships, a race had to be
postponed ... because snow was falling so heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Fate has been known to have an impeccable sense of timing. &QL;

PARK WITH UNDERGROUND CAVES REOPENS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Can you imagine exploring a park where you
actually go underground? Actually walking 400 feet into a hole that
has been bored miles into the Earth?
</P>
<P>
   With the opportunity to explore another half dozen cave-like
tunnels?
</P>
<P>
   The tunnel trails at Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve
reopened last weekend. It is like no other park in the San
Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   This adventure has been off-limits for nearly 10 years, since
the Loma Prieta earthquake of October 1989, which damaged the
tunnels. That damage has been repaired and the mines have passed
recent inspections, offering visitors an adventure at one of the
bay area's most unusual destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Black Diamond is located in the Mount Diablo foothills near
Antioch, but no matter where you live, this getaway is worth
checking out, and one that you will never forget (especially if
your flashlight goes out).
</P>
<P>
   Historically, this was the largest coal mining area in
California, hence the name ``Black Diamond.'' The park is built
around a complex network of mining tunnels, once used to mine coal
and silica sand. The coal was used for heating and fueling
California's industrial revolution, especially to power railroads
and riverboats. The silica sand was used to make glass, most
popular for canning jars, ketchup bottles and drinking glasses.
</P>
<P>
   It was closed as a coal mine in the early 1900s and ended
operation as a silica sand mine in the late 1940s. It became a
regional park 25 years ago, but since the earthquake and the
closures of the tunnel trails, it has largely been overlooked by
all but nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
   No more now that the tunnel trails have been reopened along with
an underground chamber that has been converted to what is called
the ``Greathouse Visitor Center.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two great trails here, completely different in scope.
</P>
<P>
   The new highlight is the Hazel-Atlas Mine, where visitors can
walk 400 feet into the earth, an eerie sensation. This trip is
expected to be popular and reservations are advised, with a tour
fee of $2.50 per person. The trip will take about 45 minutes and
tours will depart hourly. Participants must be at least seven years
old. Visitors will be in a group of 15, led by a naturalist. For
reservations, phone (510) 562-2267.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, you will enter an abandoned silica sand mine,
passing the office of the old mine boss, various ore chutes, and
ancient geological features that were uncovered by the tunneling.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent of these features are wave erosion marks from
a long-buried, ancient seashore. On this trip, hard hats and
flashlights are provided. However, you must bring your own canary.
</P>
<P>
   Another great attraction is the Prospect Tunnel Loop, a do-it-
yourself trip. No reservations required, just the parking fee of
$3.50, charged only on weekends. This is a loop hike that takes a
few hours, featuring the Prospect Tunnel, a 400-foot hole bored by
the coal miners in the 1860s. About 200 feet of the tunnel is
accessible, where you must have your own flashlight, preferably one
with fresh batteries.
</P>
<P>
   There are also small cave-like holes, about a half dozen of them
accessible to the public, sprinkled about the park's 5,000 acres. A
map/brochure of the park indicates specific areas that can be
explored without guides, and it is available free by mail or phone
and also at the park.
</P>
<P>
   The Greathouse Visitor Center is named after R. Marvin
Greathouse, who was a pioneer silica sand miner. It's the only
visitor center at any park in Northern California that is
completely underground.
</P>
<P>
   It is located in a chamber that Greathouse dug out to extract
the silica sand, and, for being underground, the room is quite
spacious. Lighting is provided, of course, but the whole setting is
surreal.
</P>
<P>
   The park will be open on weekends, with the visitor center
operating from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   A map/brochure is available for free at the park entrance at the
end of Somersville Road, and also by phone at (510) 635-0135, ext.
2200, or by mail by writing Map/Brochure, East Bay Parks, 2950
Peralta Oaks Court, P.O. Box 5381, Oakland, CA 94605. The park can
be reached directly by phone (925) 757-2620.

<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ ``Parking Lot Full.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. This didn't make any sense. A heavy snow was
falling into a stiff wind. It was coming down sideways, in fact.
Out in the teeth of the storm, it was miserably uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, that hip-talking guy on the local TV channel had said
this morning that there was certain to be good powder skiing (BEGIN
ITALICS)tomorrow(END ITALICS). Around noon. He looked right into
the camera's eye and said that very thing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the guy should have winked.
</P>
<P>
   Because the parking lot at Aspen Highlands was indeed jammed
during that recent midweek blizzard. The vehicles were well-worn
and mud-encrusted: contractors' trucks, merchants' 4-by-4s with
back seats piled with stock, dented old Japanese stuff that could
belong only to waiters.
</P>
<P>
   Locals. All playing hooky from work _ with permission _ because
there was three inches of new powder on the ground and these
conditions simply wouldn't wait. The tourists would be tucked away
in their accommodations, huddled around fireplaces, waiting for a
break in the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The insiders knew: This was a great time to head out to a
lesser-known area like Highlands to revel in virgin snow on runs
that were sure to be all but deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen has a well-earned reputation for being the winter
playground of Hollywood glitterati and corporate elite _ people of
means who feel a getaway here confers on them some special stature.
Celebrity sightings are as common as wildlife reports at other ski
areas. (``Saw an elk crossing Stagecoach Road.'' ``Saw Goldie Hawn
having a glass of wine in the bar at the Snowmass Lodge and
Club.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Aspen is also an area of phenomenally good skiing. That's
how it transformed from a silver-mining ghost town into a premier
resort destination just after World War II. It features four very
different mountains, lined up like sentries deep in the Roaring
Fork Valley of central Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   And those who reside and work here _ in the upper-middle-class
homes of Snowmass Village or in the down-valley settlements of
Basalt and Glenwood Springs _ know her secrets: How to avoid the
crowds. How to seize the best skiing conditions. And, most
important of all, how to do so without suffering a raging
hemorrhage to your bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a subculture. Here is a 10-step guide to it:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Pristine conditions &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dream of every skier is to be the first one down the
mountain the morning after an overnight snowfall. Or, barring that,
to be the first one down a freshly groomed run.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen has a program called First Tracks, but it is not widely
publicized. Early each morning, just before the lifts open on Aspen
Mountain, six pre-registered skiers ride the gondola to the top
with two mountain ambassadors and one instructor. Then the group
skis _ under control _ down a run selected by the Ski Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   It's free. If your skiing ability is strong-intermediate or
better, all you have to do is sign up. But here's the catch. A
couple of weeks ago, the morning after a robust evening storm, a
ski concierge at the base of Aspen Mountain produced the
registration book from beneath her counter and flipped to the next
available opening. It was nine days away.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors who get wind of this program during their stay often
have to leave before they can avail themselves of it. Locals know
better.
</P>
<P>
   Signing up before you leave home is as simple as a phone call:
(970) 920-0755.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Off the beaten track &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aspen Mountain is a natural lure for tourists. That's where the
gondola is. That's where the Little Nell hotel has its ski-in,
ski-out side door. That's where, the locals have noticed with a
smirk, some celebs pose for pictures before slipping off to
Buttermilk Mountain to wobble down the beginner slopes.
</P>
<P>
   A less-congested alternative is Aspen Highlands, the next
mountain to the west. This ski area _ the one that was so popular
during that recent storm _ is utterly free of amenities and charm,
especially now as a massive construction project seeks to upgrade
its offerings. But if you pick your way through the heavy
equipment, the temporary trailers and the piles of building
material, you'll find skiing that will put your athleticism to a
severe test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to be more locals,'' said Newton Bartley, director of
Aspen Skiing Co.'s on-mountain ambassador program. ``Fantastic
skiing and great views. It's just a very unique experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The mountain also features competitive races (slalom, giant
slalom, downhill) every Saturday _ kind of a winter-sports
equivalent to your municipal basketball league. Locals dominate the
entry lists, but anyone can enter. Although this year's racing
season is winding down, schedules for next winter are available.
(Information: Scott Nichols, director of racing, 970-544-3005.)
</P>
<P>
   Aspen Mountain shouldn't be ruled entirely out of your plans,
however. Because of its break-your-neck runs, it tends to weed out
the faint of heart. And if you abhor snowboarders, this is the
place for you: They're forbidden on this hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they do that,'' said Tom Fisher, a second-grade
teacher in the Aspen schools who has lived here 25 years.
``Snowboards tend to leave a deeper groove, and it's difficult for
a snowboarder to keep a nice, narrow line, so it chews up the
powder.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a skier, I can't imagine a better place. There are all
sorts of nooks and crannies on this mountain.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
3. Black diamond in the rough &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buttermilk got its name in the previous century, either because
a logger liked to bring a pail of the stuff up the mountain with
his lunch or because the road was so rough it was believed capable
of turning milk to butter on the wagon ride down.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ``buh'' sound at the beginning of the word is a
phonetic match to bunny, and the mountain is considered the
exclusive domain of only the most terrified novices.
</P>
<P>
   Don't dismiss it entirely if you're an accomplished skier,
though, especially if you're looking for uncrowded terrain. Off the
east side of the mountain, in the area known as Tiehack, there are
advanced runs. Seven of them. And they are not heavily traveled.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the main lift, most everybody will go right,
seeking the gentle slopes of the green and blue runs. Go left. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
4. In tribute &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shrines have sprung up in recent years. No one has made a
big fuss over their establishment, or even taken credit for them.
In select glades on Aspen Mountain, fans of various bygone
entertainers simply have begun tacking up pictures, letters,
memorabilia, CDs.
</P>
<P>
   There are secluded mountain shrines honoring Elvis Presley, John
Denver, Jerry Garcia and Liberace. (Another site, honoring Marilyn
Monroe, was established a few years ago, but it since has vanished
without explanation.)
</P>
<P>
   No signs mark the way to these places of celebrity worship. Nor
are they marked on ski maps of the mountain. And, if specific
directions were given here, the Aspen locals would be livid.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're interested in stopping by one of them, just ask
around. One hint: Bell Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
5. Parking solution &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aspen officials would like nothing more than to see their free
shuttles be the sole mode of transportation here. That much is
evident in the fact that there is metered parking throughout the
town _ but a strict two-hour limit is maintained. Doesn't allow
much time for a ski outing.
</P>
<P>
   One exasperated visitor, encountered at the base of Aspen
Mountain, said he'd given up and just parked his car at the curb
for the day. The anticipated ticket, he grumbled, would be ``the
price for skiing at Aspen.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle, which services all four mountains, is
extraordinarily convenient, but if you simply must have your car
(perhaps to maintain a link with your Southern California roots),
here is a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   On a frontage road just east of the entrance to the airport
there is a kiosk, and if you have three or more people in your car,
they'll give you a free high-occupancy-vehicle pass. Hang it from
the rear-view mirror and you can park in any non-metered area in
town. All day. For no charge.
</P>
<P>
   (The revelation of that information here probably will cause
Aspen city fathers to weep.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
6. Inexpensive eats &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many Aspen residents, a simple code protects the wallet:
breakfast and lunch out, dinner in.
</P>
<P>
   There are two excellent, reasonably priced breakfast options in
town, both of which crawl with locals just before the lifts open at
9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Main Street Bakery and Cafe is so unpretentious, the proprietors
are likely to seat your small party at a big table _ then ask you
to share it with the next people in the door.
</P>
<P>
   The Wienerstube Restaurant has a sunny atrium interior that is
as inviting as its exterior is bland. If you get there before 8
a.m., you'll be rewarded with a $3 special that includes eggs, hash
browns and toast or pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   As for lunch during a day of skiing, it's probably wise to avoid
most of the dozen on-mountain restaurants that pepper the four ski
areas. The Aspen Skiing Co. systematically has been taking them
over as the leases of the private operators have come up for
renewal, and the already high prices _ for largely unexceptional
food _ are expected to soar even more.
</P>
<P>
   The Sundeck at the top of Aspen Mountain, for example, might be
a good place to recline in a deck chair, catch some rays and gaze
at Cathedral and Hayden peaks to the south, but don't get thirsty.
Even a pint of bottled water here will cost you $2.75.
</P>
<P>
   A better option is to pack a lunch and carry it to some
secluded, spectacular overlook on the mountain. Even the Aspen
Skiing Co. can't charge extra for these views _ unless you assume
they've been factored into the daily lift-ticket price of $63.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of lunch counters in town assemble tasty sandwiches to
go: In &AMP; Out House (not to be confused with the hamburger stand)
and Johnny McGuire's Deli.
</P>
<P>
   Most people on vacation, however, don't want to spend the early
evening bent over a condo stove. For dinner out that won't bust a
budget, try any of these delightful locals' haunts: The Mother Lode
(old miner's shack-type building, emphasis on pasta and seafood),
the Steak Pit, Skiers Chalet (more steak), La Cocina (a bustling
place; inexpensive Mexican food), Little Annie's, and Cooper Street
Bar &AMP; Restaurant (which is actually on Cooper Avenue).
</P>
<P>
   As for an after-ski adult beverage, skip Planet Hollywood and
savor instead the simplicity and rich history of the bar at the
Hotel Jerome. (If you call it the J-Bar, they'll think you're a
permanent resident.) &QL; 
SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. Bargain hunting &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Got the shopping bug? Uh oh, that's a perilous affliction in
this town.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a reasonable way to indulge it, though. Believe it or
not, there are two second-hand clothing stores in Aspen: Gracy's
and Susie's. At both, wealthy visitors drop off clothing for
consignment sale _ lest they suffer the appalling scandal of being
seen in the same garment more than twice.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find sweaters, ski suits, evening gowns, furs _ all at
about half of the retail price. Inherent risk: As you walk through
town, snobs might point at you and snicker when they recognize
their castoffs.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Gracy's, a full-length women's raccoon
coat, made by the Italian furrier Fendi, was priced at $2,000. A
non-designer full-length coat, lined with mink, was $1,500. A few
blocks away, at the Fendi store itself, the general price range for
furs was $13,000 to $45,000. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
8. Sunday drive &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful, pastoral country road this close to the condo
clusters and crowded village streets of a major ski area?
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Owl Creek Road generally is used only by residents
seeking a shortcut between Aspen and Snowmass Village. Probably
because it isn't paved. But if you don't mind a little mud, and if
you pretend you didn't read your rental-car agreement closely, it
is extremely rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   The road forks off Highway 82 just east of the airport and winds
through horse farms and snow-covered fields, offering a glimpse of
what this area looked like a half-century ago, before people
discovered the exhilaration of sliding down mountains on twin
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Stay alert for wildlife. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
9. Fitness alternative &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget the mechanical stair steps, or the treadmill, or whatever
other cardio equipment the spa at your Aspen lodgings offers.
</P>
<P>
   Many area residents prefer a workout that is just as vigorous
and infinitely more scenic. Rent a pair of snowshoes and walk up
the face of Buttermilk Mountain early in the morning, before the
lift opens. Maintain a measured pace, rest occasionally and carry
water, though: The base of that mountain is at about 8,000 feet,
the east summit (where three lifts converge) is at 9,720.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about beating up your knees on the descent. The lift
ride down is free for anyone who has climbed to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lady I know tried every health club in the world,'' said
Greg Long, a 22-year resident who operates a window-washing
business in Snowmass. ``She told me, `I didn't lose any weight
until I started walking up the mountain.' '' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
10. Moonlight madness &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This recreation option is included here only for a lark; it
might be foolhardy to avail yourself of it.
</P>
<P>
   But some locals delight in carefully tracking the cycles of the
moon, then sneaking down a run in the middle of the night when the
light is at its zenith. Often, a two-car shuttle (one at the base
of the mountain, the other at a ski-in, ski-out dwelling up the
slope) is employed.
</P>
<P>
   Given the deaths and mishaps that have occurred in broad
daylight at ski areas of late, it seems inconceivable that someone
would be drawn to anything like this, but rebellion and danger can
be intoxicating lures.
</P>
<P>
   With a chuckle, Long recalled one spring evening a few years
back when he and his wife were out walking their dogs on a Snowmass
ski run called Adams Avenue. (BEGIN ITALICS)Whoosh!(END ITALICS) A
plastic toboggan came flying down the hill, piloted by a group of
kids. The turns were being negotiated only through a mad scrambling
of arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have been going 60 mph,'' said Long. ``The run goes
over three bridges, and they got air on each one.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a suicidal stunt, but at least there was no danger
whatsoever of hitting a tourist. There wasn't a single one in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   This was purely insiders' frolic.

`SALARIED' WORKERS WANT THEIR OT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Rocky Mountain News) 
 
By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Ida Basha worked for MCI Telecommunications Corp.
in Sugar Land, Texas, she arranged for the placement of new phone
and Internet lines.
</P>
<P>
   It was mostly clerical work, she said recently, describing how
she'd print out orders and file the requests.
</P>
<P>
   However, MCI called her an engineer even though she did no
engineering work, didn't have an engineering degree or any
experience as an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Basha believes the company classified her and her colleagues as
engineers solely to avoid paying overtime. She said she often
worked 80 to 90 hours a week, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Federal labor law requires employers to pay workers not exempt
from the overtime law time and a half for every hour over 40 hours
worked in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Workers not legally entitled to overtime include outside sales
people; computer analysts, programmers and software engineers who
earn at least $27.63 an hour; professionals (with an advanced
degree such as doctors, lawyers and some engineers); executives
(such as first-line supervisors); and administrative workers
(that's the murkiest category but typically requires the employee
to make corporate policies and exercise discretion).
</P>
<P>
   But many employers misclassify their workers, telling them
they're ``salaried'' and not eligible for overtime pay, said Gregg
Rosenberg, a Houston employment lawyer who is representing Basha
and another former MCI employee.
</P>
<P>
   Some common jobs that are typically misclassified, according to
Shirley Gardner, district director of the Wage and Hour Division of
the U.S. Department of Labor in Houston, include inside sales
representatives, customer service representatives,
computer-assisted designers, assistant managers who work alongside
their subordinates in fast-food outlets and construction foremen
who swing hammers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SUIT GIVEN CLASS-ACTION STATUS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. recently gave Basha's
lawsuit preliminary class-action status for the 20 or so order
arrangers in the Houston-area city of Sugar Land, who work for a
division of a corporation now known as MCI WorldCom. Rosenberg
hopes to expand that class to include employees who do similar work
in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Basha, who earned $47,000 a year, figures she's got a chunk of
change coming.
</P>
<P>
   The work had to get done, said Basha, who recounted the pressure
she felt to fill those orders and the illnesses she suffered as a
result of the stress. Some days, she said, she'd stay until 11 p.m.
and would return by 4 a.m., but was refused overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   That workload didn't go unappreciated: Basha was named to the
company's Ring of Champions, the highest honor within network MCI
Services, which is reserved for the top 1 percent of the division.
She was sent to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in August along with dozens
of other winners.
</P>
<P>
   But a week after she was added to an overtime lawsuit, Basha
said she was fired for ``no longer meeting the MCI WorldCom
standard.'' She explained her termination as she showed off a big
commemorative trophy with her name etched in crystal along with
letters heralding her nominations for other performance-based
awards.
</P>
<P>
   An MCI WorldCom spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on
pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CASES EASIER TO PROVE IN COURT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suing companies for overtime pay is becoming increasingly
popular. That's because it's a lot easier to get a judge to certify
a class of employees on an overtime pay issue than on a race or
gender discrimination case, Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The way a company classifies its employees is typically a
corporate decision, he said, which makes it relatively easy to
prove the company sought to keep its employees from overtime
whether they're in Wisconsin or Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prove a race or sex discrimination class-action case
is much more difficult, especially when employees work for
different supervisors and in different locations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime cases also are easier to present. Many times a lawyer
can go to a judge and establish corporate liability for
misclassification without having to try the case before a jury,
said Jack Wisdom, an expert on overtime pay issues and lawyer for
Bracewell &AMP; Patterson in Houston. Lawyers fees are then tacked on
top of the back-wage awards, said Wisdom, who is not familiar with
the MCI case.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom said he tells his corporate clients if they're in doubt
whether a job is exempt, go ahead and pay the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The downside can be substantial, he said.
</P>

WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT SCHOOLS? TALK TO THE MIRROR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ He's a father. He lives in an Albany suburb. He
loves his kid, and he was upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is 9,'' he told me. ``On Dec. 11, they had a substitute
teacher in his fourth-grade class who threatened him. She said to
him, `If it wasn't against the rules, I would kill you.' She raised
her hand up to him, threatening to hit him, although she didn't
actually do that.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked the obvious question: ``What did your son do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the class wasn't completely in her control. She kept
them all in from going out for their recess break after lunch.
Apparently, they were talking ...
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked another child _ apparently he wasn't listening to
her the way she wanted him to _ if he was deaf. She told him he
should get a hearing aid. She told another kid that he was acting
like he was blind. She was making a lot of derogatory remarks like
that. But to my son, specifically, there was that threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The father called the school to complain. He wanted this
substitute kept out of the place forever. He was told that would
happen, but the father never got that pledge in writing, despite
his calls to the schools superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   So, he called in a complaint to the child abuse hotline. Then
the father swore out a criminal complaint against the substitute
teacher on a charge of harassment. The police, he said, promised to
issue the teacher an appearance ticket that would require her to
appear in court. He wanted me to know about this because he was
disturbed at how unconcerned everybody seemed to be over this
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Well, nobody wants teachers abusing kids. One of my kids came
home once with a story about being roughed up by a substitute
teacher. Rather than take my kid's word for it, I called a half
dozen other kids in the class to verify what had happened. Then I
raised hell with the school. Roughing up my kid, I insisted, was my
personal pleasure and nobody else's.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I invite you to take a walk down a high
school hallway sometime, especially if you haven't been inside a
high school for a while. You'll hear language that'll blister your
eardrums. It's bellowed out without regard for who might be around
_ like the pope, maybe. You'll see a student body that's largely
out of control and, essentially, has been ever since kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because parents no longer back the schools in imposing
discipline on their kids. Instead, parents who haven't taught their
kids how to behave seem more or less determined that anybody who
tries to hold their kids to any behavioral standard will find that
chore much more trouble than it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   So, we end up with cases like this one in the Albany suburb of
Rensselaer where a teacher with a decade in the district now faces
a misdemeanor charge of endangering the welfare of a child. Her
crime? Allegedly sticking a student with a pencil that didn't break
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   One PTA board member suggested that the parents might be
over-reacting. Really? No kidding? Now we have this complaint sworn
out by a loving suburban father who figures that any teacher who
speaks harshly to his kid for misbehaving must be a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to the substitute teacher. She's only a few years out of
college and badly shaken by this. She says that she and the kids
were just fooling around. She also mentioned that this particular
kid isn't exactly a model of scholarly decorum.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you want to know why the schools don't work any more _
why kids you see everywhere seem ruder, cruder and disturbingly
dopier _ just look in the mirror. And, while you're at it, stop
complaining about how much teachers get paid. How else could they
afford the legal fees?
</P>

HISTORY THROUGH THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It's been said that journalism is the first draft
of history. But there are priceless times when a piece of
journalism is so rich and enduring that it becomes history itself.
</P>
<P>
   Thucydides' ``History of the Peloponnesian War'' is journalism,
an account of a war by a participant and observer that's been a
classic for more than 2,000 years. It succeeds because it tells a
story and tells it well.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the journalism selected as the century's top work by
experts assembled by New York University will endure as long is
unknown. But the great list of books, articles, photographs and
broadcasts representing the top 100 of American journalism in the
20th century reminds us that for all the unpopularity and distrust
of journalists, this century has produced a trove of journalistic
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The list sparkles with the jewels that are discovered when an
issue or subject lends itself to the talent, passion and ambition
of the journalist. The works are a testament to the power of
journalism to educate, expose and expand the constituency of
concern for a particular issue.
</P>
<P>
   Few journalistic efforts accomplished this better than the one
that leads the list: John Hersey's ``Hiroshima,'' the story,
through the eyes of survivors, of the dropping of the first atomic
bomb on Japan. Hersey's masterful account is an example of how
journalism can be literature.
</P>
<P>
   Other choices on the list include books by Norman Mailer, Truman
Capote and Taylor Branch's ``Parting the Waters: America in the
King Years.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the artistic possibilities of journalism, at its
heart is the service of informing the public of problems and
injustices. Second on the list is Rachel Carson's book ``Silent
Spring,'' her warning of the danger of pesticides. Also in the Top
Ten are works by two of the original muckrakers: Ida Tarbell,
documenting the evils of Standard Oil, and Lincoln Steffens,
exposing corrupt city government.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of race, there's the elegant, almost detached
writings of W.E.B. DuBois and the searing and passionate prose of
James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   H.L. Mencken, with his pyrotechnic writing style, is on the
list, as is I.F. Stone, the greatest independent journalist of the
century; Murray Kempton, the standard for all newspaper columnists;
and A.J. Liebling, who wrote well about everything from war,
boxing, food and the press.
</P>
<P>
   Documentaries by Edward R. Murrow on Sen. Joseph McCarthy,
R-Wis., and the exploitation of migrant workers are reminders of
the heights broadcast journalism can reach.
</P>
<P>
   Herblock's cartoons on McCarthyism showcase the withering power
of ridicule, while the photograph of the Marines raising the flag
on Iwo Jima is more stirring than any writer's words.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the reporting on this list deals with historic events
or famous people. Much of it is about people on the margins of
society, obscure people living obscure lives that could just as
easily gone unchronicled, as such lives often are.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, journalism not only documents a century through
covering the big events and personalities but also by celebrating
and lamenting the lives of those people whose significance is
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   What this list of some of America's finest journalism of the
century says is that all around us there are stories waiting to be
told _ and told well.

BOOMERS DISCOVER A NEW MEDIUM: THE TELL-ALL BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CELINA OTTAWAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a page of literary history that starts in Molly
Friedrich's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   It was April 1995, and Friedrich's father had died three days
earlier. The New York City literary agent was wrought with grief
and totally uninterested in reading anything, much less a
single-spaced manuscript that had been pecked out on a typewriter
onto onionskin paper. Still, she had promised a friend she would
give it a look.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich read the first four pages. Then she put it down. This
was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that I got into the business and the reason I
stayed in the business had finally arrived,'' she said, recalling
the night.
</P>
<P>
   In her lap were the first 120 pages of Frank McCourt's
``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCourt's account of his impoverished boyhood in Ireland would
win a Pulitzer Prize and top best-seller lists for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   There's an endless supply of life stories out there, and a good
many of them land on Friedrich's desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of `I'm the Frank McCourt of Ethiopia,' or `I'm
the Frank McCourt of China,''' Friedrich said.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt's ``every man'' history (he was a retired high school
teacher before becoming a Pulitzer winner) unleashed a torrent of
lottery-like hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' may have unleashed the flood, but the
momentum was already building.
</P>
<P>
   Memoirs were once for presidents, retired generals, and Cher.
But in recent years, baby boomers have decided that their stories
are at least as interesting as those of politicians. The
first-person genre is perfectly suited to a generation that has
grown up talking about itself and expecting the world to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you marry a type of ego strength with a type of rebellion
like the '60s, you get a lot of talking,'' said Patricia Eisemann,
vice president and director of publicity for Scribner, the company
that published ``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a populist bent to the new memoir selection, one
that says that the everyday problems of divorce, poverty and crummy
childhoods deserve as much attention as the political battles in
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction shelves are filled with the stories of average
people. And now with the success of ``Angela's Ashes,'' there are
books filled with life stories, some sweet, some sorrowful, one
about a guy who loved to build rockets. Homer Hickam's ``The Rocket
Boys'' was recently made into the critically acclaimed movie
``October Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers and agents call it a glut. But thousands of writers
sitting at home with computers have hit on something else: Hey, we
have life stories, too.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt's success attracted publishers' attention to memoirs,
said Paul Gediman, editor of non-fiction forecasts for Publishers
Weekly. But life stories are still a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no formula to duplicate,'' Gediman said. ``Memoirs of
people that nobody's heard of are not a formula publishers can rely
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Write well enough and you can make the head of a pin sound
interesting. Otherwise it helps to be famous or have forbidden sex
(both are even better). But even the frontiers of sex have been
traversed and sometimes trampled in the rush to publish memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Harrison's ``The Kiss'' detailed her sexual affair with
her father and raised the shock bar for confessional memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how more bizarre we can get,'' said Eisemann, who
has spent 19 years promoting books for major publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a son could have an affair with his mother (a topic that
gave Sophocles enduring success) or perhaps something with the
family dog.
</P>
<P>
   But the themes are getting exhausted, Eisemann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right now, the next memoir that will sell will be a
person whose life was normal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Inspirational tales and stories with a sense of history are
catching publishers' attention, said Daniel Mandel, a literary
agent in New York City. Many of the interesting manuscripts that
hit his desk combine memoir with history.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being smarter and looking back in their family
members' lives,'' he said. ``Sometimes the best story that they
might be able to tell is family history and how they fit into it.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, March 9:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MARS (Undated) _ Mars is coming into much better focus, so
clear that scientists think they now see in the towering mountains,
layered canyon walls and meandering channels telling traces of the
planet's early history, when volcanoes belched gases into a denser,
warmer atmosphere and rivers flowed across the russet plains. Over
the last year, the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft looked down from
orbit and snapped hundreds of pictures of the landscape that are 20
to 40 times more detailed than anything obtained by previous
explorations, and those images are giving scientists a spectacular
new view of the geological processes that shaped the Martian
surface. By John Noble Wilford. (1375 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AGING (Los Angeles) _ Science is on the brink of being able
to stretch the human life span, perhaps dramatically, a recently
assembled group of academics said. Future generations, they said,
might be able to avail themselves of scientifically established
techniques to stretch the human lifespan like a piece of taffy
until it reached 150, even 200 years. By Gina Kolata. (2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COLD-FISH (Undated) _ In the frigid waters at the bottom of
the Antarctic Ocean, scientists have uncovered what appears to be
an evolutionary explosion that has generated an unexpectedly
impressive array of cold fish. New research suggests that primitive
species have given rise to a menagerie of cold-hardy descendants
that span the spectrum in size and shape, ranging from small,
schooling herring-like fish to 250 pound shark-like creatures. By
Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1375 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-REP-BROWN (Undated) _ Conversation with Rep. George E. Brown
Jr. of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on
Science and the former chairman of the House Committee on Science,
Space and Technology. He has been a crucial supporter of manned and
unmanned space exploration. In addition, he wrote legislation
creating an Environmental Protection Agency, was a prime mover
behind efforts to include ozone-layer protections in the Clean Air
Act and supported restructuring the national weapons laboratories
to the needs of a peacetime economy. By Claudia Dreifus. (1630
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Short items on science: dealing with the
way asteroids leap from a Mars obit to one near Earth, the tectonic
rift in Africa and a baby mouse that breathes mostly through its
skin. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TYING-TIES (Undated) _ Seeking a marriage of science and
beauty, Thomas M.A. Fink and Yong Mao, research fellows at
Cambridge University, have applied the rigors of mathematics to
that most basic of fashion statements, the necktie knot. In the
process they have come up with six new ways of tying a tie. By
Henry Fountain. (800 words)
</P>
<P>

<P>
   SCI-GLOBAL-WARMING (Undated) _ The Northern Hemisphere has been
warmer in the 20th century than in any other century of the last
thousand years, according to a reconstruction of the hemispheric
temperature record by scientists at the University of Massachusetts
and the University of Arizona. By William K. Stevens. (375 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BANDAGE (Undated) _ Blood loss through wounds claims tens of
thousands of lives each year, but researchers are working to change
that by developing a new type of bandage that clots blood
instantly. Scientists with the American Red Cross have teamed with
U.S. Army researchers to produce bandages and other dressings that
they say can seal a severe, bleeding wound in seconds with a tough,
artificial scab. After about eight years of research in the
laboratory and with animals, the researchers say the sealants are
about ready for human trials. By Warren E. Leary. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CATHARSIS (Undated) _ Though pop psychology books and
articles perpetuate the notion that ``getting your anger out'' is
cathartic and can help dissipate hostility, the researchers have
found just the opposite: Venting anger on inanimate objects _
punching a pillow or hitting a punching bag, for example _
increases rather than decreases aggressive behavior. By Erica
Goode. (625 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Ten
percent to 15 percent of breast cancers do not show up on a
mammogram, so women with any suspicious area in the breast should
be biopsied even when the mammogram is negative. Times health
columnist Jane E. Brody writes of her own recent experience among
that 10 to 15 percent and her lumpectomy. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FERTILITY-HERBS (Undated) _ Many women trying to become
pregnant are careful to avoid ingesting any substance that might in
any way impair their fertility or damage a developing embryo.
According to findings of a new study, several popular herbal
remedies should be added to the list of substances that could
interfere for men and women with conception and a healthy
pregnancy. By Jane E. Brody. (695 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _Wearing tight, form-fitting shorts, also known as compression
garments, increases an athlete's power output and endurance, two
key measures of athletic performance, by an average of 12 percent _
and by as much as 30 percent. Researchers said the form-fitting
fabric exerts pressure on muscles, and that increases blood flow
and helps flush away lactic acid and other fatigue causing waste
products quickly and efficiently. It also reduces muscle vibration,
another principle cause of muscle fatigue. (350 words)
</P>
<P>
   _Should patients be allowed to sue their health maintenance
organizations? (350 words)
</P>
<P>
   _Many children as young as 10 years old want to know more about
sex than just where babies come from, but parents often shy away
from discussing sexuality, finds a national survey conducted by the
Kaiser Family Foundation and Children Now, a children's advocacy
group. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-CAPOEIRA (Undated) _ Learning to perform capoeira, a
martial art created by Africans taken as slaves to Brazil. It
involves an unusual method of self-defense. A few moves, like
spinning on one's head seemed straight out of break dancing; others
seemed worthy of an Olympic gymnastics competition. By Eric V.
Copage. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.

<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: Can a person
live without a stomach?

<HEADLINE>
STUDENTS IN KENYA ARE FULL OF ENTHUSIASM BUT SHORT ON BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Sorting out the impressions of a two-week trip
through rural Kenya will take time.
</P>
<P>
   The assimilation of a multitude of sensations and feelings of
the ranging countryside, the bountiful variety of wildlife, the
people, and, most elusively, the culture that embraces and
rationalizes them, requires time.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing from among the vivid experiences, the initial high
point is not the dramatic: Being within spitting distance of a
pride of lions ingesting their morning feast of hartebeest, or a
herd of elephants or giraffes almost within hand's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it be the transcendence of caravaning over the
undulating savanna stretching as far as the eye can see, here and
there studded by the umbrella-like formations of acacia trees, or
the varieties of shrubbery that also provide food and shelter for
the gazelles and cape buffalo and the other plant-eating beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it be of the Kenyan people, united in what aspires to
be a modern nation-state which is based on an amalgamation of some
42 tribes, each speaking its own language, each invested in its own
history and customs.
</P>
<P>
   All of these impressions were extraordinary and are sure to
remain to be savored in memory for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their vividness, the experience that stands out from
the rest is a visit to a government primary school in the city of
Njoro, northwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   We were taken there _ a group of 30 Canadian and American
visitors _ by officials associated with Egerton University, where
we had spent most of the day hearing presentations on the status of
women in Kenya and on the land use policies that defined the Kenyan
economy and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to the school rounded out the day. Kenyans, it needs
to be noted, are devoted to the idea of education, and as you
travel the rough roads, you come across school after school or to
road signs pointing the way to them. Sometimes kids in their
uniforms are glimpsed. As in most countries, those who have means
fare better, the wealthiest best of all. Some send their kids to
England for schooling or keep them at home attending the very best
of prep schools.
</P>
<P>
   But for the vast majority of people there are only the
government schools, and they are a different story altogether,
judging from what we saw and what we were told. The school property
comprised a fairly large area, with perhaps five or six
considerably sized stone buildings.
</P>
<P>
   These were set on a dusty and mostly unkempt ground and housed
one class of perhaps 30 to 40 kids and one teacher. Inside, the
classroom buildings were dark. There was a blackboard with the
lesson for the day written out in elegant cursive script. (Our
Kenyan lecturers without exception wrote a legible hand that any
American could justly envy.)
</P>
<P>
   As visitors had been expected, preparations had been made. In
one classroom, the kids sang a couple of welcoming songs that they
had obviously practiced with success. They were a pleasure to hear.
All the kids were attired in that school's particular uniform,
consisting of a yellow shirt or blouse, and dark blue jumpers or
shorts. Many wore no shoes.
</P>
<P>
   As a small number of us were making our way from one classroom
to another, kids hanging out of a window (all without glass panes)
implored us to visit them. When we got into the room, the teacher
had just left to attend to one child's particular problem. The kids
swarmed around us, perhaps 6 or 7 years old, avidly reaching out to
shake hands, demonstrating their eagerness and their friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   Vitality exuded from them and infected a visitor with optimism
for the future. Yet their reality was harsh. The classroom was
without artificial light. Few kids actually had a desk top to sit
at. The furniture hardly deserved the name, being less than basic.
The dirt floor of the classroom was littered with debris.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, the kids had no implements of learning. They
shared well-worn sheafs of paper that served them collectively as a
text. They had no paper upon which to write and no pencils or pens
to do it with. They had no books. Their teachers were high school
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   What they had amply was enthusiasm and an all-too-obvious
personal niceness. They also were tough by our standards, walking
miles by themselves to and from school, and sticking with it
although there was so little for them in that school. It was the
gap between the possibility that those kids personified and the
reality that faced them that brought home the poignancy of the
enormous hurdle that Kenyans have to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   In this they have not been well served by governments notorious
for the inventiveness of their corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that Kenya has been independent for only three
decades or so and one must not judge it by inappropriate or
impossibly high standards, which is fair enough. The capital of
Nairobi outwardly looks like a metropolitan city, although a little
ramshackle upon close examination.
</P>
<P>
   Surely if the capacity exists to build expensive condo
developments and towering office buildings, the culture should be
capable of supplying its public schools with pencils, books and
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's hope for a better future resides in its avid young
people. If they are not prepared for that challenge, who else will
there be to meet it?

   (NYT8) HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- March 8, 1999 -- OBIT-DIMAGGIO-8,
03-08 -- Joe DiMaggio during an interview with the Times in Sept.
1998. In his 13 seasons as a Hall of Fame center fielder from 1936
to 1951 (with three years out for Army service during World War
II), he had a career average of .325 with 361 home runs and 1,537
runs batted in while the Yankees won 10 American League pennants
and 9 World Series. ``Joltin' Joe'' DiMaggio died Monday morning at
his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was 84. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York

teammate for a decade, presented DiMaggio with a gift from George

GLIDER PILOTS WERE THE SILENT HEROES OF WORLD WAR II 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM BOWER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ They flew clunky-looking, blunt-nosed aircraft and
took part in some of the biggest battles of World War II. They wore
silver wings with a ``G'' in the middle that designated them as
glider pilots.
</P>
<P>
   But among the men who flew the engineless planes, the ``G''
stood for something else: Guts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were there, then you know it's true,'' said Ray Welty,
commander of the Texas wing of the National World War II Glider
Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   While gliders played a pivotal role in defeating the Germans on
the western front, their contribution and the men who flew them are
often overlooked by modern filmmakers and historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glider pilots were kind of looked down on, and I got kind
of teed off that we were ignored,'' said retired Air Force Lt. Col.
Arn Granheim, who now lives in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, one of the most-used American gliders was the
CG-4A, with a wingspan of 83 feet and a capacity to carry 13
soldiers or one jeep or one howitzer. It was towed to invasion
targets by a twin-engine C-47 transport.
</P>
<P>
   Over the target, the glider pilot would release the tow rope and
glide to a landing in a field, where the troops or cargo would be
unloaded. In Operation Market Garden on Sept. 17-19, 1944, during
the Allied invasion of Holland, more than 2,500 gliders were used
to ferry in troops and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, during Operation Varsity on March 24, 1945,
more than 17,000 glider infantry troops and paratroopers were
landed east of the Rhine River near Wesel, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Market Garden was the largest wartime use of gliders,
while Operation Varsity was the largest single-day airborne mission
in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That train of aircraft took 2-and-1/2 hours to pass by,''
Granheim said of Operation Varsity. It was Granheim's only glider
mission of the war. The rest of the time, he piloted C-47s,
ferrying in supplies and personnel to the continent from England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Operation Varsity was going to be a `milk run,''' he
said. ``That's the only time I volunteered (for that duty).''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that the mission was anything but routine, Granheim
said the cargo in his CG-4A was just a jeep's trailer with a canvas
tarp over it, along with three soldiers from the 17th Airborne
Division. After a successful landing in a field, Granheim said he
pulled back the tarp to discover he had been carrying nearly a ton
of C-2 plastic explosive.
</P>
<P>
   The only other glider carrying the same payload was hit by
anti-aircraft fire on landing approach and ``disintegrated in the
air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During D-Day, June 6, 1944, Lt. Col. Mike Murphy was flying the
lead glider with Brig. Gen. Donald F. Pratt, the general's aides
and a jeep loaded with communications equipment and fuel. Murphy
didn't know at the time that armor plating had been installed on
the aircraft to protect the general, making it too heavy. Upon
landing, the glider crashed. Murphy survived, but not Pratt, making
him the highest ranking Allied casualty of D-Day. The incident,
with a few details changed, was included in the Stephen Spielberg
film ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the bone-headed things that happened,'' Granheim
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Welty, who participated in five major airborne invasions, said
his most frightening experience came during Market Garden, when his
glider was among 13 that landed behind German lines about 11 miles
east of Groesbeek, Holland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't blame the navigator because it was overcast and we had
low clouds,'' he said, explaining the gliders apparently landed
unnoticed by the Germans in the middle of the second day of the
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, which numbered more than 100, eventually made its way
through enemy territory to return to its original destination.

   TIMERMAN-WRITING (Punta Del Este, Uruguay) _ After Argentina's
junta freed him in 1979, Jacobo Timerman's testament of prison
life, torture and anti-Semitism stirred comparisons to Dostoyevsky,
Camus and Hannah Arendt. ``Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a
Number'' brought Timerman lasting fame and fortune. Since the death
of his wife, Risha, eight years ago, however, Timerman has been
virtually silent. At 76 he speaks of depression, drinking and the
constant pain in his legs. But finally the haze seems to be
lifting, Timerman said in an interview, and he is finding his
writing powers again. By Clifford Krauss.

KUBRICK: THE RECLUSIVE MOVIEMAKING GENIUS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Adds 3 grafs at end with quotes from Kubrick's 1997 speech to
Directors Guild of America. Also corrects date of Playboy magazine
interview.)  By IVOR DAVIS 
 World rights 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If Stanley Kubrick had never been born, a masochistic Hollywood
would have had to invent him: A remote and godlike figure with a
formidable intellect and a cold heart, who every 10 years or so
made a movie his way just to show up the dummies in Los Angeles for
the money-grabbing, yes men he thought they were.
 &HT;    Kubrick died Sunday at the age of 70 in his home outside London
leaving a $100-million legacy_his latest film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
a psychological thriller starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman
which is due to open in July, two years later than expected.
 &HT;    Steven Spielberg called him ``The grand master of filmmaking. He
copied no one while we scrambled to catch up with him.''
 &HT;    The eccentric director of such unforgettable films as ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (l964), ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (l968) and ``A
Clockwork Orange'' (l971), made movies his way. It is ironic that
producers of the Oscars are now scrambling to do a segment for the
awards ceremony, which airs March 21, while in his lifetime Kubrick
paid scant attention to Hollywood.
 &HT;    In l997, all of film town turned out to honor Kubrick with the
D.W. Griffith Award from the Directors Guild of America, putting
him in the company of Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock and Akira
Kurosawa. That night Kubrick was 6,000 miles away in England. He
sent them a taped thank you.
 &HT;    He hasn't set foot in his native United States since 1968. He
lived with his third wife, German artist Christiane, in
Childwickbury Manor, Hertfordshire. One reason he kept his distance
from Hollywood is his refusal to fly. He was most comfortable on a
bicycle. Despite having been nominated for an Oscar countless times
he never won the statuette and seemed happiest when he was furthest
from other filmmakers.
 &HT;    His life was a bundle of contradictions: A man in love with
technology and the future who was not even a comfortable passenger
in an automobile; a licensed pilot who wouldn't step into an
airplane; a Jew married to a woman who as a child was a member of a
Hitler youth group.
 &HT;    In an interview with Playboy magazine in 1968 he attributed his
fear of flying and his other phobias to his growing sense of the
fragility of life and his own mortality, an obsession which he
shared with that other great though very different auteur
filmmaker, Woody Allen.
 &HT;    ``This shattering recognition of our own mortality,'' he told
the magazine, ``is at the root of far more mental illness than I
suspect even psychiatrists are aware.''
 &HT;    Despite the fact that his work was often dark, pessimistic, even
misanthropic, his films were wildly anticipated by film buffs and
seldom disappointing. His last released film was ``Full Metal
Jacket'' (1987).
 &HT;    His ``Eyes Wide Shut'' was supposed to be shot in a year. But
Kubrick shot the film for over two years_calling the stars back to
England for countless new scenes. He ordered his stars to say only
that the picture was about sexual obsession and jealousy.
 &HT;    ``Mr. Kubrick has written that line down for us,'' Kidman said,
``and that's all we are allowed to say. If I say anything else I'll
get in trouble.''
 &HT;    The rumor mill of course has been working overtime. Is the story
really about Cruise and Kidman themselves? Does Cruise, the darling
of the American box office, actually appear in one scene in a
dress?
 &HT;    But the question that interested Kubrick fans worldwide was why
it took so long for him to work again. The answer was as simple as
bad luck_and maybe even worse timing.
 &HT;    Kubrick planned to come back to the screen early in the '90s
with a pet project, his take on the Nazi era and the German sweep
across Europe. He was well into the planning phase of shooting his
epic in Denmark when Steven Spielberg's ``Schindler's List'' came
along, and Kubrick dropped his project like a hot blini.
 &HT;    It was a question of ``once bitten.'' In 1986 Oliver Stone's
Vietnam film ``Platoon'' picked up seven Oscars and took the shine
off Kubrick's ``Full Metal Jacket'' which came out a year later.
Though many critics thought ``Jacket'' the more profound of the two
films, the public response was disappointing.
 &HT;    Such perhaps were the penalties of working so far from the
mainstream. A biographer, New York-based film teacher Vincent
Lobrutto, admitted he never got to meet Kubrick: ``I wrote to him
but he never responded. I've always appreciated that he didn't make
it difficult for me to talk to other people about him.''
 &HT;    Lobrutto has great admiration for Kubrick. ``He is arguably one
of the greatest film directors ever,'' he says. ``What he does is
create his own world. People don't understand him as a person.
There's a lot of The Bronx in him. All the myths and rumors spread
on the Internet about how remote he is, how he doesn't communicate
with the outside world, I found it to be the opposite. He does
contact people but only in connection with his films. His entire
life is funneled into his films.''
 &HT;    The cast in ``Full Metal Jacket'' was taken to an abandoned
factory on the edge of London, had their heads shaved and were
drilled and humiliated for weeks in best Marine style before they
even began rehearsals.
 &HT;    Top actors still want to work with Kubrick for the chance to be
part of cinema history. Cruise said recently of ``Eyes Wide Shut'':
``It's just a damned miracle that he wanted me and Nic to do
this.''
 &HT;    Kubrick was an original offscreen as well as on. His defiance of
the conventional and the bureaucratic was consistent. Former Marine
drill instructor Lee Ermy, who starred in ``Full Metal Jacket,''
tells of how he learned his lines as he was pelted with tennis
balls and oranges by a Kubrick aide to improve his concentration.
 &HT;    Ermy also remembers scouting locations with Kubrick in a new
$50,000 Mercedes. ``Stanley spotted a place. He got so excited he
turned the car over in a ditch with us all trapped inside. Totally
ignoring us, he clambered out yelling, 'Mark that spot. That's the
one I want.'''
 &HT;    In Kubrick's world one played by the maestro's rules, which
meant long, long hours of rehearsal, all of it videotaped, followed
by more long hours of discussion over what the tape reveals.
 &HT;    ``When people say, 'Oh Stanley is so controlling, he doesn't
allow anything, he makes all the decisions.' It's not so,'' Kidman
says. ``He's actually quite open. He creates an environment where
obviously it's the director and his vision. But he wants to hear
your ideas. He's so very into improvisation and working together.
He listens and then obviously, he makes the decisions and guides
you.''
 &HT;    In the video of his acceptance speech for the D.W. Griffith
Award, Kubrick said: ``Anyone who has ever been privileged to
direct a film also knows that although it can be like trying to
write 'War and Peace' in a bumper car at an amusement park, when
you finally get it right, there are not many joys in life that can
equal that feeling...
 &HT;    ``Griffith was always ready to take risks, to fly too high. And
in the end, the wings of fortune proved for him, like those of
Icarus, to be made of nothing more substantial than wax and
feathers. And like Icarus, when he flew too close to the sun, they
melted...
 &HT;    ``I've compared Griffith's career to the Icarus myth, but at the
same time I've never been certain whether the moral of the Icarus
story should be, 'Don't try to to fly too high,' or whether it
might also be thought of as, 'Forget the wax and feathers and do a
better job on the wings.'''

REPORT: BOYS AND GIRLS DO SAME AMOUNT OF CHORES

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ American boys and girls do the same number but
not the same kind of chores, according to a survey in the
March/April is sue of Zillions, the excellent magazine for kids
from Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey of 1,000 children, gender roles continue
to apply in the assigning of tasks. Boys mowed lawns and took out
the trash more, while girls dominated in caring for younger
siblings, meal preparation and housecleaning. All children surveyed
did at least one chore weekly, and more than half performed five or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Room-cleaning was most common, followed by pet care; least
common were laundry and dusting. Finally, fewer than half received
payment; chore-related allowances averaged, for both boys and
girls, $5 to $6.
</P>
<P>
   Find the $2.95 Zillions on newsstands, or order a bimonthly
annual subscription, for $16, by calling (800) 234-2078.
</P>
<P>
   WINE WORRIES:
</P>
<P>
   Oenophiles should read no further. The news contained herein may
be dismaying in the extreme. First was a report this week in The
New York Times that some sommeliers who need to warm a cellared red
wine up to room temperature rapidly have resorted to zapping it in
a microwave oven. Good heavens.
</P>
<P>
   And then we find, in Chef's, a cook's catalog, a thing called
the Vintage Enhancer. The device employs a ``patented
electromagnetic process'' to change the pH level of the vino. A
mere half-hour's use will make a wine taste as if it has been aged
for years, says the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The mind curdles, as might, we suspect, the wine. Why would
anyone spend $60 for the Vintage Enhancer and risk ruining a $50,
long-living cabernet when a perfectly tasty bottle, drinkable right
now, is available for $7.99? We can't imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Order the product by calling Chef's at (800) 338-3232.
</P>
<P>
   EXPENSIVE TOY:
</P>
<P>
   A company called BSG Labs has released the Intensor LX, an
updated version of its ``sensory gaming chair,'' which is basically
a loudspeaker that you wear while playing a videogame. The chair
transmits soundwaves and tactile sensations directly to the user's
body.
</P>
<P>
   The new model has extra features, such as a locking connector to
keep the chair from coming unplugged, which gives you an idea of
how vigorously some people play their computer games.
</P>
<P>
   The Intensor LX works with all videogame platforms, such as the
Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64, as well as PC-based games. You
can even plug it into your stereo, should you feel the need to be
thumped directly in the kidneys by a hip-hop record or caressed by
'N Sync's coos.
</P>
<P>
   The chair costs $199, the base an extra $99; for real boom, add
the $169 subwoofer. Order any or all by visiting the Web site,

NOT THE GREATEST, BUT THE GRANDEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nobody ever said that Joe DiMaggio was the
greatest player in baseball history. That honorific might go for
differing reasons to Honus Wagner, or Ty Cobb, or Babe Ruth, or
Jackie Robinson, or Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio would make anyone's top 10 with ease, and probably even
top five, but not the best.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's command of our attention for fully six decades was
due to something else. He was the shining example of that rarest
kind of athlete, in his prime and now at the day of his death _ a
man who evoked words like ``elegant,'' ``stylish,'' and ``regal.''
</P>
<P>
   Most athletes owe their hold on us to the frenetic power of
their body or will. Even Michael Jordan, the athlete of our age,
could be all those things we ascribe to DiMaggio off the court, but
on it, Jordan is an animated, viscerally engaged, even domineering
presence. He yanks you to him forcefully, whether you resist or
not.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's gift, as described by his contemporaries of the '30s
and '40s and reiterated now at his passing, was that he subtly
gained your attention and held it merely with his presence rather
than his visible energy.
</P>
<P>
   When those who saw him play say with complete seriousness, ``He
made every play look easy,'' they are using what is surely a
falsehood to explain a greater truth. His control of his gifts
allowed him to seem omniscient as well as omnipotent. He somehow
knew where the ball would be before it got there, and what he
needed to do to get there.
</P>
<P>
   More unusual, his off-stage presence only supported what he
showed on the field. He placed enormous personal stock in that
elegance, that style, that sense of royal prerogative. He was off
the field what he was on it, a perfect symbiont in a field that
normally demands a dual personality.
</P>
<P>
   He will be remembered mostly as a son of New York, the
definitive Yankee, and as definitions go, that can work. But he
came from here, and he had that sense of self long before he went
east.
</P>
<P>
   He may not have been a pure fit for the San Francisco of his
day, but he surely was an exact match for what San Franciscans have
always thought of themselves _ again, elegant, stylish and slightly
aloof from the maddening rush of New York or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If he could only have been himself as a Yankee, we hold just as
fervently that he could only have developed this way as a San
Franciscan.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the way with cultural icons. We can reinvent them to
meet our own needs and prejudices. There are so few of those (maybe
Ruth and Robinson in baseball, Jordan in basketball, Billie Jean
King in tennis, Arnold Palmer in golf) that when one passes, it is
a matter for all of society to stop and remember.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's image, though, seems more a statement about his own
time, out of place with the frenetic, chest-thumping, sound-biting
age of ours.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth lived the contemporary star's life, Robinson the
contemporary's easy-to-feel heat, King the social crusader's
passion and stridency, Palmer the star-turned-conglomerate's
single-mindedness _ and all have modern equivalents, many of them
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, no DiMaggio clone out there now for the
terminally young among us to use as a reference point. He left us
no single compelling oration, no signature gesture, no single
moment to define his career or life. Those who say ``marrying
Marilyn Monroe'' forget that at the time he was the more famous
figure.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio leaves behind something harder to accurately define but
easier to feel _ that all-enveloping aura called ``presence.'' His
friends felt it precisely the same way his teammates did, and both
sets seemed genuinely overwhelmed by it.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to do anything to win their admiration and
respectful distance. He just had to be Joe DiMaggio, and he was
that in every sense. He defined himself, rather than be defined by
others, and he never strayed from that basic structure.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is gone, and although nobody should ever say, ``We shall
never see his like again,'' we can say that since he began his
career, we haven't. In 60-plus years, there hasn't been another
DiMaggio, and it could easily take another 60-plus years to see
another of his equal.

   Contrary to popular belief, ``letting off steam'' by watching a
violent movie or hitting a punching bag may not release aggression.
In fact, it may add fuel to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In a study led by Dr. Brad Bushman, an associate professor of
psychology at Iowa State University in Ames, students who read an
article stating that catharsis was a healthy way to relieve anger
and were then presented with the opportunity to exercise cathartic
measures actually became more aggressive. They expressed increased
aggression toward both the people who had angered them and toward
``innocent bystanders.'' Bushman's report appears in the latest
issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Catharsis theory holds that repressing anger is unhealthy, and
encourages people to redirect hostility by beating up pillows or
punching bags.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred college students were presented with messages
constructed to look like newspaper articles either supporting or
debunking catharsis theory. They were then given insulting
critiques, designed to anger them, of essays they had written.
Finally, the researchers asked them to rank their preference of a
list of activities. Angry students who were exposed to a
pro-catharsis message showed the highest desire to hit the punching
bag.
</P>
<P>
   In a related study of 700 students, similarly angered students
were asked to spend two minutes either hitting a punching bag or
just sitting alone quietly. Subjects then engaged in a computer
game that would allow them to ``punish'' their opponents with
blasts of noise of a volume and duration of their choosing.
Students assigned to hitting the punching bag chose to blast longer
and louder, regardless of whether they were told their unseen
opponent was the person who had criticized them or a third
unrelated person.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to hit the punching bag. They reported feeling
better after hitting the punching bag, but this did not translate
to less aggression _ it reinforced it,'' Bushman commented.
Particularly interesting was the tendency to lash out at
``innocent'' victims, he said. ``It's like they don't discriminate
between a punching bag and a person,'' Bushman said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the counterfeit newspaper article's influence on behavior
in a clinical setting, Bushman expressed concern over pro-catharsis
attitudes in culture and in the media that might justify losing
self-control. Terms like ``get it off your chest'' and ``let off
steam'' promote the violent release of aggression, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bushman suggested that mass media and pop psychologists endorse
the views that expressing anger is healthy and repressing it is
unhealthy. For example, in a trailer for the movie ``Analyze
This,'' therapist Billy Crystal tells a client that when he gets
upset he hits a pillow. After shooting the pillow with a gun, his
client agrees, ``I feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Redford Williams, director of behavioral medicine at the
Research Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C., also cited
studies that linked television to violence by viewers. For
already-hostile people, he said, catharsis may be a particularly
dangerous message.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who report more levels of anger at age 25 are four to
seven times as likely to be dead by age 50,'' Williams said. He
added that hostility could bring blood pressure up even more.
</P>
<P>
   Bushman offered alternative methods for dealing with anger,
including finding a distraction, such as working on a puzzle or
taking a walk, counting to 10 or higher and taking deep breaths.
``If you're angry, you're better off doing nothing,'' Bushman
advised.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists agreed that there are better ways of handling
anger than catharsis. ``A lot of people walk around confused about
what they're feeling,'' said Dr. Eleanor Cole, a licensed
psychologist in private practice in Hoboken, N. J. ``But if you're
going to deal with it by hitting a punching bag, you don't get to
the root of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams suggests people evaluate their anger and decide whether
to take action. ``Ask yourself, is the situation important to me?
Is my anger appropriate to the facts of the situation? Is the
situation modifiable? Would it be worth it to take action? If the
answers are all yes, act assertively, not aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson had his own advice: When angry, count to 10,
when very angry, count to 100.

   SCI-MARS (Undated) _ Mars is coming into much better focus, so
clear that scientists think they now see in the towering mountains,
layered canyon walls and meandering channels telling traces of the
planet's early history, when volcanoes belched gases into a denser,
warmer atmosphere and rivers flowed across the russet plains. Over
the last year, the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft looked down from
orbit and snapped hundreds of pictures of the landscape that are 20
to 40 times more detailed than anything obtained by previous
explorations, and those images are giving scientists a spectacular
new view of the geological processes that shaped the Martian
surface. By John Noble Wilford. (1375 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AGING (Los Angeles) _ Science is on the brink of being able
to stretch the human life span, perhaps dramatically, a recently
assembled group of academics said. Future generations, they said,
might be able to avail themselves of scientifically established
techniques to stretch the human lifespan like a piece of taffy
until it reached 150, even 200 years. By Gina Kolata. (2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COLD-FISH (Undated) _ In the frigid waters at the bottom of
the Antarctic Ocean, scientists have uncovered what appears to be
an evolutionary explosion that has generated an unexpectedly
impressive array of cold fish. New research suggests that primitive
species have given rise to a menagerie of cold-hardy descendants
that span the spectrum in size and shape, ranging from small,
schooling herring-like fish to 250 pound shark-like creatures. By
Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1375 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-REP-BROWN (Undated) _ Conversation with Rep. George E. Brown
Jr. of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on
Science and the former chairman of the House Committee on Science,
Space and Technology. He has been a crucial supporter of manned and
unmanned space exploration. In addition, he wrote legislation
creating an Environmental Protection Agency, was a prime mover
behind efforts to include ozone-layer protections in the Clean Air
Act and supported restructuring the national weapons laboratories
to the needs of a peacetime economy. By Claudia Dreifus. (1630

thousand years, according to a reconstruction of the hemispheric
temperature record by scientists at the University of Massachusetts
and the University of Arizona. By William K. Stevens. (375 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BANDAGE (Undated) _ Blood loss through wounds claims tens of
thousands of lives each year, but researchers are working to change
that by developing a new type of bandage that clots blood
instantly. Scientists with the American Red Cross have teamed with
U.S. Army researchers to produce bandages and other dressings that
they say can seal a severe, bleeding wound in seconds with a tough,
artificial scab. After about eight years of research in the
laboratory and with animals, the researchers say the sealants are
about ready for human trials. By Warren E. Leary. (1350 words)

<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CATHARSIS (Undated) _ Though pop psychology books and
articles perpetuate the notion that ``getting your anger out'' is
cathartic and can help dissipate hostility, the researchers have
found just the opposite: Venting anger on inanimate objects _
punching a pillow or hitting a punching bag, for example _
increases rather than decreases aggressive behavior. By Erica
Goode. (625 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Ten
percent to 15 percent of breast cancers do not show up on a
mammogram, so women with any suspicious area in the breast should
be biopsied even when the mammogram is negative. Times health
columnist Jane E. Brody writes of her own recent experience among
that 10 to 15 percent and her lumpectomy. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FERTILITY-HERBS (Undated) _ Many women trying to become
pregnant are careful to avoid ingesting any substance that might in
any way impair their fertility or damage a developing embryo.
According to findings of a new study, several popular herbal
remedies should be added to the list of substances that could
interfere for men and women with conception and a healthy
pregnancy. By Jane E. Brody. (695 words)

   _Wearing tight, form-fitting shorts, also known as compression
garments, increases an athlete's power output and endurance, two
key measures of athletic performance, by an average of 12 percent _
and by as much as 30 percent. Researchers said the form-fitting
fabric exerts pressure on muscles, and that increases blood flow
and helps flush away lactic acid and other fatigue causing waste
products quickly and efficiently. It also reduces muscle vibration,
another principle cause of muscle fatigue. (350 words)

   TIMERMAN-WRITING (Punta Del Este, Uruguay) _ After Argentina's
junta freed him in 1979, Jacobo Timerman's testament of prison
life, torture and anti-Semitism stirred comparisons to Dostoyevsky,
Camus and Hannah Arendt. ``Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a
Number'' brought Timerman lasting fame and fortune. Since the death
of his wife, Risha, eight years ago, however, Timerman has been

 &HT;    SCIENTISTS WARN Y2K BUG THREATENS NUCLEAR SECURITY
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Russia should respond to the
risk of a false missile attack warning triggered by the Year 2000
computer bug by placing their nuclear arsenals on lower alert, a
group of legislators and scientists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In anticipation of a Jan. 1 electronic 'El Nino,' we shouldn't
take the risk of nuclear weapons or nuclear power plants going
awry,'' Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., told a day-long nuclear
security conference on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Markey called on President Clinton to quickly cut a deal with
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia aimed at reducing the chances of
accidental launches. A letter that Markey and Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, sent Clinton last week warned that ``the Russian military
clearly lacks the resources to correct the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The glitch occurs when computer hardware or software programs
that use two digits to mark a year misread the year 2000, and
either fail or spew out bad data.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear experts who spoke at the session noted that the
``millennium bug'' could neither cause a spontaneous missile launch
nor cause a warhead to explode in its silo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Russian early warning network is particularly
susceptible to the Y2K problem,'' said Bruce Blair of the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center. Blair, the author of a
recent book entitled ``The Nuclear Hair Trigger: Dangers and
Solutions,'' said ``the only real cure is to take the weapons off
high alert.''
</P>
<P>
   In talks with Russian defense officials in Moscow last month,
the Pentagon proposed that before the end of the year the former
Cold War rivals set up a joint missile-warning center aimed at
minimizing the chances of a false alert.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Kraig, a nuclear policy expert, told the session
that the Russians have dragged their feet on the U.S. initiative
because they lack the funds to move forward and because they fear
that such an exchange would expose the decline in readiness that
has occurred since Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   The new U.S. proposal would implement an accord signed last
September by Clinton and Yeltsin. That deals calls on both sides to
share data on the missile launches and payloads.
</P>
<P>
   According to Markey, a top Russian missile official, Vladimir
Dvorkin, has told the U.S. negotiators that it would take about $4
million in outside aid to upgrade his nation's early-warning
systems so they are Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the many billions of dollars we've spent over the
years to ward off the threat a of Soviet missile attack, it seems
to be a prudent investment,'' Markey said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States relies on a highly sophisticated system of
radars and satellites to monitor Russian nuclear activity on a
``real time'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides reduced have their arsenals over the years, the
Pentagon estimates that Russia's current total nuclear firepower
amounts to the equivalent of 100,000 atomic bombs of the type
dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in August 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Pentagon continues to maintain large parts of
the remaining U.S. nuclear force in a high state of readiness,
including Trident submarines stationed in the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans.

DRUGGISTS REPORT DISSATISFACTION WITH WORKLOAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECILIA BALLI  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Although job satisfaction has improved, the
nation's staff pharmacists continue to report burdensome workloads
and many say they would not enter the field if given a second
chance, a survey of the American Pharmaceutical Association has
found.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 39 percent of the 1,200 pharmacists who responded said
they likely wouldn't choose the same career if they were just
beginning college today. That figure is down from results of a
similar study done in 1987. But industry representatives said the
numbers show there still is much to do to improve the work
environment of practicing pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this indicates that there is a feeling of uncertainty
about the profession within the minds of our colleagues,'' said Ben
Gruda, who serves on the association's task force for environment
and worklife quality issues.
</P>
<P>
   Findings of the survey, conducted by researchers at George
Washington University, were presented at the association's 146th
conference being held here through Tuesday. About 5,500 association
members are attending the event, which includes panels, continuing
education courses and more than 300 exhibits on the industry's
newest drugs, products and therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists surveyed said heavy workloads cut deeply into time
for counseling patients on prescriptions. They also reported too
many interruptions, problems with processing third-party insurance
prescriptions and little discussion with their peers about clients
and work practices.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, employees at chain and supermarket pharmacies, as well
as those in hospitals and other institutional settings, are less
satisfied and more likely to leave the profession, the survey
found.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five percent of those who would be permitted under labor
laws to vote for a union said they would favor one.
</P>
<P>
   The president-elect of the Pharmaceutical Society of the State
of New York said a separate job satisfaction survey in that state
found pharmacists are not complaining about long days and
infrequent bathroom breaks. They are simply unhappy they're ``not
practicing pharmacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of workload today has reached a point of absurdity,
and that's what our surveys tell us,'' Lee Joffee said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pharmacy found in its own survey that work
schedules, hours, sites, salaries and benefits are mostly
satisfactory to the 15,000 pharmacists practicing in the state.
They are most upset about their workloads, time allowed for
clinical services and patient interaction, amount of breaks and
support for staff training.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, pharmacies are required to inform clients in writing
that a pharmacist is available for counseling. They also must
provide a toll-free number to contact the Texas board with
complaints. In discussing the amount of errors pharmacists report
happening in the workplaces, Joffee described pharmacies as
sometimes dangerous places for customers whose lives may depend on
their accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmacists are challenged, and the issues that we're talking
about are very serious,'' said Jann Hinkle, director of
professional practice development for the American Pharmaceutical
Association. The association will use the survey results to draft
guidelines for employers and employees as part of a larger
undertaking of redefining standards of practice nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The findings will be published in the July-August issue of the
Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association.

HEARING FROM THOSE AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most dreaded assignments in any newsroom is to
interview the family of someone who has just been killed. It is bad
enough when the death is an accident. It is especially bad when the
victim has been murdered.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as it is from this side of the note pad, most of us
can't imagine what it is like on the other. And that was one reason
for a recent seminar involving Fort Worth Star-Telegram reporters,
editors and photographers and people who had lost family members to
violent death.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was sponsored by the newspaper, the Juvenile
Violence Task Force, the Crime Prevention Resource Center, and
Parents of Murdered Children Inc. There have been other meetings,
but they were generally small. This one involved more than 85
people.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda O'Quin, who lost a child to violence and is coordinator
of the Juvenile Violence Task force, set it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the workshop was to minimize the intrusion and
help reporters understand the trauma a family may be experiencing
so a family is not revictimized by them,'' she said. ``We found the
reporters wanted this information as much as we wanted them to have
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally walked away from the workshop feeling very
positive about the ability of the journalists from that workshop to
respond to the needs of victims, and I hope the Star-Telegram felt
we better understood the difficult position they are sometimes in
when covering a story,'' O'Quin said.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists, in my opinion, have little real appreciation of
what it means to be the focus of intensive coverage. My limited
experience has been daunting, and I can't imagine how I would feel
if I also were struggling to deal with the death of a loved one at
the same time. But we can talk to one another about it, and that is
what happened two weeks ago. (Remember, this involved Star-Telegram
people only, so the only impact on other members of the news media
will come if they read this column.)
</P>
<P>
   We told the family members and people who work with them at the
start that it was not the intent of the newspaper to develop a set
of rigid guidelines about coverage of violence as a result of the
workshop. But we wanted to listen to and learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   We divided into 10 groups with both newspaper people and
survivors involved and gave each group a specific topic.
</P>
<P>
   One group, discussing comments not appropriate when talking to
victims and survivors, suggested using subdued _ not graphic _
language in the interview. The group also cautioned about reporters
being the first to give information to the victims and survivors,
although another group studying a different question suggested
sharing information that the survivors may not know.
</P>
<P>
   Many reporters who have been in the business for any length of
time have had the misfortune of being the one to tell someone that
a loved one has been killed. It's not something you want to do
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions: Be compassionate in the approach; later, as
the coverage progresses, don't ask if the survivor has forgiven the
killer; don't ask specific legal questions about an ongoing trial.
</P>
<P>
   And in a touching comment, newspeople were urged to remember
that ``perpetrators have moms (and) dads, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A different group dealing with a similar question (''What should
be off-limits to the press?'') suggested contacting family members
or a representative for permission before covering funerals. This
already is Star-Telegram policy.
</P>
<P>
   This group suggested giving a survivor time after the trial to
collect his or her thoughts, or speaking instead to a designated
person from the victim's family. In the discussion, someone
mentioned making sure that people who claim to be friends and
speaking on behalf of the family really do have that authority.
</P>
<P>
   Another group discussed appropriate questions.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the name and age and get the correct spelling, they said,
and make it clear who you are and whom you represent. The group
suggested interviewing adults only and knowing enough about the
crime ahead of time so that ``you can be sympathetic.'' Set
boundaries, the group said, and respect the survivor's home.
</P>
<P>
   Don't say things like, ``I know what you are going through,''
because you don't. It is appropriate to say things like, ``I am
sorry for what has happened'' and ``I understand you don't want to
talk now. Is there someone else I can talk to?'' and ``Tell me
something about the person.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the group that suggested sharing ``what you know about
the crime with the family and ask them what they want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the interview, ask whether there is something
they would like to add,'' the group said. ``It gives the victims
some control of the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   It is appropriate, a different group said, to ask survivors
whether they are willing to be interviewed, and it's also OK to ask
again. But if the second answer is still no, then ``ask them to
call you if (or) when ready.''
</P>
<P>
   We asked one group to describe appropriate material in stories
about a victim. Basic background information and interviews with
relatives willing to talk are fine, the group said, but
``irrelevant personal information, sexual preference unless sexual
preference is a motive for the crime, and unsubstantiated
information'' should be off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   This group also was critical of any decision-making based on
competitive pressure and ``insisting on an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Body bags are out,'' said the group discussing crime scene
photographs. They are never appropriate ``even when the crime is in
foreign lands'' because they ``dehumanize the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some discussion that television, because of its
immediacy, can ``get away'' with more, but there was a clear
expectation that the decision-making would be more reasoned in
print publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime scenes are `fair game' as long as they represent the
true nature of the story,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   One group discussed ways to protect the privacy of the families
and still get the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure your facts are correct,'' group members said. Tell
victims when the story will run, and leave them a card with
information for follow-up contacts and for both complaints and
compliments.
</P>
<P>
   Treating victims with respect ``leads to give-and-take and a
fair balance,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Members also cautioned that ``revictimization can and does occur
during interviews,'' so reporters should ``take care with questions
and techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   This group suggested developing seminars to be held at other
newspapers and at college journalism departments about the do's and
don'ts of violence coverage.
</P>
<P>
   There was concern about how to handle the victim's story when
the reporting has switched to the accused _ say, when a person
convicted of murder is fighting the death penalty or during
frequent and repetitive appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a story is done about the accused, victims and survivors
want their loved ones remembered and mentioned at the same time,''
said the group studying this issue. ``When the accused's version is
reported, that version needs to be placed in the context of
evidence and information that shows the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   The group that discussed publication of names and addresses held
that certification as an adult means that a juvenile's name
certainly could be published, but the group was split on what to do
when the juvenile has not been certified. Star-Telegram policy
takes into account the kind of crime involved when dealing with
this issue.
</P>
<P>
   The group felt that it is appropriate to publish general crime
locations but not specific victim addresses (the practice generally
followed by the Star-Telegram), and that it is permissible to
publish victims' names.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are never sure what will happen when you put people with
very different perspectives together in one room,'' O'Quin said.
``This time, it worked very well. I think my concern was that
families who have survived the murder of a loved one are very vocal
about their experiences. They have a right to be hurt and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporters, to get the information they need, must also be
strong and determined. That's not to say they are not kind and
compassionate people, but they have a job to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ... think that each group walked away with a new and better
understanding of the perspective of the other,'' O'Quin said. ``I
noticed some cards being exchanged and some meetings being arranged
with reporters and families. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I also got the feeling that the participants, both from the
``Star-Telegram'' and Parents of Murdered Children Inc., would like
to do this again,'' O'Quin said. ``Time was short, and they felt
rushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Patsy Thomas, executive director of the Crime Prevention
Resource Center, said that ``an incredible thing happened'' at the
meeting, ``as it often does when a diverse group of individuals
meet to discuss sensitive and emotional issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I observed ... was a group of Fort Worth Star-Telegram
reporters and editors who struggle with the dilemma of reporting
crime while trying to maintain respect and sensitivity for
victims,'' said Thomas. ``My sense was that, as a whole, all
perspectives represented had a sincere desire to do the right thing
in a professional and responsible manner.''

CASE OF BLAST THAT NEARLY KILLED ENVIRONMENTALIST STILL UNSOLVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   SAN FRANCISCO _ When radical
environmental activist and organizer Judi Bari died of cancer on
March 2, 1997, the question that had obsessed her for the last
seven years of her life remained unanswered: Who built and planted
the bomb that blew up in her car and nearly killed her?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today the FBI's investigation is in mothballs. The Oakland
Police Department's ``open file'' on the bombing is moribund. The
case is no closer to solution than it was when the pipebomb filled
with nails exploded in Oakland on May 24, 1990, shattering her
pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   But while law enforcement's attention is elsewhere, an
ill-tempered argument over who-done-it has erupted among radical
activists in California's so-called North Coast _ Mendocino and
Humboldt Counties.
</P>
<P>
   Two alternative publications have called on the FBI to reopen
the investigation and question Bari's ex-husband. That suggestion
has brought forth a furious denial from him and ridicule and
denunciations from Bari's close friends.
</P>
<P>
   They charge that her adversaries connected to the timber
industry _ with the connivance of or tacit support from the FBI _
were responsible for the bombing that left her in constant pain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two key agencies that might investigate, the FBI and
the Oakland police, are being sued by Bari's estate, alleging a
conspiracy against her. The FBI referred all calls on the fresh
accusations to the lawyer defending its agents in court.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department Attorney R. Joseph Sher said the new
accusations ``obviously raise an interesting question,'' but not
one that the FBI needs to investigate. It's ``of interest to me in
defense of the civil case'' against the FBI, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland police Lt. Paul Berlin said, ``There are no leads we are
actively pursuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bari, who was 47 when she died, was the preeminent radical voice
of the North Coast. She was the leader of an environmental group
called Earth First and the organizer of Redwood Summer in 1990, a
national consciousness raiser on the threat to California's last
remaining privately owned virgin redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   She and an Earth First colleague, Darryl Cherney, were driving
through downtown Oakland when the homemade bomb exploded under the
driver's seat of her car. Oakland police immediately arrested the
pair, alleging that they were transporting the bomb. But the
Alameda County district attorney's office refused to file charges,
citing lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Now a freelance reporter named Ed Gehrman, who is also a peace
activist and a special education teacher in Plumas County, and
Vassar College English Professor Don Foster say an analysis of
writing styles suggests that a letter claiming to be from the
bomber was written by Bari's ex-husband, Mike Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who studies textual and linguistic analysis, compared
the writing styles of several people close to Bari with the style
in three letters perhaps linked to the bomber: a warning addressed
to Bari, an offer to Ukiah police to inform on Earth First, and a
letter from the ``Lord's Avenger,'' claiming to be from the bomber,
sent to Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat reporter Mike Geniella.
It was filled with details about the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Foster wrote in Flatland, an alternative magazine in Mendocino
County, that ``among the examined documents, only one writer
emerges from the pack as a plausible author of the Lord's Avenger
letter: Mike Sweeney.'' Gehrman wrote a lengthy article in the same
issue alleging that Sweeney had the motive and opportunity to put a
bomb in Bari's car.
</P>
<P>
   The two articles have attracted so much attention that Bruce
Anderson, editor and publisher of the Mendocino County weekly, the
Anderson Valley Advertiser, last week urged the FBI to reopen its
investigation and question Sweeney for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total hoax,'' counters Sweeney, a Mendocino County
waste management company executive who lives in Ukiah with his and
Bari's two daughters. ``A total black propaganda thing. It's a
tragedy that good old Judi isn't here to take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherney, Bari's close associate who was also injured in the
bombing, says the Flatland report is nothing more than a wild
accusation by ``a bunch of nut cases, disrupters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherney, who remains a high-profile activist with Earth First,
added, ``I have no great love for Mike Sweeney, but we've looked at
him through and through, and we know he's innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's name had surfaced as one of several possible suspects
in 1991, but Bari denounced the report then and insisted on
Sweeney's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrman said he began his investigation after Bari herself cast
suspicions on an acquaintance of his, a left political activist.
Convinced that his friend was wrongly accused, Gehrman spent three
years on research but did not interview Bari, who was alive when he
began his research, or Sweeney or Cherney.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrman said he first brought his suspicions to the FBI, which
didn't seem interested. Then he sought help from Foster, whose
literary sleuthing into writing styles identified former Newsweek
columnist Joe Klein as the anonymous author of the political novel
``Primary Colors.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Foster emphasized that ``I'm not accusing Mike
Sweeney of anything, but from a bunch of possible suspects . . . he
was the one whose writing forms the best match. That is not to say
he bombed Judi Bari.''
</P>
<P>
   On his Web page, Sweeney has posted his own lengthy critique of
Foster's and Gehrman's work.
</P>
<P>
   Bari's supporters share her belief that law enforcement was
either involved in the bombing, or tacitly encouraged others to
act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under normal conditions, the husband would be a suspect, but
these were not normal conditions,'' Cherney said last week. ``We
received about three dozen threatening events _ personal attacks,
death threats, phony letters. There was a concerted effort against
us. Within five minutes after the bombing, the FBI shows up and
blames us for bombing ourselves. Clearly, this all happened in a
political context. The timber industry and some disinformationists
set us up, and the FBI tried to frame us afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bari, author of a book called ``Timber Wars,'' which attacked
the industry, complained that her car had been run off the road by
logging trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Cherney and Bari sued the FBI and Oakland police in 1991,
seeking compensatory damages of $1 million each _ plus punitive
damages _ for false arrest, fabricating evidence and violating
their civil rights. They contended that an examination of internal
FBI documents shows the agency never conducted a serious
investigation to find out who carried out the bombing. Instead,
they said, the agency spent its energies checking out Earth First
contacts in order to discredit them.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit now languishes in the U.S. District Court of Judge
Claudia Wilkin in Oakland, with pieces of it on appeal by both
sides. No trial date is on the horizon.

DECLINE IN OIL PRICES LEAVES MANY TOWNS IN WEST TEXAS DEVASTATED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Texas _ They've seen it all before, the moving vans and
U-Haul trailers streaming toward the exits, the graveyards of steel
sprouting along the desert roadsides, the dust darkening the
windows where lustrous deals had been done and the long, weathered
faces in the unemployment line.
</P>
<P>
   The last time was in 1986, when the price of oil dropped from
$30 a barrel to $10 almost overnight, and people left town so fast
they didn't pause to lock up behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are seeing it again, although this time it is
different. This time, the rot spread slow and deep across the
Permian Basin, crept in so gingerly that it was almost
imperceptible until the foundation buckled and the roof sagged.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year and a half, oil prices receded in increments
that minimized panic _ a buck here, half a buck there _ until a
barrel of crude was worth less than a bucket of fried chicken.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of February, the spot price for West Texas
Intermediate fell to as low as $8 a barrel _ the lowest
inflation-adjusted price since the Great Depression _ and the broad
consequences set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty ugly out here,'' said Marshall Watson, an
independent producer, who recently laid off six of his eight
employees and shut in half of his 150 stripper wells. ``This crash
is 10 times worse than the '86 crash. Back then, the price dropped
and came right back. This has been a long drought. It costs $12 to
lift a barrel of oil that we can sell for $9. We're down to the
bare knuckles.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is betting on a quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is abundant around the globe, and troubled economies in Asia
and South America have reduced demand.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, alternative energy and renewable motor fuels have
achieved such prominence in the marketplace that Arco Chairman Mike
Bowlin recently said the world is seeing the beginning of the end
of the Oil Age.
</P>
<P>
   Watson also believes that the ``long drought'' that began in
November 1997 and accelerated late last year may be the death
rattle of the Permian Basin, which, in its heyday, produced more
oil than any field in the lower 48 states and was the well that
irrigated the Texas economy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, exploration is almost nonexistent, scores of pumps have
been turned off and the crude flows from the basin at a relative
trickle. Service companies that once thrived on drilling now
survive by plugging holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once those wells are plugged,'' Watson said, ``they'll never
be reopened. The workers are leaving and they won't come back. This
is a friendly ghost town.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarmist hyperbole? Maybe. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, cities such as Midland and Odessa appear far
from dressed for a funeral. In fact, a regional economic index
prepared early this year by Ingham Economic Reporting shows only a
fractional decline during 1998, thanks mainly to strong retail
sales, motor vehicle sales and motel/hotel revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath that gloss, however, are more troubling numbers: Permits
for new home construction fell nearly 2.3 percent, the value of all
building permits declined by 25 percent and sales of existing homes
dropped from 2,290 to 1,642.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate jumped from 3.8 percent to 6.5 percent
during the year and reached 9 percent at the end of February. More
than 1,900 jobs were lost last year in Midland and Ector counties
and hundreds more vanished in the other 15 counties of the Permian
Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the downward spiral of those key indicators was the oil
and gas activity index, which tumbled 32 percent during the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were going extremely well here,'' Dennis Clayton,
economic development director of the Midland Chamber of Commerce,
said of the years following the 1986 calamity. ``There was a good
recovery and people were smarter at using technology in getting oil
out of the ground cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil never went back to $30 a barrel, but producers and their
communities learned to live, and prosper, with $20 to $22. Even
when prices settled into the $15 to $16 range, Clayton said, there
was only a small scratch on the basin's economic EKG, because
Midland and Odessa, the major population centers, had begun to wean
themselves from oil dependency.
</P>
<P>
   Development along Loop 250 north of Midland brought in large
retailers and a string of casual-dining chains. A new terminal was
built at Midland International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Law firms that had once wallowed exclusively in oil contracts
branched out with offices in Dallas and Austin. Westwood Medical
Center joined the older Memorial Hospital to help turn the city
into a health care center.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, which had accounted for 50 percent of the city's economy in
1986, began to play a smaller role, declining to about 25 percent
to 30 percent by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to the Texas comptroller's office,
Midland-Odessa remained among the most oil-dependent metro areas in
the state. When prices slipped below $10 a barrel late last year,
the bills for that dependency came due.
</P>
<P>
   During January and February of this year, 248 bankruptcy
petitions were filed in Midland, compared with 115 during the first
two months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' said Christy Carouth, deputy in charge of the
bankruptcy court, ``we started out higher than any year in history,
and they were all personal bankruptcies _ no companies. The
companies have nothing to reorganize with. They have no hope now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about to destroy the communities in West Texas,'' said
John Bell, a resident of one of the most endangered. Kermit, west
of Midland-Odessa, sits in the middle of Winkler County, 841 square
miles of sand dunes, prairie and wells that now sip from the earth
rather than drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are in danger of being closed out here,'' Bell said.
``We may lose our hospital. Parts of county government may have to
shut down. Thousands have been laid off. We're backed into a real
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only two towns in the county of 8,626 _ Wink is the
other _ and, but for oil, neither had a reason to exist.
Unemployment has hit 17 percent in the county and a shrinking tax
base threatens to nearly halve the county's $8 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tax base is 86 percent minerals and ancillary
industries,'' said County Judge Bonnie Leck. ``The county provides
virtually all services _ airport, swimming pools, library, parks,
hospitals, senior citizen services, everything. When you're facing
a decline of 40 percent in values, it is not business as usual.
Severe cuts will be necessitated.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Raising taxes to fund government is not an option, she said.
``Counties have a cap on how much they can tax,'' she said, ``and
even if we raised them, people wouldn't be able to pay them.''
</P>
<P>
   All across the basin, the story is the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial shortages facing some school districts ... are
staggering,'' said state Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander. She
said the hardest-hit district probably will be Iraan-Sheffield in
Pecos County, which could lose $8 million of the $18 million it
normally collects in ad valorem taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' agreed Jeff Bright, business manager
for the district. ``We have enough fund balance to get through a
year or two, but that's all unless the Legislature helps us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Since oil prices are a function of the global market, West Texas
producers are finding political relief hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's solution is to raise oil prices. To that end, he has
testified before congressional committees and organized a march on
the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Results have been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has promised to take some oil off the market
by replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is moving toward a $45 million tax break that
would exempt small producers _ those whose wells produce fewer than
15 barrels a day _ from the 4.6 percent severance tax when the
price of oil falls below $15 a barrel. That exemption would apply
to 83 percent of the wells in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly would apply to Bell, whose nine wells combined
produce only 12 barrels a day. He does not believe it will be
enough to save the West Texas oil industry, however.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and many other producers want the government to impose
import restrictions to keep OPEC nations from ``dumping cheap
foreign oil into the U.S. market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been disappointed in the reception that idea has
received,'' he said. ``Sometimes our politicians fiddle while Rome
burns.''
</P>
<P>
   Oilmen recognize that most of the country, enjoying cheap
gasoline and heating oil, prefers the fiddling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil industry doesn't have any allies,'' Watson said. ``We
can't expect much help from the government. There are more
downstream workers (refiners, chemical processors and the like)
than there are upstream. They would get hammered by an import
tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an unsympathetic government, some independent oilmen
have discussed the possibility of going to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't deal with predatory pricing in Washington, we may
be able to deal with it at the courthouse,'' independent oilman
John Houghton told the Midland Reporter-Telegram recently. ``We are
told (it) would be complicated, difficult and costly, but there
could be grounds for such a suit.''
</P>
<P>
   It could also be time-consuming _ and many in the Permian Basin
feel that time is running out.
</P>

   ``Billions of dollars are being taken out of our industry,''
said Jim Henry, who, with 800 wells, is one of the larger of the
so-called small independents. ``We're losing investment capital.
We're losing experienced personnel. When the time comes to turn
around, it will be very difficult to do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`WE ARE BRACING FOR THE CRUNCH' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout downtown Midland, ``For Lease'' signs hang in the
windows of buildings once occupied by banks and major oil
companies. They are remnants of the '86 bust, not the current one,
but they are a reminder of something lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, big oil left town, or severely restricted
its presence here. Even in the happy years of recovery, the
occupancy rate for commercial real estate never rose above the 65
percent level it reached that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It absolutely collapsed and never came back,'' said Don Davis
of MRO Management Inc., the city's leading broker in commercial
space. ``It just stayed there all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't expect the vacancy rate to change much in the next
couple of years because ``the damage has already been done.''
</P>
<P>
   But the longer oil prices remain depressed, the less certain
anyone here is of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Midland County Commission recently adopted a series of
policies to deal with the ``financial crisis'' _ a hiring freeze,
curtailing overtime _ and even considered the elimination of an
entire county department.
</P>
<P>
   The school district, facing a $2.5 million shortfall after
mineral values dropped by $250 million, is also reaching for the
scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bracing for the crunch,'' said Superintendent Joe
Garessi. ``We will probably scale back across the board. We will
spend some money out of reserves but we are going to be very
conservative in hiring. A high number of teachers are leaving
because their husbands are going elsewhere to work. We may not
replace some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the price of West Texas oil moved back above $12
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was little consolation,
however, since most stripper well operators sell at the ``spot''
price, which tends to trail futures prices by $3 a barrel or so.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said the current slump is likely to continue until the
global balance of supply and demand is restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to plan and try to survive with low oil prices,'' he
said.

SILICON VALLEY AND SILICON ALLEY MEET VENTURE CAPITALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hoping to drum up funding from some of the
world's preeminent venture capital firms, New York City multimedia
start-ups are expected to strut their wares before Bay Area venture
capitalists this week at a conference titled ``Alley to the
Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The name was taken from Silicon Alley _ the region of Manhattan
from the Flatiron Building on 41st Street to the southern tip of
the city _ and Silicon Valley, the mother lode of technology in
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   About 360 Silicon Alley firms, Bay Area venture capitalists and
private investors are expected to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East and West coasts need to do business together,'' said
Anna Wheatley, editor in chief of AlleyCat News, a New York-based
magazine targeted at Silicon Alley firms and co-host of the
conference. The New York City Economic Development Corp. is also
hosting the event.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley said Silicon Alley, which began earlier this decade, is
now a force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   A Coopers &AMP; Lybrand report estimated that the number of jobs in
Silicon Alley, which is made up primarily of Internet content
providers, will reach 100,000 by the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Price Waterhouse Coopers Money Tree, which tracks
venture capital investments, venture funding for Silicon Alley
firms increased nearly five-fold from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the total dollar amount, which had been
secured mainly from East Coast investment sources, went from $51.7
million to $249.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley would not disclose all the Bay Area firms attending
``Alley to the Valley,'' but said a number of major venture
capitalists would be present.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lax, a partner at Softbank Technology Ventures in San
Jose. Calif., said the conference will allow his firm to see who's
doing what in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an aggressive reach-out mode,'' Lax said. ``What they're
obviously trying to do is take the best (Silicon Alley companies)
and expose them to the best VCs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Alley firms agreed the conference will be a useful
networking opportunity. But they weren't optimistic about getting
funding from Bay Area VCs.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Burns, chief executive of New York-based AdOne LLC, the
parent of ClassifiedWarehouse.com, said Bay Area venture firms
don't have much incentive to invest outside their region.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, there is a tremendous amount of start-up activity
on the West Coast,'' Burns said. ``For the most part, the (Bay
Area) VC firms don't have to travel. Some say, `I don't even go to
San Francisco.' When you take a statement like that, you say what's
the justification for someone to invest on another coast?''
</P>
<P>
   Bahar Gidwani, CEO of Index Stock Imagery, a Silicon Alley firm
that sells stock photos over the Internet, said some Bay Area VCs
don't take investing in Web content companies as seriously as they
should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why a lot of the West Coast (VCs) have
invested in certain things,'' such as hardware infrastructure,
Gidwani said. ``How can you do anything interesting if you don't
have good (Internet) content? The VCs out there don't get it. It's
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic
Development Corp., said that even if Silicon Alley firms don't
secure funding this week, there are other ways they can make
valuable business connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies that come here seek a number of things'' in
addition to funding, Millard said. ``They seek strategic partners,
potential acquirers and relationships with other companies in the
Internet space. The first goal is funding, but our other goals are
just as important.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gorenberg, a partner at Hummer Winblad _ which has invested
in a few Silicon Alley firms, including The Knot, an on-line
wedding registry business, and BizTravel.com, a travel reservations
site for business people _ said location doesn't drive his firm's
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invest everywhere,'' he said.

</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 14)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Committee to Restore American Values, reports Richard L.
Berke in The New York Times, has been asking presidential
candidates to take a kind of  &UR; litmus test &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Every Bronx High School of Science graduate knows that litmus is
a paper covered with the coloring matter from lichens that stays
blue when dipped in an alkaline solution and turns pink when dipped
in an acid solution. (Or is it the other way around? I did poorly
in chemistry, but got through because the kid next to me, who
ultimately won a Nobel Prize, let me crib. Some may call that
cheating; we called it ``helping a flunking friend,'' a Value that
needs Restoring.)
</P>
<P>
   That scientific meaning of  &UR; litmus test &LR;  has been extended to
``a criterion that overwhelms all others.'' To get an illustrative
usage of this, I just used my mouse to highlight the phrase and
punched the dictionary symbol on my Microsoft QuickShelf. Here's
what came up: ``The word `hopefully' has become the  &UR; litmus test &LR; 
to determine whether one is a language snob or a language slob _
William Safire.'' (Cribbing from yourself is unsettling; what if I
made a mistake?)
</P>
<P>
   The testing questions from CRAV ranged from ``Would you support
a removal of the words `under God' from the Pledge of Allegiance?''
to ``Do you believe gun control reduces crime?'' Presumably, a
``yes'' answer to either would turn the paper a hot shade of pink.
But the tester that struck me as insightful _ a subtler guide to
moral-political orientation _ was ``Do you normally call games of
chance  &UR; gambling &LR;  or  &UR; gaming &LR; ?''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf is president of the American Gaming
Association. As the lobbyist for the casino industry, he prefers
 &UR; gaming &LR; . ``It's all wagering,'' he tells me. He knows I am an
anti-gambling zealot, but is willing to take a chance on my
redemption. ``Around the 16th century, the distinction came about
between games where personal skill is involved and games of chance.
For example, playing poker is  &UR; gaming &LR;  because it takes personal
skill.  &UR; Gambling &LR;  is where there is no skill involved _ like
picking a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Nevada legalized  &UR; gaming &LR;  in 1931,'' Fahrenkopf, a native
Nevadan, continues, ``most of the games involved skill: table
games, like cards and dice. From the start, it's been the Nevada
 &UR; Gaming &LR;  Commission. But a change has come about in the last 10 or
15 years because the big games are games of chance _ that is, slot
machines. Now, that's  &UR; gambling &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   It's all  &UR; gambling &LR; , says Tom Grey, executive director of the
National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling. ``The use of the
word  &UR; gaming &LR;  is our  &UR; litmus test &LR; . When legislators use it, that
shows us they're in the pocket of the casino operators, and they've
bought the party line or PR guy's package. The word  &UR; gaming &LR;  puts
`foo-foo dust,' as we used to say in the Army, on a business that
bilks the poor and traps the unwary with `something for nothing.'
That's how you make the wrong disappear. The use of the word
 &UR; gaming &LR;  is an attempt to make a serious business seem like fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree:  &UR; Gambling &LR;  has a negative connotation;
 &UR; gaming &LR; , a positive one. Opponents of lotteries denounce
`` &UR; gambling &LR;  as public policy''; proponents say `` &UR; gaming &LR;  is an
entertainment medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Five will get you 10 that  &UR; gaming &LR;  came first. Rooted in the Old
English  &UR; gamenian &LR; , ``to sport, play,'' it appeared around 1510 to
mean ``playing at games of chance for stakes,'' and the person who
did it was a  &UR; gamester &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In Shakespeare's day, the activity was frowned upon as immoral:
Hamlet, thinking about murdering King Claudius, thought the best
time to consign him to hell would be not while he was trying to
pray, but when he was engaged ``At  &UR; gaming &LR; , swearing, or about
some act/That has no relish of salvation in't.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until the 18th century did  &UR; gambling &LR;  roll upon the scene.
Its earliest slang sense was ``cheating at  &UR; gaming &LR; .'' In 1726,
``the  &UR; Gambling &LR;  Fraternity'' was said to be a term used by those
``with a just Derision of their own Vileness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentleman's Magazine in 1747 updated the earlier term:
`` &UR; gamesters &LR; , commonly called  &UR; gamblers &LR; , players, women of the
town.'' The lexicographer Samuel Johnson wrote that  &UR; gambler &LR;  was
``a cant word, I suppose, for  &UR; game &LR;  or  &UR; gamester &LR; '' and defined it
as ``a knave whose practice it is to invite the unwary to  &UR; game &LR; 
and cheat them.'' It was, as the Oxford English Dictionary later
concluded, ``essentially a term of reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the casino operators and lottery advocates
scrupulously avoid the word, while the moralists, joined by
liberals who see it as regressive taxation, try to jam the
pejorative word down the burgeoning industry's throat.
</P>
<P>
   CRAV is right: The word is a sure-fire  &UR; litmus test &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   LOWER THE BAR
</P>
<P>
   In a column about impeachmentese, I speculated that the
ubiquitous metaphor ``lowering the bar'' might be derived from high
jumping.
</P>
<P>
   Lexicographic Irregular Coral Samuel of London called with a
deeper etymon: ``Try the Temple Bar.'' Jack E. Garrett of
Jamesburg, N.J., agreed: ``I believe this expression derives from
the old English tradition centered on the Temple Bar at the
entrance to the City of London.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1301 to 1672, a gateway, or bar, separated the cities of
London and Westminster. When the sovereign wished to enter, goes
the story, he or she had to stop at this boundary (now marked by a
dragon on a pedestal at the junction of Fleet Street and the
Strand) or a similar gateway to receive the formal assent of the
lord mayor of London. The tradition is remembered today in the
symbolic handing over of a sword or giant key, and American mayors
copied this with the presentation of a ``key to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   This raises (but does not beg) the question: If ``lowering the
bar'' meant removing a barrier, how did it come to signify a
lowering of standards? Answer: It became a symbol of welcome, or
easement. Raise the frequency of lowering the bar, and anybody can
get in.

FROM MARS: EVIDENCE OF ITS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ariz., Mass.)   (af)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mars is coming into much better focus, so clearly that
scientists think they now see in the towering mountains, layered
canyon walls and meandering channels telling traces of the planet's
early history, when volcanoes belched gases into a denser, warmer
atmosphere and rivers flowed across the russet plains.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time, more than three billion years ago, when
conditions on Mars seemed much more hospitable to life than today's
cold desert environment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft has
looked down from orbit and snapped hundreds of pictures of the
landscape that are 20 to 40 times as detailed as anything obtained
by previous explorations. And this was not even part of the
original mission plan, but an example of a constructive response to
adversity.
</P>
<P>
   When Surveyor reached Mars orbit in September 1997, a
malfunction had left its solar-power panels vulnerable to excessive
vibrations. The spacecraft had to be maneuvered gingerly into its
planned circular orbit for the primary mission of mapping the
entire planet. Only now, a year late, has Surveyor reached its
intended orbit, ready to start the two-year mapping operation this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Flight controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., checked out all of the spacecraft's systems and scientific
instruments last week and reported they were in excellent health
and performing normally.
</P>
<P>
   As eagerly as scientists await the improved maps, which will be
used in selecting future landing sites, the delay was made more
than bearable by the photographs and other scientific data
transmitted while Surveyor was slowly getting into position.
</P>
<P>
   The most revealing pictures were taken when the craft dipped
within 100 miles of the Martian surface, much closer than its
prescribed mapping orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a bonus mission,'' exulted Dr. Arden L. Albee,
72, of the California Institute of Technology, the mission's chief
scientist, who put off retirement twice to be around for this
moment. ``You wouldn't design a mission this way, spending so much
time before getting to the major objective, but we couldn't be
happier with the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the results in a recent issue of the journal
Nature, Dr. Maria T. Zuber, a planetary scientist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the Surveyor
photography provided a spectacular new view of the geological
processes that shaped the Martian surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``These images, combined with observations from other orbital
sensors and with local views from surface landers, offer the hope
of piecing together a self-consistent view of Mars' early climate _
with implications for the development, or not, of early life on the
planet,'' Dr. Zuber concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pictures revealed unsuspected aspects of familiar
landmarks, like Valles Marineris, the canyon stretching 2,400 miles
just south of the Mars equator. Shot at oblique angles, the
pictures showed for the first time sharply defined horizontal
layers in the chasm walls. The dark and bright banding represented
layers, each 15 to 165 feet thick, reaching to depths of five
miles.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis of the pictures, a team of planetary geologists
led by Dr. Alfred S. McEwen of the University of Arizona in Tucson
concluded that the most likely explanation for the layering was
periodic lava flows from repeated volcanic eruptions over much of
the history of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The geologists estimated that volcanoes spread 10 times as much
lava onto the Martian surface as previously thought, enough to
cover an area the size of the United States to a depth of four
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conclude that volcanism on early Mars has probably been
much more extensive than previously documented, and it must have
affected the climate and near-surface environment,'' McEwen's team
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Such volcanic activity would help explain why Mars appears to
have had a thick, warm atmosphere in earlier epochs. Today, the
atmosphere there is too cold and thin for liquid water to exist on
the surface. But observations by Mariner 9 and two Viking
spacecraft in the 1970s surprised scientists with ample examples of
deep channels, dry river beds, flood plains and other signs of
water erosion. This implied a thicker, warmer atmosphere in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Volcanism would have released substantial amounts of water to
the surface and also gases to sustain a significant atmosphere. If
the principal gas was carbon dioxide, Mars could have developed
greenhouse conditions to retain atmospheric heat and maintain a
relatively warm climate.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon dioxide is the main constituent of today's tenuous
Martian atmosphere, but the Surveyor scientists said it had not yet
been confirmed that the Martian crust contained sufficient
carbonates for volcanoes to have expelled significant amounts of
atmospheric carbon dioxide in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, Dr. Zuber said, provide more reasons to
believe that ``Mars is a superb and arguably unique natural
laboratory for the study of climate in the early stage of evolution
of the terrestrial planets.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also said the Surveyor pictures showed extensive lava
flows near the volcanoes of the Tharsis plateau that appeared to be
no older than 40 million to 100 million years. Perhaps the planet
still has some volcanic heat churning in its interior.
</P>
<P>
   The findings provided other clues to the planet's watery past.
From previous photography, showing valleys that appeared to start
abruptly at almost full size and without tributary channels, it was
assumed that flash floods of upwelling ground water were mainly
responsible for surface erosion.
</P>
<P>
   This left open the question of whether the early Mars
environment could sustain flowing surface water for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael C. Malin of Malin Space Sciences Systems in San
Diego and Dr. Michael H. Carr of the United States Geological
Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., reported that the new pictures
supported the view that ground water, rather than rainfall, played
an important role in the formation of most of the water-eroded
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dry channels appeared to be the result of
short-duration floods, presumably fed by frozen reservoirs just
beneath the surface. Other scientists suggested that volcanism
could have melted these reservoirs and brought the water to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   But Malin and Carr also found the first strong evidence that in
some places water had flowed for extended periods over great
distances. A prime example is a narrow, meandering valley in Nanedi
Valles. Surveyor pictures detected a 600-foot-wide trough at the
bottom of the 1.6-mile-wide canyon, indicating to the scientists
that flowing water had steadily eroded the channel deeper and
deeper over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Albee, the chief scientist, said Surveyor's nonphotographic
results had also produced important results. The magnetometer
revealed large remnant magnetic fields in the Martian crust,
indicating that at one time Mars had a global magnetic field
presumably generated by convections in a molten core.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of radio signals has shown that the planet's gravity
field is lumpy, which may mean that an ancient cratered terrain
lies buried under the present crust. And the spacecraft's laser
altimeter, measuring variations in surface elevations, has given
scientists a more detailed view of the terraced landscape of the
north polar cap.
</P>
<P>
   For its mapping mission, the Surveyor is orbiting Mars from pole
to pole, passing over a given part of the planet at the same local
time on each orbit. Mapping pictures are to be taken repeatedly of
the entire planet from a 250-mile altitude over almost two Earth
years, the equivalent of one Mars year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the global map is mainly intended for interpreting the
planet's geologic history and planning future missions, Surveyor
will be directed to take special pictures of the borders of the
southern polar ice cap in May.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures will be used in selecting a safe and interesting
landing site for the Polar Lander spacecraft, already on its way
for a scheduled landing in December.

FIRSTHAND PROOF OF THE IMPORTANCE OF BREAST BIOPSIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago I wrote a column that might have been called ``the
myth of the negative mammogram.'' In it I discussed the fact that
10 percent to 15 percent of breast cancers do not show up on a
mammogram and cautioned women that any suspicious area in the
breast should be biopsied even when the mammogram is negative.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, I became living proof of the value of that advice.
I'd been having annual mammograms for about 13 years with no
evidence of anything wrong. Likewise at my exam this year, my
radiologist for the last eight years, Dr. Doreen Liebeskind,
delivered the news that my X-rays looked fine. However, this time I
feared something was the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was an area of thickening in my left breast that we'd
been watching for years. My mammograms were consistently negative
and sonograms had shown nothing more than fibrous tissue, a normal
aberration common in many women. But from time to time the area
hurt and it had been especially painful two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   I had begun to wonder how I would know if something went awry.
Even if I suspected all was not well, would I fail to act after
being reassured for seven years that there was nothing to worry
about?
</P>
<P>
   Then Dr. Liebeskind did a manual exam and said, ``It feels a
little different from last year, a little more nodular. Let's get
another sonogram.'' Sonography, a way of viewing tissue using
ultra-high-speed sound waves, is an excellent noninvasive tool for
investigating suspicious areas in the breast that are picked up
either by a mammogram or physical examination.
</P>
<P>
   It is also useful for screening women at high risk either
because of family or personal histories of breast cancer, according
to Dr. Peter I. Pressman, breast cancer surgeon at Lenox Hill
Hospital and Beth Israel Medical Center and co-author, with Dr.
Yashar Hirshaut, of ``Breast Cancer: The Complete Guide'' (Bantam
revised edition, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Liebeskind compared my sonogram to the one taken last
year, she said, ``There's something new there now, and I think we
should do a needle biopsy and see what it is.'' Guided by
ultrasound, a thin hollow needle was inserted into the suspicious
area and cells were sucked out for microscopic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   It was all so swift and matter-of-fact that I wasn't even scared
when Dr. Liebeskind said she saw something in the cells that wasn't
quite normal. She handed over the slides of my breast cells to Dr.
Grace Yang, cytopathologist at New York University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Dr. Yang developed a rapid stain technique
that enabled her to make a diagnosis within 10 minutes _ no three
days of agonized waiting for biopsy results. I don't know why her
technique is not used everywhere by now.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Yang was also matter-of-fact. ``This is cancer,'' she said,
tempering her grim report with, ``But you're very lucky. It's
small, one centimeter, and very early and of low nuclear grade,
meaning it's not an aggressive cancer.'' Surgery a week later and a
complete microscopic analysis of the tumor and lymph nodes into
which my breast drains confirmed her diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   I was very lucky, if someone with cancer could ever be
considered lucky. My chances are better than 95 percent that the
surgery, a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy, and subsequent five
weeks of radiation (five days a week) will be a permanent cure.
</P>
<P>
   In a lumpectomy, the surgeon removes the tumor and a small
amount of surrounding tissue, and the sentinel node biopsy removes
only those underarm nodes into which the breast drains. And just to
be sure, since my tumor cells, like those of most breast cancers,
respond to estrogen, I'll be taking the antiestrogen drug tamoxifen
for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, a major multicenter study showed that tamoxifen
reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence and the chances of
developing cancer in the opposite breast by about 45 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My experience should in no way discourage any woman from having
regular mammograms. My advice is also the recommendation of the
American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute: an
annual mammogram starting at age 40. Mammography is an excellent
surveillance tool that can detect 85 percent of breast cancers. It
can pick up tumors when they are too tiny to be felt, before they
have spread beyond the area where they arose, when the potential
for cure is greatest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Early detection through mammography is one of the main reasons
for the declining death rate from breast cancer. The other factors
are the widespread use of radiation therapy for five or six weeks
following a lumpectomy and postoperative chemotherapy, which,
depending on the cellular nature of the tumor, is now often given
even when there is no evidence that cancer has spread beyond the
breast if the tumor is larger than mine or there are indications
that it is more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Mammograms are lifesaving, and I will continue to have them
annually. But as with the recently removed tumor, I will not rely
on them 100 percent. If something feels wrong, I will make sure to
have it examined by ultrasound and biopsied if there is a
suspicious lesion.
</P>
<P>
   I will repeat what Dr. Liebeskind told me in 1988: ``Every lump
should be biopsied unless it disappears on its own in a month or
two or it is shown to be a benign fluid-filled cyst that collapses
and does not recur when the fluid is removed.''
</P>
<P>
   A mammogram alone cannot distinguish between an innocent cyst
and a cancer. If ultrasound is available, it can show if the cyst
is filled with fluid, and guided by ultrasound, a needle can be
used to suck out the fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the value of mammography, a negative mammogram does not
rule out cancer. Mammograms are most likely to miss cancers in
women under 50 who have dense breast tissue. Breast size, however,
is not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Although annual mammography is not recommended before age 40
(except, perhaps, for women with a strong family history of early
breast cancer or who carry genes that place them at high risk of
cancer), many radiologists recommend that a baseline mammogram be
done at age 30 or 35, when everything is likely to be normal. That
way future deviations from normal will be easier to spot.
</P>
<P>
   Too many women with worrisome lumps are falsely reassured by
doctors when their mammograms are negative. Some are advised to
return in three or six months for another look, but others are not
examined again for another year.
</P>
<P>
   One of my friends who had a mammogram-negative lump was followed
for a year with periodic mammograms before her doctor decided to do
a biopsy, which revealed a cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Money should not be a concern that deters women from having
regular mammograms. Many states now have laws mandating insurance
coverage, at least for women over 50, and Medicare now covers
annual mammography for all Medicare-eligible women.
</P>
<P>
   For those not fully covered by insurance, there are low-cost
mammography services almost everywhere. To find one, call the
American Cancer Society at (800) 227-2345.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget breast self-examination. Even with the
increased use of screening mammography, today most women with
breast cancer come to the doctor with a tumor they have found
themselves, usually by accident.
</P>
<P>
   This speaks to the value of doing regular breast
self-examination because a woman who checks her own breasts every
month is most likely to be sensitive to subtle changes that could
mean trouble. And the earlier trouble is discovered, the less
aggressive the therapy needs to be and the greater the likelihood
of cure.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Liebeskind put it, ``A woman doesn't have to know what
she is feeling, only that it feels different from before.'' She
emphasizes that monthly examinations by a woman who is familiar
with every nuance in her breasts are far more likely to pick up an
early cancer than is a annual breast examination by a health
professional.

LETTING OUT AGGRESSION MAY BE BAD ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa)   (af)  
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You know what I do when I'm angry? I hit a pillow. Try that,''
suggests the psychiatrist, played by Billy Crystal, to his New York
gangster client (Robert De Niro) in the Warner Brothers movie
``Analyze This.'' But it is bad advice, according to new research
by social psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   Though pop psychology books and articles perpetuate the notion
that ``getting your anger out'' is cathartic and can help dissipate
hostility, the researchers have found just the opposite: Venting
anger on inanimate objects _ punching a pillow or hitting a
punching bag, for example _ increases rather than decreases
aggressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing, the researchers found, books and articles
that recommend ``catharsis'' as a good method of dealing with anger
actually may foster aggression by giving people permission to relax
their self-control.
</P>
<P>
   In the studies, which appear in the March issue of The Journal
of Personality and Social Psychology, angry subjects who hit a
punching bag were later more aggressive in blasting their rivals in
a competitive task with loud, unpleasant noises than subjects who
did not hit a punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   But aggression also increased when the subjects, who were all
undergraduates enrolled in introductory psychology courses, first
read a bogus article describing research purportedly showing that
hitting an inanimate object was ``an effective way of venting
anger.''
</P>
<P>
   In one study, participants who read the article were more eager
to hit the punching bag than subjects who read a different article
debunking the benefits of catharsis. In a subsequent study,
participants who read the pro-catharsis article and then hit the
punching bag were more aggressive toward partners in the
competitive task.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brad J. Bushman, an associate professor of psychology at
Iowa State University and the lead author of the studies, said he
suspected that the subjects, led to believe catharsis worked, kept
trying to relieve anger, even after it became clear that the
punching bag was not doing the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep trying to get this emotional release, but it never
happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To make the subjects angry, the researchers asked them to write
one-paragraph essays on abortion, and informed them that the essays
would be critiqued by other study participants.
</P>
<P>
   Half the subjects received negative critiques, consisting of low
ratings on organization, originality, style, clarity,
persuasiveness and overall quality, along with a handwritten
comment saying, ``This is one of the worst essays I have read!''
The others received positive critiques, including the comment, ``No
suggestions, great essay!''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that catharsis is the best way to handle anger gained
wide currency as part of Sigmund Freud's hydraulic model of sexual
and aggressive drives. The theory holds that when angry feelings
are repressed, pressure builds up. If the pressure is not released,
the logic goes, psychological or physical problems can result.
</P>
<P>
   Many self-help books advocate a cathartic approach to anger
management. One, the researchers wrote, ``recommended that angry
people twist a towel, punch a pillow, wallop a punching bag, hit a
couch with a plastic baseball bat, throw rocks or break glass to
reduce pent-up anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three decades, however, psychologists have tested
the catharsis theory and found virtually no evidence for it.
``Catharsis has enjoyed a run of support in the popular media that
far outstrips its support in the research literature,'' Bushman and
his colleagues wrote.

NATION'S FIRST PRIVACY CZAR IS A COMPUTER WHIZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When Peter P. Swire was a student at the Albany
Academy, a private preparatory school here, he excelled in math and
half a dozen sports. But at home one of his biggest interests was
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly a quarter century later, Swire will have a big say
in the use of electronic information in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Ohio State University law professor was named by
Vice President Al Gore to be the nation's first ``privacy czar.''
</P>
<P>
   Swire, a 1976 graduate of the academy, is an expert on financial
privacy and the protection of electronic personal information that
is used by seemingly every business in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``With new technology, there's new privacy issues all the
time,'' said Swire in a telephone interview. ``Privacy's been a
controversial political topic in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Swire also co-wrote the book ``None of Your Business: World Data
Flows, Electronic Commerce and the Internet Privacy Directive.'' He
has written dozens of papers and delivered speeches on the issue.
Now he will divide his time between his professorship in Ohio and
his new position in Washington, D.C. as chief counselor for privacy
at the federal Office of Management and Budget. At the end of the
spring semester, he will move his family to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At Albany Academy, Swire was one of the top students in his
class. According to Bob Olcott, a retired teacher, Swire was a
problem-solver with an active mind and plenty of creativity. He not
only helped lead the school's math club, he also played tennis,
soccer, ran cross-country and wrestled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was solving problems out there on the mat at the same time
he was dealing with the physical side of the sport,'' Olcott said.
</P>
<P>
   William Swire of Albany, the 72-year-old father of Peter Swire,
said his son's interest in electronics began in high school. The
elder Swire owned the Mayfair furniture company here and developed
a software program that he later sold to businesses around the
country. On his summer vacation, Peter would tinker with the
program and had a hand in perfecting it.
</P>
<P>
   At Princeton University, Peter Swire wrote his senior thesis on
how technology was going to change the world. After college and law
school, he married Anne Putney, a graduate of the Albany Academy
for Girls. He began his career as an associate lawyer for a
Washington, D.C. firm with an expertise in environment, banking and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Swire, now 40, taught at the University of Virginia from 1990 to
1996 before moving to Ohio State University College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Swire said Gore's staff called him last year because of
his expertise in cyberspace, and invited him to apply for the
position Gore had created. The job, which pays $125,000, will last
until the end of the Clinton administration, when Swire will return
to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Swire says he will help get the federal government to discuss
with states different privacy issues, such as New York's
contemplation of selling Department of Motor Vehicle names to
private companies. He will also have a hand in the creation of
privacy bills and other issues.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is a common, but still horrifying image. A
traffic accident, a shooting, a fall or a stabbing. And the victim
lies dead in a pool of blood, life drained away by severe
hemorrhaging that could not be stopped in time.
</P>
<P>
   As blood is the fluid of life, the loss of it can be the
harbinger of death. Blood loss through injuries claims tens of
thousands of lives each year, but researchers are working to change
that by developing a new type of bandage that clots blood
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists with the American Red Cross have teamed with U.S.
Army researchers to produce bandages and other dressings that they
say can seal a severe, bleeding wound in seconds with a tough,
artificial scab.
</P>
<P>
   After about eight years of research in the laboratory and with
animals, the researchers say the sealants are almost ready for
human trials.
</P>
<P>
   If the dressings prove effective and safe in the real world,
scientists say, they could radically change emergency treatment for
civilians and soldiers, saving thousands of lives now routinely
lost.
</P>
<P>
   They foresee that these dressings will be carried not only by
ambulances, but also in police cars, fire trucks and other
emergency vehicles that arrive first on trauma scenes, and
potentially placed in first aid kits in remote locations to be used
before medical help arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty thousand people in the United States bleed to death per
year, 30,000 in hospitals and 20,000 in the streets,'' said Dr.
William Drohan, director of the plasma development branch of the
Red Cross' Jerome H. Holland Laboratory for the Biomedical Sciences
in Rockville, Md. ``We think we can make a difference in this with
something very simple, something so practical it could be available
and used almost anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The military interest in an improved field bandage is also
obvious, Drohan said. Of the soldiers who die on the battlefield,
50 percent bleed to death, he said, and having soldiers carry
clotting bandages as part of their gear could increase their
chances of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Alving, a blood expert with the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute, said that if the new bandages proved
effective, they could have a big impact upon emergency care.
Doctors may see fewer patients who have gone into shock from blood
loss, but may also see an increase in severely injured people who
otherwise would have died before reaching the hospital, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to take two human blood plasma proteins, fibrinogen
and thrombin, which are key components in stopping bleeding, and
concentrating them at the site of the wound to speed the natural
clotting process. While the concept is not new, finding a practical
and safe way of doing it has challenged scientists for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Army worked on blood-clotting bandages during World War II,
but abandoned the effort for two reasons. It could not find an
efficient way to mass-produce the clotting proteins from plasma,
the clear liquid part of whole blood where they are found. More
importantly, Army doctors found that diseases like hepatitis could
be transmitted through infected plasma and plasma products, and the
technology did not exist to purify contaminated blood.
</P>
<P>
   Technical advances in blood work, brought on in part by recent
efforts to cleanse blood products that might be contaminated with
the virus that causes AIDS and by the discovery of new ways of
isolating fibrinogen and thrombin from each other until they are
needed, have opened up new approaches to making clotting dressings,
according to scientists.
</P>
<P>
   With support from the Army, the Red Cross has developed methods,
for which it is seeking patent rights, to bring clotting
ingredients together in several forms to make easy-to-use sealants
for different types of wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the effort has gone into a bandage, embedded with
clotting proteins, that is pressed into a wound and held in place
for a couple of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have also developed a self-expanding sealant
foam that can be propelled from a container into deep wounds or the
body cavity to contact internal bleeding sites. And, the team is
investigating a dry spray that would be squirted on a large, open
wound or a burned area.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a revolutionary way of using an old technology,'' said
Dr. Martin J. MacPhee, the principal Red Cross scientist working on
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by delivering 10 to 20 times more clotting factors to a
wound than naturally available in the blood,'' MacPhee said, ``it
can stop a gushing hemorrhage with a clot that is much, much
stronger than normal.''
</P>
<P>
   When there is a bloody injury, thrombin activates small blood
cells called platelets and they collect at the site to form a loose
plug.
</P>
<P>
   Thrombin interacts with fibrinogen to form an insoluble compound
called fibrin, which binds platelets to other proteins in the wound
to form a clot and scab. Because the two clotting proteins begin
forming fibrin as soon as they come into contact, using them
outside the normal process requires that they remain separated
until needed.
</P>
<P>
   For years, surgeons have taken fibrinogen and thrombin liquids
and mixed them in the operating room to form a glue-like biological
adhesive that they used to control minor and moderate bleeding
along sutures and other parts of surgical wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial products that do the same thing, often with the
clotting proteins separated in special double syringes, have been
available in Europe for a decade. Last year, the Food and Drug
Administration approved use of the first such fibrin sealants for
surgical procedures in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a team led by Col. John R. Hess at the Walter Reed
Army Institute of Research, Red Cross researchers developed a way
to freeze dry human fibrinogen and thrombin that had been filtered
and cleaned to remove most bacteria and viruses.
</P>
<P>
   These proteins are freeze-dried to a special backing to form a
bandage that can be absorbed by the body if left in a wound. The
bandage is then sealed in an airtight foil pack to keep out
moisture that can activate it, and the pack is sterilized with
gamma-ray radiation using a patented process developed by Indico
Technologies of Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Drohan said these techniques allowed the two clotting proteins
to be packaged together at room temperature without reacting with
each other unless moistened. The bandage uses blood itself as the
liquid to activate the clotting process, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Modern sterilization procedures remove or destroy almost all
bacteria and viruses from blood products, but a small risk of
contamination always remains, MacPhee said.
</P>
<P>
   To eliminate even this tiny risk, and to assure an ample supply
of clotting proteins without having to process vast quantities of
plasma, the Red Cross is sponsoring research at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, in Blacksburg, Va., to alter pigs
genetically to produce the pure human clotting proteins in their
milk, he said. Ample supplies of the pure proteins would be used to
mass-produce the bandages.
</P>
<P>
   Animal tests of the dry fibrin sealant dressings conducted by
Dr. John B. Holcomb and colleagues at the Army Institute for
Surgical Research in San Antonio showed that the bandages were much
more effective in stopping bleeding from surgical and trauma wounds
than the standard gauze pressure bandage.
</P>
<P>
   The new bandage reduced blood loss by 65 percent to 85 percent,
they reported, and greatly decreased the loss of arterial blood
pressure that leads to shock.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said human trials of the bandage were about a
year away. Negotiations are under way to find a manufacturing
partner to make the bandages for the tests. If successful, the
bandages could receive Food and Drug Administration approval as a
medical device in three to five years, they estimate. Human tests
of the fibrin sealant foam are at least another two or three years
away, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Initial human tests of the bandage will probably be with
surgical patients undergoing operations, like prostate gland
removal, that normally result in heavy bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   These may be followed later by trauma studies, perhaps at
centers that treat bloody liver and spleen injuries, the scientists
said.

PUSHING LIMITS OF THE HUMAN LIFE SPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Texas, Mich., Ill., N.C., Idaho)   (af)  
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They were a small group of eminent academic
scientists who had their reputations to think of. They were
repelled by what they saw as the hucksterism and charlatanism that
had given attempts to delay human aging a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, at a recent meeting here, most agreed that science
might be on the brink of being able to stretch the human life span,
perhaps significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have had astonishing success in recent years in
increasing the life spans of laboratory species like worms and
fruit flies. The time was ripe to review these discoveries and
discuss what might lie ahead, said Dr. Gregory Stock, the
conference organizer, who is director of the program on medicine,
technology and science at the University of California School of
Medicine at Los Angeles. ``Given adequate funding, given lucky
breaks, how far could we go?'' Stock asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ten scientists attended the two-day meeting. Future generations,
they said, may be able to avail themselves of scientifically
established techniques to stretch the human life span like a piece
of taffy until it reaches 150, even 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can extend the life span of mammals,'' said Dr.
Judith Campisi, who heads the department of cellular and molecular
biology at the Berkeley National Laboratory. ``There is no reason
to believe that we couldn't do the same today in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably possible,'' said Dr. Cynthia Kenyon, a
professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of
California at San Francisco. ``The lights are green everywhere you
go,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   And if their expectations bear fruit, the scientists said, and
humans live to be 150, 200 or even older, these latter-day
Methuselahs will not creak along, riddled with disabilities and
disease, for decade after decade. The goal is to allow people to be
vigorous and healthy as they age, to stretch out the good years
rather than elongate the bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   It is, said Dr. Kenyon, 45, as if someone who looks as she does
were actually 90. Just imagine it, ``I'm 90,'' she said,
challenging the scientists as they turned to stare at her, a tall,
vibrant, honey-blond professor.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental questions remain unanswered, but, the scientists
say, the general direction is clear. For now, what they have is a
proof of principle and a staggering vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be very hard for us to deal with,'' Stock said.
The idea of expanding the human life span to 150, 200 or more
years, ``puts a distance between ourselves and all of our
history,'' he said. And it puts humans in uncharted waters. ``All
of human wisdom on how to live a life,'' no longer would apply,
Stock said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jan Vijig, the director of basic research and a professor of
physiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San
Antonio, added: ``We have a few small starting points now. We have
never been in a position like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of hypotheses to explain aging, but this
group, whose members had a range of specialties, was especially
impressed by one that held that the secret of aging was in the
genes.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that with just a few genetic alterations, scientists
had created worms and fruit flies with lifespans twice the norm and
that die healthy and vigorous _ the worm or fly equivalent of being
90 and looking 45. Even mice have lived twice as long as normal
with a simple genetic mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Rose, a professor in the department of ecology and
evolutionary biology at the University of California at Irvine,
said there was nothing like creating one of these long-lived
organisms to make someone a believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've created postponed-aging with my own hands,'' he said. ``I
know what it feels like to see one organism on its last legs and
another organism that is the same age doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the workshop sessions and in private discussions scientists
explained why they were so impassioned and why they came to believe
that genes controlled life spans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenyon started her quest to postpone aging with a fact that
used to seem surprising: Many of the fundamental biological
processes that occur in the simple roundworm, C. elegans, also
occur in humans. She was a postdoctoral student when the revelation
occurred, in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had discovered a small collection of genes that
choreographed development in simple creatures like fruit flies and,
they soon discovered, in mammals as well. By making a single change
in a single gene, development could be profoundly deranged: A fly's
antennae could turn into legs, for example. Worms, once thought too
primitive, also turned out to have these genes.
</P>
<P>
   So Dr. Kenyon began pondering the genetic control of aging.
Perhaps the same genetic approach that worked with development
might crack the problem of aging, she reasoned and worms might show
the way. After all, she decided, there was every reason to believe
that life spans were written in the genes.
</P>
<P>
   She cites, for example, the life spans of three small mammals:
the mouse, the canary and the bat. Mice live 2 years, canaries live
13, and bats live for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why evolution selected for different life spans,
but it did,'' Dr. Kenyon said. Because evolution acts on genes,
that means that scientists can ask whether they can deliberately
stretch an organism's life.
</P>
<P>
   To test her hypothesis, Dr. Kenyon began looking for simple
genetic alterations that could extend the life of C. elegans. It
did not take her long to find one: mutations in a gene, called
daf-2, that allow the worms to live for a month instead of two
weeks. And unlike other mutations that seemed to increase the
worms' longevity, the worms with mutated daf-2 genes were fine _
healthy and vigorous.
</P>
<P>
   When they near the end of their two-week lives, ``normal worms
look horrible,'' Dr. Kenyon said. A young worm has a certain body
posture, Dr. Kenyon explained, it moves vigorously and its body
makes a nicely shaped wave as it wriggles along. An old worm, by
contrast, has a pockmarked body and cells that are filled with
gunk. It lies around listlessly.
</P>
<P>
   But old worms with the daf-2 gene mutation ``look great,'' she
said. It is as though they have a perpetual youth. ``Even a dead
daf-2 looks better than a dead normal worm,'' Dr. Kenyon said.
</P>
<P>
   Others found that the worm daf-2 gene was closely related to
genes that cells used to respond to several hormones, including
insulin, raising questions of whether there might be a simple
hormonal treatment to retard aging substantially. The next step,
Dr. Kenyon said, was obvious: ``Check in mice'' to see if the mouse
version of the daf-2 gene controls life span.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Rose came at aging from a different direction. It was 1976 and
he was 21 years old, trying to decide whether to do his graduate
work at Harvard University or at the University of Sussex, when he
got a letter from Dr. Brian Charlesworth of Sussex. It said, ``I
want you to work on the evolution of aging because I've solved the
problem of aging,'' Rose recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote back saying I didn't believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose hesitated even to think about studying aging, realizing
that it was ``famous as the rocks on which scientists dashed their
careers.'' But Charlesworth convinced Rose of the merits. Rose went
to Sussex and worked on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Charlesworth's idea was that in the time before the age of
reproduction, natural selection would insure that those who
survived would be very healthy. But once an organism reproduced,
natural selection no longer mattered, meaning that there would be
no advantage to good health.
</P>
<P>
   To show how this plays out in human genetics, Rose points to two
genes. Both kill with absolute certainty. One, which causes a
disease called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, makes children age so
fast that by 5 they lose their hair, become wrinkled and develop
cardiovascular disease. They look like little old men and women.
And they die at about 12.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Huntington's disease. Symptoms begin when people
are in their 30s or 40s, after they have finished reproducing.
They, too, die grisly deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Rose, there are only a few dozen children in the world
with progeria. There are tens of thousands of people with
Huntington's disease.
</P>
<P>
   As Rose thought about Charlesworth's theory of aging, he
realized he could test it. He would force fruit flies to reproduce
at an advanced age, by throwing away their eggs when they were
young. The only ones that would survive would be those that could
stay youthful and healthy to advanced ages. He would make natural
selection work to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Just by doing that experiment, Rose said, he has bred flies that
live twice as long as normal and that, like Dr. Kenyon's worms,
stay healthy and vigorous as they age. ``I think I have produced a
better fly,'' Rose said. ``They are athletically superior, they
have a greater ability to do work and a greater ability to survive
under stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing they do less well is reproduce at early ages.
But, Rose said, ``we probably don't care about how well we can
reproduce at age 15 to 20, which is what these organisms are giving
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he is analyzing the fly genes that make it possible, finding
that only about 100 of the 14,000 fruit fly genes are involved.
Three to 8 of the 100 genes are most important, Rose said, and he
has identified two of them, both common genes that are found in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   One instructs cells to make superoxide dismutase, proteins that
``take charged molecules that cut through DNA and RNA like buzz
saws and turn them to water.'' He will not reveal the identity of
the other gene because he has applied for a patent on it.
</P>
<P>
   The final piece of the new aging evidence comes from studies
with mice, said Dr. Richard A. Miller, a pathology professor at the
University of Michigan School of Medicine and associate director of
the university's geriatrics center.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists long ago discovered two mouse strains that were
interesting because they were small. Recently, Dr. Andrzej Bartke
at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale asked how long the
mice lived and found that they lived 50 percent to 75 percent
longer than normal. They are ``fat little mice,'' Miller said, but
they are not entirely normal.
</P>
<P>
   The gene mutations knock out cells of their pituitary glands,
preventing the animals from making hormones like growth hormone,
thyroid hormone and prolactin. These dwarf mice grow to just
one-third the normal size and are not fertile.
</P>
<P>
   But, Miller and others emphasized, the point is that a pinpoint
genetic change in mice lengthened their life spans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Miller said, another scientist, Dr. William Atchley of
North Carolina State University, has bred 15 lines of mice, looking
for variations in body size. Six turn into giant mice, six into
small mice as adolescents but some grow larger by adulthood, and
three turn into medium-sized mice. The mice that remain small live
on average 941 days and the large ones live a shorter time, with
one living just 344 days. Atchley has asked Miller to look for the
genetic changes that make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happens with dogs, Miller said, noting that small
dogs live much longer than large ones. Even small grasshoppers live
longer than bigger ones, Miller said. Is the same true for people?
``We don't know,'' he replied, explaining that properly controlled
studies have not been done.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the scientists spoke of what might lie ahead, some drew
back, nervous about public reactions and stung by their experiences
when they voiced their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Campisi of Berkeley said she recently gave a public lecture
on aging on her campus. Afterward, she said, ``a number of people
came up to me and said, `How dare you do this research? The earth
is already being raped by too many people, there is so much
garbage, so much pollution.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really quite taken aback,'' Dr. Campisi said. ``It was a
small group but they just about nailed me to the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did they fear hostility if they spoke out, but the
scientists also feared being tainted with the stain of hucksterism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group is sensitive to the inflated claims that have been
made in the past,'' said Dr. Steven Austad, a professor of zoology
at the University of Idaho. ``That makes us hesitant. We don't want
to follow in this long line of people who say, `Take this potion
and do my exercises and you can live to be 150.'''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, most of the scientists at the meeting said, the
question no longer is ``Will it happen?'` but rather ``When?''
``There's nothing bigger,'' Austad said. ``If we could do it,
there's nothing bigger. It's the big enchilada.''

<P>
   The Northern Hemisphere has been warmer in the 20th century than
in any other century of the last thousand years, according to this
reconstruction of the hemispheric temperature record by scientists
at the University of Massachusetts and the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp upward jump of the last 100 years was recorded by
thermometers at and near the Earth's surface. Earlier fluctuations
were reconstructed from ``proxy'' evidence of climatic change
contained in tree rings, lake and ocean sediments, ancient ice and
coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   The farther back in time the reconstruction is carried, the
larger the range of possible error. Where the proxy and
instrumental evidence overlap, they are in close accord.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the evidence indicates that the abrupt
20th-century warming ended a 900-year natural cooling trend. The
cooling was apparently interrupted by several sudden but brief
warming episodes in the late 11th, late 12th and late 14th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who did the reconstruction cautioned that large
uncertainties in the earlier centuries ``preclude, as yet, any
definitive conclusions'' regarding the climate before about A.D.
1400.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists were Dr. Michael E. Mann and Dr. Raymond S.
Bradley at the University of Massachusetts and Dr. Malcolm K.
Hughes of the University of Arizona. Their report is to appear in
the March 15 issue of Geophysical Research Letters.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say the dominant influence in the 20th century
has been emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon
dioxide, which is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels like coal
and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century, the average surface temperature of the
globe has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit or a little more. By
comparison, the Earth is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than in the
depths of the last ice age some 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If greenhouse emissions are not reduced, scientists predict, the
temperature will rise by another 2 to 6 degrees in the 21st
century. The best estimate is about 3.5 degrees, which would make
the Earth warmer than it has been in millions of years.

 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. George E. Brown Jr. of California, the ranking Democrat on
the House Committee on Science and the former chairman of the House
Committee on Science, Space and Technology, is the dean of the
congressional science buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 79, has been a crucial supporter of manned and unmanned
space exploration. He was an author of legislation creating an
Environmental Protection Agency, a prime mover behind efforts to
include ozone-layer protections in the Clean Air Act and an
advocate of restructuring the national weapons laboratories to meet
the needs of a peacetime economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my earliest days, I was fascinated by science,'' Brown
said on a recent afternoon in his offices on Capitol Hill, his
wife, Marta, at his side. ``Also by my earliest days, I was
fascinated by a utopian vision of what the world could be like.
I've thought that science could be the basis for a better world,
and that's what I've been trying to do all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How skilled are scientists and researchers at
presenting their case to Congress?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Very unskilled. They, generally-speaking, have too great a
faith in the power of common sense and reason. That's not what
drives most political figures, who are concerned about emotions and
the way a certain event will affect their constituency. If you're
going to work in a political environment, you have to know the
reasoning of the people you're dealing with. You have to talk to
them realistically. It does very little good to appeal to high
principle, although I would not say that's insignificant. The vast
majority of politicians think they are functioning on high
principle.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Some months ago, we interviewed Dr. Leon Lederman,
the former head of the Fermi National Laboratory. It was his view
that it may have been a mistake over the years for the scientists
to ask for funding as a part of the cold war. Do you agree with
him?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I wouldn't describe it as a complete mistake. But to
build the funding of science for the next generation on the basis
of the cold war was not well advised. That implied that science
wasn't important enough to survive without a cold war. The truth is
that science _ research and development _ is probably the most
important factor in the progress of the human race over the last
several thousand years. To base support of science on something
that ephemeral as temporary alliances and enemies is ridiculous!
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What's your take on the Czech president and
playwright Vaclav Havel's famous statement that the fall of
communism has meant ``the end'' of science?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, like many people, I've tried to understand Havel as
much as I could. I think his feeling was that science was the
ultimate expression of a neo-modernist philosophy and that it is
inherently bad because it fails to consider human emotions and
needs. It was probably his hope that once the cold war was over and
the need to have overwhelming military strength had dissipated,
that people would revert to a more benign and caring and
nonrational way of interacting.
</P>
<P>
   Havel was influenced by the fact that the Communist system
considered itself to be the ultimate in ``scientific rationalism.''
Communism was touted from the beginning as a ``scientific'' way of
looking at the problems of society. It wasn't. It probably never
could be. It represented an effort to control society with a
philosophy that was antithetical to freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You're a strong advocate of international
cooperation in science and yet, you are very critical of our State
Department. Why?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Because the State Department gives lip service to the
importance of international cooperation in science. And lip service
is about all they give. They are reducing the number of scientific
attaches at overseas missions, and scientists in policy making
positions in the State Department here in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   My problem with the State Department is that they spend most of
their time in this area in long, drawn out international
negotiations. They negotiate a new science and technology
cooperation treaty. You can almost count on their doing that
periodically with each country we have good relations with.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it's a photo opportunity for the presidents of the
two countries. Then, believe it or not, the administration doesn't
request any money to carry out the provisions of the agreement.
This isn't unique to the current administration; they all do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)The microbiologist Rita Colwell, an expert on
cholera, was named last year to be the nation's top scientist, to
head the National Science Foundation. Does her appointment
represent a sea change in the NSF's direction? (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Her appointment could portend a new direction in the support
of science in the United States. Her career and her achievements
reflect the direction science funding is going into in the future.
In other words, jobs, industrial opportunities are going to stem
more from the biological sciences than from chemistry and physics.
I see biology as being the greatest area of scientific
breakthroughs in the next generation. So, I'll probably be
supporting her in any changes she wants to make in the direction of
the NSF's funding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are you a scientist?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not. I'm a politician. I started out with a background in
science. I do have a degree in physics and did a short stint as an
engineer. I was interested in science before I even knew what
science was. I used to read science-fiction magazines when I was a
kid, stories about space travel, and that led me _ structuring my
college training in math, physics, chemistry, astronomy _ a little
bit. I've been on the science committee in the House since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)When you are putting together science policy, how
much do you rely on staff?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. How do you quantify that? I rely very, very heavily on the
staff of the House Science Committee. That's because we have some
the best people with the best scientific backgrounds available
anywhere in the country. These people are good enough to know how
to express my views, even when they don't agree with them. That's
always very helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Former Sen. John Glenn was able to parlay his
support for science into a second ride in space. Have you
considered doing the same?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. (Laughs) I've indicated to NASA Administrator Dan Goldin that
if he thinks I'm physically qualified, I'd still like to go into
space. In any event, politicians have been known to use their
influence to get things that they want.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)When you give speeches, you say that you expect to
watch the progress of the space program from your perch in heaven
some day. What exactly do you mean?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. That I think we're soon going to have the exploration of the
heavens by humans, starting with Mars and the rest of the solar
system. I think maybe Dan Goldin and a few other people have this
sense that human settlement of the universe is, beginning with
what's nearest to us, an inevitable progression of human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Where do you vote on the ``is there other life out
there'' question?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I consider the probability that there is other intelligent
life in the universe overwhelming. And we will ultimately find it.
It may not be exactly what we think it ought to be, but it will be
intelligent life. It may be far more intelligent than we are. And
that will be an interesting situation. How do we deal with a
situation where we are encountering someone with vastly superior
intellectual powers to ourselves? Now, I'm not fearful of that.
Because highly evolved life will not be looking at new life forms
as enemies. They will be looking on them as their children who need
to be encouraged to develop even further.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you see a beneficent kind of ``Star Trek''
scenario for our space future?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it will be beneficent, and I like ``Star Trek.'' The
people who write ``Star Trek'' are going through all these same
scenarios as you are. They are asking, ``What is a reasonable
rational future for the human race?'' And then they try to project
that into a television program.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I don't mean this disrespectfully, but as the most
senior member of the House, do you ever think about retirement?(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I have no desire or ambition to enter another career just to
earn more money or something like that. So my criteria for
retirement will be determined by my sense whether or not I'm
adequately fulfilling the responsibilities I have.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my colleagues, years before they retired, weren't
accomplishing anything. I don't want to do that. What I've always
wanted to do is help shape ideas about the emerging human culture,
the kind of thing that Newt Gingrich sometimes did. I think I can
make a small contribution to that, maybe not as much as Newt. But I
think I'm more on the right track. We'll see. As to my decision as
to whether I decide to retire or not, that may be conditioned on
how you write this story.

OH, MONICA, THIS IS MORE THAN WE WANTED TO KNOW
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by LEWINSKY-OTHERS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rarely, but sometimes, the publication of a book is a sad
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   It happens when a wretched sequel follows a fabulous novel
(''Texasville'' after ``The Last Picture Show''), or when a gifted
author turns out unreadable gibberish (Norman Mailer's ``Ancient
Evenings''), or when obvious fluff is accepted by hundreds of
thousands of readers who want push-button answers to their problems
(any printed prattlings of Mars-Venus author John Gray).
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of ``Monica's Story'' may be the saddest moment
yet in modern publishing.
</P>
<P>
   It is not, in any literary sense, a very good book. Andrew
Morton can put words together decently, but his role here is more
as translator than anything else. Morton is relating this tawdry
tale from a third-person perspective, but everyone who reads it
will assume Lewinsky is the author. Subjects of books do not
receive $600,000 advances from publishers.
</P>
<P>
   So the book's ``voice,'' what the reader hears in his head as
his eyes fix on the printed pages, is stilted. Morton isn't telling
us what he thinks, but what Monica thinks, and obviously what
Monica thinks is that this is her best chance to make people feel
sorry for her and mad at the same individuals she's mad at,
particularly Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   So, via Morton, Monica spills her guts, and, as great American
wit Fran Leibowitz once pointed out, for onlookers that's just
about as attractive as it sounds. We must know it all, Monica
believes, and so it includes messy details about her parents'
divorce, how future TV star Tori Spelling invited everybody in
class but Monica to her birthday party (and Michael Jackson and the
world's tiniest pony were going to be there!), how Monica could
signal Bill Clinton she ``knew the rules'' about affairs with
married men because she'd already had such an extended one with
somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   There's much detail about Monica's ongoing fixation with her
weight and the book's intended bombshell: that while involved with
Clinton she also dallied with another man, becoming pregnant with
and subsequently aborting his baby.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is sad because anyone's private life and private
demons seem demeaning when offered for examination by the rest of
the world. The definition of maturity is not doing things you very
much want to but shouldn't. So in that way, ``Monica's Story'' is
the equivalent of a kindergarten kid confessing cookie-jar sins to
Mommy and Daddy, hoping they'll still love her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica's Story'' is also sad because its very existence is
testimony to how judgmental our society has become. Like the O.J.
Simpson case, Clinton-Monica has become less a topic for discussion
than for labeling. You can have any opinion on either, and to a
large, loud-mouthed percentage of the American public you've just
proved you're a moral and intellectual loser. Like her superficial
TV interrogation by Barbara Walters, ``Monica's Story'' will be,
for too many people, just another chance to say ugly things about
somebody else. (''I can't believe this moral degenerate/spoiled
brat said that in her book!'' ``I can't believe how this poor sweet
girl has suffered so unfairly at the hands of Bill Clinton/Kenneth
Starr/Linda Tripp/the media.'')
</P>
<P>
   But I think ``Monica's Story'' is saddest because it really has
no heroes. Nobody in this book comes off well. It won't make any
Clinton-bashers think they maybe were wrong about ol' Bill, or
Starr-haters decide Ken really meant well, gosh darn it. If
Lewinsky disgusted you before you read the book, she'll still
disgust you afterward. Revealing everything has, predictably, the
same effect as revealing nothing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists are constantly striving to do good for the common
man. Now, two physicists in Britain have come to the aid of the
well-dressed one.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a marriage of science and beauty, Thomas M.A. Fink and
Yong Mao, research fellows at Cambridge University, have applied
the rigors of mathematics to that most basic of fashion statements,
the necktie knot. In the process they have come up with six new
ways of tying a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Fink, who in his more serious moments investigates protein
folding, and Mao, who specializes in colloids and polymers, felt
that the world might be ready for a new knot or two.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four in common use, the four-in-hand (so named because it
was used by drivers of four-in-hand carriages) dates from the 19th
century, while the Windsor and its smaller cousin, the
half-Windsor, were popularized in the 1930s by the Duke of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Pratt knot, which was publicized about a decade ago,
has a more recent history, and there are some people who dismiss it
as simply a reverse Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought there are probably unknown knots that have yet to
be stumbled upon,'' Fink said in a telephone interview. Their idea,
he said, was to create a mathematical framework that captured the
elements of knot-tying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficult part was converting esthetic criteria into
mathematical constraints,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who described their research in the current
issue of the journal Nature, used as their knot-tying model the
idea of a random walk on a triangular lattice.
</P>
<P>
   Such a lattice has three axes, and movements along them
correspond to the three possible movements of the business end of a
tie: to the left, to the right or to the center.
</P>
<P>
   A random walk is just that. It is as if a drunk were reeling
around a room, unable to control the direction of each step. The
trajectory that results satisfies certain mathematical properties,
making random walks useful in explaining physical phenomena like
the diffusion of gases.
</P>
<P>
   Fink and Mao used a variant, known as a ``persistent'' random
walk, in which consecutive moves could not be made in the same
direction (for the obvious reason that in knot tying, a move such
as passing the wide end of the tie to the right over the narrow end
cannot be made twice in a row). They also had to take into account
another characteristic of tying a necktie: the moves alternate
between heading toward, and away from, the shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In their work, a map of a walk corresponds to the movements of
the wide end of the tie. Using an upper limit of nine moves (based
on practical considerations of tie length) the researchers
determined that 85 different knots are possible. But once they
allowed for esthetic qualities like symmetry (whether the number of
left and right moves are equal) and balance (the order of moves,
with a good mix being better), the list narrowed to 10, including
the four in common use. Knots with even numbers of moves begin with
a move toward the shirt, while those with odd numbers start with a
move away from it (and must begin with the tie inside out).
</P>
<P>
   The key to their analysis, Fink said, was making the connection
to the idea of a random walk. ``We played around with ties in the
office, but it wasn't obvious at first that there was this
mathematical simplicity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The more they experimented (switching eventually to short pieces
of rope because it was easier to see what was going on), the more
they recognized that tying a tie was like wrapping it around the
hub of a three-spoke wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you make that realization,'' Fink said, ``it becomes
apparent that a walk on a triangular lattice captures the math
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fink wears a tie often around the office, and always at meals,
as Cambridge still requires jacket and tie in the dining halls. He
used to opt for the half-Windsor (which, he and Mao note, is really
three-quarters of a Windsor).
</P>
<P>
   But these days he often finds himself sporting one of the new
knots, known simply as ``7, 2,'' the 7 denoting the total number of
moves (but not including the final move through the loop that
cinches the knot) and the 2 denoting the number of center moves.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much of a name, Fink acknowledged. ``But when you have
six knots, you run out of names, so we haven't named any of them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers will leave that to others. Their foray into
fashion is over; now it's back to proteins and colloids and other
theoretical matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really sort of went as far as one could,'' Fink said. ``I
certainly don't think we'll be moving into bow ties.''

HOW ASTEROIDS JUMP  
 AFRICA PARTING  
 THE SKIN AS LUNGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most asteroids lead a benign existence, content to linger in
their main belt between Mars and Jupiter, following an elliptical
orbit around the Sun. But some wind up nearer Earth, where the
potential for a life-threatening collision inspires fear and film
scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how an asteroid jumps across Mars orbit to near-Earth
space has always been something of a mystery. Now, scientists from
Italy and the Czech Republic, writing in the journal Science, offer
an explanation as to how small asteroids and asteroid fragments
make the leap.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the scientists have dusted off a phenomenon first
described a century ago. It is called the Yarkovsky effect, for the
Russian engineer who discovered it, and holds that spinning bodies
warmed by sunlight gain heat in a nonuniform manner, which in turn
leads to small orbital shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Using simulations, the scientists showed that over millions of
years, the effect can cause an asteroid's semimajor axis (half the
long axis of the ellipse) to drift a few million miles or so. That
is enough to bring some asteroids in the inner part of the main
belt close enough to Mars that other forces take over, slinging the
rocks into orbits that bring them near Earth. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A more down-to-Earth drift concerns two scientists at Rice
University, who have provided further understanding of how the
Earth's crust is moving in Africa, where things are coming apart.
</P>
<P>
   The split is occurring at the East African rift, a 2,400-mile
zone that runs north-south from Djibouti to Mozambique and is
dramatically revealed in the rift valleys of Kenya and Tanzania.
The zone is the boundary of two tectonic plates, the Nubian on the
west and the Somalian on the east.
</P>
<P>
   But the boundary continues south of the zone, where there is no
evidence of rifting. The Rice scientists, who reported on their
work in the journal Nature, found the first evidence of movement in
this part of the boundary, in the Indian Ocean where the two plates
meet a third, the Antarctic plate. Their findings explain why there
is no evidence of a split south of the rift zone: in this area, the
two plates are converging.
</P>
<P>
   By studying measurements of sea floor spreading, the scientists
determined that the Nubian and Somalian plates are rotating
slightly with respect to each other, so that the same force that is
causing the plates to separate in the rift zone at a rate of about
one-quarter of an inch a year is making them come together, at a
slightly slower rate, at the southern end. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

<P>
   Who needs lungs? Not a tiny Australian mouse that in its first
days after birth breathes mostly through its skin.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse, a marsupial called the Julia Creek dunnart that lives
among cracks in the bone-dry soil of northeastern Australia,
produces offspring that are among the smallest newborn mammals
known, about one-sixth of an inch long and weighing slightly more
than half an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   The newborn mouse is not very well developed, with cartilage for
bones and a small number of spherical air sacs for lungs. In the
first few days after birth, the animal's body movements do not seem
to expand the air sacs appreciably.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not seem to matter, according to the Canadian and
Australian researchers who studied the animal and reported on their
findings in Nature. The young mouse's skin is hairless and rich in
blood, providing a convenient means for gas exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Using an apparatus that included a tiny jury-rigged mask to
cover the mouse's mouth and nostrils, the researchers measured the
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide both through the sacs and
through the skin. For mice up to about four ounces in weight,
respiration through the skin exceeded that through the lungs. As
the mice grew more, the lungs took over; at three weeks old and
about 10 ounces, exchange through the skin was about a third that
through the lungs. &QL;

   It had been over two years since my last visit to the gym, and
it was beginning to show. While on a business trip last December, I
was dismayed when I stepped out of the shower into a bathroom that
could have doubled as a shrine to Narcissus. I noticed that the
abdominal six-pack I once maintained almost effortlessly was
threatening to become a keg. The shoulders that had given my body a
horizon line, sagged so that they were hard to differentiate from
my lower trunk. And the arms, while never pythons, were once sinewy
cobras that could have belonged to a dancer. Now they were garden
snakes.
</P>
<P>
   I resolved to do something about my physical deterioration. But
one reason I quit running, rowing, walking and lifting free weights
was because of the mind-numbing repetition. And I lacked the time.
What I needed was one exercise that would address cardiovascular
fitness, grace, balance, flexibility, muscular strength and that
was also, well, kind of fun.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered seeing many years ago a demonstration of capoeira
(cop-WAY-ruh), a martial art created by Africans taken as slaves to
Brazil. A few moves, like spinning on one's head seemed straight
out of break dancing; others seemed worthy of an Olympic gymnastics
competition. Though I was amazed by capoeira's unusual method of
self-defense, what struck me was the practitioners' nimble, yet
steely bodies.
</P>
<P>
   So recently I called up the Brazilian consulate to find out
more. The first thing I learned was that capoeira was developed in
Brazil by enslaved Africans hundreds of years ago. To the casual
observer, the practice looked like innocent dance. But at a
privotal moment, when the plantation owner was alone or distracted,
the capoeirista would take that same dance-like gesture, move it a
crucial inch or two nearer the opponent's body and strike a blow
for freedom. It was also once used by street gangs, and its
practice at various times has been outlawed in Brazil. Despite the
self-defense aspect of the activity, when two capoeiristas get
together, they call it ``play.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic styles of capoeira: Angola is slower, nearer
to the ground and more closely resembles dance or slow t'ai chi.
Regional (hay-jhon-AL) is faster and flashier, with a repertoire of
swift ankle sweeps and chin-high kicks that one can easily imagine
settling a bar bet.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to attend a class in regional at the White Street
Center, a dance/exercise studio in New York City, given by Edna
Lima, 36, who has been teaching capoeira since she was 14. She is
one of the few mestrandas, or female capoeira masters, in the
world. (Capoeira is historically a male preserve, but in the
classes I observed up to half of the students were women.) Ms.
Lima, who specializes in regional style, was resplendent in
waist-long braids and an easy smile. Her gait was one of feline
grace and confidence, which I assumed emanated from growing up to
the sound of samba in Brasilia. Or perhaps it came from being not
only a capoeira master, but also a fourth-degree black belt in
karate. Yet, as the other 12 members of the class straggled in, I
noticed they had a similar gait: shoulders back, women a slight
catwalk sashay, men a subtle swagger.
</P>
<P>
   For this lesson, I wore Navy-blue sweats and a Reebok T-shirt. I
felt, but was not made to feel, like a blasphemer, as the class
came dressed, like Ms. Lima, in baggy white draw-string pants and
loose fitting T-shirts. Wearing white dates back to the
capoeiristas of hundreds of years ago, Ms. Lima said. They would
wear their best clothes, white linen, to church or to a party, and
then take part in capoeira afterward, she explained. ``If you can
keep your clothes clean _ it means you weren't taken down _ it
shows your skill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Asian martial arts, capoeira is not just a physical skill,
but also a mental exercise and a cultural and spiritual discipline.
Music, mainly chanting accompanied by percussion, is an integral
part. In our class, an assistant played the berimbau, an ancient
stringed instrument, which is the central symbol of capoeira. This
instrument, along with drums, a cowbell and tambourine, provide
accompaniment for the roda (ho-da), the last part of each class
when the students form a circle and ``play'' capoeira with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   After a 20-minute warm-up that included stretching and a little
jogging, Ms. Lima asked us to turn away from the wall-wide mirror.
``Staring at your reflection teaches you to look outside,'' Ms.
Lima later told me. ``I want my students to feel the correct body
position. It takes longer, but once they get it right, it stays
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she began calling out moves, which I came to understand
are the building blocks of the sport. The basic move is called,
ginga, which acts as a thread from one movement to the next. Most
of the movements are described by Portuguese words, though some
come from African languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginga,'' Ms. Lima says, and I watch and imitate the class: We
sink into a lunge position, arms with elbows down, forearms up to
block a phantom attack. We slide our feet on the hardwood floor,
bobbing like boxers, staying in constant motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meia lua de Frente,'' Ms. Lima says, and we swing our right
feet in a semicircle, face high. Then we go back to the ginga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rasteira de chao,'' Ms. Lima commands, and we drop to a squat,
our hands touching the floor and extend one leg full-length on the
ground, and swing it so it resembles an arc.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Lima demonstrates a move to the class, she describes what
it is used for. ``The hand is up so that it can block,'' she said.
Or ``the sweep is not a ballet move, but is to knock your
opponent's feet from under him.'' Despite the talk of knocking and
blocking, Ms. Lima explained: ``It's not a fight. In a fight there
is a winner and loser. Capoeira is a game, a game of wits. The idea
is not to outmuscle your opponent, but to outfox him. The ultimate
goal is to reach some kind of harmony.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After 45 minutes it is time to put all the parts together. The
students gather into a roda, or circle, in which the capoeiristas
``play.'' Clapping and the soft syncopation of drumming rise like
incense and fill the room. I try to add my voice to the chant in
Portuguese that goes up from our roda: ``Now is the time to show
your skills.'' As we chant, I imagine another scene. It is the
slave quarters on plantations in Brazil where capoeira is believed
to have taken root, when knowing capoeira was a matter of freedom
and captivity, life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Though I was not ready to actually ``play,'' I watched with awe
as two of my classmates faced off. With the rest of us circled
around them, each kneeled on one leg before the drums, facing one
another other. They made the sign of the cross, then tumbled and
literally cartwheeled into the center of the circle. Their eyes
were wide, smiles beamed from their faces. Despite rocket kicks
that can injure, the ``play'' looks less like mortal combat and
more like two people searching for convergence in a joyful ebb and
flow of motion. After no more than three minutes, someone from the
circle tapped one of the participants on the shoulder and took on
her opponent, tag-team style. A couple of minutes later, the
opponents switched again _ over and over for 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning I wondered if my capoeira class had been a
dream. But my thighs ached from remaining in a semi-squatting
position, and my arms and shoulders were sore from warding off the
blows of my shadow opponent. Yet I also felt a strange
exhilaration. Capoeira is indeed a one-stop discipline, and there
was an unexpected spiritual aspect.
</P>
<P>
   Once my body acclimates to capoeira, I think it will give me the
muscle strength, grace, endurance I want. But for the time being,
I'm still avoiding full-length mirrors.

IN ANTARCTICA'S FRIGID WATERS, AN EVOLUTIONARY CALDRON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Ill.)   (af)  
 By CAROL K. YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miserably cold, dark for three months of the year and crowded
with icebergs, the Antarctic seas hardly seem the sort of place to
look for an overabundance of life. But in these frigid waters at
the bottom of the earth, scientists are uncovering what appears to
be an evolutionary explosion that has generated an impressive array
of cold fish.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of years ago, thick-bodied, bottom-feeding fish swam
these icy waters almost alone. Since then, new research suggests,
these fish diverged, or radiated, into a number of evolutionary
lines, each exploiting one or another of the cold sea's surprising
variety of environmental niches.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a menagerie of cold-hardy descendants that vary in
size and shape, from small, schooling, herringlike fish to 250
pound-sharklike creatures. So far the number of Antarctic
notothenioids (pronounced no-toe-thin-EE-oids), as these fish are
known, is at 94 species and counting, with the last two species
discovered just a few months ago. (Anyone who has eaten Chilean sea
bass can claim to have sunk their teeth into a notothenioid, the
bass being one of few non-Antarctic members of the group.)
</P>
<P>
   So diverse are these fish that biologists have compared their
evolutionary radiation to that of the cichlid fishes of Lake
Victoria, a group of hundreds of closely related but highly diverse
fish that have evolved to exploit every nook and cranny of the
lake, and Darwin's finches, the similarly renowned, diverse birds
of the Galapagos Islands.
</P>
<P>
   For evolutionary biologists, the pace of discovery suggests that
Antarctica is far from the barren wasteland, devoid of noteworthy
diversity or evolutionary experimentation, that it had long been
assumed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible rate,'' said Dr. Joe Eastman, an anatomist
at Ohio University's College of Osteopathic Medicine, who caught
the new species. Trawling in the Ross Sea off a research vessel
from the National Science Foundation's polar fleet, Eastman said he
also caught two new species of another group of fish as well,
bringing the total to four new species in just ten trawls.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this makes us think we don't have quite the understanding
of the Antarctic fish fauna that we once thought we had,'' Eastman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say interest in the area is growing as scientists
working there discover evidence for what appear to be evolutionary
radiations in other groups, including crustaceans and another kind
of fish. This May, in Brazil, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research will hold its first conference on the evolutionary biology
of Antarctic organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two new notothenioids discovered, one was found living in
a sponge bed on the ocean bottom, where fish swim among sponges
that can grow two or three feet tall. The other fish apparently
feeds in shallow waters.
</P>
<P>
   These latest finds join a host of odd relatives unique to the
Antarctic. There are lethargic, dumpy-looking bottom feeders
similar to a catfish as well as fish that live a bit closer to the
surface as do haddock. There are large, streamlined predators that
have evolved a variety of sharklike features including a skeleton
made of cartilage instead of bone.
</P>
<P>
   There are fish that can only be found living beneath the solid
ice in a jumble of what look like ice chips from a hotel ice
dispenser, and icefish, so-called because of their ghostly white
appearance. To keep their blood from becoming too viscous in the
cold, icefish adapted by losing their red blood cells; now, they
must rely on the dissolved oxygen in their blood plasma.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers theorize that Antarctica's very barrenness may have
made it the perfect playground for evolutionary experimentation.
The first required element for an evolutionary radiation is a
complex habitat, ready to be filled with a new suite of species.
</P>
<P>
   The once empty Antarctic seas provided just that, said Dr.
Andrew Clarke, a marine ecologist at the British Antarctic Survey,
a government research agency in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a habitat as varied as anywhere else,'' Clarke
said, ``Underwater there are ice canyons, flat areas, steep
cliffs.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clarke said, there are fish-friendly habitats like
sponge beds similar to coral reefs and other growths known as
bryozoan gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The other required element for a good evolutionary radiation is
isolation from habitats full of other organisms, something provided
in abundance by the pattern of currents around Antarctica and its
extreme cold. The original notothenioids that swam the frigid
Antarctic waters had a lot of time and space to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The isolation makes the area ``an ideal place to study
evolution,'' said Dr. Guido di Prisco, a biochemist at the National
Research Council in Naples who studies icefish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are in stay in and those who are out stay out,'' di
Prisco added.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers speculate that an important reason the Antarctic
seas are full of notothenioids, rather than some other kind of
fish, was the fact that they evolved antifreeze proteins that keep
their body fluids liquid and prevent the fish from turning into
blocks of Antarctic ice.

   ``It's a key innovation,'' Eastman said. ``Without it, they're
dead. A lot of times it's hard to devise a test to prove that
something you think is a key innovation actually confers an
important advantage. That's not the case here.'' Dr. Arthur L.
DeVries, a marine biologist at University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign who has studied these proteins for decades, said
that over the eons their use has become very fine-tuned. Fish
living nearest to the icy surface have about twice as much
antifreeze in their blood and more copies of the antifreeze genes
in their genome than those that live in relatively warmer, deeper
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Antarctica,'' DeVries said, ``ice is the master.''
</P>
<P>
   But taking over the waters around Antarctica was not as simple
for notothenioids as beating the cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were going to design an Antarctic fish that worked
really well,'' Clarke said, ``you wouldn't start with a
notothenioid, but that's what you had.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for notothenioids is that over evolutionary time
they lost an organ known as the swim bladder, an internal air sac
that helps a fish control its buoyancy, allowing it to swim at
different depths. For notothenioids which originally lived only on
the ocean bottom, a swim bladder was unneccesary, but to invade the
entire sea, ``they would have to evolve all manner of tricks for
getting back into the water column,'' Clarke said. And that is
exactly what they did.
</P>
<P>
   In this evolutionary radiation, which produced fish species that
can live at every depth, some notothenioids have added layers of
fat as Eastman's research has shown. Because fat is lighter than
water, these fish that have packed it on are able to float
effortlessly much closer to the surface. Other notothenioids, he
has found, have evolved lighter skeletons and scales in order to
float higher.
</P>
<P>
   Laden with insulating and buoyant fat, sometimes stripped of red
blood cells and always filled with antifreeze, notothenioids, it
seems, are overburdened by the difficulty of surviving in these
waters. But di Prisco reminds one not to be too anthropomorphic.
The slightest warming for a notothenioid can be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them,'' he said, ``the Antarctic is the ideal situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers say, these fish, which have managed to blossom
in the frozen remoteness of the Antarctic may be about to come into
all too frequent contact with humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean sea bass, a very popular fish, is reaching numbers
low enough to worry conservationists. DeVries said fishing boats
are coming all the way to the Antarctic to begin fishing for the
sharklike fish known as Dissostichus mawsoni, the bass' huge,
slowly growing and extremely tasty Antarctic relation.

 &HT;    CLINTON PROMISES AID TO NICARAGUA AT START OF CENTRAL AMERICAN
TOUR
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ President Bill Clinton began a four-day
trip Monday to Central America with an emotionally wrenching visit
to an area devastated by mudslides caused last fall by Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after arriving in Nicaragua, the first leg of the trip
that will also include El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, Clinton
flew by helicopter to the Casita Volcano area near Posoltega, about
70 miles northwest of Managua. More than 2,000 people were killed
and thousands left homeless there when torrential rains spawned a
wall of mud covering 60 square miles that obliterated two small
communities, leaving only one badly damaged house still standing.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the house, Clinton and Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman walked through the heat and dust to the spot where a
6-year-old girl's body was found encased in the mud. Clinton laid a
wreath of flowers where a silhouette of the girl's body still
remains pressed into the tan dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``No picture can convey the feeling of seeing the outlines of
that small child's body by her grave and seeing the remnants of her
skeleton,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a high school where 20 students were killed -- and
another 60 students lost parents -- Clinton, speaking in Spanish,
said: ``We are brothers and we help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the bitter civil war that killed tens of thousands
during the 1980s, Clinton said, ``Not so long ago, your country
overcame a terrible war and emerged even stronger. You will
overcome this adversity as well. And we will work with you every
day until the task is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived with a planeload of school supplies and $120
million in aid allocated as part of the U.S. Agency for
International Development's budget.
</P>
<P>
   However, he came without congressional approval for a $956
million emergency relief package to Central America. Clinton wants
to provide the aid by using the federal budget surplus, but
Republican leaders in Congress want the money to come from domestic
programs including foods stamps and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also pledged to try to convince Congress to support his
effort to expand the Caribbean Basin Initiative to allow Caribbean
and Central American countries to compete, in terms of trade, on a
near-parity basis with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who was accompanied by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.
and former Florida Gov. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay, the newly
appointed special envoy for Latin America, will visit El Salvador
and Honduras on Tuesday.

LAURYN HILL MIXES STYLES IN LIVELY SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hip-hop diva Lauryn Hill commanded the Universal
Amphitheatre stage Friday like she's been doing it all her life.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Hill _ fresh from breaking records at the Grammy
Awards by winning five trophies including album of the year _ put
the packed venue in a party mood with a lively, good-natured show
that celebrated r&AMP;b's past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Fronting a crack 16-member band that included three backup
singers, three horns, two keyboardists and onetime Bob Marley &AMP; the
Wailers member Al Anderson on second guitar, Hill kept fans on
their feet for nearly the entire two-hour concert.
</P>
<P>
   Following a 45-minute opening set by popular Atlanta rappers
Outkast, the headliner, wearing a Jamaican-style skirt, hit the
darkened stage after recordings of Marley's ``Redemption Song'' and
a gospel number played through.
</P>
<P>
   Touching on soul, reggae, gospel and blues while retaining the
hip-hop flavor she's known for, Hill emphasized music over show biz
and the result was a gig that brought to mind legendary soul revues
of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key set design consisted merely of three high-school
lockers placed in the background, a reference to the between-song
skits of her multimillion-selling solo debut, ``The Miseducation of
Lauryn Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   On the opening date of three sold-out Universal shows, Hill
offered retooled versions of the eclectic album's tunes, such as a
``Superstar'' charged with gospel fervor and a ``Lost Ones'' that
evolved into a reggae-tinged rap-funk jam, along with quotes from
immediately recognizable songs by classic soul acts the O'Jays and
Stevie Wonder and current rap stars Eminem, Jay-Z and Nas.
</P>
<P>
   Hill left the stage at one point to change clothes while DJ Leon
Higgins gave an enjoyable seminar in hip-hop turntable magic _
juggling vinyl records in the air while skipping and scratching
beats on the wheels of steel.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a demonstration of rhythmic prowess by Hill's
drummer, who took solos on his kit, a set of timbales and finally
on a trio of plastic buckets.
</P>
<P>
   When the singer returned in a new outfit, a 20-minute old-school
``battle'' ensued between the musicians on Hill's side and the
turntable artists and rappers on the other, using snatches of songs
by the Jackson 5 as well as rap hits and underground classics.
</P>
<P>
   Several charged bars from Jay-Z's ``Hard Knock Life (Ghetto
Anthem)'' sung by Hill brought a roar from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Hill closed Friday's glorious show with a joyous ``Doo Wop (That
Thing)'' and encored with the Fugees' 1996 breakthrough hit, a
cover of Roberta Flack's r&AMP;b classic ``Killing Me Softly With His
Song.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The northern edge of a large winter storm will stretch from
south of Chicago to the suburbs of Pittsburgh eastward across
southern Maryland. A swath of moderate to heavy snow, about 75
miles wide, will leave more than 6 inches of accumulation Tuesday
in central Ohio and northern West Virginia. Snow and sleet will
cause difficult travel in Virginia and northern North Carolina.
Heavy snow should fall in the central Appalachians and across
northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Light snow will fall on the northern periphery of the storm from
Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota across southwest Michigan, northern
Ohio and into southern Pennsylvania. Its shield of clouds will edge
into the New York metropolitan region. A slice of sunny, but chilly
weather will cover much of New England; however, clouds and light
snow will circulate back into Maine as last weekend's storm, now in
the Maritimes, drifts toward the west.
</P>
<P>
   A new low-pressure system will develop along the Carolina coast
when a line of heavy thunderstorms reaches the Southeast shore
Tuesday afternoon. Cold air will be wedged between the southern
Appalachians and the Coast leading to a chilly rain, mixed with ice
on the Piedmont plateau. Gusty showers and a few thunderstorms will
mark a cold front's passage through Georgia and northern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure in Oklahoma will sponsor dry and milder weather in
the central and southern Plains. A cold front moving through Idaho,
Nevada and California will produce some snow inland and a few
showers in California. The Northwest will stay dull and rather
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Frozen Rochester
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, Rochester, N.Y., tied its lowest
reading ever for March on Monday morning when the mercury fell to
minus-7 degrees. The previous record for the date was minus-1
recorded in 1943. The only other occasions of minus-7 degrees
occurred last century in 1872 and 1885. The deep snowpack, now
measuring over 30 inches, combined with clear skies, light winds
and a gelid air mass to bring the record chill. Fortunately, the
next potent disturbance should pass south of western New York
Tuesday, and its shield of high clouds will keep nighttime readings
from falling to record levels.

HERBAL REMEDIES TIED TO PREGNANCY RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many women trying to become pregnant are careful to avoid
ingesting any substance that might impair their fertility or damage
a developing embryo. According to a new study, several popular
herbal remedies should be added to the list of substances that
could have detrimental effects on men as well as women and could
interfere with conception or a healthy pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the widespread belief, often fostered by advertising
copy, that herbal preparations are ``natural'' and ``drug-free,''
those that have druglike effects in the body do in fact contain
potent chemicals that act like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And, like many prescription and over-the-counter drugs that are
known to be unsafe before or during pregnancy, some herbal remedies
may also be expected to interfere with normal reproductive
function. This expectation prompted researchers at Loma Linda
University School of Medicine in Loma Linda, Calif., to explore the
effects of four popular herbs on eggs and sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Their findings were published in the current issue of Fertility
and Sterility, the journal of the American Society for Reproductive
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the herbs, St. John's wort, Echinacea purpura and
Ginkgo biloba, had ill effects on either eggs or sperm or both. The
damage, the researchers said, included a reduced ability of sperm
to penetrate an egg, changes to the genetic material in sperm, poor
sperm viability and, in the case of St. John's wort, mutation of
the tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1, a change that can increase the
risk of breast and ovarian cancers in women who inherit the mutated
gene.
</P>
<P>
   Of the herbs tested, only saw palmetto, which is commonly taken
by men to relieve the symptoms of an enlarged prostate, did not
damage eggs or sperm in the doses tested. But even saw palmetto
reduced the viability of sperm that were exposed to the herbal
preparation for seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The journal's editor, Dr. Alan H. DeCherney, said, ``This is a
very important study that could provide important information to
patients suffering from infertility.'' He added, ``The growing
popularity of these herbal products means we must examine all their
possible effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers emphasized that their study, which was conducted
in the laboratory on both human sperm and hamster eggs, indicated
only a potential risk to those who take the herbs in question. They
said it was possible that no untoward effects would occur in people
who used the herbs in the usual recommended doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our knowledge, no data exist on concentrations of these
herbs in semen or serum,'' the team, headed by Dr. Richard R.
Ondrizek, noted. Thus, it is not possible to say whether the herbal
doses tested represented an amount that may actually reach the eggs
or sperm in people who use these preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the remedies, which are sold over the counter as dietary
supplements, are not required to undergo premarket tests for safety
or accuracy of dosage.
</P>
<P>
   In the studies, the researchers examined the effects of two
concentrations of herbs, one high and one low, but in both cases
the amounts that eggs and sperm were exposed to represented a tiny
fraction of the recommended dosages on product labels.
</P>
<P>
   For echinacea, ginkgo and saw palmetto, the researchers examined
amounts that represented one-thousandth and one-hundredth of the
recommended daily doses. For St. John's wort, they also looked at a
concentration of one-millionth of the recommended dose.
</P>
<P>
   Two types of studies were conducted. In one, hamster eggs that
were prepared for fertilization were exposed to various
concentrations of the herbs and then inseminated with sperm. Sperm
were unable to penetrate the eggs exposed to higher doses of St.
John's wort and penetration was impaired by the higher doses of
both echinacea and ginkgo.
</P>
<P>
   In the second study, human sperm were exposed for seven days to
different herbal concentrations. This long-term exposure to St.
John's wort and echinacea resulted in significant changes to the
sperm and reduced their viability.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the prolonged exposure to St. John's wort caused
some mutations.

 &HT;    Entertainment Weekly On Campus: R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe talks
about fashion.
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Rudoph has worries. Not only is the FBI on his tail, but
the folks at Plaza Video in Murphy, N.C., would like to have a word
with him. It seems that Rudolph rented ``Krull the Conqueror'' on
Jan. 30, 1998, the day after he allegedly bombed an abortion clinic
in Alabama. Rudolph had to disappear for a while, and the tape is
now overdue to the tune of $975.20 in late fees, according to Tony
Horwitz, who writes about the Rudoph manhunt in this week's The New
Yorker ($3). Horwitz reports on the effort to bring Rudolph to
justice and the radical groups in southwestern North Carolina that
have embraced him as a folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Up with Michael: Michael Stipe, R.E.M. front man with a
fondness for wraparound skirts, says his greatest weakness when it
comes to clothing is ``keeping them on.'' Stipe is on the cover of
Entertainment Weekly's quarterly On Campus publication, a free
24-page handout that will be inserted into school newspapers at 100
colleges and universities, including Georgia State and Emory (but
not the University of Georgia, R.E.M.'s old stomping ground). Stipe
says he relates to the Peanuts character Pigpen, ``because I
attract dirt magnetically. So my clothes, no matter how beautiful
or expensive or sublime, always get trashed really easily.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Teach your children: Termed a ``review of academic life,''
Lingua Franca ($4.95) sounds painfully dry but is actually quite
approachable. The March issue includes an engaging meditation on
the mindlessness of secondary school and the occasional reprieve
that comes in the form of an irresistible teacher. Mark Edmundson
was a disaffected conformist jock at Medford High School near
Boston until Doug Meyers came there to teach philosophy. In ``My
First Intellectual,'' Edmundson tells how Meyers, an
unprepossessing, droopy-mustached rebel, turned him into a thinker
and a writer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Listen to your Mother: The latest issue of unapologetically
leftist Mother Jones ($3.95) offers a panoply of readable goodies,
including a quick interview with ``Simpsons'' creator Matt
Groening, a visit with pie-throwing protesters the Biotic Baking
Brigade (who recently pied San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown) and a
thoughtful piece on how the supporters of convicted cop killer
Mumia Abu-Jamal are missing the point by insisting on his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Teen zines: Critics of magazines for teenaged females consider
such periodicals to be primers for anorexia and low self-esteem.
But a new generation of teen magazines promises to offer a more
inclusive, more humane view of this manipulated demographic, and
they deliver, more or less. ``The only teen fashion magazine for
girls all shapes all sizes all cultures'' is the way Girl ($2.95)
describes itself. The current issue features most of the familiar
staples of the genre, with features on prom dresses, makeup,
``amazing hair rules'' and little known facts about Leonardo
DiCaprio. But not all the models are rail thin and there are nods
to cross-culturalism, such as a visit to Buenos Aires. Jump ($2.95)
tells girls to go ahead and order seconds, because guys like girls
who like to eat. We suppose that's an improvement over the endless
diet advice. Sure there are the typical features _ ``Does your
romance need rehab?'' and ``how the famous have fun'' _ but these
are balanced with views of girls as something more than a date
waiting to happen, including profiles of a 14-year-old one-legged
sprinter who runs with an orthotic device and a 16-year-old judo
champ.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lordy, Lordy, Barbie's 40.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, the corporation that owns Barbie, calls today her 40th
``anniversary.'' No mention of the b-word.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not fooling anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie's reached midlife, all right. She's having some nips and
tucks _ plastic surgery on that famous plastic body. Last year, she
got a face lift. She even has a tattoo _ albeit a not-so-daring
butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   She's also hanging out with a cooler crowd, including one new
pal with a pierced nose.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Barbie's no longer the teenage fashion model who, in
1959, strutted into America's rec rooms in high heels and a
zebra-striped bathing suit. Even before reaching the Big 4-0, she
had multiple face resculptings, sports cars and wedding dresses
(although she's never actually married). She's changed careers 75
times. She's done disco and played doctor, changing friends and
fashions to stay abreast of the cultural Zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's over the hill just yet. In an industry where toy
fads pass as quickly as you can say ``pogs,'' she's got legs.
American girls own an estimated eight Barbies on average, and more
than 1 billion dolls have been sold worldwide. The six top-selling
computer games for girls in 1998 were Barbie titles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a hint of trouble in Pink Paradise appeared last year, when
retailers cut back orders for the doll. At the same time, Mattel
announced that some Barbies would be getting breast reductions and
tummy augmentations to give them a more realistic figure. This
year, a new line of Barbies aimed at older girls will come with a
different name, Generation Girls, and packaging that's hipster
black rather than preschool pink. For the first time, Mattel is
giving these Barbies an age: 15.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what 40 looks like?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have changing interests and are no longer playing with
toys as long as they used to,'' says Marianne Szymanski, editor of
Toy Tips magazine. ``Twenty years ago, girls played with Barbies
until age 12. Now it is difficult to find a 9-year-old who is still
interested _ e-mail and Internet surfing has replaced that.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's a golden gal to do?
</P>
<P>
   Barbie's got a bit part as a tour guide in ``Toy Story 2,'' due
in theaters around Thanksgiving. Yet the Valley of the Dolls can be
hard on an older actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this town . . . at 40 you are over the hill and
opportunities are limited,'' deadpans Dr. Toni Bernay, a Los
Angeles psychologist. ``It's going to be hard for her, because what
she's been focused on in the past is what she looks like, and
that's going to fade rapidly. I presume she's going to be 40 for
the next 30 years, like the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Harsh words, but not as harsh as the contents of a jokey e-mail
making the rounds of Barbie collectors. Bifocals Barbie or
Hot-Flash Barbie, anyone? How about the services of the Reroot
Queen, a for-real Las Vegas flight attendant who fluffs up balding
Barbies?
</P>
<P>
   Zack McDonald of Atlanta, a hairdresser and collector, wants her
to stay glamorous. ``She's always been a model, which is cool,'' he
says. ``Maybe a Victoria's Secret Barbie, there you go.''
</P>
<P>
   But not a B-cup Barbie. ``If you took that away from Barbie,''
he says, ``you would completely lose the doll and the point.''
</P>
<P>
   And about this ``40th anniversary'' business. According to the
10 commandments for preserving babedom, Barbie should never lie
about her age, says Linda Stasi, co-author of ``Boomer Babes: A
Woman's Guide to the New Middle Ages'' (St. Martin's, $12.95). ``My
mother always told me that the 40s are the sexiest time of a
woman's life,'' Stasi says. ``When you hit this decade, for the
first time, for me at least, I really hit my stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's putting its money on surgery, however. It just gave
Barbie a younger-looking face. ``We just felt she needed to be more
contemporary, more up-to-date,'' says spokeswoman Lisa McKendall.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Burton of Tucker, who makes a living customizing Barbies
for collectors at $200 a pop, would like to see the doll return to
her roots. She should wear the kind of sophisticated outfits that
real women might wear _ no ball gowns, no pink pumps. And just one
more wedding dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, Ken either needs to pee or get off the pot,''
he says. ``If he can't commit by now, come on.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe they'll load their offspring _ like the two sets of
identical twins that sister Skipper baby-sits _ into the back of
the pink Ford Explorer and set off on a reality trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let her be a woman,'' Burton counsels. ``She's not a little
girl anymore.''

 &HT;    Current players, coaches react to DiMaggio's death
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Bobby Cox's most vivid memory of Joe DiMaggio
didn't come from his early childhood, when DiMaggio was wearing
Yankee pinstripes. It wasn't the time the extremely private
DiMaggio agreed to have his picture taken with Cox, then a rookie
for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   It came less than 20 years ago, when Cox was eating at a New
York deli and looked out the window to see a gray-haired DiMaggio,
dressed in a pin-striped suit, cause a commotion on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped the city,'' Cox said. ``Everybody ran out of
restaurants, hotels. He looked like some elder statesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   News of DiMaggio's death saddened those around Tiger Town Monday
morning. A moment of silence was requested in DiMaggio's honor
before the 1:05 p.m. start of the Detroit-Atlanta spring-training
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Class guy,'' Cox said. ``All I think of Joe D. is class. A
very private guy, commanded respect somehow without asking for it.
A different type of guy. Real dignified, graceful, all his
mannerisms were graceful. He was different from any superstar I've
ever known. His presence was that of a statesman, a president. . .
. He was truly a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves hitting coach Don Baylor, who played for the Yankees
1983-85, got acquainted with DiMaggio at old-timers' games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of all the players, when he walked in the locker room, he
was the guy everybody had their eyes on _ young players, old
players,'' Baylor said. ``Pete Sheehy (the Yankees clubhouse man
for 60 years) stopped what he was doing when Joe D. came in. He sat
down over in the corner, and I know they talked about old times.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said he always liked to ask Sheehy which of the Yankees
players was the best he ever saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I could get it out of my mouth,'' Baylor said, ``it
was, 'Joltin' Joe.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was a pall-bearer at Sheehy's funeral. He said DiMaggio
didn't show up until the last possible minute and sat on the back
row, presumably to keep the attention off himself and on Sheehy,
where it belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a special, special guy,'' Baylor said. ``He had such a
dignity about him.''
</P>
<P>
   To Braves players from the New York area, especially those of
Italian heritage, DiMaggio's legend was huge, and the loss was
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hero, especially in the Italian community,'' said
Braves second baseman Tony Graffanino, who grew up in Amityville,
N.Y. ``I never saw him, but I grew up hearing about him. His
parents were immigrants and poor, and here he was a legend in
baseball. Everybody looked up to him. . . . Fifty-six games? That's
crazy. To hit in every game for two months?''
</P>
<P>
   Braves minor-league shortstop Mark DeRosa thought it was amazing
that DiMaggio was able to hit safely in 72 games during a 73-game
stretch in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you hear he hit safely in 72 out of 73 games,
you have to be amazed at what he was able to accomplish,'' DeRosa
said. ``But you never got a chance to really see the guy for
yourself. I just appreciate what he did growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   DeRosa said DiMaggio was a name he heard throughout his
childhood in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my grandfather's favorite player,'' DeRosa said.
``Being in a 100 percent Italian family, Joe D. was constantly
talked about. No one ever compared to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be remembered, that's the good thing,'' Cox said.
``There are names that just never go away. Two of them are Ruth and
DiMaggio.

POWER DRESSING ON THE PLAYING FIELD HMO PATIENTS: TO SUE OR NOT TO
SUE GETTING BEYOND THE BIRDS AND THE BEES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa.)   (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Cherny played a mean game of volleyball at the Empire
State Games in Syracuse a few weeks back. A 36-year-old day care
provider from Kingston, N.Y., she spiked hard and jumped high. And,
she says, she owes it all to her shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe her. In a five-year study, Dr. William
Kraemer, the director of research and a professor of applied
physiology at Pennsylvania State University, tested hundreds of
male and female athletes of all ages, abilities and fitness levels
and found that wearing form-fitting shorts, also known as
compression garments, increases an athlete's power output and
endurance, two important measures of athletic performance, by an
average of 12 percent and by as much as 30 percent. The study,
which tested athletes after they jumped and ran, was sponsored by
DuPont, the maker of Lycra Power garments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of the research was to understand the relationship
between compression and muscle performance,'' Kraemer said. ``We
hypothesized a relationship existed because of the anecdotal
reports from athletes who had tried compression garments and liked
the way they felt and performed.''
</P>
<P>
   That stretchy, form-fitting fabric exerts pressure on muscles,
he said. That pressure, in turn, increases blood flow and helps
flush away lactic acid and other fatigue-causing waste products
quickly and efficiently. And, he added, the pressure reduces muscle
vibration, another major cause of muscle fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The garments also seem to be effective, according to the study,
because of improved proprioception, or awareness of body movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a sense of where your joints and muscles are,'' said
Dr. Gilbert Gleim, the director of Research at the Nicolas
Institute for Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma at Lenox Hill
Hospital in New York City, who was not involved with the garment
research. ``This is feedback you don't normally get when you wear
loose clothing.''

<P>
   Q. Should patients be able to sue their health maintenance
organizations?
</P>
<P>
   If somebody is hurt as a result of the improper decisions of an
HMO, he should be able to sue that HMO and be compensated for the
damage. The purpose of the right to sue is to serve as a deterrent
against conduct by an HMO that is in reckless disregard of a
patient's needs. The Erisa (Employee Retirement Income Security
Act) statute, enacted in the 1970s, keeps states from establishing
causes of action and keeps patients from suing in state courts. But
the statute also says a person can sue in federal court. If the
patient prevails, though, he can get only the service that was
originally denied or its dollar value.
</P>
<P>
   The statute made a great deal of sense when it was enacted.
Then, people had very little in terms of HMOs and managed care, and
disputes between consumers and insurance companies occurred after a
service was provided. The contest: Will the insurance company pay?
Today, the contest is whether a patient gets the service to begin
with and whether he will be denied needed health care. The harm is
considerably greater. Liability is not retribution; I view it as
deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   _ RON POLLACK, executive director, Families USA Foundation
</P>
<P>
   The issue of coverage denial drives the liability debate. Now,
while every denial is viewed as a significant problem, it is
important to recognize that there are times that patients are hurt
by medical services that are not the right ones for them. Some have
estimated this to be higher than 30 percent of the total health
care delivered in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, we saw a report from a House of Representatives
committee finding that 12,000 Americans died as a result of
unnecessary surgeries, with the unnecessary surgeries numbering 2
1/2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, not covering a service that is recommended by a
physician is the right thing to do, because that service may be
harmful to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care was invented to try to bring better medical
evidence into private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Our ability to do that would be severely compromised if each
time a physician recommended a treatment, and we questioned it, the
case ended up as litigation in court. That does not sound like
quality care to me.

   BEHAVIOR
</P>
<P>
   Many children as young as 10 years old want to know more about
sex than just where babies come from, but parents often shy away
from discussing sexuality, according to a national survey conducted
by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Children Now, a children's
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Topics that may have parents blushing even in discussions with
teen-agers have filtered down to children ages 10 to 12. In a
random-sample telephone survey of 161 children in that age group
and 447 parents, more than 40 percent of the children said they
wanted to know how to handle peer pressure, how to know when they
were ready for sexual activity and how alcohol and drugs might
affect their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet half of the parents surveyed said they had never talked to
their children 10 to 12 years old about readiness and 46 percent
had never discussed either how to handle pressures or how drugs or
alcohol influenced choices.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent said they had never talked to their
preteen-agers about how to avoid pregnancy or sexually transmitted
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as easy as just giving the birds-and-the-bees talk,
but getting down to the nitty-gritty of talking about the
pressures,'' said Dr. Richard Gallagher, director of the Parenting
Institute at the New York University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Experts interviewed said the Lewinsky matter had increased
sexual awareness, although talk about sex among younger children
had been increasing gradually. ``Today discussions begin as early
as third grade,'' said Dr. Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, professor of child
development and education at Columbia University's Teachers
College, who has studied puberty issues over the last 25 years.
``My guess is if you talk to 12-year-olds, they could tell you
exactly about the different sex acts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this survey is suggesting,'' Dr. Brooks-Gunn concluded,
``is that after you have had the sex talk, mechanics and all, it is
time to start talking about peer pressure and how to help kids
withstand that pressure.''

SENATE CONSIDERS REGULATING SWEEPSTAKES MAILINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eustace Hall, age 65, is a retired medical
technologist. But the Brandon, Fla., man told a Senate panel Monday
he is now working at AT&AMP;T to pay off thousands of dollars in debts
he incurred in an effort to win millions in sweepstakes promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Hall became so upset while trying to tell his story before the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that his daughter
Angela had to read most of his prepared testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Hall estimated that he has spent from $15,000 to $20,000 since
1992 in sweepstakes purchases with American Family Publishers and
other promoters. He said wanted to win so that he could contribute
toward his daughter's law school education. She eventually
graduated from law school anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always made purchases because I believed that through
purchases, I increased my chances of winning,'' Hall said. ``The
sweepstakes always used phrases that made me think I was a winner
and that the prize was guaranteed and bonded.''
</P>
<P>
   Most sweepstakes mailings contain information advising
recipients that ``no purchase necessary.'' However, that disclaimer
usually is printed in small type on the back of a cover letter
telling Hall and millions of other Americans that ``you are a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweepstakes companies aim to entice people to buy magazines,
compact disks and other products by offering contests that give
people the chance to win prizes like cars, stereos and millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, age 46, chairman of the
subcommittee on investigations, said she couldn't read the small
print on letters promoting sweepstakes. And Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., age 64, said he couldn't make out the small print even
with reading glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Collins and Levin are authors of legislation that would ban
companies from telling people they are winners when they haven't
actually won anything. The bill also would require promoters to use
much larger print in describing such details as the long-shot odds
of winning a contest.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing from Hall and five other people who told stories
of their parents or parents-in-law spending thousands of dollars to
purchase magazines and other items, Levin said he is considering
adding a provision in the bill that would require companies to
clearly state that making a purchase does not increase a person's
odds of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Karol Carter, from Troy, Mich., said her father is upset that
she testified before the Senate because ``he is concerned that I am
ruining his chances of winning a... sweepstakes when he, and I
quote `am getting close to winning.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said her father's problem began about 15 months ago when
he first entered a sweepstakes. He is now inundated with contest
mailings.
</P>
<P>
   She said one sweepstakes letter stated, ``You Allan Carter are
guaranteed to receive a brand new automobile or cash award...there
is no mistake and your award is waiting to be claimed.'' It
required that Carter send in $14.98 to have the title of a
Chevrolet Malibu transferred to him. Carter sent in the money, but
never got the car.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``gimmick'' that entices seniors to purchase magazines,
Carter said, is the fact that there are different return mailing
addresses for a contestant not making a purchase and for a
contestant making a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Patti McElligott, of Tyler, Texas, said she had her
father-in-law's mail forwarded to her when he moved into a
retirement center last year. She said she received as many as 20
magazines a day, including duplicates of the same magazine that he
had ordered through Publishers Clearing House and Reader's Digest,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   She later discovered canceled checks totaling more than $50,000
made out to American Family Publishers, United States Purchasing
Exchange and other firms that operate sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Bernstein, vice president of marketing services for
American Family Enterprises, said in testimony prepared for a
hearing Tuesday on sweepstakes, that the primary focus of their
mailings is to sell magazines. The company uses Ed McMahon and Dick
Clark to promote its sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of our mailings is not to convince people they've
won a sweepstakes, but rather to be excited about the possibility
of winning and to consider our products,'' she said. ``The vast
majority of people who receive our mailings understand them and do
not believe either that they have won or they must order to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein also said 11 of the past 17 ``grand prize'' winners
were people who did not purchase any magazines.
</P>
<P>
   American Family Enterprises, commonly known as American Family
Publishers, recently made changes to its sweepstakes promotions
including allowing people to cancel magazine subscriptions at any
time and receive a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said she has some concerns about some of the wording
in the Collins-Levin legislation but supports standards for the
entire industry. Officials from Publishers' Clearinghouse have also
said they support national standards.

LIVING WITH NO STOMACH

 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Q. (italics)Can a person live without a stomach?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. ``The stomach is not an essential organ for human survival,''
said Dr. Paul Basuk, a gastroenterologist at New York Weill Cornell
Center. Many people have survived and adjusted to total or partial
surgical removal of the stomach because of diseases like stomach
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stomach is a reservoir that allows us to eat the quantity
of food we want, emulsify it and pass it gradually into the small
intestine,'' he explained. ``Without a stomach, a person cannot
consume the quantity of food one was able to before and usually
must have more frequent and smaller meals.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an initial uncomfortable transition period after the
loss of the stomach, Basuk said. It may take months, but the person
can adjust to the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The operation to remove a stomach is called a gastrectomy. It
can be either partial or total. Doctors often place an external
feeding tube directly into the small intestine, a procedure called
a jejunostomy, to provide consistent nutrition during recovery and
acclimatization.
</P>
<P>
   If a person without a stomach eats too much, it is very quickly
apparent because of an uncomfortable feeling of being very full.
Other possible problems include diarrhea, a condition called
dumping syndrome in which nutrients are moved too rapidly into the
small bowel and upward reflux of bowel contents.

THEY COULD WRITE A BOOK
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies LEWINSKY-BOOK) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``Monica's Story,'' Monica Lewinsky is only the first major
player in the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal to come out with a book.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff, who used Linda Tripp as a key
story source, has his book-length recollections coming out in
April. From there, it's Bob Woodward in June and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't know yet is how many Monicagate
celebrities-of-the-moment also will get their stories into print.
Whether Tripp and the others will get book deals will depend in
large part on how well ``Monica's Story'' sells. Should it do well,
these people are most likely to publish books:
</P>
<P>
   KENNETH STARR: The good news for the special prosecutor, if he
hopes for a seven-figure publishing contract, is that fully
one-third of the American public thinks of him as an icon. The bad
news is two-thirds don't. He's still controversial enough for some
publisher to sign him up.
</P>
<P>
   LINDA TRIPP: If there's one thing the world agrees on, it's that
everybody dislikes Tripp. Major publishers would be concerned about
a publicity backlash. Tripp's only hope is that some smaller
publishing house will decide it's got nothing to lose, and that
even bad publicity is better than no publicity.
</P>
<P>
   HENRY HYDE: The Illinois congressman is the perfect author for a
book detailing the perspective of the House prosecutors in
Clinton's Senate trial. He'd appeal to the same audience that made
books by Dan Quayle and Rush Limbaugh bestsellers. Expect a
big-name publisher to announce a Hyde book deal soon.
</P>
<P>
   KATHLEEN WILLEY: If Monica's book sells, it's a near cinch we'll
hear in print soon afterward from another woman who claims she
encountered Clinton's advances. Willey's a good bet; she'd be
considered attractive enough for the TV-author circuit, where
glamour is every bit as important as on ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   NEWT GINGRICH: Don't laugh. Newt will resign his congressional
seat soon, and there's no reason now for him to observe
statesmanship in book form.
</P>
<P>
   BOB BITTMAN: Who? Well, Bittman was Starr's day-to-day manager
during the Lewinsky investigation. He has now left Starr's staff,
and he undoubtedly has lots of dirt to dish on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   BILL CLINTON: Someday he'll write his memoirs, and, like Richard
Nixon before him, he'll give his side of the bad times _ but in a
presidential way, which means it will somehow be deadly dull. A big
house will publish it, but there won't be any real juice to it.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY CLINTON: The woman every publisher wants. The first lady
can have it all from any publisher, even if she says nothing but,
``I wish my husband hadn't done it.'' The only reason we might not
see it is if she decides to run for the Senate, in which case
decorum and a stiff upper lip will mean more than a $5 million
advance and financial relief from those tacky Whitewater legal
bills.

TO BARBIE ON HER 40TH BIRTHDAY ...

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Babs,
</P>
<P>
   I can't sing it loud enough or often enough. Happy Birthday,
dear Barbie, Happy Birthday to you.
</P>
<P>
   Forty! Can you believe it? My voice fairly squeals when I say
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry I can't be there for your big party tomorrow. I'm sure Ken
and all your friends at Mattel will do something spectacular. I can
just imagine it _ Barbie's 40th-birthday-and-face-lift party.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe you should take this opportunity to rethink your
personal style, have your colors done. All that pink is a little
over the top for a woman of your age. I mean, what if people start
mistaking you for a Mary Kay salesperson?
</P>
<P>
   Now, you know, I'm only suggesting this because we've been
friends since the '60s. But the first thing I'd recommend is taking
about 2,000 of your ball gowns to the consignment shop. Next, buy
some nice black slacks. They're very slimming. Like you've ever
worried about your figure _ but you will. Oh, how you'll worry.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to go is your waist, or your hips, or your waist
AND hips. Before you know it, you'll be fat and sweating like a
stevedore.
</P>
<P>
   While you're ditching the dresses, lose the shoes. Those spikes
you've worn for the past four decades have permanently crippled
your feet. If you don't know a good podiatrist, I do, and I can get
you a good deal. Let me warn you though; she'll tell you to get
down off those high heels and into something sensible.
</P>
<P>
   Once you wear flats, it's amazing how easy it is to quit wearing
mascara and eyeliner. You have to abandon the eyeliner anyway. You
have no choice; it starts creeping into the little lines and
crevices and overnight you'll see why they call them crow's feet.
After that, who needs eye shadow?
</P>
<P>
   Soon, you'll discover the true beauty of the lipstick 'n'
leggings look. Put a Bedazzled sweat shirt on the top, and you'll
never miss the Bob Mackie gowns or the cruel underwear you needed
to wear with them.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to simplify. Trade in your sports car. It sends out
the wrong message. Maybe a minivan would be more appropriate. Or at
least a Volvo station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of trade-ins _ Haven't you wondered why Ken has never
come through with the Big Rock? Catch the clue bus. He's either
gay, or he has some serious commitment issues.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably more than you want to deal with right now. I
know turning 40 has all this extra baggage attached to it. Like
dealing with your diminished sex appeal, and the fact there is no
Baby Barbie, and how you never found a satisfying career. You've
worn so many hats in your day, I can't believe you never found one
you liked.
</P>
<P>
   But let me tell you, dear Babs, getting past 40 is positively
liberating. The playing field levels dramatically as experience
makes up for all sorts of imagined shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you've never had any shortcomings, have you? But now,
you're 40. Next year, you'll be Over 40. Can you feel the ground
leveling? You would if you were wearing flats.
</P>
<P>
   Have a wonderful birthday, Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   Love, Gaile

 &HT;    CONTROVERSY OVER PENTAGON ANTHRAX VACCINE WON'T GO AWAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington category
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Army Spec. Joseph Jones, 22, of Austin, Texas, says
he ``had a bad feeling'' about the anthrax vaccine he was required
to take a year ago when the Army sent him to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the medic I didn't want to take it, but he said, 'It's
okay. Take it and don't worry about it,' '' Jones said Friday in a
telephone interview from the Georgia Army hospital where he was
sent because of a succession of increasingly serious medical
problems that he and his family are convinced were caused by the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said other Army officials gave him an even stronger reason
for taking the controversial vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in formation and they announced to everyone that if we
refused to take it they would give us an Article 15 (misconduct
proceeding) and the MPs would hold us down while they gave it to us
anyhow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones took the vaccinations, four of them, beginning March 17,
1998. And a day or two after receiving each vaccination, he said,
he became ill, beginning with ``flu-like symptoms'' following the
first and growing progressively worse with subsequent shots.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the aches and fever, Jones said the shots have
been followed by sometimes bloody diarrhea, terrible headaches and
occasional fainting spells. He recently was moved from Ft. Benning,
Ga., where his outfit is based, to Eisenhower Army Medical Center
at Ft. Gordon, near Augusta, Ga. Scans revealed a ``mass'' behind
his sinuses and surgery has been scheduled to drain it, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Army doctors don't believe Spec. Jones' medical problems have
anything to do with the anthrax shots. His mother, Mrs. Theresa
Jones of Austin, responds to that with a mother's logic. ``He went
in the Army healthy, and he's sick now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she also is concerned that the Army is about to
discharge her son for medical reasons and leave him with the burden
of lingering medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Food and Drug Administration-approved label for
the vaccine, fewer than 0.2 percent of recipients of the material,
which is manufactured from non-virulent strains of anthrax
bacteria, experience ``malaise and lassitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chills and fever have been reported in only a few cases,'' the
label states. ``In such instances, immunization should be
discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is one of 209,949 persons -- including Secretary of
Defense William Cohen -- who had received at least one of the six
injections required to induce immunity to anthrax as of last week,
said Pentagon Office of Health Affairs spokesman Jim Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Before the five-year immunization campaign is over, 2.4 million
active duty and reserve personnel are to be vaccinated against the
dread disease. Military personnel are being vaccinated because of
concern in the Defense Department about the emerging threat of
biochemical warfare. Government officials have stated anthrax was
being used by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and some terrorist
organizations to in efforts to develop biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the campaign did not begin until the safety, purity
and potency of the vaccine had been verified.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' case has been picked up by activists who have declared an
Internet war on the Defense Department anthrax immunization
program. In addition to posting Food and Drug Administration
documents that raise questions about the practices at the Michigan
plant where the vaccine was produced, opponents publicize stories
like those of Spec. Jones and promote the views of some scientists
who question the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they have promoted the causes of active duty
personnel who have been punished for refusing to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Air Force announced that an airman at Travis Air
Force Base in California was being discharged under ``other than
honorable conditions'' for disobeying a direct order to take the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Airman First Class Jeffrey Bettendorf had a ``choirboy'' service
record but was given an excessive punishment because top Air Force
officers were angry over the publicity his case generated, his
lawyer charged. Typically, troops that refuse to take the vaccine
are punished with a demotion and a month's restriction to base when
they refuse the vaccine a first time, said the lawyer, Mark Zaid.
He said the second refusal often results in a general discharge
under honorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Zaid said he receives several calls a week from U.S. military
personnel around the globe asking him what will happen to them if
they refuse to take the vaccination series. Some Air Force Reserve
pilots in California and Connecticut have chosen to get out of the
reserves instead of taking the shots.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine was manufactured in a Lansing, Mich., laboratory
originally owned by the Michigan State Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said a routine inspection of the facility in 1996
found ``good management practices'' violations in connection with
production of vaccine in general and anthrax vaccine in particular.
As a result, the FDA notified the department that it intended to
revoke the federal license of the facility, then known as the
Michigan Biologic Products Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The state presented a plan for correcting the deficiencies, said
John Taylor, an official of the FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs. A
follow-up visit found some of the problems had been corrected and
some had not, Taylor said, so the FDA notified the state that the
facility still was not in compliance with federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months later, when we visited the site again, we were not
about to note with any accuracy how much progress had been made,
simply because the company had stopped manufacturing anthrax
vaccine,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the state has sold the Michigan Biologic Products
Institute to a private company, Bioport Inc., which is headed by
retired Navy Adm. William Crowe Jr., a former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Theresa Jones is convinced that other mothers of
military personnel are hearing of problems with the vaccine and
don't know where to turn. She urged them to study an Internet site,

 &HT;    Current players, coaches react to DiMaggio's death
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Bobby Cox's most vivid memory of Joe DiMaggio
didn't come from his early childhood, when DiMaggio was wearing
Yankee pinstripes. It wasn't the time the extremely private
DiMaggio agreed to have his picture taken with Cox, then a rookie
for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   It came less than 20 years ago, when Cox was eating at a New
York deli and looked out the window to see a gray-haired DiMaggio,
dressed in a pin-striped suit, cause a commotion on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped the city,'' Cox said. ``Everybody ran out of
restaurants, hotels. He looked like some elder statesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   News of DiMaggio's death saddened those around Tiger Town Monday
morning. A moment of silence was requested in DiMaggio's honor
before the 1:05 p.m. start of the Detroit-Atlanta spring-training
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Class guy,'' Cox said. ``All I think of Joe D. is class. A
very private guy, commanded respect somehow without asking for it.
A different type of guy. Real dignified, graceful, all his
mannerisms were graceful. He was different from any superstar I've
ever known. His presence was that of a statesman, a president. . .
. He was truly a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves hitting coach Don Baylor, who played for the Yankees
1983-85, got acquainted with DiMaggio at old-timers' games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of all the players, when he walked in the locker room, he
was the guy everybody had their eyes on _ young players, old
players,'' Baylor said. ``Pete Sheehy (the Yankees clubhouse man
for 60 years) stopped what he was doing when Joe D. came in. He sat
down over in the corner, and I know they talked about old times.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said he always liked to ask Sheehy which of the Yankees
players was the best he ever saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I could get it out of my mouth,'' Baylor said, ``it
was, 'Joltin' Joe.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was a pall-bearer at Sheehy's funeral. He said DiMaggio
didn't show up until the last possible minute and sat on the back
row, presumably to keep the attention off himself and on Sheehy,
where it belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a special, special guy,'' Baylor said. ``He had such a
dignity about him.''
</P>
<P>
   To Braves players from the New York area, especially those of
Italian heritage, DiMaggio's legend was huge, and the loss was
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hero, especially in the Italian community,'' said
Braves second baseman Tony Graffanino, who grew up in Amityville,
N.Y. ``I never saw him, but I grew up hearing about him. His
parents were immigrants and poor, and here he was a legend in
baseball. Everybody looked up to him. . . . Fifty-six games? That's
crazy. To hit in every game for two months?''
</P>
<P>
   Braves minor-league shortstop Mark DeRosa thought it was amazing
that DiMaggio was able to hit safely in 72 games during a 73-game
stretch in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you hear he hit safely in 72 out of 73 games,
you have to be amazed at what he was able to accomplish,'' DeRosa
said. ``But you never got a chance to really see the guy for
yourself. I just appreciate what he did growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   DeRosa said DiMaggio was a name he heard throughout his
childhood in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my grandfather's favorite player,'' DeRosa said.
``Being in a 100 percent Italian family, Joe D. was constantly
talked about. No one ever compared to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be remembered, that's the good thing,'' Cox said.
``There are names that just never go away. Two of them are Ruth and
DiMaggio.

 &HT;    International soccer: History of tensions looms large for U.S.,
Mexico
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neither coach has experienced it, and a majority of players on
both sides will be new to it. The increasingly fierce rivalry
between the U.S. and Mexico, especially when it's renewed in
southern California, has become one of the most acrimonious in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   And when they take the field for the 40th time against each
other Saturday in the U.S. Cup in San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium
(3:30 p.m., ABC), the Americans once again will feel like strangers
in a strange land.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., unbeaten in four matches under coach Bruce Arena,
hasn't been able to turn out supporters to match the pro-Mexican
fans living in California. Last year, American players were
showered with debris as they emerged from the tunnel of a packed
Los Angeles Coliseum in the finals of the CONCACAF Gold Cup won by
Mexico.

   England: Le Saux Redux
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea's Graeme Le Saux and Robbie Fowler of Liverpool are
being cast as equally culpable for an ugly incident last week that
has dominated the sports pages in Britain. LeSaux knocked Fowler to
the ground after the latter made obscene gestures in a match. An
unidentified friend of Le Saux said last week the player has been
labeled, falsely, of being gay because he collects antiques, visits
bookshops and cafes and reads the left-leaning Guardian newspaper
instead of tabloids. . . . The day after setting up both goals in a
2-0 Champions League win over Inter Milan, Manchester United
midfielder David Beckham became a father. Beckham and fiancee
``Posh Spice,'' a.k.a. Victoria Adams, gave birth to a son,
Brooklyn Joseph, named, presumably, because the lad was conceived
while the couple visited New York. . . . Tough-guy Vinnie Jones,
red-carded 13 times as a player, is retiring to turn his attention
to an acting career. Jones, 35, is getting good reviews for his
role as a debt collector in the new film ``Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels.'' . . . Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear will miss
the rest of the season after suffering a heart attack before a game
last week. . . . Manchester United and Chelsea tied 0-0 in the F.A.
Cup on Sunday and will replay the match Wednesday. Holders Arsenal
advanced with a 1-0 win over Derby County.

   Italy: 'The Animal' returns
</P>
<P>
   When he disappeared during Carnival last month, Brazilian enigma
Edmundo ignored the fury from his Fiorentina bosses for missing
several critical Serie A matches. Now, he won't be going back home
any time soon, not after receiving a 4 1/2-year prison sentence for

LAMAR ALEXANDER HOPES TO BE THE LAST GOP CANDIDATE STANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who plans to
announce his candidacy Tuesday, has a scenario for wrapping up the
Republican 2000 presidential nomination that goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   It is March 2000. His better-known GOP rivals _ such as Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, two-time cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole and
conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan _ have either failed to
take off or fizzled in mid-flight.
</P>
<P>
   With a boost from the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary _
political soil he has tilled virtually non-stop since 1996 _
Alexander is poised to grab the nomination. He clinches it with a
better-than-expected showing on Super Tuesday, March 7 _ primary
day for a dozen or so major states including California and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy? Or maybe just crazy like a fox in a plaid shirt,
Alexander's favored garb in the 1996 campaign that now for the most
resides in his closet.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old candidate, who will officially launch his
campaign at a rally in his home town of Nashville Tuesday, insists
it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an air of unreality about'' perceptions that he has no
chance, Alexander said in a telephone interview. ``Mrs. Dole
resigned from (her job as president of the American) Red Cross, and
within one day she was ahead of Governor Bush in the polls in New
Hampshire. That's how rapidly things can change. They can also
change when I do better than expected in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Alexander has taken 60 or more trips to Iowa and
has enlisted former Gov. Terry Branstad to head his effort there.
Iowa is the first to play its card in next year's political
sweepstakes, holding caucuses on Feb. 7. The primary in New
Hampshire, where Alexander is similarly dug in, follows the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will really get a significant bounce coming out of
Iowa and New Hampshire is problematic. With those crucial dates 11
months away, Bush and Dole already have sprinted to commanding lead
positions in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bush and Dole, Alexander must compete with Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, and magazine
publisher Steve Forbes for the votes of Republican fiscal
conservatives and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Buchanan, Forbes, former Vice President Dan Quayle,
former Reagan administration aide Gary Bauer, and Sen. Robert
Smith, R-N.H., are vying for GOP social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's strength, to the extent that he has any, resides
partly in his resume _ governor of Tennessee from 1978 to 1987,
president of the University of Tennessee from 1987 to 1990, U.S.
education secretary from 1991 to 1993 _ and partly in his ability
to stay afloat in the political money race.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has close to $1 million in the bank and says he can
raise another $14 million this year. That's short of the $20
million most political pros say a candidate needs to weather the
primary season, but it is nonetheless respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander sees another hidden asset: His affable-but-bland
personality. ``I am myself,'' he said. ``Maybe after President
Clinton's electrifying charisma, we'll want charisma based on words
and deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls his surprising third-place finish in Iowa in 1996
when, he says, for a short time the media treated him ``like some
Beatle.'' The lesson? Charisma ``has a lot to do with whether
you've won the last caucus ... I've got to be myself. My goal is to
bring out the best in our country, not to be some swashbuckling
leader on a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's not bashful when it comes to criticizing the
competition. When Bush described himself as a ``compassionate
conservative,'' Alexander accused him of mouthing ``weasel words''
even though Republican National Chairman Jim Nicholson has called
for a moratorium on intraparty attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander styles himself the ``education candidate'' who has the
most experience on the issues of ``broken families and substandard
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He is downplaying his one-time support for dismantling the
Department of Education. In speeches, he talks about greater pay
for teachers, flexibility for disciplining students, ending tenure
for poor-performing teachers and ``fixing schools.''
</P>
<P>
   On the family front, he wants an end to the ``marriage
penalty,'' which forces married people to pay higher taxes than
singles with the same income, and a boost in ``national
leadership'' that helps parents teach children right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he will start a 2004 effort if he loses next year,
Alexander laughed. ``I'm planning on running for re-election in
2004,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But he also talked about his ``rich, full life'' apart from
presidential campaigning, how he plays the piano and intersperses
business dealings with book authorship (``Lamar Alexander's Little
Plaid Book,'' 1998, Rutledge Hill Press) and hosting a cable
television series on ``great schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Although 1996 was his first campaign, he says he first became
interested in the presidency after Clinton's election in 1992.
Alexander scoffs at suggestions that he has been running too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who have run longer and harder than I have are
named Nixon, Reagan and Bush,'' he said. ``They're ones who have
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander recalled how he lost his first gubernatorial race in
1974, only to win in 1978 after a 1,022-mile campaign walk across
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have forgotten American history if they think
that's odd,'' he said.

`SHAKESPEARE: A LIFE': SHAKESPEARE IN FACT (BUT ALAS, NO LOVELY
VIOLA) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes are at the end of the review) 
(Matt Wolf is London theater critic for Variety) 
 (HLW)  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever else one thinks of ``Shakespeare: A Life,'' the latest
and by no means last contribution to the Bardic industry, the
timing of Park Honan's impressively researched biography cannot be
faulted. When better to reconstruct the goings-on of the newly
named Man of the Millennium? His singularity, after all, doesn't
just reverberate afresh in the pages of Harold Bloom's
``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human,'' an assessment as
spiritual as Honan's is factual. Hollywood, too, has enlisted in
the cause with ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which has been nominated
for 13 Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that Honan speaks of ``our William'' with
the affectionate familiarity appropriate to someone who is part of
the collective imagination. As one reads this painstaking
re-creation of a life whose facts seem forever to be unavailable or
in dispute, it's difficult not to imagine scenes from the film,
with the doe-eyed Joseph Fiennes, quill ever at the ready, charging
about the intrigue-laden, plague-infested London that Honan so
thoroughly animates. But there's no Viola De Lesseps on offer here
(notwithstanding entirely separate musings on Shakespeare's
possible homoerotic infatuations) and, to be honest, there's not a
lot of drama, either.
</P>
<P>
   On Honan's evidence, it was both Shakespeare's blessing and his
curse to exist at an ever-self-effacing remove from the enmity,
turbulence and sheer nerve that marked contemporaries like Greene,
Marlowe and Jonson. ``He found it wise to be `open' and simple,''
Honan writes of his subject, emphasizing the glover's son as a team
player: ``It is clear enough that Shakespeare coveted the normalcy
of being a group member,'' free from the ``quirky egotism'' that
defines many a life in the theater. In 1596, he was being viewed as
a mere ``functionary, or a minor cause of a troupe's ability to
endure.''
</P>
<P>
   But who wants to hear of a theater person divested of quirks and
ego, an apparently normal guy possessed of far-from-normal
abilities? Given Shakespeare's benignity and his ``calm, fine
control,'' one can hardly be surprised that the book's real
dramatic juice resides in talk of the plays, which may explain (not
for the first time) why Shakespeare the man is never as interesting
as Shakespeare the poet-dramatist.
</P>
<P>
   At times, and not for want of countless statistics and figures
down to the last penny of Shakespeare's arrears, he once again
seems to elude his biographer. (Anthony Holden, the English
journalist and author, will deliver his own version in the fall.)
Phrases like ``incomplete, uncertain evidence,'' ``no sign that''
and ``only a possibility'' testify to the eternally elusive nature
of a life that some have famously made an industry out of denying
altogether in favor of the Oxford-Bacon school of authorship that
posits Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, or Francis Bacon in
place of Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   It may be in the spirit of triumphant reaction, then, that Honan
gives us what facts (or, at one point, furlongs) he has in all
their minute detail, whether they be the measurements of structures
built for the royal entry into London of Shakespeare's new patron,
James I, in 1604 or the nearly exact dimensions of the Anne
Hathaway cottage in Stratford that remains on view to visitors.
Larger revelations, and they exist, generally pertain to
Shakespeare's earlier years and to his domestic life.
</P>
<P>
   Filling gaps in a chronology that has come down to us over time
mostly as a variably opaque set of lawsuits and wills, Honan links
young Will to one ``William Shakeshafte,'' an ``angular and
graceful'' teen-ager who may have traveled north to Lancashire
where he found work as an unlicensed schoolmaster. Back home in
Stratford, Shakespeare's mother, Mary, is said to be literate, just
as Shakespeare is reported to have gained an understanding into the
violence that courses through his plays from having purchased his
Stratford home from a man later murdered by his son.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, perhaps inevitably, the direct links between writer and
work are what fascinate most, starting with the news that
Shakespeare the actor preferred to take on the smaller (and senior)
parts in his plays: Old Adam in ``As You Like It'' or the Ghost in
``Hamlet.'' Honan writes intriguingly of actual analogues or
sources for certain parts right through to the bear that gives
chase in ``The Winter's Tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere there's something delicious about imagining the
specifically Jonsonian traits that Shakespeare folded into his
portrait of Ajax, the ``beef-witted'' Greek commander in ``Troilus
and Cressida.'' But as befits an emeritus professor of English at
Leeds University in the north of England, Honan is on far happier
ground as critic than as chronicler, especially once he veers away
from hackneyed generalizations about an entire bequest (``His works
transcend their time'') and moves through the canon play by play.
</P>
<P>
   Honan is particularly good on ``The Merchant of Venice,'' citing
an ``evasively estheticized'' last act that even during the
Renaissance could be seen to back away from issues and debates
raised earlier in the play. And to describe the ``lurid charm'' of
Lady Macbeth is to encapsulate character with a precision and
lucidity absent from vague encomia later on to Shakespeare's mind
as ``a complex thoroughfare of contradictions and extreme
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Shakespeare: A Life'' the last word on its subject?
Unlikely, insofar as it engages with a reconstruction that runs
from Anthony Burgess, A.L. Rowse and Samuel Schoenbaum, among many
others, straight back to John Aubrey's fascinatingly piecemeal
glimpses from the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   If Shakespeare's plays are transcendent, perhaps there exists
some essential way in which their author is, too. Or maybe no
portrait of a man capable of so much can correspond to the myth
surrounding him. For all its scrupulous scholarship, this book
leaves no doubt that the quest for the genius at its heart will go
on.

VETERANS CONFRONT NEW FOE _ HEPATITIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George Gramlich admits he wasn't too careful about
coming in contact with blood during his stint in the Army,
especially during his year in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a firefight, we used to drag our wounded out,'' said
Gramlich, bemused at the notion of hygiene during the chaos of
jungle warfare. ``Nobody knew anything about no hepatitis C.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramlich, a 50-year-old Sicklerville, N.J., man who won two
bronze stars for valor during his service in Southeast Asia in
1967-68, is learning plenty about the liver disease now.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it has a long latency period. He knows the disease
could be contracted through transfusions and exposure to infected
blood. He knows the incidence of hepatitis was high in Southeast
Asia and that no effective test for it was available until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it can disable and kill. And he knows he has it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the war was over,'' he said. ``It is not for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramlich is one victim of a growing epidemic of hepatitis C
among U.S. veterans. New studies show that veterans, particularly
Vietnam-era veterans, appear to be at much higher risk of carrying
the virus than the population at large.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control estimates that hepatitis C
infects slightly less than 2 percent of the population _ about 3.9
million people _ and active military personnel seems to have an
even lower incidence. But patient surveys at Department of Veterans
Affairs hospitals have found an infection rate between 10 percent
and 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In raw figures, the number of cases at VA medical centers has
risen from 6,100 in 1991 to 18,850 in 1994 to more than 21,000
counted last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming a veterans' disease,'' said George Duggins,
president of the Vietnam Veterans of America. ``Many of our
veterans who received no obvious injuries in the war are now
discovering that they are carrying this virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial symptoms of the disease can be mild and difficult to
detect. They include fatigue, low-grade fever and muscle and joint
aches. But it can progress into cirrhosis, liver failure and
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation over why Vietnam veterans are prone to this strain
of hepatitis centers on the blood supply of the time and combat
transfusions, contact with blood spilled by comrades, unsanitary
living conditions, prevalence of the disease in the region, sexual
activity, even tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   The VA recognizes the epidemic and is moving to contain it.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the agency announced it was establishing two
hepatitis C research centers in Miami and San Francisco to
coordinate research and treatment. Agency medical authorities also
said they would make available to veterans with hepatitis C a
complex new drug treatment regimen at costs of up to $12,000 to
$15,000 per patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a policy decision that we are going to
aggressively identify patients and deal with the problem,'' said
Dr. Kenneth Kizer, VA undersecretary for health. ``Frankly, I think
we are taking a more aggressive approach than any other health care
system I have seen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But veterans advocates and some members of Congress are worried
there won't be enough money available for treatment that could cost
the financially stretched VA up to $500 million next year. They
want the agency to take another step _ give any veteran who suffers
from hepatitis and meets certain other criteria the ``presumption''
of infection during time in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans with such ``service-connected'' status receive top
priority for treatment and qualify for disability benefits.
Advocates say many veterans with hepatitis have been denied such
service-connection in the VA system since they are often unable to
prove how they got hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say this is the day and time we got it,'' said
Gramlich, who has been denied any disability for his hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a proof problem for veterans,'' agreed Rep. Vic
Snyder, D-Ark., a physician and author of a House measure that
would establish the presumption.
</P>
<P>
   The potential cost of the bill has not yet been estimated, but
any new expenses for the VA will be hard to absorb given its
financial situation. Veterans groups are already attacking the
Clinton administration budget proposal for the agency, saying it
falls as much as $3 billion short.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the hepatitis bill say it could actually save the VA
money in the long-run by eliminating hepatitis disability appeals
from the backlogged VA system and treating the disease earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alternative is much more costly treatment of end-stage
liver disease and the associated complications, or other disorders
_ treatment often provided at federal government expense,'' said
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, chief sponsor of the bill in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans warn there are other costs as well, including spreading
the infection to the general public. If it goes unchecked in
veterans, it can be passed to veterans' relatives and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just us,'' said Terry Baker, a Vietnam veteran
undergoing the new drug therapy. ``It is our children and our
wives. We don't want to see our country infected by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramlich already gave hepatitis to his wife, Lauren, before he
knew he had it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks my heart,'' he said.

 &HT;    Even in the end, DiMaggio called his shots
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He died exactly the way he lived. So when Joe DiMaggio left
Monday to join Ruth, Gehrig, Mantle and the rest of those
pin-striped greats in the baseball heavens, the Yankee Clipper did
so quietly and gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't surprising. It was appropriate that during the latter
portion of DiMaggio's three-month stay at a Florida hospital before
his release in January, he adjusted the breathing tube in his
throat to tell listeners, ``I want to get the hell out of here and
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, you figured DiMaggio would get his wish without
objection from doctors or deity, because nobody ever told DiMaggio
what to do. Folks didn't want to. They didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was hitting in 56 consecutive games or demanding to
be the last person announced at old-timers' games as ``the world's
greatest living ballplayer,'' DiMaggio operated on his terms.
</P>
<P>
   Death had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nothing ever will kill what DiMaggio left behind, and
that is his nearly unparalleled presence for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Among the living, only Muhammad Ali matched DiMaggio's ability
to transcend sports in making the bulk of society feel something at
the mention of his name. Otherwise, DiMaggio was the stuff of his
contemporaries in other fields, such as John Wayne, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis and even Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Charisma isn't developed. Charisma just exists, and charisma was
Joseph Paul DiMaggio. It was true right down to his elegant way of
walking, even near the end of his 84 years.
</P>
<P>
   I've mentioned this before, but it is worth repeating,
especially since those eternal words of Simon and Garfunkel
(''Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?'') keep dancing in my head.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few gah-gah moments I've had as a journalist came
during the latter 1970s, when I encountered DiMaggio preparing to
leave an elevator at the Oakland Coliseum. It was just the two of
us. He looked to his left and then to his right for something or
somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Then DiMaggio nodded, and then I nodded, and then we both moved
inside the elevator, where I promptly shared a wonderful lifetime
with a legend for only a few seconds. Not only was DiMaggio tan and
fit, but his eyes sparkled, and every silver hair was in place.
</P>
<P>
   We never spoke. I mean, what do you say to Joe DiMaggio? Even
so, in addition to Simon and Garfunkel, I had a lengthy
conversation in my mind with DiMaggio about everything from those
pin-striped legends to his brief marriage with Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Now DiMaggio is gone. You won't know as much after what we'll
experience during the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   We'll see endless black-and-white film of his glorious 13 years
with the Yankees. There will be stories about his days with Monroe,
about his stint as Mr. Coffee, about his insistence to remain in
the shadows when the majority of the world wanted him to do more
than grin and nod.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'll officially lay DiMaggio to rest in his native San
Francisco, but it won't matter. After all, Joe, even in death, with
an impeached president, and with a fluctuating stock market, and
with terrorist threats everywhere, a nation still turns its lonely
eyes to you.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I'm a pretty little fellow,'' sings Matthew
Broderick, alone on the stage of the Lyceum Theater, and at that
moment, he certainly is. His eyes shut, his voice sweet and liquid,
the open-faced Broderick has never looked or sounded so much the
choirboy, as he croons a phrase from the dusty sentimental favorite
``Mighty Lak' a Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Maternal instincts should be running riot in the audience. But
since Broderick's character has just committed, and obviously
relished, a brutal murder, responses are a tad more complicated.
Yes, he's a coldblooded killer, and yes, he's a pretty little
fellow of inexhaustible charm. One doesn't rule out the other, and
Broderick, in a beautifully balanced performance, gets to have it
both ways.
</P>
<P>
   So, for that matter, does this utterly disarming revival of the
1935 melodrama ``Night Must Fall,'' which opened last night under
John Tillinger's direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Welsh-born playwright Emlyn Williams translated a lifelong
obsession with grisly murder cases and a more recent one with a
charismatic drifter he had befriended into this tale of a
psychopathic hotel bellboy and the women who love him. It was, by
the standards of the day, strong meat. ``As one chap to another,
don't you think it's just the teensiest, weensiest bit unpleasant
here and there?'' teased Noel Coward in a letter to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the very point of ``Night Must Fall,'' in which
Williams starred both in London (where it was a hit) and New York
(where it wasn't), was that the unspeakably unpleasant can become
compelling spectator sport. In the age of the posthumous stardom of
JonBenet Ramsey, it's hard to argue that things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with its conspicuously well-made dramatic architecture and
groaning lines like ``Come away, my darling'' and ``You can't stay
in this house tonight!'' Williams' potboiler would seem to invite
only campy revivals. That's why the greatest thrill of this new
incarnation, even counting that moment in the second act when the
whole audience screams, is in seeing how a mothball-scented
property can be turned anew into agile and seductive theater.
</P>
<P>
   With a little script tweaking, a subliminally surreal visual
presentation and a stylish cast that understands the difference
between a wink and a grimace, this production from Tony Randall's
National Actors Theater works engagingly on two levels. It starts
off as a spooky fun house, with the obligatory creaks and shrieks.
But as it continues, it makes respectful breathing space for
Williams' considerations of the magnetic appeal of the lurid and of
the idea that extraordinary evil can take the most ordinary forms.
</P>
<P>
   The show isn't perfect: it doesn't quite bring off its principal
climaxes, and it overexaggerates some of its comic servant
business. But it's a surprisingly delicate and compelling treatment
of the sort of material usually delivered as ghoulish parody.

 NEW YORK: ghoulish parody.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tone is established with an interpolated prologue in which
thunder claps, a scream resounds, a shadowy figure is perceived
through a window and, voila, you have the basic alphabet of a
specific suspense genre, the kind on which Hollywood once thrived.
The designer James Noone's representation of a comfortable sitting
room in a woodland house in Essex, England, is correspondingly
executed entirely in black and white, as are the period costumes by
Jess Goldstein. (Note for Broadway trend spotters: The same palette
is found in Trevor Nunn's current production of ``Not About
Nightingales.'') And spine-tingling music (by David Van Tieghem)
underlines ominous revelations.
</P>
<P>
   The implicit message is that you have entered a passe world in
which even unsavory subjects were presented with comparative
innocence, in terms as simple as black and white. Our relation to
that world would seem to be roughly that of the characters onstage
to ``East Lynne,'' the famously stilted 19th-century novel that is
being read aloud to an elderly woman when the play begins.
</P>
<P>
   That woman is the hypochondriacal Mrs. Bramson (Judy Parfitt),
who might as well have ``victim'' stamped on her forehead. She is
peevish, rudely dictatorial to her servants and restless young
companion, Olivia (J. Smith-Cameron), and rolling in cash she
insists on keeping at home. Enter, smiling, young Dan (Broderick),
a chipper Irish lad (Welsh in the original) who has impregnated
Mrs. Bramson's maid, Dora (Seana Kofoed), and been summoned to
account for himself.
</P>
<P>
   He does; he stays. His arrival happens to coincide with the news
that a woman has disappeared from the hotel where he works. And
what is in that mysteriously sealed hatbox he brings with him?
</P>
<P>
   You can probably imagine what follows, down to the moment where
Mrs. Bramson finds herself all alone in her big, dark house. But in
between Broderick, Ms. Parfitt and Ms. Smith-Cameron enact an
uneasy dance of attraction and repulsion that occurs less in clear
black and white than in gray zones.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was partly sending up the fascination with sensational
acts of violence, that mix of prurience and displaced guilt that is
here amusingly embodied by the reactions of Olivia's patient,
ineffectual suitor, nicely played by Michael Countryman, and Mrs.
Bramson's cook, Patricia Kilgarriff. But Williams was also
seriously acknowledging the lure of the amoral, reflected in
Olivia's increasing attraction to a man she believes to be a
murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith-Cameron has the toughest role, a sort of eroticized
Nancy Drew part, but she plays it with a canny directness, lightly
flavored with an acerbic artificiality. Ms. Parfitt, who played a
similar role in the film ``Dolores Claiborne,'' is wonderful,
bringing an unseemly glimmer of sensuality to her disagreeable
imaginary invalid's relationship with Dan. And when she sinks into
rabid fear, Ms. Parfitt conveys it so harrowingly that you start to
feel tainted for having rooted for her demise.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick's terrifically smart, fully engaged portrait of a
sociopath may unnerve audiences much as Robert Montgomery,
traditionally known as a suave romantic lead, did in the same role
in the 1937 movie. There has always been a feral cunning and
confidence in Broderick's stage and screen portrayals of precocious
boys and boyish men.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he wears that cockiness as the gleaming shell on a murky,
swirling interior. This boy can be as smooth as Astaire, but when
the shell cracks, what you see is not a cold executioner but a
thwarted, egocentric child, and it helps explain Olivia's
continuing protection of a deranged murderer.
</P>
<P>
   What Williams was asking, in his deceptively jocular way, was
that we own up to the part of us that will always be drawn to
darkness. The all too charming Broderick makes it unsettlingly easy
for us to do so.
</P>

 &HT;    FAMU, Duke may be historical mismatch
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest margin of victory in the NCAA Men's Basketball
Tournament occurred in the first round in 1963 when eventual
champion Loyola of Chicago beat Tennessee Tech by 69, 111-42.
</P>
<P>
   We might have a similar mismatch in store Friday when No. 1 Duke
(32-1) meets MEAC champ Florida A&AMP;M (12-18) in the first round of
the East Regional in Charlotte (7:40 p.m.). Duke brings a 27-game
winning streak into the game and has beaten 19 ACC opponents by an
average of 24 points. The Blue Devils are a prohibitive favorite to
cut down the nets in St. Petersburg on March 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers, on the other hand, lost their first 10
regular-season games and were 7-18 before winning their last five,
including the MEAC Tournament and the automatic bid. Seeded seventh
in the conference tournament, they beat the top three seeds to get
in.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin George, FAMU's 6-10 center, said his team will not be
intimidated by Duke and its wealth of high-school All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go in there and play with a lot of heart and
courage,'' said George, who will guard Duke's Elton Brand, a strong
candidate for national player of the year. ``We have to play our
game and go at them like they're regular guys.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Valpo?
</P>
<P>
   Delaware (25-5), which plays fifth-seeded Tennessee in Friday's
first game in Charlotte, sees itself as this year's Valparaiso, the
Cinderella team that made it to the Sweet 16 in 1998. Last week,
coach Mike Brey, a former assistant at Duke, had scenes from the
movie ``Hoosiers'' spliced into the scouting tape of Drexel, which
Delaware played for the America East tournament championship. The
Blue Hens won 86-67. Delware is hoping for a better showing than it
had in last year's tournament, when Purdue crushed the Blue Hens by
39.
</P>
<P>
   Hoosier hysteria
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ``Hoosiers,'' the state of Indiana placed four
schools in the NCAA Tournament: Indiana, Purdue, Evansville, and
Valparaiso. Purdue is the most fortunate to get in; the
Boilermakers enter the tournament with five losses in its last six
games.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA to MSU: Play somebody
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State won seven of its last 11 games, and three of
those four losses were to Arkansas and Auburn, both of which made
the tournament. Still, the Bulldogs were left out of the NCAA field
with a 20-12 record. The message: Play a decent non-conference
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs had an RPI of 90 and a schedule ranking of 142.
Their non-conference schedule included Arkansas-Pine Bluff,
Belmont, Centenary, and Tennessee-Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the way we finished and the people we got beat by. . .
. I don't
</P>
<P>
   understand why we weren't selected,'' first-year coach Rick
Stansbury said. ``We won 20 games in one of the best leagues in the
country.''Phelan at the dance
</P>
<P>
   Mount St. Mary's Jim Phelan has won 800 games in his 45 years as
a coach. On the career-victory list, he trails only Dean Smith
(879), Adolph Rupp (876) and Clarence ``Big House'' Gaines (828).
</P>
<P>
   But Phelan, now 69, will be making only his second appearance in
the NCAA Tournament on Friday when his team goes against top-seeded
Michigan State in the Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan, who became coach in 1954, has spurned numerous offers to
leave the tiny school in the hills of western Maryland. He says he
has no plans to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my wife had her way,'' he said, ``I'd be doing it until I
was 85, just so I'd be out of her way at home.'' Tony Barnhart

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of the major religious right organizations,
whose interests greatly overlap but are not always identical, are
in a cranky mood these days. They have good reason to be.
</P>
<P>
   Confused by a Republican presidential field overloaded with
social conservatives, they have been unable to unite behind a
single candidate and may lose their electoral clout. Frustrated by
a GOP-controlled Congress that has not lived up to their
expectations, they are turning against their past political patrons
and groping blindly for new ways to find support.
</P>
<P>
   Like spoiled children, they are seriously considering packing up
their marbles and leaving the establishment's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party should get so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The season of the religious right's discontent comes after a
remarkable two decades in which they captured control of the GOP
apparatus in several states and powerfully influenced the elections
of hordes of U.S. senators and representatives. Yet the social
conservatives have not become more than a political irritant. They
never managed to translate their narrow concept of morality and
self-righteousness into public policies that could win majority
support nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   And new questions have arisen about just how active their
activists continue to be these days. Some of their leaders are
saying the darndest negative things.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the Senate to convict President Clinton and his
continuing public support in the polls are the immediate cause of
their disgust with government and the country. But many in the
Christian Coalition, Focus on the Family and other right-wing
groups are also finally conceding privately that widespread voter
resistance to their dearest causes may be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The light dawned slowly after the Republicans seized control of
both houses of Congress in 1994. The religious right had been
promised the moon if only the Democrats were defeated. Demands
included constitutional amendments to balance the federal budget,
outlaw all abortion, ban flag desecration and allow school prayer
in addition to granting public subsidies for private schools and
eliminating the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   But most Republican lawmakers did not give their issues a
priority, and their agenda is dying. For instance, efforts to end
abortion held up dozens of unrelated legislative initiatives yet
did little but add to the partisan acrimony that infects Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   After voters last fall cut back the GOP House majority, the
shocked Republican Party examined its soul and its image. Most
party leaders think that moving toward the middle and away from
rigid ideology is essential, which is one reason that
inclusion-preaching Texas Gov. George W. Bush immediately became
the heavy frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right also got a message but is not sure just what
it is or what to do about it. The movement's leaders have always
been torn between those willing to compromise to gain a voice in
GOP policymaking and those who insist on going down in flames to
make a statement for their principles. That division is now more
intense and public than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious way to regroup and reassert their influence is to
unite behind a presidential candidate who can articulate their
basic agenda and move it ahead. They had tentatively coalesced
behind Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, but he decided against the
race. Now they confront a range of right-wing candidates who pander
madly to their views but lack popular appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The best known is television commentator Pat Buchanan, a former
Richard Nixon aide who was a conservative favorite when he ran
unsuccessfully in 1992 and 1996. But even Buchanan wins only 4
percent support in this week's Newsweek poll, and many Republicans
feel his past campaigns denouncing so-called cultural
permissiveness have contributed to two successive GOP White House
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The others look like losers too _ Lamar Alexander, still a
nobody after seeming to run for an eternity; Gary Bauer, a lobbyist
who has never been elected to public office; Steve Forbes, best
known for being rich and wanting tax breaks for himself; Rep. John
Kasich of Ohio, a federal budget maven whose figures don't compute;
Dan Quayle, a former vice president and perpetual laughing stock,
and Bob Smith, a New Hampshire senator with delusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Cabinet officer
Elizabeth Dole, Bush represents the GOP establishment that believes
in coalition over confrontation. It's those three against the many
right-wingers. In such a sea of candidates, it is unlikely a
divided religious right can deliver a crucial bloc of votes.
</P>
<P>
   This confusion has given credence to grumblings about pulling
out of the political system altogether. Free Congress Foundation
President Paul Weyrich set off a firestorm when he suggested that
the religious right give up trying to take over the government and
other existing institutions and instead build a new, parallel
world.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions the creation of new systems that would coddle
conservatives and protect them against wicked ways. Since he
loathes the public schools that are the backbone of American
education, he touts schooling pupils at home so parents can
directly control what their children learn.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Weyrich is mushy about the separate environment in
which he would have religious purists live. Although he is tapping
into a mood of discouragement, this is loony tunes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican Party should encourage such fantasy. The
minute the religious right walks away, the GOP is free at last to
reach out to the rest of the country. And perhaps win the
presidency.

   WASHINGTON - Army Spec. Joseph Jones, 22, of Austin, Texas, says
he ``had a bad feeling'' about the anthrax vaccine he was required
to take a year ago when the Army sent him to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the medic I didn't want to take it, but he said, 'It's
okay. Take it and don't worry about it,' '' Jones said Friday in a
telephone interview from the Georgia Army hospital where he was
sent because of a succession of increasingly serious medical
problems that he and his family are convinced were caused by the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said other Army officials gave him an even stronger reason
for taking the controversial vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in formation and they announced to everyone that if we
refused to take it they would give us an Article 15 (misconduct
proceeding) and the MPs would hold us down while they gave it to us
anyhow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones took the vaccinations, four of them, beginning March 17,
1998. And a day or two after receiving each vaccination, he said,
he became ill, beginning with ``flu-like symptoms'' following the
first and growing progressively worse with subsequent shots.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the aches and fever, Jones said the shots have
been followed by sometimes bloody diarrhea, terrible headaches and
occasional fainting spells. He recently was moved from Ft. Benning,
Ga., where his outfit is based, to Eisenhower Army Medical Center
at Ft. Gordon, near Augusta, Ga. Scans revealed a ``mass'' behind
his sinuses and surgery has been scheduled to drain it, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Army doctors don't believe Spec. Jones' medical problems have
anything to do with the anthrax shots. His mother, Mrs. Teresa
Jones of Austin, responds to that with a mother's logic. ``He went
in the Army healthy, and he's sick now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she also is concerned that the Army is about to
discharge her son for medical reasons and leave him with the burden
of lingering medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Food and Drug Administration-approved label for
the vaccine, fewer than 0.2 percent of recipients of the material,
which is manufactured from non-virulent strains of anthrax
bacteria, experience ``malaise and lassitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chills and fever have been reported in only a few cases,'' the
label states. ``In such instances, immunization should be
discontinued.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is one of 209,949 persons -- including Secretary of
Defense William Cohen -- who had received at least one of the six
injections required to induce immunity to anthrax as of last week,
said Pentagon Office of Health Affairs spokesman Jim Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Before the five-year immunization campaign is over, 2.4 million
active duty and reserve personnel are to be vaccinated against the
dread disease. Military personnel are being vaccinated because of
concern in the Defense Department about the emerging threat of
biochemical warfare. Government officials have stated anthrax was
being used by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and some terrorist
organizations to in efforts to develop biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the campaign did not begin until the safety, purity
and potency of the vaccine had been verified.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' case has been picked up by activists who have declared an
Internet war on the Defense Department anthrax immunization
program. In addition to posting Food and Drug Administration
documents that raise questions about the practices at the Michigan
plant where the vaccine was produced, opponents publicize stories
like those of Spec. Jones and promote the views of some scientists
who question the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they have promoted the causes of active duty
personnel who have been punished for refusing to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Air Force announced that an airman at Travis Air
Force Base in California was being discharged under ``other than
honorable conditions'' for disobeying a direct order to take the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Airman First Class Jeffrey Bettendorf had a ``choirboy'' service
record but was given an excessive punishment because top Air Force
officers were angry over the publicity his case generated, his
lawyer charged. Typically, troops that refuse to take the vaccine
are punished with a demotion and a month's restriction to base when
they refuse the vaccine a first time, said the lawyer, Mark Zaid.
He said the second refusal often results in a general discharge
under honorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Zaid said he receives several calls a week from U.S. military
personnel around the globe asking him what will happen to them if
they refuse to take the vaccination series. Some Air Force Reserve
pilots in California and Connecticut have chosen to get out of the
reserves instead of taking the shots.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine was manufactured in a Lansing, Mich., laboratory
originally owned by the Michigan State Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said a routine inspection of the facility in 1996
found ``good management practices'' violations in connection with
production of vaccine in general and anthrax vaccine in particular.
As a result, the FDA notified the department that it intended to
revoke the federal license of the facility, then known as the
Michigan Biologic Products Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The state presented a plan for correcting the deficiencies, said
John Taylor, an official of the FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs. A
follow-up visit found some of the problems had been corrected and
some had not, Taylor said, so the FDA notified the state that the
facility still was not in compliance with federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months later, when we visited the site again, we were not
about to note with any accuracy how much progress had been made,
simply because the company had stopped manufacturing anthrax
vaccine,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the state has sold the Michigan Biologic Products
Institute to a private company, Bioport Inc., which is headed by
retired Navy Adm. William Crowe Jr., a former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Teresa Jones is convinced that other mothers of
military personnel are hearing of problems with the vaccine and
don't know where to turn. She urged them to study an Internet site,

RENO URGES COURT TO APPROVE HER INVESTIGATION OF STARR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Monday urged a
special three-judge panel to allow the Justice Department to
continue its investigation into whether prosecutors for Whitewater
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr abused their authority while
questioning Monica Lewinsky in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel, which appointed Starr in August 1994, had
directed Starr and Reno in February to file legal briefs on whether
the department has jurisdiction to investigate an independent
counsel's practices.
</P>
<P>
   The court order was in response to a petition filed on Feb. 11
by the Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative law group based in
Herndon, Va., which asked the court to stop Reno's inquiry into
Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark contended that the attorney general does not have the
authority to investigate an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, the Justice Department told Starr that it would
begin an investigation into whether his office's prosecutors were
guilty of misconduct. Investigators would also look into whether
Starr's office withheld information from department lawyers about
possible conflicts of interest at the outset of the Lewinsky
inquiry in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In her 10-page brief, Reno argued that because the independent
counsel law gives the attorney general sole responsibility for
dismissing an independent counsel, the department should be able to
investigate possible misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act clearly contemplates that the attorney general has the
authority to conduct such investigations, since it requires (her),
upon removal of an independent counsel, to report ... to the
Judiciary Committee of the Senate and House, `specifying the facts
found and the ultimate grounds for such removal,''' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also argued that because the law gave her the power to
remove Starr, the three-judge panel _ also known as the special
division _ did not have the authority to stop her investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the law remotely suggests that the special division
has authority to prevent the attorney general from inquiring into
whether ... to remove an independent counsel,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's brief was unavailable from either his officer or the
three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Starr and Reno met to negotiate a plan for how the
Justice Department investigation would be conducted. According to
department officials, Reno assured Starr at the meeting that the
investigation was not ordered by the White House and that it would
be done in a fair manner.
</P>
<P>
   Starr reportedly was willing to accept the investigation so long
as its impartiality could be assured, while Reno was willing to
accept a negotiated plan for the investigation so long as she
retained authority over the inquiry, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation likely will delve into allegations of
misconduct by Starr and his deputies in several areas, including
claims that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Their aggressive interrogation of Lewinsky last year without
her lawyer present violated ethics rules;
</P>
<P>
   _ His office leaked secret grand jury material to the media;
</P>
<P>
   _ Starr aides misled Justice officials and failed to reveal a
potential conflict of interest when _ as they sought authority to
investigate the Lewinsky matter _ they denied receiving information
about it from the Paula Corbin Jones legal team, which was suing
President Clinton for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his deputies have defended their initial encounter
with Lewinsky, saying she was free to leave. They also have denied
trying to mislead the attorney general about their sources of
information.
</P>
<P>
   If Reno concluded that Starr had engaged in prosecutorial
misconduct, she could remove him or issue a reprimand that would
taint his inquiry. Her finding could also serve as an official
endorsement of the view of the president's lawyers that Starr had
abused his prosecutorial powers in a relentless pursuit of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel is headed by Judge David B. Sentelle of
the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, who pushed for Starr's
appointment as the independent counsel. The other two judges are
Richard D. Cudahy of the Seventh Circuit and Peter T. Fay of the
Eleventh Circuit. Starr replaced Robert B. Fiske Jr., who had been
appointed by the Reno.

   &UR; THE FIGHT TO PUBLISH FICTION ON FICTION &LR;

<P>
   New York publisher &UR; Barney Rosset &LR;  is fighting with the son of
novelist  &UR; Vladimir Nabokov  &LR; over Rosset's proposed publication of
an English-language version of ``Lo's Diary,'' an Italian novel
spun off from ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dmitri Nabokov &LR;  is citing copyright infringement in France and
the United States in an effort to squelch further publication of
the book, which already has come out in five countries. Knopf had
planned to publish an English version but backed out, as did
Macmillan U.K. and Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. ``I think it's a
mistake morally,''  &UR; Roger Straus  &LR; told the Observer. ``It smells
wrong to me. It's poaching on someone else's territory.'' Nabokov's
lawyer, &UR; Peter Skolnik &LR; , said the book is ``bad,'' ``vulgar,''
``cheap and crass.''
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment lawyer  &UR; Martin Garbus &LR; , on behalf of Rosset and
his Foxrock Books, says the book is `` `Lolita' from a feminist
perspective.'' The matter will be heard in federal court in
Manhattan on March 19, reports the New York Observer.
</P>

   Somebody had to fight the case, Rosset said. As to previous

A FIGHTING JOURNALIST FINDS HIS ROOTS IN A FEARFUL CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay _ After Argentina's junta freed him in
1979, Jacobo Timerman's testament of prison life, torture and
anti-Semitism stirred comparisons to Dostoyevsky, Camus and Hannah
Arendt. ``Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number'' brought
Timerman lasting fame and fortune, and he went on to write
critically acclaimed books on Chile, Cuba and Israel's invasion of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Since the death of his wife, Risha, eight years ago, however,
Timerman has been virtually silent. At 76 he speaks of depression,
drinking and the constant pain in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   But finally the haze seems to be lifting, Timerman said in an
interview, and he is finding his writing powers again. A memoir he
has worked on fitfully for a decade is finally taking form in
unexpected ways, not as the story of his life as a crusading
journalist but as the story of his early years in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, as a poor, immigrant Jewish boy from Ukraine. And as he
plods through a few pages a day in longhand _ a little bit in the
morning and bit more after his siesta, between puffs on a Havana
cigar or walks in his garden with the help of a cane _ he seems to
be finding a second wind to get on with his life.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of writing a memoir came years ago from Ashbel Green,
his longtime editor at Alfred A. Knopf, which has published all his
books in the United States. But Timerman said he hit a wall trying
to write about his years publishing newspapers and challenging both
right-wing generals and left-wing terrorists. The frustrations
grew, he said, as other Argentine writers began writing biographies
about him, and he came to the realization that his life story would
be defined by people who he believed really did not know him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked myself who am I,'' Timerman said, as the requests for
interviews from his would-be biographers came in and he denied them
all. ``To me, my life as a journalist is like a cowboy movie. I
didn't discover anything, I didn't create anything. It was not
anything unusual. So I went to prison and was tortured?''
</P>
<P>
   The power of negative thinking can overwhelm a writer. And
negative thoughts still bubble through Timerman's conversation as
persistently as the fizz in a bottle of seltzer. Never mind that
his exile in Uruguay is voluntary. Never mind that he lives in a
large, graceful house near the beach, complete with a swimming pool
shaded by palm trees. He persistently enters the dark side of life
as he speaks of his best friends inhabiting cemeteries, and as he
laments surrounding himself with photographs of relatives who
rarely visit. He says he has no interest in socializing, and is
destined ``to live surrounded by ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   What perks him up is the subject of his memoir, which he says
``is beginning to become an inspiration.'' He takes particular
delight in saying he will totally surprise Green and the publishing
world with this new book. He refuses to say how much he has written
or when his work will be finished. But his son Hector, also a
journalist, predicted it would be done by July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to write a memoir of my life as people think of
what my life was: the life of a fighting journalist,'' he said.
``People think my life began when I went to prison. But I went to
prison because of the way my life began much earlier. Thinking
constantly about this book I discovered that I wanted to write
about my fears and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is, how do you construct a life despite the fears?
Who can say whether the story of a soul _ not only of a life _ but
the soul that becomes a life might not be an inspiration for many
people?''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Timerman's life, soul, fears and dreams occurred
between the ages of 5 and 16, he said, and they are part of the
larger story of ``the great experience of immigration, the biggest
adventure the world has seen in the last two centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My story is that of an immigrant child who goes to school only
speaking Russian in Argentina, an endemically anti-Semitic
country,'' he said. ``Every day I feared when people spoke to me,
even looked at me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was worse than prison, he said, adding, ``I don't fear
torture, but I still fear entering a dark room, just as I did as a
child.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sources of Timerman's fears are personal, not political. And
they are wrapped up in not only his early experiences with
prejudice, but with poverty as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day was 24 hours of terrible difficulties for a child to
see his parents discussing if there was anything to eat,'' he
recalled. ``We had one bed for four people. You can get love as a
child only from your parents, but if your parents are so troubled,
disturbed and traumatized, the relationship is quite difficult and
you can feel very lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Loneliness came up repeatedly during a six-hour conversation.
But, surprisingly, Timerman said the loneliness of being in a
prison was not so bad because he was reinforced by ideals and
dreams rooted in his adolescent years discovering Zionism among his
fellow teen-age Argentine Jews. It was among young progressive Jews
that Timerman learned of his love for sports and politics, a
confidence around the girls, a passion for literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were with the Republicans in Spain, but as Jews, socialist
Jews,'' he recalled. ``It made me feel strong, complete, capable of
doing great things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am talking about identity,'' he said. ``How a little, shy
immigrant boy becomes a superman journalist by discovering his
identity. Thanks to being Jewish, I lost all of my fears. I never
thought of that before I started writing the memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Timerman is having a cathartic experience, one in which
writing down his feelings can only do him good. He said that he did
not understand psychology, but that he knew that not even Freud
could explain exactly what he was going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin to feel things you want to see again,'' he said. ``I
feel much more strongly involved with those faraway years than with
those of the last 20. Why? That's something I still have to
discover.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be something for his biographers to ponder as well.

JOLTIN' JOE HAS LEFT AND GONE AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The longest unbroken streak by a professional athlete
in any sport ended quietly Monday. After 84 years, 3 months, 1 week
and 4 days of uninterrupted dignity, the great Joe DiMaggio died.
</P>
<P>
   I've marked time by DiMaggio all my life. I was born Nov. 25,
1954, the day DiMaggio turned 40.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he'd been out of baseball for three years. He'd been
divorced from Marilyn Monroe for almost two months. The 56-game
hitting streak for which he was best known (and which still stands)
already was 13 years in the past. Still, DiMaggio was as famous
then as he had been during his playing days.
</P>
<P>
   He must have been.
</P>
<P>
   In the second or third grade, I found out that we shared a
birthday from one of the Sisters of St. Joseph, who announced it to
our class at St. Titus Elementary School as if it were better than
a ``saint's day.'' Because to her, it was.
</P>
<P>
   In the last of the '50s, DiMaggio attended a middleweight title
fight between Sugar Ray Robinson and Carmen Basilio. He went with
his lawyer, Edgar Bennett Williams, and with New York nightclub
owner Toots Shor and novelist Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Williams remembered later how DiMaggio was surrounded by
autograph seekers as the group entered the arena. After one young
man had gotten the former ballplayer to sign a program, he looked
at Hemingway and said, ``Hey, you're somebody too, ain't ya?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Hemingway said, pointing at DiMaggio. ``I'm his
doctor.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A peaceful transition &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio died at home. It was a peaceful transition, as should
happen when a man passes from one state of grace into another.
DiMaggio was the greatest center fielder of his time. But it was a
long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   He remained well-known in spite of the fact that we know little
about him. Or maybe because of it.
</P>
<P>
   He never wrote a tell-all book, though he was married to the
most famous sex symbol in history. He never gave a teary-eyed TV
interview or spilled his guts to the tabloids. He never allowed
himself to become a movie of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time Detroit Tigers slugger Hank Greenberg said of
DiMaggio, ``I guess I know Joe almost 40 years now. We've played
hundreds of games against each other. I've talked to him hundreds
of times at banquets and at Shor's and places like that. In a way,
though, I guess I really don't know him. I don't know if anybody
knows Joe DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   All through the years, we've only gotten glimpses.
</P>
<P>
   During his final days with the Yankees, he was asked why he
continued to play as hard as he did when he was a rookie. DiMaggio
said it was because ``there might be a kid in the stands who has
never seen me play.''
</P>
<P>
   The 56-game hitting streak began on May 15, 1941, and ended July
15. In the middle of it, a summer high school history class in
Cincinnati took a poll to name the greatest Americans. Abraham
Lincoln finished third. George Washington was second. DiMaggio was
first. &QL; 
 &QL; 
I remember it, Joe' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, at an old-timers game, a man approached
DiMaggio and said he'd been at Cleveland the night the streak
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a kid then,'' the man said, ``and I was rooting for
you to get a hit because it would have been fun to see you go all
season with a hit in every game. I remember it, Joe. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do too,'' DiMaggio said.
</P>
<P>
   It's as big a personal disclosure as DiMaggio was willing to
make. He must have known a legend can't survive without mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Gomez, a teammate and friend, once explained it this way:
``He knew he was Joe DiMaggio and he knew what that meant to the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   It meant even more to certain families, like ours, for which
DiMaggio's greatness was magnified by the fact he was Italian.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in San Francisco, but his parents were from Italy,
like all of my grandparents. They were all American citizens, but
in the first half of this century, some citizens, like some
citizens now, were made to feel like foreigners. Even someone like
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, as he was coming into his own as a ballplayer, ``Life''
magazine did a profile of DiMaggio. It read in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Italians, bad at war, are well-suited for milder competition.
. . . Although he learned Italian first, Joe, now 24, speaks
English without an accent, and is otherwise well adapted to most
U.S. mores. Instead of olive oil and smelly bear grease, he keeps
his hair slick with water. He never reeks of garlic and prefers
chicken chow mein to spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he preferred privacy to publicity. &QL; 
 &QL; 
His days with Marilyn &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gay Talese is the only writer to come close to separating
DiMaggio the Person from DiMaggio the Persona. Talese wrote a
profile of the retired ballplayer for ``Esquire'' magazine in the
1960s. Three paragraphs from that article tell the whole story of
DiMaggio and Monroe. They are:
</P>
<P>
   ``He was then 39, she was 27. They had been married in January
of that year, 1954, despite disharmony in temperament and time: He
was tired of publicity, she was thriving on it; he was intolerant
of tardiness, she was always late. During their honeymoon in Tokyo,
an American general had introduced himself and asked if, as a
patriotic gesture, she would visit the troops in Korea. She looked
at Joe. `It's your honeymoon,' he said, shrugging, `go ahead if you
want to.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She appeared on 10 occasions before 100,000 servicemen, and
when she returned, she said, `It was so wonderful, Joe. You never
heard such cheering.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Yes I have,' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time I got around to reading that story, it was the
1970s. DiMaggio had been out of baseball for more than 20 years.
Monroe had been dead for more than 10 years. Sometime in there,
Joltin' Joe, the Yankee Clipper, started doing Mr. Coffee
commercials. Even that didn't hurt his image.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't. After he retired, DiMaggio lived his life the way
he'd played the game, as if there might be a kid out there who'd
never seen him before. He did it year after year, his strength and
speed waning, but never his form, until the streak ended early
Monday morning. &QL;

JOLTIN' JOE HAS LEFT AND GONE AWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The longest unbroken streak by a professional athlete
in any sport ended quietly Monday. After 84 years, 3 months, 1 week
and 4 days of uninterrupted dignity, the great Joe DiMaggio died.
</P>
<P>
   I've marked time by DiMaggio all my life. I was born Nov. 25,
1954, the day DiMaggio turned 40.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he'd been out of baseball for three years. He'd been
divorced from Marilyn Monroe for almost two months. The 56-game
hitting streak for which he was best known (and which still stands)
already was 13 years in the past. Still, DiMaggio was as famous
then as he had been during his playing days.
</P>
<P>
   He must have been.
</P>
<P>
   In the second or third grade, I found out that we shared a
birthday from one of the Sisters of St. Joseph, who announced it to
our class at St. Titus Elementary School as if it were better than
a ``saint's day.'' Because to her, it was.
</P>
<P>
   In the last of the '50s, DiMaggio attended a middleweight title
fight between Sugar Ray Robinson and Carmen Basilio. He went with
his lawyer, Edgar Bennett Williams, and with New York nightclub
owner Toots Shor and novelist Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Williams remembered later how DiMaggio was surrounded by
autograph seekers as the group entered the arena. After one young
man had gotten the former ballplayer to sign a program, he looked
at Hemingway and said, ``Hey, you're somebody too, ain't ya?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Hemingway said, pointing at DiMaggio. ``I'm his
doctor.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A peaceful transition &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio died at home. It was a peaceful transition, as should
happen when a man passes from one state of grace into another.
DiMaggio was the greatest center fielder of his time. But it was a
long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   He remained well-known in spite of the fact that we know little
about him. Or maybe because of it.
</P>
<P>
   He never wrote a tell-all book, though he was married to the
most famous sex symbol in history. He never gave a teary-eyed TV
interview or spilled his guts to the tabloids. He never allowed
himself to become a movie of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time Detroit Tigers slugger Hank Greenberg said of
DiMaggio, ``I guess I know Joe almost 40 years now. We've played
hundreds of games against each other. I've talked to him hundreds
of times at banquets and at Shor's and places like that. In a way,
though, I guess I really don't know him. I don't know if anybody
knows Joe DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   All through the years, we've only gotten glimpses.
</P>
<P>
   During his final days with the Yankees, he was asked why he
continued to play as hard as he did when he was a rookie. DiMaggio
said it was because ``there might be a kid in the stands who has
never seen me play.''
</P>
<P>
   The 56-game hitting streak began on May 15, 1941, and ended July
15. In the middle of it, a summer high school history class in
Cincinnati took a poll to name the greatest Americans. Abraham
Lincoln finished third. George Washington was second. DiMaggio was
first. &QL; 
 &QL; 
I remember it, Joe' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, at an old-timers game, a man approached
DiMaggio and said he'd been at Cleveland the night the streak
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a kid then,'' the man said, ``and I was rooting for
you to get a hit because it would have been fun to see you go all
season with a hit in every game. I remember it, Joe. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do too,'' DiMaggio said.
</P>
<P>
   It's as big a personal disclosure as DiMaggio was willing to
make. He must have known a legend can't survive without mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Gomez, a teammate and friend, once explained it this way:

DIMAGGIO: DEMANDING TO THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was on the top of the grandstand roof at Fort Lauderdale
Stadium that I saw Joe DiMaggio play. I heard him sing, too.
</P>
<P>
   This was out of sight of the crowd that had come to his annual
charity game for the children's hospital in South Florida that
bears his name. DiMaggio was 81 then, and he was tossing a soft,
padded ball back and forth to his great granddaughters, Valerie and
Vanessa. They called him Big Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like these cookies,'' Vanessa had said to her great
grandpa as they snacked on finger sandwiches and shrimp and cookies
in a private box.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about getting me one?'' Big Joe said. ``Give me one with
walnuts.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to sing, ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame,'' Big
Joe joined in, his voice softer than those of the children and his
granddaughters, Paula and Cathy, but he knew all of the words.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one baseball displayed in DiMaggio's home,
according to DiMaggio's close friend and attorney, Morris
Engelberg. It was the one signed by Vanessa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's a relatively frugal man,'' Engelberg said, ``but
anything Vanessa wants is hers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Jr. threw out the first ball that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for inviting me to come,'' Ripken told DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was in Baltimore the night Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's
record for consecutive games played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it on my own,'' DiMaggio said. ``I wanted to see it
because Gehrig was my teammate. I was invited by Mr. (Peter)
Angelos (the Orioles' owner).''
</P>
<P>
   Also present that night in Florida was Tommy Henrich, the Old
Reliable who broke in with the Yankees one year after DiMaggio, in
1937.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God I saw the best of DiMaggio,'' Henrich said.
``You've got no idea how great he was. Let me sum it up this way:
DiMaggio was the best winner I ever saw in my life. It was so
doggone important to him to finish ahead of somebody by the end of
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, Engelberg said, was a man who still wore a jacket and
tie everywhere, including to the dentist's office. Most mornings,
he was up at 5 and out the door by 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough to be Joe DiMaggio's friend _ he's a very
tough guy to deal with,'' Engelberg said. ``He's on the point. You
can't be late a second. If he says, `Call me at 8 o'clock,' and you
call one minute after 8, he goes crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Age had made him no less demanding, of himself and those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a second life,'' said Joe Nacchio, one of
DiMaggio's closest friends who was at his bedside when he died,
``there are three things I don't want to come back as. Joe's
chauffeur. Joe's barber. And Joe's tailor.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, Engelberg said, ever asked DiMaggio to pick up a check
in a restaurant. He had stacks of clothes still unopened in boxes
in his apartment. Engelberg's secretary, Valerie, cleaned
DiMaggio's apartment _ he wouldn't trust a housekeeper with his
possessions _ and did his shopping for him.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, he played golf, at least three or four times a
week, despite the arthritis in his back, then had a steam bath
before dinner. He also made visits to his hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personality changes with children,'' said Frank Sacco, the
hospital administrator who used to accompany DiMaggio on his rounds
through the neonatal unit, and the cancer ward, and the rooms of
children hooked up to machines as frightening-looking as they are
life-giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very reserved,'' Sacco said, ``but when he sees children,
all of a sudden something happens to him.''
</P>
<P>
   His was a male-dominated world, according to those who knew him
best. One friend said he hadn't seen DiMaggio on a date in years.
Evenings, when he was home, DiMaggio watched TV. He liked Westerns
and war pictures and CNN. He'd watch a ballgame, but much the way
many of us do, he'd channel surf with the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a fan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I saw DiMaggio for the last time in September in Chicago, where
he was receiving an award from the Italian-American Sports Hall of
Fame. Engelberg said he couldn't promise me an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't write this,'' he said, ``but Joe has walking pneumonia.
Nothing serious, but we're probably going to leave the dinner, go
upstairs and watch the fights on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   I never did talk to DiMaggio that night. The next day, he flew
to New York and made an appearance at Yankee Stadium, but did no
interviews that day, either. Before the week was out, he was in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months later, he was dead. Two little girls had
lost their Big Joe.

 &HT;    JULIAN BOND LINKS INTERESTS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) Political categories
 &HT;    with photos
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NAACP Chairman Julian Bond, assessing the
importance of political alliances among minority groups in the 2000
election, said Monday that African-Americans and Hispanics, in
general, ``think and vote the same'' on basic issues of civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, ``I don't think it's going to pay off'' if there
is any attempt by Republicans, and especially by Gov. George Bush
of Texas, to target Hispanic voters as a way of offsetting
overwhelming Democratic advantages among African-Americans in next
year's presidential and congressional elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Hispanic community generally - and this is a big
generalization - is aligned with the black community on these
issues,'' Bond said during an interview with Cox News Service. ``I
do think a candidate like Governor Bush, who speaks Spanish, who
has attracted a large Hispanic vote in his native state of Texas,
is going to be attractive, because he knows this community, he's
familiar with this community, he's not coming to it brand new.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a general proposition _ although I can't say what the
percentage is going to be _ on civil rights issues, blacks and
Hispanics, generally speaking, think and vote the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a ``major priority'' of every one of the NAACP's 2,200
local branches is to reach out to the local Hispanic community and,
in preparation for next year's election, to conduct voter
registration drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very badly want to swell our numbers, because we think the
more the merrier,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a
Washington-based lobbying organization for dozens of civil rights
groups, has expanded from blacks and labor groups to include
Hispanics and Asians - ``the whole spectrum of who we are as
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Polling data by the Tarrance Group, a well-known Republican
polling firm, show that while Hispanic voters are closer to the GOP
on issues of education, family values and entrepreneurship, an
overwhelming majority also view the Democratic Party as ``standing
up for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And since last fall's election, Republican strategists have
focused on how to win back Hispanic voters from the Democratic
Party. They frequently cite Bush's performance among Hispanics. He
won 49 percent of the Hispanic vote, 14 points above the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   According to television network exit polls, in last year's
congressional election, 59 percent of the Hispanic vote went
Democratic, 35 percent Republican. By way of comparison, 88 percent
of African-Americans voted Democratic, about 11 percent Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Democrats because Democrats are so great,'' Bond
said, referring to African-Americans in general and not, he
emphasized, the NAACP, which is nonpartisan. ``We're Democrats
because the Republicans are so bad on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a one-time Democratic member of the Georgia Legislature
and candidate for Congress in Atlanta, said he does not know Bush,
but is interested ``to see how his campaign (for president)
develops,'' particularly in terms of reaching out to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the newspaper coverage of Bush's announcement of an
``exploratory committee'' Sunday, which included photographs of
Bush standing with African-Americans and Hispanics, Bond said, ``I
hope it's more than a photo op, that it means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, in a wide-ranging interview, also said that:
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP would spend ``as much money as it takes'' in order to
defeat any statewide initiatives to end affirmative action
programs. The organization spent $70,000 in Washington last fall,
where such an initiative passed.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an ``abdication of responsibility'' on the part
of most white Americans to help solve the problem of race in
America, and that he would like to see more whites join the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   A debate is underway within the NAACP about its future role,
with Bond trying to ``tip the scale'' away from social services to
social justice efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Racism is ``pervasive'' in America today, although it does not
``exhibit itself daily with hoods and sheets and horrendous
incidents'' like the death of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi should lead a
``loud and clear condemnation'' of the Council of Conservative
Citizens, a white supremacist organization whose leaders have been
hosted by Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau should conduct two counts, if necessary, to
produce ``as fair and as inclusive'' a census as possible.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's racial initiative ``discovered or created''
what he termed ``cross-racial dialogue'' that should improve
understanding between whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The president will be ``fondly remembered'' by African-Americans
for his defense of affirmative action but would be ``less fondly
remembered'' for welfare reform. ``It's a mixed record, but on
balance, it's a good record,'' he added.

 &HT;    JULIAN BOND LINKS INTERESTS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) Political categories
 &HT;    with photos

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NAACP Chairman Julian Bond, assessing the
importance of political alliances among minority groups in the 2000
election, said Monday that African-Americans and Hispanics, in
general, ``think and vote the same'' on basic issues of civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, ``I don't think it's going to pay off'' if there
is any attempt by Republicans, and especially by Gov. George Bush
of Texas, to target Hispanic voters as a way of offsetting
overwhelming Democratic advantages among African-Americans in next
year's presidential and congressional elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Hispanic community generally - and this is a big
generalization - is aligned with the black community on these
issues,'' Bond said during an interview with Cox News Service. ``I
do think a candidate like Governor Bush, who speaks Spanish, who
has attracted a large Hispanic vote in his native state of Texas,
is going to be attractive, because he knows this community, he's
familiar with this community, he's not coming to it brand new.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a general proposition _ although I can't say what the
percentage is going to be _ on civil rights issues, blacks and
Hispanics, generally speaking, think and vote the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a ``major priority'' of every one of the NAACP's 2,200
local branches is to reach out to the local Hispanic community and,
in preparation for next year's election, to conduct voter
registration drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very badly want to swell our numbers, because we think the
more the merrier,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a
Washington-based lobbying organization for dozens of civil rights
groups, has expanded from blacks and labor groups to include
Hispanics and Asians - ``the whole spectrum of who we are as
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Polling data by the Tarrance Group, a well-known Republican
polling firm, show that while Hispanic voters are closer to the GOP
on issues of education, family values and entrepreneurship, an
overwhelming majority also view the Democratic Party as ``standing
up for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And since last fall's election, Republican strategists have
focused on how to win back Hispanic voters from the Democratic
Party. They frequently cite Bush's performance among Hispanics. He
won 49 percent of the Hispanic vote, 14 points above the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   According to television network exit polls, in last year's
congressional election, 59 percent of the Hispanic vote went
Democratic, 35 percent Republican. By way of comparison, 88 percent
of African-Americans voted Democratic, about 11 percent Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Democrats because Democrats are so great,'' Bond
said, referring to African-Americans in general and not, he
emphasized, the NAACP, which is nonpartisan. ``We're Democrats
because the Republicans are so bad on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a one-time Democratic member of the Georgia Legislature
and candidate for Congress in Atlanta, said he does not know Bush,
but is interested ``to see how his campaign (for president)
develops,'' particularly in terms of reaching out to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the newspaper coverage of Bush's announcement of an
``exploratory committee'' Sunday, which included photographs of
Bush standing with African-Americans and Hispanics, Bond said, ``I
hope it's more than a photo op, that it means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, in a wide-ranging interview, also said that:
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP would spend ``as much money as it takes'' in order to
defeat any statewide initiatives to end affirmative action
programs. The organization spent $70,000 in Washington last fall,
where such an initiative passed.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an ``abdication of responsibility'' on the part
of most white Americans to help solve the problem of race in
America, and that he would like to see more whites join the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   A debate is underway within the NAACP about its future role,
with Bond trying to ``tip the scale'' away from social services to
social justice efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Racism is ``pervasive'' in America today, although it does not
``exhibit itself daily with hoods and sheets and horrendous
incidents'' like the death of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi should lead a
``loud and clear condemnation'' of the Council of Conservative
Citizens, a white supremacist organization whose leaders have been
hosted by Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau should conduct two counts, if necessary, to
produce ``as fair and as inclusive'' a census as possible.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's racial initiative ``discovered or created''
what he termed ``cross-racial dialogue'' that should improve
understanding between whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The president will be ``fondly remembered'' by African-Americans
for his defense of affirmative action but would be ``less fondly
remembered'' for welfare reform. ``It's a mixed record, but on
balance, it's a good record,'' he added.

NO FURTHER DISCIPLINE FOR CHECK BY BELANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ken Belanger expected the worst Monday but wound up
with the best-case scenario when he learned he wouldn't receive any
supplementary discipline from the NHL for drilling Rangers
defenseman Ulf Samuelsson into the boards in the first period of
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The league office reviewed videotape of the hit, which knocked
Samuelson out of the game, but felt the five-minute major for
boarding and game misconduct were the proper punishment for
Belanger.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to finding out he would be eligible to play against
Florida Tuesday, Belanger was clearly expecting the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the puck in his skates, his shoulder was on the
boards,'' said Belanger. ``As I was going in, I don't know if he
kind of saw me and he turned back. If his visor doesn't cut his
face, it's not a major. If he gets up right away, it's not a major.
Maybe if I'm not so big, I hit him and it's not a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do? Do you poke-check the puck out of his skates
or do you hit him? It's hockey. I never hit anyone from behind
before and got a major. It's not like it was intentional. I never
meant to hurt him, I was just finishing my check. It's just the way
he kind of turned I guess. There was no intent to injure.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson suffered a concussion and was scheduled to be
evaluated in New York Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hit wasn't particularly vicious, though Belanger wouldn't
have been surprised by a suspension (``I never get off easy on
anything,'' he said).
</P>
<P>
   The FleetCenter fans cheered when Samuelsson went down and booed
when he finally got up after several minutes and had to be helped
to the bench and dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson, of course, is blamed in these parts for cutting
short Cam Neely's career as a result of a hit in the 1991 playoffs
when Samuelsson played for the Penguins. But Belanger said he
wasn't aware of all the history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't here when all that stuff went down,'' he said. ``It
wasn't revenge. It was just a coincidence that it happened to be
him. I guess he's not well liked here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out there to hurt guys. Everyone is playing hard and
doing their jobs. It's just unfortunate that he got hurt. I'm sure
there are a lot of happy people out there but I'm not happy about
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger expected to be assessed at least one game and thought
that since Colin Campbell, the former Rangers' coach, was meting
out the punishment, he might be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's Ulf Samuelsson and he's hurt a lot of players,'' said
Belanger. ``It's good having a reputation as being tough, but
referees always look for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the situation comes up again where the guy has the puck
along the boards, I'm not going to say, `I can't hit him because
I'm going to get suspended.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There has been some confusion about Tuesday's game because of
the original schedule. The Bruins host Florida Tuesday night, not
Wednesday, at the FleetCenter . . . Forward Peter Ferraro cleared
waivers and was demoted to Providence. In 45 games with Boston,
Ferraro had 6 goals and 14 points. ``I'm very unhappy the way it
turned out,'' said Ferraro. ``Certainly, I got a great opportunity
to play here and play under a great coaching staff and with some
great teammates. I have to go to Providence with a positive
attitude and do the best I can down there and hopefully I'll be
back.'' . . . Forward Steve Heinze's run of less-than-stellar luck
continued. He had to leave practice a little early Monday because
he was struck in the jaw by a puck and needed several stitches . .
. Defenseman Darren Van Impe, who has been out of the lineup since
suffering a separated shoulder Feb. 9, is closing in on a return,
perhaps as early as this weekend. ``If not this weekend, then not
too long after that,'' said Van Impe. ``We'll just have to see over
the next couple of days.''

EG&AMP;G TO BUY PERKIN DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EG&AMP;G Inc. said it plans to acquire an instruments unit from
Perkin-Elmer Corp. for $425 million in cash and debt.
</P>
<P>
   EG&AMP;G also said it may sell or spin off its technical services
unit, which manages a chemical weapons disposal plant and other
facilities for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Both steps are part of a strategy to concentrate on commercial
businesses with higher profit margins, said EG&AMP;G's president and
chief executive Gregory L. Summe. ``We're clearly shifting the
profile and narrowing the focus,'' Summe said in an interview at
the company's headquarters in Wellesley, Mass. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal contracting unit, he said, is ``not synergistic from
a customer or from an employee standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   With about 6,000 employees scattered around the country, the
technical services unit's 1998 revenue of $553 million made up 39
percent of EG&AMP;G's total 1998 revenue of $1.4 billion. In addition
to the chemical weapons destruction plant in Utah, other operations
include services for the US Navy and a contract to oversee
redevelopment work at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This year the unit's revenues are expected to fall to $450
million, mainly because it failed to obtain a major contract to
operate the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Profits are also low,
a chief reason Summe has steered EG&AMP;G to focus on private sector
work since he was named to head the company 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Perkin-Elmer's Analytic Instruments Division
is also meant to complement EG&AMP;G's existing instruments unit. Based
in Norwalk, Conn., the Perkin-Elmer unit has 3,100 employees and
reported sales of $569 million in its last fiscal year. Its devices
are used in the manufacture of drugs and to test food, water, and
materials purity.
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs are expected to result from the purchase, Summe said.
Under the terms of the transaction, EG&AMP;G will pay $275 million for
the unit and will assume $150 million worth of debt from
Perkin-Elmer.
</P>
<P>
   If the transaction is completed as expected before June, EG&AMP;G
expects to write off about $30 million worth of Perkin-Elmer
research now under way, Summe said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the transaction is not expected to to affect 1999
earnings and will add to earnings beginning in 2000. Both
companies' boards of directors have approved the transaction, which
still requires approvals from various US agencies and from some in
Europe, where the Perkin-Elmer unit conducts 40 percent of its
business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, EG&AMP;G will assume control of the Perkin-Elmer brand
name for use with the new unit. Perkin-Elmer Corp. will change its
name to PE Corp. after one year, Summe said.
</P>
<P>
   EG&AMP;G said it has hired Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``to explore
strategic alternatives'' for its technical services Unit. Summe
declined to discuss what price he hopes the unit might receive if
it were sold outright.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in EG&AMP;G rose 5/16 to 27 7/8 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. Shares in Perkin-Elmer Corp. fell 1/4 to 92 1/2.

WILLIAMS: `I NEVER, EVER COMPARED MYSELF TO HIM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Theirs was a two-man club. They knew things
no one else could know. They had experiences no one else shared. In
their time, baseball's golden age, Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams
were the best players and ultimate American heroes. Never teammates
or even friends, they were measured against one another from
opposite ends of the New York-Boston corridor.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio-Williams was something more than Russell-Chamberlain,
Bird-Magic, or Ali-Frazier. It was more like FDR and Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons and questions never stopped. Photographs,
statistics, and memories tracked them into their 80s, and Monday,
when DiMaggio died, the hardball world waited for word from Ted.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in bed in Hernando, Fla., watching the History
Channel and talking on the phone when an employee came into his
room with word that the great DiMaggio had died at his home in
Florida at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend came into my room in the morning and said, `I got
some news,' and I knew what it was right away,'' Williams said. ``I
can only tell you that I'm sad, but I'm happy Joe's not suffering
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an American hero and a legend for sure. I never, ever
compared myself to him. I thought there never was a greater player
in the history of baseball. For me just to be mentioned in the same
breath, boy, I always felt like I was two steps below him. I
thought I could hit with anybody, but he was in my opinion as good
as any that ever played this game. There's only one guy I saw you
could mention in the same breath, and that was Willie Mays. I felt
that just to have my name mentioned with Joe, it elevated me. I
never thought I was ever as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly they were different. DiMaggio was a graceful center
fielder, a righthanded batter who rarely struck out. He was the
complete player who rarely showed any emotion. It was noteworthy
just to see Joe D kick the dirt after an outfielder made a
spectacular grab to rob him of a hit. Williams, meanwhile, lived to
hit. Everything else _ fielding, throwing, running the bases _ was
stuff you had to do to stay in the lineup and get a chance to hit.
Ted was combustible, sometimes spitting in the direction of his
hecklers and smashing equipment after frustrating plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   They did not have many conversations or share many laughs when
they dominated baseball in the 1940s. DiMaggio was the quiet,
dignified son of an Italian immigrant from San Francisco. Williams
was the cocky slugger from San Diego. Joe played for the perennial
world champion Yankees. Ted played for the runner-up (or worse) Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Ted was the fire. Joe was the ice. And often their greatness
intersected. DiMaggio was American League MVP when Ted hit .327
with 31 homers and 145 RBIs as a rookie in 1939. When Ted hit .406
(baseball's last .400 season) in 1941, Joe D hit in 56 straight
games and won the MVP again. When Ted hit the home run off Claude
Passeau to win the 1941 All-Star Game in Detroit, Joe D was
standing at home plate to congratulate Boston's young slugger.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams's Red Sox went to New York for the final two games
of the 1949 season, needing a single victory to clinch the American
League pennant, DiMaggio's Yankees won both games and went to the
World Series. Ted was MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never did dislike him,'' said Williams. ``I liked him. I
wasn't jealous, but I was envious. He had great complements with
him, too. One guy can't do it. All they have to do is walk you.''
</P>
<P>
   There were five DiMaggio brothers, and three became major
leaguers. Williams's longtime Red Sox teammate was Dominic
DiMaggio, Joe's baby brother who was at his bedside when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much admiration and strong feeling about the
DiMaggio family,'' Williams remembered. ``I played (in the minors)
with Vince, who was a good ballplayer and a wonderful person. Then,
of course, I played with Dominic for 10 years, and everybody knows
what I thought of him. Joe I saw for a lot of years, and nobody was
any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I actually saw him was in Yankee Stadium,
Opening Day in '39. I had been in the (Pacific) Coast League in
'37, and he had just left the league and was making major league
history. I remember I always played him deep, I'll tell you that.
He didn't say much to me. He'd just say, `You're doing a great job
with that ball club.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Franchise players from rival teams often get to know one another
during the midsummer All-Star Game. This wasn't the case when Ted
and Joe teamed up for the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk much, even then,'' remembered Williams, now 80.
``Joe would come early and never talk to anybody. I'd talk more
with Hank Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do remember one thing from one of those games. I was
playing left and he was playing center, and we were in Brooklyn.
Jackie Robinson hit a line drive to left center that bounced up
against the fence and came to DiMaggio. Joe didn't look like he was
rushing or anything, but he took that ball and ripped it into
second base. It was a bang-bang play and Robinson was safe, but I
thought to myself, `Jesus.' I was impressed with that, with the way
he made that play so close without even hurrying.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Williams, Robinson, DiMaggio. Converging on a single
play. There's a little hardball history buried in that All-Star
anecdote.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for him to talk about the passing of his longtime
rival. Williams is scheduled to appear with Tom Brokaw on NBC
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Dom,'' said Williams. ``He knows how much I
thought of the DiMaggio clan. The last several months, every time I
talked to Dom, it was always, `How's Joe today?' I admired them all
because they were all good players. It's a sad day to think that
Joe DiMaggio is gone.''

ISTANBUL JOURNAL: LEFTIST FILM TRIES TO DEAL WITH TURKEY'S RECENT
PAST  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Celebrating historic triumphs is a favorite
pastime for many Turks. Tales of how Turkic peoples emerged from
Central Asia, crossed the steppes to Anatolia, established the
Ottoman Empire and ruled for centuries over large swaths of Europe
and Asia are the subject of countless legends, poems and books.
</P>
<P>
   But dealing with the more recent past is difficult here.
Passions run too high to allow critical assessments of Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk, who founded the Turkish Republic in 1923, or of the
Kurdish uprisings, military coups and periods of repression that
have marked this country's political life since then.
</P>
<P>
   The intense emotion surrounding the recent arrest of the Kurdish
guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is now facing a trial for
treason that could lead to the death penalty, reflects this
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   But one Turkish filmmaker, Reis Celik, 37, has begun to tackle
topics that many Turks prefer not to confront.
</P>
<P>
   Celik's 1997 film ``Let There Be Light'' examined the war
between the Turkish army and Kurdish separatists in a daringly
balanced way, suggesting there might be right and wrong on both
sides. Now he has produced a film about three college dropouts who
tried to set off a Marxist revolution in Turkey, but who were
captured and hanged in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The film, ``Goodbye Tomorrow,'' is a drama that focuses on the
most prominent of the three, Deniz Gezmis. Some Turks remember him
as an idealist victimized by the brutality of military justice.
Others say he deserved his fate because his crime was no less than
seeking to destroy the nation he claimed to love.
</P>
<P>
   Since the film's release, debates over Gezmis, the leftist
movement that spread through Turkey after 1968, and the death
penalty have come to the surface here. The film portrays the rebels
in a highly favorable light and the military establishment as cruel
and repressive.
</P>
<P>
   Gezmis and his comrades, like their counterparts in the United
States and Western Europe, were fired by anger at the American role
in Vietnam and at social injustices at home. Some Turks came to
view them with a hatred almost as intense as that which they now
hold for Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War was fought very intensely here,'' said Hasan
Cemal, author of a forthcoming book on the period. ``Moscow was
always trying to destabilize Turkey. The Americans were willing to
do anything to keep Turkey on their side. The polarization was
tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students and others filled Turkish streets for
marches and demonstrations in the late 1960s and early '70s. Some
like Gezmis, inspired by the example of Che Guevara, decided that
Turkey was ripe for revolution. Among their actions was the
spectacular kidnapping of four American soldiers, who they later
released without receiving the ransom they had demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Gezmis and his comrades were caught soon after that episode.
They were brought before a tribunal established by the military
junta that took power in 1971, and charged with trying to overthrow
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is you people who tried to overthrow it with your junta,''
the actor who plays Gezmis tells steely-eyed military judges in a
scene from the new film. ``You should be trying yourselves on these
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   In other scenes, the Gezmis character asserts that his fight was
against American imperialism and that his ``one real objective was
an independent and democratic Turkey.'' Gezmis is portrayed as a
kind of national conscience, a defender of humanistic values in the
face of an evil machine.
</P>
<P>
   This perspective is repulsive to Turks who consider Gezmis to
have been no more than a terrorist. Yet some of them harbor
grudging respect for him nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, people on both sides were sincere and honest
and patriotic,'' said Yasar Okuyan, a leader of the center-right
Motherland Party who was an anti-Marxist student organizer in the
1970s. ``At the time, it may have seemed that there were reasons to
execute him, but looking back it is impossible to accept those
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The execution of Gezmis and his two comrades did not end
political confrontation in Turkey. On the contrary, the
confrontation worsened, and by the end of the 1970s gunfire,
bombing and killing became daily events. The chaos was ended after
another military coup in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey did not give the '68 generation a chance to express
itself peacefully,'' said Ilkay Demir, a doctor who was sentenced
to death for her involvement in leftist subversion in the 1970s and
who served eight years in prison before being released in an
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very unrealistic,'' Dr. Demir said. ``We thought we
could spark a popular uprising immediately. Looking back, I can see
that what we did was really stupid. But still, Deniz and people
like him left a very important symbolic legacy. They're symbols of
self-expression, of a determination to participate in society and
not to accept state authority blindly.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of her former comrades, Dr. Demir has no plans to see
``Goodbye Tomorrow.'' The film, which is to be shown at festivals
in Europe and may later appear in the United States, has received
mixed reviews. Many veterans of the leftist movement prefer to
guard their own memories rather than see them filtered through a
camera's lens.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in an Istanbul cafe on a recent afternoon, Celik, the
film's director, said that although he is hampered by tight budget
constraints _ he made his new film for just $1 million _ he is
determined to confront issues from a leftist perspective that was
until recently considered intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have been possible to make this film 10 or even
five years ago, but now there is a real demand for democracy
here,'' Celik said. ``Turkey is entering the world. I see my role
as helping it to confront its past and its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he saw a comparison between the death sentence handed
down to Deniz Gezmis and the one that Ocalan may receive, Celik
replied: ``Gezmis was hanged, but now even the president of Turkey
speaks in some of the same terms he did. Who knows whether years
from now, people will defend what Ocalan has been saying?''

 COMMENTARY: KillingGoliath.com  
(Eds., in 4th graf, double parentheses should be set as brackets)  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently wrote a column about Lyle Bowlin, who, for about $150
a month, had managed to put together a Web site that could compete
with Amazon.com for selling books. Bowlin was underselling
Amazon.com (and making a profit!) while running the whole operation
out of a spare bedroom in his home in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Well, the
column elicited the usual range of skeptical responses from
experts, who argued that Bowlin's operation was just a fluke, or
that he wasn't calculating his costs properly, or that Amazon.com
would soon crush him and all other would-be little-guy competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Well, to all of you I say: YOU'RE WRONG.
</P>
<P>
   You think the Internet is overrated. It's underrated. Here's the
e-mail I got from Bowlin two days after the column ran, both in The
New York Times and on line on www.nytimes.com:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Tom, I thought I would just fill you in on the impact the
column has had. We had over 142,000 hits between 11 p.m. Thursday
night ((when the column first appeared on the Web)) and 2 p.m.
Friday afternoon from 40 different countries, before the software
that tracks hits gave up and crashed. I have personally responded
to over 1,400 e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail messages fell into three broad categories. One group
was people who were interested in the charitable-donation
arrangement Bowlin offers, whereby 10 percent of the purchase price
of any book can be dedicated to an IRS-certified charity. Another
group was small-business people around the world _ particularly
craft makers _ who were interested in competing against the big
boys from their spare bedrooms at home, just like Bowlin, and
wanted to know how to get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people out there who have a passion for
selling different things, and if they all start doing it over the
Web as a hobby, it is going to have an impact on the big
retailers,'' argues Bowlin.
</P>
<P>
   What intrigued me most, though, was the third group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole group of people out there,'' says Bowlin,
``who like the idea of the `little guy' competing against
Amazon.com. People see Amazon.com as this big impersonal thing.
Whereas they like the idea of dealing with a person they know
actually exists. Even though their contact with me is over the Web,
and it is through e-mail, they know when they contact me the answer
is coming from a real person, with a real name. I'm a real person,
not a virtual person. If someone sends me an order and forgets
something or makes a mistake, I will send them a message and say,
`Didn't you mean this?'''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there is still a deep hunger out there for that
old-style, Main Street feeling, built on human contact. This
suggests that the really successful retailers in the Internet Age
will be those who can combine the efficiency of cyberspace with the
intimacy of the backyard barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin's experience underscores another point: If you think
globalization is overrated, you're also wrong. You ain't seen
nothin' yet. As Lyle Bowlin can tell you, the minute you start to
do business on the Web, you now have to think globally. You have to
think about your customers as global, your competitors as global,
your readers as global, your suppliers as global and your partners
as global.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a commercial technology like this in the
history of the world, whereby from the minute you adopt it, it
forces you to think and act globally,'' argues Robert Hormats of
Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin got offers last week to go into partnership with local
booksellers in both London and Singapore. Whereas before he was
doing at best $2,000 a month in business, since the story about him
appeared on the Web he is now doing $2,000 a day from around the
globe. This is enabling him to make improvements to his site _
www.positively-you.com _ that will make it even more competitive
with Amazon.com. In particular, he is now able to afford a search
engine, so his customers can easily search the 500,000 titles
offered by his main wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   The only downside to his sudden expansion, says Bowlin, is that
he can no longer compete against Amazon.com from his spare bedroom.
It's not big enough anymore to serve as his headquarters. ``I've
had to move the whole operation into the downstairs formal dining
room,'' he said.

<P>
   WETUMKA, Okla. _ If she could look out her window, Mary Fish
Basquez would see the ground that was given to her family long ago,
land now being hollowed for oil that was supposed to mean a better
life for Muscogee Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The oil is pumped just steps from the rumpled little house where
Mrs. Basquez lives. But for all the Oklahoma sweet crude that comes
from six wells on her family's 40 acres, Mrs. Basquez receives only
a few dollars a year. And from her house, now, she cannot even see
the land _ the windows are boarded up because she is unable to
afford basic home improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Being poor and Indian and locked in a fight over some scrap of
land are not unusual circumstances in this part of Oklahoma, where
tribes from the Southeast were forced to live in the last century.
But if the land itself is rich, and the manager of it is supposed
to be making money from it for the Indians, that boils the blood of
people here beyond the rage over historic slights.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the manager is the federal government, which holds
more than 10 million acres in trust for up to a half-million
individual Indians. But as a trust manager, a role it has had for
more than a century, the government seems incapable of keeping
track of the money for people like Mrs. Basquez. It cannot even
tell her how much oil is being sucked out of the ground, or what
company owns the lease, or the price it pays for the oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me so mad,'' said Mrs. Basquez, a 56-year-old
Muscogee, Indians who are also known as Creeks. ``I see all the oil
they're taking away, but then I get a statement for $5 or less.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Basquez is getting her day in court. Her case is one of
thousands behind the largest class-action suit ever filed by
Indians. They say the government, which is required by law to take
care of Indian trust lands with a high standard of fiduciary
responsibility, has managed the accounts with epic ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian plaintiffs say a system run by people who know next
to nothing about managing trusts has produced a situation where
most beneficiaries cannot even get an account of their own assets.
</P>
<P>
   Even the basic numbers about the size of the trusts are unknown.
The Interior Department says it manages about 300,000 accounts,
through which pass roughly $500 million a year. The Indians say
that because the government has lost track of so many
beneficiaries, the actual number of accounts is closer to 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The trusts work like this: The government leases out the
Indian-owned land to oil, gas, timber or other businesses for a
fee. The fees then go to the Treasury Department, and from there,
checks are supposed to be sent to individual Indians. Money does go
out. But many checks gather dust, because the government claims it
cannot find the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many lapses, black holes and lost records in the
system that the government says it cannot even account for 50,000
of the active trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The government, in large measure, agrees with the Indian
complaints, and says it is the top priority of the Interior
Department to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our own money _ not government handouts,'' said Eloise
Cobell, a Blackfoot Indian and lead plaintiff in the class-action
lawsuit. ``This is money that comes in the door and then doesn't go
out to the people it's supposed to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the Indian money has gone is one of the many mysteries at
the heart of this case. It is money that was supposed to make
Indians into landowners and capitalists _ money that was going to
pay for college, homes, businesses and farms, money that flows
through the accounts at a clip of about $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bureau of Indian Affairs has spent more than 100 years
mismanaging, diverting and losing money that belongs to Indians,''
said John E. Echohawk, executive director of the Native American
Rights Fund, which is handling the case for the plaintiffs. ``We
don't have any political clout to change it, so the government just
continues to ignore us.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say the money has not gone anywhere; many
checks have simply never left the Treasury Department. The problem,
they say, is finding the ever-expanding number of heirs to the
original trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to restore original trust documents, and then pay out
lost trust money that the Indians say may be as high as $10
billion, will be one of the hardest things the government has tried
to do in a long time, the trust officials say. It may even be
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together we dug up a big snake,'' said Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt. ``We scratched the snake up. And I'm going to cut
its head off on my watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Babbitt has made very little progress with the snake,
the Indians who filed the suit say. And the judge hearing the case
has tended to agree. In late February, Judge Royce C. Lamberth of
U.S. District Court held Babbitt and Treasury Secretary Robert E.
Rubin in civil contempt of court for their inability to produce
documents in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's department manages the trust, while Rubin's writes the
checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians say the trust mess is a financial scandal rivaled
only by the savings and loan crises of the 1980s. In terms of human
misery, they say, it may be worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the result of this abuse every day,'' Ms. Cobell, the
lead plaintiff, said. ``I see elders passing away and dying, people
who could have had a better life if their land had been properly
managed.''
</P>
<P>
   If the money were being held for Americans other than Indians,
said Ms. Cobell, the trust problem would long ago have been
resolved, a contention federal officials strongly dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to make passive investors out of us,'' she said.
``It was another way to take the land.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there is not even an accounts receivable system to
track how much money is supposed to be coming in, and how much is
going out. Hundreds of thousands of records _ deeds, leases, deals,
addresses of family beneficiaries _ are lost, missing or otherwise
unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The records have crumbled in riverside warehouses, been lost to
fire, washed away by floods, are covered with rat feces or buried
in salt mines, trust managers say.
</P>
<P>
   The trusts date to the 1887 General Allotment Act, when
reservations were broken up and Indians were given 80 to 160 acres
apiece. At the time, policy makers said the Indians were incapable
of managing their own land, so the government was set up as a
trustee for many of the new land owners. They leased the Indian
parcels to oil, gas, timber, grazing and mining interests.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than making Indians prosperous, by most accounts, the
allotment system destroyed tribal wealth and led to Indians losing
two-thirds of the land.
</P>
<P>
   No new allotments have been given out since 1934. Still, Indians
continued to lose their land, often through default or sales made
after trust officials claimed that an Indian beneficiary could not
be found. Court documents show that from 1934 to the present,
nearly 50 percent of the 17 million acres managed by the government
for Indians went out of the hands of families that originally owned
the land.
</P>
<P>
   The land in eastern Oklahoma that was held in trust for the
descendants of Moses and Frances Bruno, for example, was sold in
the 1960s to satisfy a $97 grocery bill, according to documents in
the case. No one is certain why this was permitted, and the family
points to it as an example of a flagrant abuse. Oil has been pumped
from the land for much of this century, and oil is still being
drawn from the old Bruno ground today.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno family descendants have spent more than 30 years trying
find out why their trust property, with all its valuable oil, was
sold by the government trust manager. In a special exemption that
the Indians consider unjust, a half-century-old federal law allows
local and state courts in Oklahoma to have a say in how Indian
trusts are probated. The Indians say the exemption simply clears a
legal path for people to take Indian land that is supposed to
remain in trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at the grandchildren of the original Indian
allottees, and we're dealing with the grandchildren of the Oklahoma
Sooners,'' said Johnny Flynn, a descendant of the Bruno family and
a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. ``Guess which side
usually ends up with the land?''
</P>
<P>
   Marcella Giles, a Muscogee lawyer who is representing some of
the cases in Oklahoma, says that up to 90 percent of the oil-rich
trust lands in eastern Oklahoma have fallen out of Indian hands in
the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Oklahoma, it's the fox guarding the henhouse,'' Ms. Giles
said. ``There is a simple reason why _ oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bureau of Indian Affairs officials in Oklahoma, who are part of
the Interior Department, could not answer specific questions about
some of the trusts in question. But Kevin Gover, a Pawnee Indian
who is the assistant Interior secretary for Indian Affairs, said
many of the sales of the land, like the one to satisfy a grocery
bill _ should never have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the trust system collapsed years ago,''
Gover said. ``But we ought to be able to produce basic records of
deed, leases, income amount for any trust beneficiary. We're taking
that task on, and I think the system will be fixed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Court documents and testimony in the trust case, which was filed
in 1996, also show that most of the leases on Indian land were
never put up for competitive bidding. In numerous cases, land was
leased for a quarter of its market value.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations that hold leases on Indian trust land include the
telecommunications giant US West, the J.R. Simplot Co., an
agribusiness conglomerate, and most of the major American oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees are supposed to be generating maximum returns on
the land they manage for the Indians. But at a time when oil was
selling, at the well, for about $10 a barrel, Mary Fish Basquez was
told by a Bureau of Indian Affairs official that she was getting
only $3 a barrel, with no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the checks she has received have been paltry _ $5 one
month, $3 another. After two lawyers who took up her case showed up
on the land, and were questioned by oil drillers, Mrs. Basquez
received a check for $3,000, with no explanation, according to her
documents.
</P>
<P>
   But doing business in Indian country should not be compared to
private business dealings, federal officials say. Because there are
so many heirs to individual pieces of property, it is hard to make
changes in how the land is managed, and restrictions prevent the
trusts from being run the way commercial bank trusts are.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created a special trustee office, answering to the
Interior Secretary, in 1994. Paul Homan took over the office and
said he found the system to be the worst operating mess he had ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Homan resigned in January over differences with Babbitt. He
wanted to make the trust office independent, while Babbitt and
other officials said that most Indians, despite their criticism of
the government handling of the trusts, wanted to insure that they
answered to the department that has always run Indian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said 61 percent of the trust accounts have
less than $25 in them; 22 percent have up to $1,000; 14 percent
contain up to $100,000, and less than 1 percent have more than
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to undo more than eight decades of
problems,'' said Tom Thompson, the acting trust manager. ``We took
the job on, kicked the rock, and now everybody is complaining about
the smell.''

FORMER DA DENOUNCES `60 MINUTES' FOR AIRING EAPPEN REPORT

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Saying CBS had inflicted unnecessary pain on a family
that has suffered enough, Attorney General Thomas Reilly denounced
``60 Minutes'' Monday for broadcasting a segment suggesting Matthew
Eappen died of strangulation rather than a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have lost all sense of decency, and all for the sake of a
sensational story that is really a sideshow that has very little to
do with what happened in court,'' Reilly said of the Sunday segment
on the CBS news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who in his previous role as Middlesex County district
attorney brought the charges resulting in the conviction of British
au pair Louise Woodward for killing Matthew Eappen, added: ``I hope
they are satisfied with themselves. All they have done is cause
further harm and pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Tedesco, spokesman for ``60 Minutes,'' said the news
magazine had aired a legitimate story providing new information
about a case that has generated tremendous national interest. ``He
is entitled to his opinion, just as we are entitled to do a story
about forensic evidence in such a high-profile trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Tedesco denied that CBS had broadcast its story as a ratings
bid. `We don't do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``60 Minutes'' segment featured Dr. Floyd Gilles, a
child-abuse specialist at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, who
said his examination of the medical record made him believe Eappen
died from strangulation. At the 1997 trial, prosecutors said the
baby died from violent shaking and having his head slammed against
a hard object, which caused fatal brain swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, in an interview with the Globe Monday, said the ``60
Minutes'' executives should have weighed the relevance of the story
against the pain it would cause the Eappens before airing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't determine people's guilt or innocence based on a
20-minute story by Mike Wallace,'' Reilly said. ``They have lost
sight of the family and lost sight of their pain. To continue to
torment them like this is terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he rejected it, Reilly said that even if Gilles's
theory were true, it wouldn't exonerate Woodward because ``she
could have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvey Silverglate, one of Woodward's attorneys, said the
new theory, if true, actually could help exculpate Woodward,
because that scenario expands the period during which the injury
could have occurred. On the CBS program, Gilles said the actual
injury could have occurred as many as two days before the fatal
brain swelling.
</P>
<P>
   If delayed effects of strangulation caused the baby's death,
Woodward would be no more likely a suspect than any other member of
the household that had access to the baby in that period,
Silverglate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was as much or as little evidence against them as there
was against her, because they are all in exactly the same
position,'' Silverglate said. ``Under these circumstances it would
be unfair to suspect any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate said Woodward's defense team would now try to have
its experts meet with Gilles and another physician who shares his
view. If the experts concur, he said, Woodward's lawyers will ask
Martha Coakley, the new Middlesex County district attorney, to
allow further examination of the medical evidence, particularly
tissue samples.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, now a law student in England, was released from prison
last year after Judge Hiller Zobel reduced her sentence from
second-degree murder to involuntary manslaughter and sentenced her
to time already served.

DISARMAMENT DISPUTE FORCES DELAY IN CREATING NORTHERN IRELAND
CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Britain announced a three-week
postponement Monday in the effort to create an executive cabinet
that is to give the Roman Catholic minority more power and return
home rule to this British province.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Mowlam, the British Northern Ireland Secretary, said the
delay was needed to give the politicians more time to seek
compromise in the dispute over disarmament of the Irish Republican
Army. But Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, clearly anticipating the delay, blamed it on the British
government and said, ``now we're into crisis time, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive cabinet, which was to have been formed by members
of the Northern Ireland Assembly this Wednesday, was delayed by the
dispute over the disarmament of the IRA. The Protestant first
minister of the Assembly, David Trimble, has ruled that until the
IRA begins ``credible'' disarmament, Sinn Fein will not be allowed
to take its two places in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Adams says, accurately, that the agreement setting up the
Assembly does not require disarmament before May, 2000. He says the
IRA's current 19-month cease-fire is evidence that it supports the
peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The police of the Royal Ulster Constabulary declined to comment
Monday night on a report in Monday's editions of the Belfast
Telegraph newspaper that the police had warned Adams of a threat to
his life by an unspecified IRA splinter group that opposes his
participation in the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach a compromise failed again Monday as Adams met
in Dublin with Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of the Irish Republic.
Generally, northern Catholics look to Dublin to the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish Republic to support their demands. But Ahern has
said that it is unrealistic to expect Protestants to sit in a
cabinet with Sinn Fein until the disarmament dispute is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and Trimble are to meet in Belfast on Tuesday, but
officials and experts said a breakthrough in the dispute was
unlikely. In announcing the delay, Ms. Mowlam said she was dropping
the March 10 deadline and extending it to the week starting March
29.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean that the politicians would be talking about it
as the first anniversary of approval of the overall peace agreement
approached on April 10, presumably increasing public pressure for a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mowlam said the delay would give the northern political
parties ``the time and space to find a way forward.'' She noted
that many Assembly members would be in Washington next week for St.
Patrick's Day ceremonies at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, whose involvement in the peace effort has
been crucial, is widely expected to urge the politicians to end the
disarmament dispute. In Washington, Ms. Mowlam said, ``There will
be opportunities to build confidence and talk informally
together,'' in preparation for an intensive round of discussions in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in Dublin, Ms. Mowlam and Irish Foreign Minister David
Andrews signed four treaties legalizing the previously approved new
political structures that would permit the transfer of governmental
powers to the Assembly by the British government, which has ruled
directly since a power-sharing body of Protestants and Catholics
collapsed in 1974.

IT WAS THE MYSTIQUE THAT SET HIM SO FAR APART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He made it look easy. That's what they all said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no athlete who gives you quite the same sense of
effortless ease that DiMaggio does in the performance of his
baseball tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   So wrote Grantland Rice in his foreword to Joe DiMaggio's
autobiography, ``Lucky To Be A Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Cannon agreed. ``The long-boned grace was there from the
beginning and that shaped his style, but the purity was Joe
DiMaggio's baseball talent,'' observed the legendary writer in a
1956 piece for Sport magazine. ``The game of baseball was simple
for him, and he never attempted to make it complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point in that same memorable piece, Cannon makes
reference to DiMaggio ``drifting back after a fly ball with that
marvelous certainty.'' There was clearly something distinct about
Joe DiMaggio, something unique to him, that moved the great
craftsman of the sportswriting profession to reach only for
superlatives in describing the play of the wondrous Yankee center
fielder, who died early Monday at age 84.
</P>
<P>
   In the alleged egalitarianism of American society, DiMaggio was
royalty. Others played; DiMaggio performed. In England, he would
have played his last several years as (itals)Sir(unitals) Joseph
DiMaggio, no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   We Americans do not confer knighthood. We settle for nicknames.
The Voice. The Schnozz. The Great Profile. In DiMaggio's case, The
Yankee Clipper. Imagine being compared to a graceful 19th-century
sailing ship.
</P>
<P>
   When Hemingway needed a sports reference, it was DiMaggio. When
Paul Simon needed an American heroic reference, it was DiMaggio.
When Sport magazine wanted to attract attention for its inaugural
issue in 1946, the only choice for the cover was DiMaggio. When
that same magazine wanted a centerpiece story to celebrate its 10th
anniversary, the only choice was DiMaggio, who was then five years
into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Many players have had an aura, Ted Williams included. DiMaggio
alone had a mystique. He had it as a ballplayer and he had it for
the rest of his life, starting with the fact that after his
retirement, he married Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folk idols,'' said Cannon. ``The whole country's pets.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage lasted nine months, but we know that Joe carried
his torch to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   And never spoke about it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is part of the DiMaggio mystique. DiMaggio was
eternally conscious of being DiMaggio. You might say it was his
life's calling.
</P>
<P>
   No one that accomplished at his trade could be unaware of his
stature. Consider his reaction to the celebrated Al Gionfriddo
catch in front of the visiting bullpen in Game 6 of the 1947 World
Series. ``He was playing me wrong,'' DiMaggio fumed. ``What right
does he have to play me that shallow? If he'd been playing me
right, he wouldn't have had to run that far.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's career is proof that style and inherent professional
class are more important than numbers. He forever will be
associated with the 56-game hitting streak, but his other primary
career numbers (.325 batting average, 361 home runs, 2,214 hits,
1,537 runs batted in) are reasonably modest in context. The most
impressive number, aside from 56, is 369. That was his lifetime
strikeout total.
</P>
<P>
   With DiMaggio, it was never about the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Stengel: ``He had the greatest instinct of any ballplayer
I ever saw. He made the rest of them look like plumbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke Appling: ``He could do everything better than any
ballplayer I ever saw. He was without weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cronin: ``He was the greatest I ever saw or hope to see. He
was just about the perfect ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe McCarthy: ``I don't think anyone can ever put into words the
great things DiMaggio did. Of all the stars I've known, DiMaggio
needed the least coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Hank Greenberg: ``Name a better righthanded hitter or a better
thrower or a better fielder or a better baserunner. That's right, a
better baserunner. Did you ever see him slide when he hooked the
bag with his toe? Absolutely perfect!''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Musial: ``There was never a day when I was as good as Joe
DiMaggio at his best. Joe was the best, the very best I ever saw.''
</P>
<P>
   The big DiMaggio autobiography, the one that would not only have
DiMaggio talking about baseball as only he could but also would
have given us insight into his relationship with Marilyn, was the
Holy Grail of publishing. ``The price tag was around $2 million 10
years ago when he actually held discussions with us about doing
it,'' explains Simon &AMP; Schuster editor Jeff Neumann. ``Today it
would be worth $4 million or $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   It never came out. No amount of money was ever worth it to
DiMaggio if the cost were the surrender of his soul. ``He was not
interested in `setting the record straight,' '' recalls Neumann,
``nor in settling history. He was only considering it because he
knew we wanted it. And in the end, he just couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 of the 1951 Series was his final game, and he lived out
the next 47 years as Joe DiMaggio, the Ultimate American Superstar,
and the Yankees' Yankee. He was accessible to the American public
only when he chose to be, and in so doing, he created a Garbo-like
demand for his presence that separated him from every other similar
sports icon.
</P>
<P>
   In Broadway musicals, there is always supposed to be a
showstopping number. At Old-Timers' Days, the showstopping number
was Joe DiMaggio, and it was no accident.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the deal at any public gathering of ballplayers was that
Joe DiMaggio would be introduced last, and that he would referred
to as ``the greatest living ballplayer.'' He insisted on it.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever objected.

MAVERICK'S FILM LEGACY LIMITED YET OVERPOWERING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By   BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The one comforting thought about Stanley Kubrick's
death on Sunday is that it probably hasn't robbed the world of too
many great films. He only made four features during the last
quarter century, including the just-completed erotic thriller
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' which is scheduled for release in July.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the 70-year-old genius' first production in 12 years,
so how many more could we reasonably expect?
</P>
<P>
   The loss of even one more Kubrick film, however, is an
incalculable tragedy. Kubrick directed only 13 feature films during
a 46-year career. But that relatively modest body of work was
arguably the most accomplished and influential of any American
filmmaker's beside Orson Welles.
</P>
<P>
   Always a technical innovator and more often than not a
breathtakingly original conceptualist, Kubrick pioneered _ and at
the same time perfected _ much of what late 20th-century American
cinema came to be about.
</P>
<P>
   On the formal front, the photo-realistic special effects of
``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968) set the standard for the universe
of science-fiction films that followed (though nothing in the genre
has come near approximating the film's visual poetry and
intelligence). Kubrick integrated music for dramatic emphasis and
irony into his movies in a whole new way while MTV directors were
still in diapers. And even if the historical satire ``Barry
Lyndon'' (1975) was designed on an epic pictorial scale, its
groundbreaking use of natural, low light sources paved the way for
much of the intimately focused independent filmmaking that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick was no less canny when it came to subject matter. He
found expression for such driving themes as contempt for authority
and the fragile, illusory nature of civilization in a kaleidoscopic
variety of styles and genres. Each new film was completely fresh
and different from the others, yet most of them spoke with a
remarkably sharp, often prescient voice to the issues of Kubrick's
radically changing times.
</P>
<P>
   After some noirish explorations that culminated in the
masterful, multiviewpoint heist caper ``The Killing'' (1956),
Kubrick's fourth feature, ``Paths of Glory'' (1957), was an
outraged indictment of military mismanagement years before the
Vietnam War heated up. In 1964, at the height of America's plunge
into that quagmire, Kubrick dropped ``Dr. Strangelove,'' the
blackest, funniest and smartest of Cold War comedies.
</P>
<P>
   In between, with the unavoidably self-censored but still
ruthlessly witty ``Lolita'' (1962), Kubrick challenged society's
self-congratulatory plunge into the sexual revolution, pointing out
way ahead of his time that personal freedom had its limits, both
morally and emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   With ``2001,'' Kubrick broke all the rules of Hollywood
narrative, literally shifting a story through time and space with
no effort to explain the connections. Yet the implications he
coolly, elliptically touched on were as profound as any film ever
has achieved.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other Kubrick film, ``2001'' explored the link
between mankind's destructive and creative impulses. It looked at
how our minds (represented at the extreme by the mad computer Hal)
and our souls (the star child) controlled our destinies _ and by
doing so became one of the few truly spiritual films ever made.
</P>
<P>
   And it was, as the hippies instantly realized, a trip. Not only
did ``2001'' approximate the psychedelic experience better than any
film before or since, it established the concept of movie-as-ride,
a primarily sensory entertainment. That approach has come to
dominate big-budget filmmaking in the decades since; but in all
that time and footage, the abstract elegance of Kubrick's original
design never has been equaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971) foresaw the violent disintegration
of urban youth culture _ and the reactionary social policies that
went right along with it. It also predicted the saturation of
media, and the sometimes frightening efforts to manipulate it, that
has come to define the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Many feel ``Clockwork'' was Kubrick's last great film. But the
three we've seen since _ ``Lyndon,'' ``The Shining'' (1980) and
``Full Metal Jacket'' (1987) _ all possess high degrees of design
genius and thematic consistency. All three are wisely
disillusioned, steeped in the chilling realization that madness is
a stronger force than idealism or rationality _ especially when,
whether in the guise of 18th-century aristocrats, Jack Nicholson's
father figure or a pathological drill sergeant, the insanity rests
in figures we invest with power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' if stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman and
the few Warner Bros. executives who've seen it are to be believed,
could be Kubrick's crowning statement on the subject. From what
little we know, it's about psychiatrists succumbing to their own
obsessions _ a story Kubrick hadn't previously made a movie about,
but a subject he certainly understood intimately.
</P>
<P>
   As controlling a perfectionist as he was a dyed-in-the-wool
maverick (the New York-bred director moved to England in the 1960s
in order to remain as far away as possible from studio
interference), Kubrick oversaw every aspect of his productions from
inception to marketing campaign. He kept his sets closed and his
artistic strategies to himself and the few collaborators he needed
to help realize them. He was known for driving actors mad with
upward of 100 takes, sometimes of the simplest shots. Indeed, the
shooting schedule for ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is believed to have been
the longest in movie history.
</P>
<P>
   Some have noted rather ghoulishly that Kubrick died within days
of completing the first (and now, last) ``Eyes'' cut he felt was
worth showing to anybody _ as if the effort required all the life
left in the aging artist. That's a little too cozy a connection,
especially in regard to a tough-minded individualist like Kubrick.
</P>
<P>
   There is some hard irony, though, in the thought that Kubrick
died a year shy of the millennium, never to see the 2001 he so
unforgettably imagined decades earlier. That vision will inspire
filmmakers and audiences well into the next century, perhaps
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody was a filmmaker for the ages, it was Stanley
Kubrick.!end! &QL;

FAIR TRADE WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   China's recently disclosed use of espionage to develop
miniaturized nuclear warheads suggests many flaws in US
counterintelligence that need to be corrected. There has been a
certain amount of confusion, however, about the proper lessons to
draw from this lapse of security.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report Saturday in The New York Times, beginning
in the mid-1980s a Chinese-American scientist at Los Alamos
pilfered design secrets for an advanced US missile, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage at Los Alamos was first detected in 1995 after
intelligence analysts deduced from Chinese missile test results
that Beijing had been able to emulate the US W-88 missile. The
suspect was identified the following year, but the White House was
not informed of the extent of the problem until 1997. Six months
later President Clinton ordered that security be tightened at Los
Alamos and other nuclears weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   There is no excuse for Los Alamos's lax security, which dates
back to the Reagan and Bush administrations. There can also be no
justification for the dilatory behavior of the Clinton
administration Energy Department, which was first alerted to the
Chinese penetration of Los Alamos in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will be performing its oversight functions if it
investigates allegations that policy makers in the Clinton
administration were slow to take action because they did not want
to do anything that might compromise trade relations and the goal
of a ``strategic partnership'' with China.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, says China
should be denied entry into the World Trade Organization because of
its espionage, he is practicing the politics of the non sequitur.
Winning lower Chinese tariffs for US exports does not become
inimical to US interests because Beijing stole the design of the
W-88 missile. By the same token, there is no reason Clinton can't
get tough with Beijing on the issue of espionage while pursuing
trade relations with China and cultivating a strategic partnership.

JOE DIMAGGIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After he retired, Joe DiMaggio became a cultural icon who was
made to stand for the imagined virtues of a vanished American era.
Yogi Berra stated in plain terms the predicament of being a myth
and a man at the same time. ``I don't think many of us would want
to have tried to be Joe DiMaggio all our life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became a mythic figure _ the dignified, grieving
husband of Marilyn Monroe _ Joe D. had been a ballplayer. His true
domain was the original Yankee Stadium. Fans who saw him pursue a
long drive to center field had the impression that DiMaggio knew
where the ball was going before it left the bat. When he got there,
running in those long, effortless strides that defined his
gracefulness, he would make the catch look easy.
</P>
<P>
   In his prime the Yankee Clipper could throw from center field as
well as anyone who ever played that position. He ran the bases not
like one of today's prima donnas but like the son of an immigrant
Sicilian fisherman who knew that a pennant race was a Darwinian
struggle for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Today's baseball mercenaries talk about the numbers they put up,
as if statistics can be translated into monetary evaluations as
crude as the price of pork bellies on the commodity exchange.
DiMaggio, who died Monday at age 84, had stats worthy of the
diamond's pantheon, but stats alone do not tell the story of his
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   He led the American League in 1939 with a batting average of
.381. In '37 he led the league in RBIs with 137, in runs scored
with 151, and in total bases with 418. His lifetime slugging
percentage _ in the capacious Yankee Stadium _ was sixth of all
time, behind Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Foxx, and
Hank Greenberg. And of course he left behind his record 56-game
hitting streak of 1941. Williams spoke the truth when he said,
``DiMaggio was the best player I ever saw.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe DiMaggio was not about stats or individual excellence.
He was about winning. He carried his teammates to 10 pennants in 13
seasons and to victory in nine of 10 World Series. On the field,
the myth and the man were one.

FAIR TRADE WITH EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing about international trade conflict: There is no
shortage of childish behavior to relieve the monotony of an issue
full of grinding detail.
</P>
<P>
   A long conflict between the European Union and the United States
over bananas _ which neither party grows in any consequential
numbers _ has spilled over and threatens to escalate into something
serious.
</P>
<P>
   Europe wants to give a special break to some of its former
colonies by restricting banana imports from other Central American
nations dominated by US corporations. The United States appealed to
the World Trade Organization, which said the Europeans broke
international rules. The Europeans made some changes, sent them to
the WTO for approval, and are waiting for a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The United States got impatient and on Mar. 4 said it would
impose punitive tariffs on a wide range of European goods unrelated
to bananas. The list is short on the necessities of life: Bath
preparations, plastic handbags, cashmere sweaters, electric coffee
and tea makers, uncoated felt paper, Pecorino cheese (soft),
plastic pocket accessories, candles.
</P>
<P>
   Not much of anyone would care _ except for the folks who make or
want them. The cashmere sweaters, for example, come from the
English-Scottish border country, which depends heavily on sales to
up-scale American retailers. This is the time of year when they
gear up for the Christmas trade. Even the threat of the 100 percent
tariffs the United States is talking about is enough to kill US
interest. No wonder the British Foreign Office summoned the US
ambassador twice to deliver sharp complaints about the threatened
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will all blow over. Trade fights have a way of seeming
unsolvable until the last moment, and the United States has said it
won't impose the tariffs until the WTO has ruled on the modified
banana rules. But the maneuver alone feeds European protectionists
who accuse the United States of bullying. And it has prompted
protests from others that it's getting in the way of real issues.
</P>
<P>
   One might think the time has come to get some adults dealing
with these problems. Enough whining, everyone.

NOMINEES RELAX, REFLECT AT LUNCHEON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ ``Affliction'' co-stars Nick Nolte and James Coburn
looked dapper, while ``Saving Private Ryan'' director Steven
Spielberg and Billy Bob Thornton of ``A Simple Plan'' dressed down.
Brenda Blethyn and Lynn Redgrave were radiant, a far cry from their
unattractive characters in ``Little Voice'' and ``Gods and
Monsters,'' respectively.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's the nice thing for nominees at the Academy Awards
luncheon: It's come as you want. It's not nearly the high-pressure
event that the actual Oscars show, upcoming on March 21, is.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th annual nominees luncheon was held at the Beverly Hilton
on Monday. Nearly 100 nominees from 22 categories dined on roasted
sea bass and beef tenderloin and were presented with certificates
of nomination. Still, those in attendance admitted the pace has
already picked up. ``Shakespeare in Love'' actor Geoffrey Rush,
asked whether this time around is any less dizzying than when he
was nominated for ``Shine'' two years ago, replied simply: ``No.''
Rush said, ``It's a little more familiar this time than the first
time I went on this ride. This time, at least I know where the
scary twists are coming, where they hang you upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush is among three Australians nominated for acting Oscars this
year. Also in attendance were Aussies Cate Blanchett, up for her
role as the queen of England in ``Elizabeth,'' and Rachel
Griffiths, nominated for best supporting actress in ``Hillary and
Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have more nominations per capita than any other
country,'' joked Blanchett, now a stunning blonde after her redhead
role in ``Elizabeth.'' Brazilian Fernanda Montenegro, nominated as
best actress for ``Central Station,'' said she was proud that four
nominated foreign films are from a ``Latin heritage'' (from Brazil,
Italy, Argentina and Spain). Still, she said, she hopes her
countrymen are not getting their hopes too high. ``To win the
Oscar, it has become like winning the World Cup ... to be like
seeing God,'' said Montenegro. ``I'd like to tell my country, it's
almost impossible to win. I'm very stressed, but the moment is also
very beautiful,'' allowed Montenegro, in halting English.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the actors up for Oscars were in attendance. Kathy
Bates, nominated for her role in ``Primary Colors,'' admitted to
being dazzled by the company. ``I'm just trying to keep a cool
head. It's amazing to be in the company of these women,'' said
Bates, whose fellow supporting-actress nominees are Redgrave,
Blethyn, Griffiths and ``Shakespeare's'' Judi Dench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' star Ian McKellen, nominated for his
portrayal of gay film director James Whale, was asked whether he
thought ``doors were opening'' for homosexuals in Hollywood.
``Sometimes I'm optimistic, and sometimes I'm not,'' said McKellen,
who was recently knighted by the Queen Elizabeth II. ``We did it
right, we had a gay director, a gay writer and a gay lead actor ...
you have to keep pushing at your own closet door _ and into the
world beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Actress Emily Watson was also somewhat philosophical when asked
about the controversy surrounding her film, ``Hillary and Jackie,''
especially in England. Some musicians who knew the late Jacqueline
Du Pre, who Watson portrays, have protested that the film is
inaccurate and disrespectful to the brilliant cellist. ``It
surprises me that people think it's not sympathetic to her ... when
you have someone so talented, who starts to lose that talent, would
you expect her not to rage against that?'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte admitted to having ``a little trouble with awards ... I
just don't think there is a best actor or a best film,'' Nolte
said. ``They're all unique, all different.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Spielberg said it never gets any easier to be up
for an Oscar. ``I had the best time at the Golden Globes last year,
when I was up for `Amistad,' because I knew they were going to read
Jim Cameron's name for `Titanic,' and I could just relax,''
Spielberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you actually have a shot at something, it's
torture.'' The director declined to comment on the very competitive
and aggressive ad campaigns being waged by both ``Shakespeare'' and
``Private Ryan'' for Academy votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get up in the morning and like myself ... I need to
take the high road,'' said Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   On a lighter note, triple-nominated composer Randy Newman joked
that if precedent holds, he doesn't expect to bring home any
Oscars. ``I think getting all three would be good. But I don't
think my track record would indicate my chances are very good,''
said Newman, who wrote music for ``Pleasantville,'' ``A Bug's
Life'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   But Newman said with a wink that he won't be too upset if he
ends up empty-handed on Oscar night. ``I've never gone home and
wept and got drunk ... because of THIS,'' he added, to a roar of
laughter from the press. &UR;

WINERIES WELCOME E-WINE IDEA

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Winery organizations embrace the basic idea
of a national Internet wine-locator service but argue that it is
not the solution to problems of conflicting state regulations
related to direct shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Naxon Corp. announced last week that it was creating an Internet
site for wine, and that it had picked up support from the Wine and
Spirits Wholesalers Association and was being backed by an
investment group, Kleiner Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers, that helped
fund America Online, Netscape and Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We applaud any effort that would open up the market for
consumers,'' said Patrick Campbell, president of the Coalition for
Free Trade. ``We wish them the best of luck, but it doesn't solve
the core issue of direct shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Naxon CEO Peter Sisson declined to comment on speculation that
Naxon was working with Amazon.com, the Internet bookseller that
quickly became the darling of Wall Street when it filed its initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of a publicly traded company, I can't comment,''
he said, referring to Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   There are obstacles that could hamper efforts to provide wine
nationwide, winery organizations said. Some of them are logistical,
involving the varying requirements in each state for selling
alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 22 states have laws that automatically enter a
winery into a binding business agreement with a distributor upon
the first transaction between the companies. Regardless of the
distributors' performance, one consumer order could lock a winery
into a business arrangement without the recourse of normal business
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, the state itself is the wholesaler and retailer
of alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already been in touch with several control states and
we have found them quite receptive to making special arrangements
to support our system,'' Sisson said. ``In general, control state
regulators are very interested in acting in the best interest of
their consumers''
</P>
<P>
   Such regulations were stumbling blocks for some predecessors in
trying to establish a wine e-commerce site, like Cellar Masters of
America. Naxon bought Cellar Master's subsidiary Virtual
Distribution, Inc., to obtain its 37 state licenses to operate in
those states, Sisson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also kept four of their employees because of their
tremendous experience with regulatory issues. Other than that, we
have nothing in common with them,'' Sisson said.

 &HT;    New president named to Georgia territory
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael H. Dulan today was named president of
NationsBank in Georgia, making the company veteran the bank's
pointman in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Dulan, 47, had been working here as consumer banking executive
for Georgia and Tennessee since arriving in late 1996 from the
NationsBank office in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He will continue in that role, in addition to his new duties,
said James R. Lientz Jr., NationsBank Midsouth president, who
announced the appointment. Dulan will report to Lientz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident the bank will grow in its leadership in the
state of Georgia under the guidance of Mike Dulan,'' Lientz said.
``With more than 25 years of experience with the bank, he knows the
industry and knows the business of banking.''
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank is the largest player in Georgia banking, with more
than 600 ATMs and 293 offices, including 81 in Kroger stores.
</P>
<P>
   Dulan will focus on Georgia, much as Lientz has done in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   In putting the Georgia operations in Dulan's hands, Lientz taps
a consumer banking veteran who started his career in 1974 at First
National Bank of Dallas, which was later taken over by NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our task over the next few months and years is to keep the
emphasis on good service and provide an even wider array of
products,'' Dulan said. ``We will have to continue, and place even
more emphasis on, training and coaching of the staff to be more
service minded.''
</P>
<P>
   And immediately, the task is to prepare for the August rollout
of the ``new'' Bank of America, the merged bank that includes the
far-flung NationsBank and Bank of America organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Lientz said Dulan came to his attention nearly three years ago,
when he observed the good job the native Oklahoman was doing with
community banking in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got thoughts of changes here in Atlanta, Dulan
immediately came to mind,'' Lientz said. He brought Dulan to
Atlanta in November of 1996 to be consumer bank executive.
</P>
<P>
   Dulan comes from an Oklahoma City family of achievers, including
two strong parents as role models, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Hurlon J. Dulan, was the chief personnel officer for
the Oklahoma City post office and previously was an Army field
captain during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of learning principles of leadership, I learned at
the feet of a master,'' Dulan said. ``And my mom, who played
softball, taught us how to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Play to win,'' she said, ``and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most important personal inspiration to young Dulan was
an older brother, Hurlon Jr., who graduated from Princeton and
Harvard Business School and became a manager in training for
Citibank in the early 1970's. He is now in private business in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly subscribe to the view that effective role models are
not ball players and celebrities, but family members and people in
the community who teach values,'' Dulan said.
</P>
<P>
   Young Mike Dulan, who played two years of football at Oklahoma
as a cornerback, decided on banking and finance early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it became clear that I wasn't going to crack the
National Football League, I decided to major in finance, and that
started my move into banking.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner than Dulan arrived in Atlanta in 1996 did he become
involved in Atlanta community affairs, particularly becoming active
in the Atlanta Neighborhood Development Partnership, Leadership
Atlanta and 100 Black Men of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly excited about his new membership on the board
of the Trust for Public Lands that has embarked on establishing the
narrow bands of parkland on both sides of the Chattahoochee River.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very concerned about preservation and for protecting the
environment,'' Dulan said.
</P>
<P>
   And so how has Dulan and his family adapted to the change from
Dallas to Atlanta, two cities often seen as competitors for
business prominence?
</P>
<P>
   ``We love it hear,'' said Dulan, ``and my wife told me recently
there is no way she intends to go back to Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lientz also made it clear he plans to remain deeply involved in
Georgia affairs , even as his responsibilities now include the huge
small business portfolio of NationsBank all across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue my roles with the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce, the Woodruff Arts Center and the Super Bowl committee,''
Lientiz said. ``I'm not going anywhere.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... he was 14.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years later, in his first game for the minor league San
Francisco Seals, he hit a double and a triple. The next season, he
set a Pacific Coast League record _ and gave a hint of things to
come _ by hitting safely in 61 consecutive games. There was talk of
a major league team buying his contract for $75,000 until a freak
knee accident sustained whle hopping off a bus put Mr. DiMaggio's
career in jeopardy. Only two teams remained interested: the Yankees
and Red Sox. As usual, the Yankees got there first, gaining Mr.
DiMaggio's services from the Seals in return for $25,000 and five
players.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at Yankee Stadium in 1936 _ and less than three
months into the season was on the cover of Time. A year later, he
was appearing in a movie (``Manhattan Merry-Go-Round''), and four
years after that, Les Brown's big band had a hit record with the
refrain, ``Joe, Joe, DiMaggio/We want you on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   The song came out in the summer of 1941, during the two months
and two days of ``the streak.'' Mr. DiMaggio hit .408 during that
period (Williams, it might be noted, hit .412 over the same span).
When his run finally ended, on July 17, it took two standout
defensive plays by Cleveland Indians third baseman Ken Keltner, and
another by shortstop Lou Boudreau, to keep Mr. DiMaggio hitless.
``Well, I'm glad it's over,'' he said afterward, and proceeded to
hit safely in the next 16 games. The oddest footnote to the streak
is that the Yankees tried to reduce his salary for the following
season by $5,000 (he ended up with a $5,000 raise).
</P>
<P>
   Mr. DiMaggio enlisted in the Army Air Force early in 1943, doing
all his service Stateside or in Hawaii. He returned to the Yankees
in 1946, his talents undiminished, but the three seasons he lost
contributed to the relative disparity between the adulation Mr.
DiMaggio inspired and his impressive but not overwhelming career
statistics. Another factor was his having had to take half his
at-bats in a ballpark whose oceanic left field was unforgiving to
righthanded hitters.
</P>
<P>
   There were also his frequent visits to the trainer's room. For
all the fluid elegance of his play, injuries plagued Mr. DiMaggio
throughout his career. Besides the career-threatening knee injury
in San Francisco, he battled bone chips in his throwing arm, bone
spurs in his heels, chronically sore shoulders, a bad ankle, a
blinding eye inflammation, and even tonsillitis. Seven times he
missed a season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. DiMaggio's perfectionism was notorious. Asked once by Cannon
why he never let up on the field, he replied, ``Because there might
be somebody out there who's never seen me play before.'' Age and
injuries took an increasing toll, and after the 1951 season, he
retired from baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever chance Mr. DiMaggio had for obscurity once he left the
Yankees ended when he married Marilyn Monroe two years later, on
Jan. 14, 1954. Whatever chance the marriage had for success ended a
few minutes after that when she told reporters, ``I'm going to
continue my career, but I'm looking forward to being a housewife,
too.'' The idea of Monroe being a housewife was as unlikely as that
of Mr. DiMaggio taking a back seat to his wife's fame.
</P>
<P>
   There is a famous story of an exchange between them after she
went on a USO tour in Korea. Monroe said, ``It was so wonderful,
Joe. You never heard such cheering.'' His reply: ``Yes I have.''
</P>
<P>
   There had long been a contradiction in Mr. DiMaggio. The
reserved, dedicated athlete who stood alone in center field was so
personally reticent that he once turned down $2 million to write
his memoirs when he realized he'd need to describe his private
life. Yet the adored celebrity with the liquid eyes and chiseled
good looks (``Gentlemen,'' the gossip columnist Dorothy Kilgallen
informed her readers, ``he's divine'') was the toast of New York
nightlife.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage had been to an actress, Dorothy Arnold. Their
union lasted 4 1/2 years and produced Mr. DiMaggio's only child,
Joe Jr. The marriage to Monroe lasted barely nine months. ``No man
could be a success in two national pastimes,'' the actor Oscar
Levant quipped when they divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. DiMaggio never got over Monroe, whom he once described as
``a warm, big-hearted girl that everybody took advantage of.'' In
times of trouble, she would turn to him for support, and prior to
her death, in 1962, there was talk of their remarrying. For the
next 15 years, he had a half-dozen roses placed next to her
cemetery crypt three times a week, finally stopping the ritual only
because souvenir seekers kept making off with the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the marriage revealed an emotional vulnerability
that had long been evident to Mr. DiMaggio's intimates. The
pressure he performed under, a pressure imposed as much by himself
as his public, had always been great. Its effects could be seen in
the cigarettes he chain-smoked, the ulcers he developed, and the
endless cups of coffee he drank (appropriately enough, he later
served as spokesman for Mr. Coffee products). As his Yankee
teammate Yogi Berra put it, ``I don't think many of us would want
to have tried to be Joe DiMaggio all our life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, DiMaggio received the nation's highest civilian honor,
the Medal of Freedom. An even more singular tribute had come his
way a decade earlier when Paul Simon wrote ``Mrs. Robinson'' and
young Americans found themselves singing the words, ``Where have
you gone, Joe DiMaggio?/A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.''
(Simon had originally wanted to use the name of his childhood idol,
Mantle, but the syllables didn't scan.) Asked by an interviewer in
1974 about the recording, Mr. DiMaggio was enthusiastic, if
bemused. ``You mean that `Mister Robinson' song? I was really
flattered. I was surprised that those young fellows would think of
an old guy like me . . . I don't have a copy. I think my sister
might. But it really made me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   The discipline that had marked Mr. DiMaggio's playing days
carried over into retirement. When he was well into his 60s, his
trim physique and erect carriage suggested he could still step onto
the diamond and hold his own. Henry Kissinger once shared the
owner's box with Mr. DiMaggio at Yankee Stadium during a playoff
game. The home team was losing, and the former Secretary of State
saw an obvious solution to the Yankees' plight. ``Joe, put on a
uniform _ they can use you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. DiMaggio's friend Toots Shor, the New York restaurateur,
once made a prediction: When Mr. DiMaggio died, his open casket
would lie in St. Patrick's Cathedral and thousands of mourners
would file past saying, ``Joe, you look great.'' Even the premature
silvering of his hair merely served to heighten Mr. DiMaggio's air
of distinction.
</P>
<P>
   It was in a dual capacity, as senior statesman of the game and
former teammate of Gehrig's, that he participated in the ceremonies
honoring Cal Ripken on the night in 1995 when the Baltimore Orioles
shortstop broke what had long been considered a record as
unreachable as Mr. DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, the Yankee
first baseman's string of 2,130 consecutive games played. Also
present was President Clinton. It takes nothing away from the
president to suggest that, had a visitor from outer space been
asked which of the two men appeared to be chief executive of
Earth's greatest nation, the interplanetary traveler would surely
have indicated the immigrant fisherman's son from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's body will be flown to Northern California for burial
in his hometown of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his brother, Dominic, and son, Joe Jr., survivors
include two grandchildren, Paula and Cathy, and four
great-grandchildren.

JOE DIMAGGIO, 84; BASEBALL LEGEND WHO EPITOMIZED ATHLETIC GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the New York Yankees' Hall of Fame center fielder
who uniquely personified athletic grace and patrician bearing, died
early Monday at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio had undergone surgery for lung cancer in October and
during a 99-day hospital stay battled many complications.
</P>
<P>
   Among American athletes, perhaps only Michael Jordan has enjoyed
a mystique comparable to Mr. DiMaggio's. Ted Williams, the Red Sox
Hall of Fame outfielder who was his archrival and sole peer, once
said, ``I've never seen anyone who played the game with more
perfection. He was the best player I ever saw. He seemed to do
everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. DiMaggio's hold on the American imagination was not limited
to the sports page. The hero of Ernest Hemingway's ``The Old Man
and the Sea'' hopes to be ``worthy of the great DiMaggio who does
all things perfectly.'' Simon and Garfunkel fastened upon him as a
symbol of lost American innocence in their 1968 song ``Mrs.
Robinson.'' And Marilyn Monroe made him her second husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``This son of Italian immigrants gave every American something
to believe in,'' said President Clinton. ``He became the very
symbol of American grace, power and skill. I have no doubt that
when future generations look back at the best of America in the
20th century, they will think of the Yankee Clipper and all that he
achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the owner of the Yankees, said in a
statement, ``Like many fans across America, and indeed around the
world, the Yankees are deeply saddened by the passing of Joe
DiMaggio, one of our own and one of the greatest of all time. It
was the class and dignity with which he led his life that made him
part of all of us. I will forever treasure the close friendship we
shared over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, called DiMaggio ``the
personification of grace, class and dignity on the baseball
diamond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As an immigrant's son, he represented the hopes and ideals of
our great country,'' Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   The flag at the Baseball Hall of Fame flag in Cooperstown, N.Y.,
was lowered to half-staff Monday and a wreath was placed around
DiMaggio's plaque.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. DiMaggio's most storied feat was hitting safely in 56
consecutive games in 1941. Considered by many the baseball record
least likely to be surpassed, the hitting streak exemplified the
unflappable consistency of his play. (The closest anyone has come
since is Pete Rose's 44-game streak in 1978.) Mr. DiMaggio won the
American League's Most Valuable Player Award in 1939, 1941, and
1947. Twice he led the league in home runs, 1937 (46) and 1948
(39). Twice he won the batting title, 1939 (.381) and 1940 (.352).
Twice he led in runs batted in, 1941 (125) and 1948 (155).
</P>
<P>
   Yet statistics barely suggest what a nonpareil figure he cut.
Mr. DiMaggio was named to the American League All-Star team in each
of his 13 major league seasons and was elected to the Baseball Hall
of Fame in 1955. Fourteen years later, the Baseball Writers
Association of America voted him ``greatest living all-time
baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, there was an aura about the man variously known
as ``the Yankee Clipper,'' ``Joltin' Joe,'' and ``the Big Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walked into that clubhouse,'' said his teammate Billy
Martin, ``it was like a president or senator walking in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrolling center field in Yankee Stadium from 1936 to 1951
(with three years away for military service during World War II),
he gained a reputation for near-flawless performance that didn't so
much recall any other ballplayer's as it did that of another master
of poetic motion, Fred Astaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw him play,'' wrote the sportswriter Jimmy Cannon,
``you'll never forget him. No one ran with such unhurried grace.
His gifts as an athlete were marvelous because they were subdued.
Here was an outfielder who followed a fly ball with a deft serenity
. . . concerned only with the defeat of awkwardness.''
</P>
<P>
   Great as were Mr. DiMaggio's accomplishments on the diamond, his
persona far exceeded them. Among baseball players, only Babe Ruth,
whose larger-than-life personality rescued the sport after the 1919
``Black Sox'' scandal, and Jackie Robinson, who presaged the coming
of the civil rights era with his breaking of the major leagues'
color barrier in 1947, surpass him as a presence in the American
psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The boisterously Dionysian Ruth was a throwback to an earlier,
more raucous America. Robinson, with his intensity and
extra-athletic significance, looked ahead to a more complex,
self-aware society. Mr. DiMaggio embodied America at mid-century _
or at least America as it liked to see itself _ his Apollonian
reserve off the field and the seeming effortlessness of his play
epitomizing an invincible nation at the height of its power,
gracious in victory and all but impossible to imagine in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. DiMaggio further differed from Ruth and Robinson in having a
name that ended in a vowel. This, too, helped make him such an
evocative figure for mid-century America: the first truly national
hero to come from other than northern European stock. (His parents,
who emigrated from Sicily in 1898, did not become US citizens until
the 1940s.) For millions of immigrants and their children, Mr.
DiMaggio's mastery of the national pastime symbolized their own
arrival as full-fledged Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Here was an ethnic version of Gary Cooper or James Stewart:
soft-spoken, matter-of-fact, supremely capable. In his loner
status, Mr. DiMaggio also resembled the classic American heroes
those actors portrayed. Few individuals have so excelled at a team
sport, but there was always a remoteness about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was and has remained an interior man, ever distant,'' the
writer Gay Talese once observed, ``a kind of male Garbo.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yankee teammate, pitcher Eddie Lopat, once said, ``Joe was the
loneliest man I ever knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Red Sox' Williams, he gave an impression of intrinsic
apartness. ``The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic,''
the English novelist D.H. Lawrence famously argued. Mr. DiMaggio's
special status in the national psyche derives at least in part from
his so clearly demonstrating the force of Lawrence's remark.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this feeling of otherness he communicated, no small part
of Mr. DiMaggio's renown sprang from affiliation. Besides the bond
of ethnicity that made him a revered figure among
Italian-Americans, there was the renown of the team he played for.
Mr. DiMaggio, who appeared in 10 World Series, found his fame
enlarged through association with what was already the United
States' most fabled professional sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   He wore No. 5, an explicit acknowledgement of his being the
legatee of Ruth (No. 3) and Lou Gehrig (No. 4), Ruth's successor as
team leader. Mr. DiMaggio proved eminently worthy of the
responsibility. Where Ruth and Gehrig had brought the Yankees
unparalleled success, he made that success a tradition, one
continued by his Yankee heir, Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Another affiliation, this one fraternal, contributed to the
legend: He was one of three DiMaggio brothers who made it to the
major leagues. Vince played 10 seasons with a total of five teams,
and Dominic played 11 with the Red Sox. It was as if there were so
much DiMaggio magic, it couldn't be contained in just one player.
</P>
<P>
   There were nine DiMaggio siblings in all, four sisters and two
other brothers. Joseph Paul DiMaggio, the next to youngest, was
born in Martinez, Calif., on Nov. 25, 1914, the son of Giuseppe
Paola DiMaggio and Rosalie (Mercurio) DiMaggio. A year after his
birth, the family moved to the North Beach section of San
Francisco. The two oldest DiMaggio boys took up their father's
trade of fisherman. Not young Joe. ``I'd get seasick when the water
was rough,'' he later explained. ``And I couldn't stand the
smell.'' Instead, he led his Boys Club baseball team to a
championship when he was 14.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: We have an employee who walks around
with a scowl on his face and a chip on his shoulder. The staff
complains about him, but everyone knows he is one of our most
knowledgeable employees. We have talked to him about his attitude,
but he looks at us as if we have the problem. How do we deal with
him? D.M.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: In many work situations, one employee with one chip on
the shoulder can easily chip away at the morale and satisfaction of
his or her co-workers. There is even a contagious aspect to this,
as scowls can easily spread from one employee to another.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is to meet with the scowling employee again, but
rather than talking about attitude, talk about behavior. And,
instead of saying what is bothering you, ask what is bothering him.
If his behavior is interfering with teamwork and productivity, he
should be so advised, and should be informed of the possible
consequences associated with such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be helpful to spend more time observing what is
going on in the department. Is it possible that the employees are
engaging in some sort of behavior that is putting a scowl on this
individual's face? A related step is to consider holding more
departmental meetings to review objectives and build consensus and
teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that you have a bright and creative
individual who works best alone. In this age of building jobs
around people's strengths, it is important to review this
employee's job in addition to reviewing him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since our new boss arrived, I cannot believe how many
mistakes I have been making. He must think I am not a good
employee, but that's not true. Should I talk to him about this, or
just focus on my work and try to work better? W.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Rather than focusing on your boss or your work, the first
step is to focus on yourself. Are there any changes or developments
in your life that may be distancing, upsetting or stressful? When a
solid employee starts making a string of mistakes, there is often
something else going on. You are in the best position to know what
that may be.
</P>
<P>
   One apparent change in your life is the new boss. Is there
anything about him that may be interfering with your performance?
Not to go overly Freudian on this issue, but is it possible that
the job is no longer as enjoyable with this new boss, and something
deep inside is telling you to leave?
</P>
<P>
   Depending upon what you learn after some soul-searching, you can
discuss your performance with your new boss. You should wait until
you perform particularly well on a project, and use that as an
opportunity to discuss your work and the steps that you have been
taking to improve your performance. Remember that no matter what
you may say to your boss, your performance is going to speak much
louder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On several occasions, I suggested a better way to do a
certain project. My manager nodded and seemed to hear me, but that
was it. Now I hear that the project is going to be done the way I
suggested, and not one word has been said to me. I want to say
something, but maybe I shouldn't. What do you think? P.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like you believe that if you say something, you
will look like a fool, and if you say nothing, you will feel like
one. The fact is that it would be foolish to do nothing in this
situation.
</P>
<P>
   There are basically two explanations for your manager's
behavior, and neither is particularly uplifting. The first is that
he is the kind of manager who goes through the charade of
listening, while hearing very little. In this case, he was not
paying attention to you and has no recollection that this idea was
originally yours.
</P>
<P>
   The second explanation is that he listened carefully to what you
said, and then took the idea as his own. When it comes to ideas, a
manager who does this has no idea as to what management is all
about.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it is time to meet with him. You should use a candid
and businesslike approach, based heavily on asking questions.
Review the facts regarding the original conversations with him in
which you presented your idea, and then indicate that you are
puzzled over what happened from that point.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the light goes on in his head or not, this entire
situation sheds light on the need for you to use more
assertiveness, repetition, and documentation on key issues or
suggestions that you discuss with him in the future.
</P>

FRANCE PUTS 6 LIBYANS ON TRIAL IN ABSENTIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A French antiterrorism court in Paris put six
high-ranking Libyan officials on trial in absentia Monday on
charges of ordering the bombing of a French DC-10 airliner that
killed 171 people in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from tight international economic sanctions
imposed because of Libyan support for terrorism, Col. Moammar
Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, allowed a French investigator into the
country in 1996 to take evidence against the six suspects. They
include Gadhafi's brother-in-law Abdallah Senoussi.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi, who has called the destruction of the plane an
accident, offered no objection to the trial in absentia, which is
expected to conclude this week with guilty verdicts against all
six. They are, as far as anybody here knows, at liberty in Libya.
Under French law, since they are absent, they cannot have lawyers
contest the charges against them at their trial.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, the investigator who built the case
against them, said international arrest warrants for the defendants
would insure that they never set foot out of Libya again if they
were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against them includes a Samsonite suitcase _ armed
with explosive and provided to Bruguiere by Libyan authorities two
and a half years ago _ that Bruguiere said was identical to the one
that blew up the airliner.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence, the judge said, showed that Libyan operatives
had bought explosives and detonators and plotted to blow up a
French airliner in retaliation for French intervention on behalf of
Chad in a war Libya had been fighting there in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Senoussi, then chief of foreign operations for the Libyan secret
service, is accused of ordering one of the other defendants to
provide a rigged Samsonite suitcase to a Brazzaville, Congo,
passenger who checked it onto the plane, UTA Flight 772 to Paris.
The airline no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb went off while the plane was over Niger, killing all
aboard. The wreckage came down in the desert, and investigators
were later able to piece it together in a hangar at Le Bourget
Airport outside Paris and determine the cause of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and setting off
destructive explosions as part of a terrorist plot, all six could
get life jail terms. These would most likely be only symbolic,
though French officials have said they expect that Gadhafi might
agree to pay reparations to the 232 relatives of the victims with
legal standing in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case, that of Pan American Flight 103, which blew
up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on its way to New York from London in
December 1988, the United States and Britain have not been willing
to settle for trial in absentia of the two defendants. That
explosion killed 270 people in the plane and on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin
Khalifa Fhimah, worked for Libyan intelligence. Three years after
the explosion, Scottish authorities charged them with conspiracy
and murder, asserting that they had rigged an explosive device in a
suitcase and checked it onto the aircraft via a connecting flight
from the Mediterranean island of Malta.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year the United States and Britain had insisted that
the sanctions against Libya, which include a ban on international
flights to and from there, would remain in place until the
defendants were extradited for trial in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   But now the two countries agree that the men can be tried before
a special Scottish court in a third country, the Netherlands, which
is ready to make available a secure compound in Zeist, outside of
Utrecht. The U.N. secretary- general, Kofi Annan, along with
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Saudi and Egyptian
leaders, has been trying to get Gadhafi to agree to send the
defendants there for trial with the understanding that sanctions
would be lifted immediately if he did.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi, now traveling in Egypt, said over the weekend that
agreement might be reached soon, but he has said this many times
before.

ECONOMIC WOES, RESURGENT ANTI-SEMITISM WORRIES RUSSIA'S JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Like many of Russia's Jews, Anatoly Vugman would like
to stay in Russia. But since the financial crisis hit last August,
the 20-year-old student has begun to hedge his bets by attending
evening Hebrew classes.
</P>
<P>
   Vugman has plenty of company. With the economy distressed and
political extremists making anti-Semitic tirades, enrollment in
Hebrew classes here has tripled in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some students have already decided to move to Israel, while
others simply want to know the language of their ancestors. Then
there are Jews like Vugman, an earnest young man with wire-rim
glasses, who seem to be in a quandary about their future.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 opened a fresh chapter
for Russia's Jews. Synagogues and yeshivas started up. The top
echelons of government and finance were opened to people of Jewish
descent.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's Jews are now facing a collapsing economy as well as
the fresh burst of anti-Semitic statements.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly a decade, emigration from Russia to
Israel is starting to climb. Though relatively modest, the number
of Jews leaving for Israel in January, 1,774, was 70 percent higher
than the 975 who left in January of last year.
</P>
<P>
   While many Jews want to remain in Russia, there is a growing
realization that they will have to fight the old battles against
anti-Semitism all over again.
</P>
<P>
   The fears are more acute in Russia's provinces. Just Monday,
Jews in Novosibirsk reported that the lone synagogue in that
Siberian city had been vandalized and swastiskas painted on the
walls. But many Jews in Moscow and in liberal St. Petersburg are
also on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, things were worse in Soviet times,'' said Zinaida,
70, a retired woman who was waiting for a meeting at Moscow's
Choral Synagogue and declined to give her last name. ``But now
anti-Semitism is again threatening us and our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has never been an easy place for Jews. Under the czars
there were restrictions on where Jews could live, and violent
pogroms.
</P>
<P>
   During Soviet times Jews often filled the professional ranks,
but they were generally barred from leading universities and from
top jobs. Worship was suppressed. Jews were identified as a
separate nationality in internal passports.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union unleashed a virtual tidal wave
of emigration. So many Jews have intermarried and assimilated that
estimating how many remain in Russia is an arcane science.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kupovetsky, a demographer at the Jewish studies program at
the Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow, says
there is a ``core'' Jewish population of 332,000. That figure is
derived, in part, from the number who described themselves as
Jewish in the last Soviet census.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate increases severalfold if it includes those with a
Jewish parent or grandparent _ important because Israel accepts
immigrants who can show that at least one grandparent is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   While Jews represent only a small fraction of the country's 147
million people, their status has long been taken as a measure of
Russia's struggle to build a more democratic and tolerant society.
In recent years, in fact, the situation for Jews has largely been
considered to be a Russian success story.
</P>
<P>
   Jews have used their new freedoms to reclaim their heritage.
Moscow State University recently began a joint program of Jewish
studies with Hebrew University. To the tune of ``Hava Nagilah,''
ads for matzo appeared on Russian television during Passover.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist politicians have also been free, however, to exploit
Russia's deep undercurrent of anti-Semitism, which they have done
more frequently since the financial collapse last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has never known democracy, and democracy is a very
intricate thing to put so suddenly on the shoulders of millions who
are used to the tradition of a strong hand,'' said Tankred
Golenpolsky, the editor of the Jewish Gazetta, a Moscow-based
publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days they used to keep horses in the mines and not
take them out until they got old,'' he added. ``When they did they
would have to cover their eyes or they would go blind. Well, Russia
is like a horse that has been taken out without his eyes covered
and is running around and shouting whatever it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews have certainly been a very visible target.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the government team that has guided Russia's painful
transition to a market economy is of Jewish ancestry, as are many
of the country's bankers and tycoons, though few are practicing
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the former prime minister, who adopted his
mother's Ukrainian family name, is part Jewish, as are the former
Kremlin aides Boris Y. Nemtsov and Anatoly B. Chubais. Yegor T.
Gaidar, the former prime minister who promoted a free market, also
has some Jewish ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   But then Jews have also been on different sides of the debate, a
fact overlooked by Russian militant nationalists. Grigory A.
Yavlinksy, the head of the Yabloko Party, who is part Jewish, has
long assailed the Yeltsin government for its halfhearted support of
economic reform. One of the most strident nationalists, Vladimir V.
Zhirinovsky, and Yevgeny M. Primakov, the cautious prime minister,
also have Jewish roots.

<P>
   Neither Zhirinovsky nor Primakov has ever been assailed by
anti-Semites, which Jewish leaders say shows that the recent wave
of anti-Semitism is part of a broader assault on the Western and
pro-capitalist attitudes epitomized by Russia's more liberal Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews in fact believe that their acceptance in Russian
society will ultimately depend on the nation's ability to develop a
capitalist democracy with rising living standards and Western-style
legal protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future for Jews in Russia depends on the success of
economic reform,'' said Kupovetsky.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is the virulent anti-Semitic tirades of extremists like
Albert Makashov, a Communist legislator and former general, that
have alarmed many Jews.
</P>
<P>
   He recently gave a fiery address in the southern Russian town of
Novocherkassk in which he virtually invited Cossacks to ramsack
Jewish homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so brave and cheeky because we are dormant so far,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another self-proclaimed anti-Semite is Aleksandr Barkashov, the
leader of the neo-Fascist group, Russian National Unity, whose
emblem resembles a swastika. He recently told a rally in
Yekaterinburg that he was changing the name of his political groups
to ``Movement Against the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Ilyukhkin, chairman of the Parliament's defense committee
and a Communist, has charged that Yeltsin and Jewish members of his
``inner circle'' are committing ``genocide'' against the Russian
people.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls indicate that these extremists do not speak
for most Russians. And many Russians Jews say that their situation
is not as bad as that of other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average Russian is more upset about the presence of
Caucasians in Moscow than about Jews,'' said Rashid Kaplanov, the
president of Sefer, a Moscow-based center of Jewish studies,
referring to the people from the southern Caucasus mountains
region. ``Still, one does feel vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The main worry for Russia's Jewish leaders is that the barrage
of from the extremists will begin to stir up ordinary Russians,
particularly in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   In Novosibirsk, where the report came Monday that the synagogue
had been vandalized over the weekend, a new rabbi, Shnaior Zalman
Zaklos, had arrived only 10 days before. Miriam Zaklos, his wife,
said in an telephone interview Monday that prayer books were torn
up, and Torah religious scrolls were ripped. The name of the
neo-fascist group, Russian National Unity, was painted on the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   Russian National Unity has also distributed virulently
anti-Semitic material in Borovichi, a town of 70,000 people 240
miles north of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in Moscow there's some regulation,'' Eduard
Alekseyev, the 29-year-old leader of the local Jewish Association,
said in a telephone interview. ``Here swastikas are legal. Its
legal to say, `Yids Get Out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish fears have been aggravated by the mixed response from
mainstream politicians. President Boris N. Yeltsin has denounced
anti-Semitism, and Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow has banned
marches by fascist groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the Communist-led Parliament has refused to censure
Makashov. Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, has criticized
Makashov for his ``intemperance'' but in an appeal to national
sentiment has also implied at times that Russians of Jewish origin
are overrepresented in government and finance.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Zyuganov put it, ``Too many people with strange-sounding
family names mingle in the internal affairs of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews themselves are not always certain about how to fight the
problem. Vladimir A. Gusinsky, a news media tycoon who is the
leader of the Russian Jewish Congress, has taken a head-on
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky said in an interview that he had asked the World
Economic Forum not to invite Zyuganov to its conference in Davos,
Switzerland, because of his failure to condemn the anti-Jewish
remarks by Makashov.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov, in fact, was not invited this year, though organizers
of the forum insist his statements regarding Russian Jews were not
the reason. Many Jews, however, are uncomfortable with too
confrontational a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a dispute between generations,'' observed Rabbi
Pincus Goldschmidt of the Choral Synogogue. ``The older generation,
which lived under Stalin and survived, believes in bending. It
thinks silence is more effective than confrontation. But the young
people are ready to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One prominent Jewish writer, Eduard Topol, stirred up a stormy
debate by publishing an open letter in a Russian newspaper urging
Jewish financiers to devote their energies _ and their newly made
millions _ to the common good.
</P>
<P>
   Topol wrote that such pre-emptive measures would defuse
anti-Semitic sentiment, but critics say his letter may encourage
the very sentiments he deplores.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews have strayed so far from their traditions, however,
that they are not above making anti-Semitic slights themselves.
When Nemtsov, the reform-minded Kremlin aide, sought to combat the
influence of Russia's tycoons last year, the financier Boris
Berezovsky responded with an anti-Semitic jibe.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, a Jew who once held an Israeli passport but who
christened his infant son in the Russian Orthodox faith, said
Nemtsov would never be elected president because his mother was
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov, he sneered, has a ``purely genetic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the after-school center on Vadkovsky Pereulok, in central
Moscow, the worries are palpable. On Sundays, some 700 Russians
attend Hebrew classes here and even on weekdays several classrooms
are full.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Levy, the director of the Moscow office of the Jewish
Agency for Israel, which assists Jews in emigrating, says that
immigration to Israel could reach 20,000 in 1999, compared with
fewer than 15,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That is small compared with the massive wave of emigration that
came on the heels of the Soviet Union's demise, but it is still a
significant change.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism is just one factor in decisions to emigrate.
Before the financial crisis, many young and middle-aged
professionals felt they had a better chance of making good in
Russia than they would if they started over again in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But now many are worried about building a future for their
children. And unlike most of Russia's ethnic groups, Jews have a
homeland to which they can go.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Rechistyev, a 38-year-old entrepreneur who is studying
Hebrew, declared he had made up his mind to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian history here has always been stormy,'' Rechistyev
said. ``We have had enough of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Vugman, a student at one of Moscow's most prestigious management
academies, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Jew, and I want to know the language of my parents,''
he said. ``But I don't want to live in another country.
Anti-Semitism is not the state policy. There is not complete
anarchy in the country, and we are not threatened by pogroms. None
of that has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a sharp retort from Irma Yelasvili, a 28-year-old
Jew who moved to Moscow from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia
five years ago, ``When the pogroms happen, it will be too late to
leave. It will be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   As the class resumed, Vugman seemed to be careworn and tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know my wife is Russian and I am sure her parents would
not want her to emigrate to Israel,'' he added softly. ``But maybe
in the future we will go to the United States, Canada or Israel,
after all.''

 &HT;    Lady Jackets stung by NIT news
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Tech women did not have as much at stake
Sunday as some teams, because they were not anticipating an NCAA
bid, but the news that they didn't make the women's NIT was
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Jackets, who finished 13-14 after their quarterfinal
loss to North Carolina in the ACC tournament, were passed over
because of their losing record. The NIT field, which expanded from
16 to 32 teams this year, includes a number of high-profile
programs such as Washington, Colorado, Wisconsin and Baylor, last
year's runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us they weren't going to take any teams with losing
records,'' Tech coach Agnus Berenato said. ``We're disappointed,
but we know that every game counts. If we win one more game, then
maybe we're in. We're just going to try to come back next year and
do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys' bracket?
</P>
<P>
   Call Mulder and Scully. For several years now, there's been a
growing conspiracy theory that top male-coached teams are being
lumped together in the same bracket. The conspiracy theorists will
have a field day if all four top seeds in the Mideast advance to
the Sweet 16 in Cincinnati. UConn, coached by Geno Auriemma, is the
top seed, followed by Jim Davis' Clemson team and Georgia with Andy
Landers. The No. 4 seed is Iowa State, which is enjoying its
greatest success under Bill Fennelly.
</P>
<P>
   In the West are the other two Top 16 seeds coached by men: No. 1
Louisiana Tech, with Leon Barmore, and second-seeded Colorado
State, led by Tom Collen. The East and Midwest regionals are all
women in the top four seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma, whose status as the most recognizable and
controversial male coach in women's basketball is examined in the
current issue of Sports Illustrated for Women, was asked by the
Hartford Courant about the composition of the Mideast bracket:
``Let's just say there are some very experienced gentlemen in that
regional.''
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, underestimate us
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the attention Tennessee gets these days, UConn is
still the darling of the East Coast media. And it sure helps when a
national television commentator is only four years removed from
your program. ESPN studio analyst Rebecca Lobo, who led the Huskies
to the NCAA title in 1995, promptly tagged UConn the favorite in
what she termed a ``weak'' Mideast regional.
</P>
<P>
   That elicited a chuckle or two from Davis of Clemson, whose team
is seeded No. 2, the best in program history. ``I guess the rest of
us are just going to have a good time and then concede to Geno and
the girls,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of slight doesn't seem to bother Davis. After North
Carolina coach Sylvia Hatchell complained that Davis' starting
guards, Itoro Umoh and Amy Geren, should not both have been
selected first-team All-ACC, Clemson whipped the Tar Heels in the
ACC tournament finals.
</P>
<P>
   SEC coaches 'stunned'
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of eight SEC teams in the NCAA _ a women's record
for one conference _ certainly took league coaches by surprise. In
fact, they were so surprised they didn't have time to spout off the
``I told you sos'' that usually accompany their complaints that
they should have gotten more teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned it happened, but also very pleased,'' said coach
Sue Gunter of LSU, whose team is the No. 4 seed in the West. ``I
thought there were eight teams that deserved to go, but I didn't
think it would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida (19-13), which became the first women's at-large team to
get in despite a losing conference record, was considered out of
the tourney until the brackets came out with the Lady Gators as a
No. 11 seed in the Midwest Regional, where they play Arizona on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought we were a bubble team,'' said Florida coach
Carol Ross , whose team had the fourth-toughest schedule in the
country.

COURT REFUSES TO BLOCK `BORN KILLERS' CIVIL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court Monday refused to stop a lawsuit charging that
the 1994 film ``Natural Born Killers'' incited a Louisiana couple
to shoot and seriously injure a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, brought by the shooting victim's family, accuses
director Oliver Stone, Time Warner Entertainment Co., and others of
intentionally inspiring a real-life crime spree that mimicked the
plot of the film, in which a couple played by Woody Harrelson and
Juliette Lewis embarked on a series of murders and robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment or dissent, the court cleared the way for the
case to proceed by letting stand a Louisiana appeals court ruling
that the film was not subject to free-speech protection because it
allegedly incited ``imminent lawless activity.''
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's action was not a ruling but simply a denial of
review, the case challenges First Amendment precedents and could
redefine standards of liability in the entertainment industry,
opening the door to similar suits against book publishers, film and
television producers, musicians and other artists. Entertainment
industry leaders are watching the case closely, and the filmmakers'
appeal was supported by a friend-of-the-court brief signed by 27
media groups, ranging from ABC, Inc., to the Freedom to Read
Foundation to the Video Software Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to defend vigorously the constitutional
rights of artists and directors to express their creative ideas
without fear of liability,'' said John Schulman, general counsel
for Warner Bros., the division of Time Warner that produced the
movie. ``We are fully confident that the courts will ultimately
uphold those rights in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit is being brought by the family of Patsy Ann Byers, who
was shot and paralyzed during a March 8, 1995, robbery at a
convenience store in Ponchatoula, La. The suit alleges that the
assailants, Sarah Edmonson and Benjamin Darras, watched the Stone
movie before launching their violent spree. Byers died last year of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Simpson, one of three lawyers for the Byers family, said
he estimates the damages could be as high as $5 million to $6
million. But he conceded the case would be difficult to prove:
``Put it this way, we have a rough row to hoe, since we ing a phone
interview from his office in Amite, La. The plaintiffs, he said,
are basing their case on an April 1996 interview in which Stone
said, ``The most pacifistic people in the world said they came out
of this movie and wanted to kill somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which depicts a violent, celebrity-driven culture, has
been a center of controversy nationwide. A 1995 murder in Avon,
Mass. was dubbed the ``Natural Born Killer case'' after one of the
three men accused of killing a disabled veteran allegedly said,
``Haven't you seen `Natural Born Killers' before?'' when he was
confronted about his bloody clothing. That case sparked Bob Dole,
then Senate majority leader, to lash out against violence in
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   A 1969 Supreme Court decision ruled that people can only be
prosecuted or punished for advocating illegal action if they
specifically incite ``imminent unlawful action.'' In several
precedent-setting cases, in which the families of teenagers who
died sued over media influence, the courts have ruled in favor of
Hustler Magazine, NBC, Inc., and the heavy metal group Judas
Priest.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Natural Born Killers'' case and a lawsuit pending in
Maryland could push the boundaries of free expression law, some
legal scholars said. Last April, the Supreme Court allowed a case
to proceed against Paladin Press, which published a book called
``Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors.'' A hit
man in Maryland read the book and killed three people, and their
families are suing the publisher, alleging that the book incited
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Supreme Court says that the (1969 precedent) may not
apply fully in some of these cases, then there is at least some
greater risk of liability,'' said Frederick Schauer, Frank Stanton
professor of the First Amendment at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government. Schauer, however, cautioned that Monday's ruling does
not imply a change in precedent; the Supreme Court agrees to hear
fewer than 100 of the more than 6,000 appeals it receives each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Stone could not be reached for comment Monday.

   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ Beneath a volcano still scarred by the
hurricane-induced mudslide that occurred last October, President
Clinton vowed Monday to help Nicaraguans reclaim their lives and
ravaged land.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hurricane, a mudslide, they can destroy lives, they can
destroy homes, they can destroy a life's work,'' the president said
as blinding dust swept through a schoolyard in the town of
Posoltega where he spoke. ``But they must not be allowed to destroy
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced that the United States would provide an
additional $120 million to build temporary shelters, repair roads,
provide medical care and remove land mines uprooted by the
torrential rains and mudslides of the hurricane. But Clinton's
request for nearly $1 billion in additional disaster relief for
Central America is stalled in Congress in a partisan dispute over
the source of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Casitas volcano, near Posoltega, 70 miles northwest of Managua,
was the scene of the deadliest disaster wrought by the hurricane
last October: a 30-foot torrent of mud that buried two villages, El
Porvenir and Rolando Rodriguez. Some 2,000 people were killed in
the mudslide, many of them buried alive. Thousands were left
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of a four-day, four-nation tour of Central
America, Clinton saw the remnants of the disaster in Nicaragua,
including the single house that remains of the two villages and the
shallow graves of hundreds of victims of the storm. Thousands of
residents are still in temporary shelters of plastic sheeting and
corrugated metal atop the packed brown dirt left by the volcanic
mudslide.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton placed a spray of flowers at the grave of one victim, a
6-year-old girl crushed by the slide. She was one of many victims
who for public-health reasons were not buried but cremated where
they lay, their remains then strewn with dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Clinton said he had not appreciated the extent of the
catastrophe until he saw the scene himself.
</P>
<P>
   In his public remarks, made on the grounds of the Jose Dolores
Toruno Lopez High School, Clinton alluded to Nicaragua's revolution
and counterrevolution of the 1980s and its two democratic elections
since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this decade,'' the president said, ``with courage and with
strength you have created a new Nicaragua. You have earned the
world's admiration and now you deserve the world's support in this
moment of need.'' The aid that Clinton announced Monday is to come
from Agency for International Development funds already included in
the current year's budget. An aid proposal worth $956 million is
stalled in Congress in a dispute over how to pay it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had hoped to deliver the nearly $1 billion in aid during
his trip this week. But House and Senate Republicans voted last
week to attach conditions to the relief bill that the White House
finds unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute will most likely take weeks or months to resolve,
forcing Clinton to dip into aid agency coffers to pay for a much
smaller effort. The country is to get help on housing, health care,
education, road and bridge repair and the removal of land mines
left from the civil wars of the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already given about $300 million in
disaster aid to the region, through civilian relief agencies as
well as the Defense Department, which provided earth-moving
equipment and temporary bridges for the hundreds of spans washed
out by the rains.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration also temporarily suspended deportations of
Central Americans who illegally entered the United States to escape
the effects of the hurricane. But preparations are under way to
force the return of many of those refugees, a development that has
created friction with the region's governments, which say they
cannot provide housing or sustenance for them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised Monday to seek a ``fair solution'' to the
refugee issue but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its disaster relief program, the administration also
deferred for two years all bilateral debt payments owed to the
United States by Nicaragua and Honduras. That concession would
relieve the two countries' obligation to pay $54 million in
interest payments. The administration is also asking other nations
holding debt from Central America to forgive or defer payments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Peace Corps is expanding its presence in the
region to help rebuild, according to Mark Gearan, the Peace Corps
director, who accompanied Clinton on the trip. The 500 Peace Corps
volunteers already working in the countries hardest hit by the
storm will be reinforced by as many as 100 workers for short-term
emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   They belong to the Crisis Corps, a new Peace Corps program that
enlists former volunteers to return for six-month stints to the
countries where they served, sometimes decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go back to their country or region of service,'' Gearan
said aboard Air Force One Monday morning, ``because they know the
language, the people, the culture, and they're literally ready at
Day One to make a difference in disaster relief.''
</P>
<P>
   In a small gesture, White House staff members collected pencils,
pens and pads of paper to distribute to Posoltega schoolchildren
whose classrooms were destroyed. Aides unloaded six boxes of the
supplies from Air Force One in Managua and transferred them to the
helicopters that took the president's party to Posoltega.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was greeted at Sandino Airport in Managua and introduced
in Posoltega by Arnoldo Aleman, president of Nicaragua. Clinton is
the first American president to visit the country since Lyndon
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman, a former coffee grower who leads the center-right
Liberal Alliance, said American and other international assistance
had allowed Nicaragua to begin clearing roads, planting fields,
building housing and reopening schools. ``Most importantly,'' he
said, ``hope and faith in our national destiny have returned.'' He
added, ``Welcome, President Clinton, to Nicaragua, a beautiful and
brave land that does not surrender to its sorrows.''

COURT REFUSES TO BLOCK `BORN KILLERS' CIVIL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>

 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court Monday refused to stop a lawsuit charging that
the 1994 film ``Natural Born Killers'' incited a Louisiana couple
to shoot and seriously injure a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, brought by the shooting victim's family, accuses
director Oliver Stone, Time Warner Entertainment Co., and others of
intentionally inspiring a real-life crime spree that mimicked the
plot of the film, in which a couple played by Woody Harrelson and
Juliette Lewis embarked on a series of murders and robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment or dissent, the court cleared the way for the
case to proceed by letting stand a Louisiana appeals court ruling
that the film was not subject to free-speech protection because it
allegedly incited ``imminent lawless activity.''
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's action was not a ruling but simply a denial of
review, the case challenges First Amendment precedents and could
redefine standards of liability in the entertainment industry,
opening the door to similar suits against book publishers, film and
television producers, musicians and other artists. Entertainment
industry leaders are watching the case closely, and the filmmakers'
appeal was supported by a friend-of-the-court brief signed by 27
media groups, ranging from ABC, Inc., to the Freedom to Read
Foundation to the Video Software Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to defend vigorously the constitutional
rights of artists and directors to express their creative ideas
without fear of liability,'' said John Schulman, general counsel
for Warner Bros., the division of Time Warner that produced the
movie. ``We are fully confident that the courts will ultimately
uphold those rights in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit is being brought by the family of Patsy Ann Byers, who
was shot and paralyzed during a March 8, 1995, robbery at a
convenience store in Ponchatoula, La. The suit alleges that the
assailants, Sarah Edmonson and Benjamin Darras, watched the Stone
movie before launching their violent spree. Byers died last year of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Simpson, one of three lawyers for the Byers family, said
he estimates the damages could be as high as $5 million to $6
million. But he conceded the case would be difficult to prove:
``Put it this way, we have a rough row to hoe, since we ing a phone
interview from his office in Amite, La. The plaintiffs, he said,
are basing their case on an April 1996 interview in which Stone
said, ``The most pacifistic people in the world said they came out
of this movie and wanted to kill somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which depicts a violent, celebrity-driven culture, has
been a center of controversy nationwide. A 1995 murder in Avon,
Mass. was dubbed the ``Natural Born Killer case'' after one of the
three men accused of killing a disabled veteran allegedly said,
``Haven't you seen `Natural Born Killers' before?'' when he was
confronted about his bloody clothing. That case sparked Bob Dole,
then Senate majority leader, to lash out against violence in
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   A 1969 Supreme Court decision ruled that people can only be
prosecuted or punished for advocating illegal action if they
specifically incite ``imminent unlawful action.'' In several
precedent-setting cases, in which the families of teenagers who
died sued over media influence, the courts have ruled in favor of
Hustler Magazine, NBC, Inc., and the heavy metal group Judas
Priest.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Natural Born Killers'' case and a lawsuit pending in
Maryland could push the boundaries of free expression law, some
legal scholars said. Last April, the Supreme Court allowed a case
to proceed against Paladin Press, which published a book called
``Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors.'' A hit
man in Maryland read the book and killed three people, and their
families are suing the publisher, alleging that the book incited
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Supreme Court says that the (1969 precedent) may not
apply fully in some of these cases, then there is at least some
greater risk of liability,'' said Frederick Schauer, Frank Stanton
professor of the First Amendment at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government. Schauer, however, cautioned that Monday's ruling does
not imply a change in precedent; the Supreme Court agrees to hear
fewer than 100 of the more than 6,000 appeals it receives each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Stone could not be reached for comment Monday.

ILLINOIS TRIAL EXPECTED TO JOLT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (wg)  
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a case that could have reverberations throughout
the nation's criminal justice system, a group of seven prosecutors
and sheriff's deputies are to go on trial on Tuesday on charges
that they conspired to frame an innocent man.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, charged with perjury and conspiring to obstruct
justice, are accused of knowingly using false evidence or
withholding evidence in order to convict a man of the 1983 rape and
murder of a 10-year-old girl in DuPage County, outside Chicago. The
man, Rolando Cruz, was ultimately exonerated in 1995 after spending
10 years on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it is almost unheard of to put prosecutors on trial
for these kinds of offenses, in part because it is considered so
difficult to covincingly explain to a jury why prosecutors would
accuse someone if they had doubts about the person's guilt. If the
prosecutors in this case are convicted, experts said, they would be
the first prosecutors found guilty of a felony for this kind of
prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely rare,'' said Ron Allen, a professor of
criminal law at Northwestern University, who added that this case
was different from accusations of bribery or corruption that have
resulted in indictments of prosecutors in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This prosecution emerged out of the everyday actions of the
prosecutors,'' Allen said. ``When you're solving a crime,
especially a crime like the one they were investigating, you have
to make difficult decisions often based on ambiguous information
and those decisions are what led us here. The fact is, the system
makes mistakes; and the question being asked here is, how do you
deal with those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is hard to track cases going back decades, a search by
the Chicago Tribune turned up only six other instances nationally
in this century in which prosecutors have faced criminal charges
alleging similar misconduct. Of those prosecutors, the newspaper
reported, two were convicted of misdemeanors and fined $500; two
were acquitted; and charges were dropped against the other two
before trial.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the charges involve allegations that sheriff's deputies
fabricated a story that Cruz had told him about a detailed dream he
had about the girl's murder, and that prosecutors presented the
deputies' testimony knowing it was false. Other charges contend
that a prosecutor failed to tell defense attorneys that another
lawyer had told him in 1985 that a client admitted to killing the
girl.

CHILD ABUSE EXPERTS DEBUNK NEW EAPPEN DEATH THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS AND PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new and legally explosive theory that Matthew Eappen died not
from shaking but from strangulation as much as 48 hours previously
came under intense fire Monday from child abuse experts who called
it illogical and medically unsound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on e-mail all day'' with other child abuse experts
``and everybody's scratching their heads and saying, where did he
get this time frame _ there's nothing in the literature to support
it,'' said Dr. Robert Reece, director of the New England Medical
Center's Child Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
   His and others' criticism of the strangulation theory, put
forward on the CBS-TV show ``60 Minutes'' show Sunday, again
highlighted the stunningly divergent opinions of the same evidence
that scientific experts, even in the same field, can reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on who's doing the interpreting, and with what
incentive,'' said Dr. Marcia Angell, executive editor of the New
England Journal of Medicine. ``In any legal case, there are plenty
of incentives, and I smell a lot of legal activity here.'' Angell
said she was not familiar with the specifics of the evidence in the
death of Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   The new theory by Dr. Floyd Gilles, a neuropathologist at
Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, not only brings an entirely new
putative cause of death into the case, but suggests that it may
have been caused by someone other than British nanny Louise
Woodward, who was convicted of involuntary manslaugther of the
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Reece, who served as a prosecution consultant during the
Woodward trial but did not testify, said he was familiar with a
1987 journal article in which Gilles and others reported on the
deaths of three children by strangling. But Reece said that paper
does not support Gilles' argument that strangling in young children
can have such a delayed effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't account for the fact that Matthew was fine at
11:30'' the morning of his death, said Reece in an interview. ``You
don't lie around for 24 or 48 hours with brain damage and then
collapse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cindy Christian, head of the child abuse program at
Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to imply that the baby would be (seemingly
health) for 48 hours and then would go, kerplunk,'' said Christian.
She also objected that Gilles's argument failed to explain other
injuries noted by doctors who examined Matthew, including broken
blood vessels in the retina of the eye, a skull fracture and a
swelling and blood accumulation, or hematoma, on his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eli Newberger, a pediatrician and director of family
development programs at Children's Hospital in Boston and who
testified for the prosecution against Woodward, said Monday that
although the editing of his comments on ``60 Minutes'' seemed to
suggest he found Gilles's theory plausible, this wasn't the case.
``I never gave that any serious credence,'' he said. ``It makes
absolutely no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Reece, who in addition to his New England Medical Center
position is director of professional education for the
Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
attacked Gilles's credibility, saying his expertise isn't in child
abuse and he doesn't see patients clinically.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles's turn in the media limelight, said Reece, ``is highly
irresponsible and a reflection of academic hubris.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillis, and a colleague, Dr. Marvin Nelson, defended their
findings at a press conference Monday, saying they would stand up
to independent scrutiny. But as the latest tempest swirls around a
case that has worked its way through both the criminal and civil
court systems, it seems more likely that this newest theory may
simply fade away because the legal reality of testing it is so
risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great downside to moving for a new trial is you may get
it,'' said Marc Perlin, associate dean and professor at Suffolk Law
School in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the lawyers for Woodward are a long way from
taking that step _ one that could only be taken at Woodward's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the decision for the client to make,'' Harvey
Silverglate, a member of Woodward's defense team, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Silverglate said he wants to do is to speak to
Dr. Gillis and his colleague, Dr. Marvin Nelson, who told the CBS
news program that he'd found evidence that the baby had fractured
ribs and had been punched hard in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with the Los Angeles doctors, Silverglate said he
would like to bring all of the duelling experts together in one
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have preferred that the review of the evidence be
done by an independent organization like the National Academy of
Science or some other independent, prestigious medical or
scientific organization,'' said Silverglate. ``Instead, it was done
by `60 Minutes,' which in our view is better than nothing. . . . We
are very interested not only because of Louise Woodward, but
because other people have been convicted with fallacious
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Middlesex (Mass.) District Attorney Martha Coakley, who
helped prosecute Woodward before becoming district attorney,
dismissed Silverglate's suggestion of a meeting of the scientific
minds as ``a crazy idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see if there's anyone else in the country who has a
theory as to how Matthew Eappen died,'' Coakley said caustically.
``Because one doctor on the West Coast has a new theory?''

CHICAGO: the girl. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trial here will offer an unusual look inside the process
that prosecutors and the police go through when tackling a
complicated investigation, in this case one of the area's most
grisly and frightening murders, one that law enforcement officials
were under tremendous pressure to solve.
</P>
<P>
   One impression that comes through is that the investigation and
prosecution of Cruz was unwieldy and bedeviled from the outset.
Cruz was someone who initially was courted by detectives as a
source of rumors about the killing. He was not indicted until 13
months after the murder. Nine months after Cruz was arrested, a
detective resigned after expressing doubts about the case. In 1992,
a lawyer in the Illinois attorney general's office in charge of
fighting Cruz's appeals, resigned, saying she believed Cruz was
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is coming at a difficult time for the Illinois justice
system, which has seen 11 death row inmates freed after
investigations found evidence of their innocence. Defense attorneys
and critics of the criminal justice system across the country say
this case may pull a veil off unacceptable prosecutorial and
investigative practices that they believe are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors worry that the case could have a chilling
effect, causing prosecutors to hesitate as they second-guess their
actions. Others say these allegations, if true, are an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Kent Schaffer, director of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said ``the important thing
about this case is it's going to tell prosecutors that they are not
immune from prosecution if they hide evidence, if they suborn
perjury or if they go after somebody who has not committed the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the special prosecutor in the case,
William J. Kunkle Jr., known for prosecuting John Wayne Gacy, the
serial killer, will argue that some or all of the defendants knew
Cruz was innocent, or honestly believed he was guilty but cut
corners to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The men, known as the DuPage Seven, have all pleaded not guilty.
The parents of the murdered girl, Tom and Pat Nicarico, are
supporting the DuPage Seven and have praised their work and
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The four sheriff's officers, James T. Montesano, Thomas E.
Vosburgh, Dennis Kurzawa, and Robert L. Winkler, are still working
for the sheriff's department. One of the former prosecutors,
Patrick J. King Jr., is now an assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago.
Another, Thomas L. Knight, has a private law practice; and the
third, Robert K. Kilander, is a DuPage County judge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The DuPage Seven case emerged out of the long, intricate
prosecution of Cruz, now 38, and another man, Alejandro Hernandez,
now 35, for the sexual assault and murder of Jeanine Nicarico, who
was home alone from school with a cold one February day when
someone kicked in the front door of her house in the affluent town
of Naperville and abducted her. Her body was found two days later
in a wooded area about six miles away and the crime, in a suburb
hardly used to such inexplicable violence, stunned the community.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was also convicted of the murder, sentenced to death
and then, in a second trial three years later, sentenced to 80
years in prison. He, too, was exonerated in 1995, but a judge ruled
that the DuPage Seven case should focus only on allegations in the
Cruz case.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those allegations involve the main strategy used to
convict Cruz and Hernandez: testimony by two of the sheriff's
deputies, Vosburgh and Kurzawa, that Cruz told them he had had a
dream about Jeanine's killing and revealed details the deputies
said only the killer could know.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz and his lawyers have repeatedly said that the deputies
fabricated the dream, and that there was no written investigator's
report about it. In 1995, in Cruz's third trial (his two previous
convictions had been overturned on appeal), another sheriff's
officer, Montesano, said he had testified falsely that the deputies
had informed him about Cruz's dream. As a result, the judge
acquitted Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Vosburgh's lawyer, Brian Telander, said on Monday that he would
present testimony from six of the grand jurors who originally
indicted Cruz, all of whom say that, although there is no written
record, Cruz babbled to them that he had had a dream about the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler is charged with falsely testifying that Cruz told him
about acquiring and disposing of a car used in the murder. King and
Knight are accused of presenting the false testimony, knowing it
was false. Kilander is charged with failing to inform defense
attorneys that a lawyer for a convicted child rapist and murderer
named Brian Dugan had told him that Dugan admitted to killing
Jeanine.
</P>
<P>
   Kilander's lawyer, Ronald D. Menaker, suggested that his client
had fulfilled his obligation because he had told defense attorneys
about an interview he had with Dugan shortly after he talked with
Dugan's lawyer. Lawyers for the other defendants either declined to
comment or did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Dugan, serving a life sentence for two rapes and murders, was
linked to the Nicarico murder by DNA testing in 1989, but has not
been charged in the case. He has said he will only talk with
authorities if they promise to spare him from execution.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Kunkle and his team have a tough task ahead of them.
They will not only have to prove that the sheriff's deputies
fabricated evidence, but that the prosecutors knew the evidence was
false. They also have to convince a jury to believe _ over the
assertions of upstanding law enforcement officers _ the contention
by Cruz, known at the time to be a street punk, that he never
described a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got very difficult problems because he's trying some
people of significant stature who are well-respected,'' said
Terrance A. Norton, a former federal prosecutor who is now a
clinical professor of law at Chicago-Kent College of law.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest job of all, however, may be to make the case that
the prosecutors, perhaps because they were under pressure to solve
a horrifying crime, behaved in a way that was criminal and not just
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between incompetent prosecutors and
criminal prosecutors,'' Allen of Northwestern said, ``and I think
that's going to be difficult to prove.''

CONSERVATIVES NEAR VICTORY IN EL SALVADOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR _ Despite widespread voter apathy that resulted in
a low turnout during Sunday's presidential elections, El Salvador's
ruling conservative party appeared headed toward an outright
victory over leftist opponents Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released Monday by the country's Supreme Electoral
Tribunal showed that 39-year-old Francisco Flores, candidate of the
Republican Nationalist Alliance, garnered almost 52 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Flores's closest rival, 44-year-old Facundo Guardado of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, had 29.3 percent with
about 93 percent of the votes counted. Flores needed 50 percent to
avoid an April runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for all Salvadorans,'' Flores said in a
press conference Sunday night, where he claimed victory less than
three hours after polls closed. He said his campaign had been
conducted in a ``positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 40 percent of El Salvador's 3 million registered voters
cast ballots Sunday in the peaceful and orderly elections.
Observers blamed the lower-than-expected turnout on the country's
arcane registration process, a lackluster campaign, and economic
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   The victory marked a dramatic triumph for the former philosophy
professor who studied at Amherst College and in California. His
campaign announcement a year ago had surprised many.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Flores portrayed himself as a more
independent voice in the party, staying away from the anticommunist
themes that became the Republican Nationalist Alliance's trademark
during the civil war years. Instead, Flores focused on El
Salvador's growing crime and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory marked a dramatic turnaround for the
Republican Nationalist Alliance and the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, the former guerrilla group that became a
political party after the civil war ended in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During midterm elections two years ago, momentum seemed to favor
the Front, captured the San Salvador mayor's office and came within
one seat of matching the ruling party's power in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But the Front was split between hardline socialists and
moderates during the candidate selection process.

<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ Kicking off a four-day tour of Central
America, President Clinton on Monday toured one of the worst
horrors left by Hurricane Mitch, but offered a fraction of the
reconstruction help he had hoped to deliver to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The president walked through the ruins of two neighboring
villages where 2,000 people were killed when 40 feet of mud crushed
their communities in late October.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was the first by a U.S. president to Nicaragua since
1968, when President Johnson visited the country. President Clinton
was not accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was
sidelined with a recurring back injury.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton arrived with little aid to offer. Some Central
American leaders also are rankled over U.S. immigration policy,
which began this week forcing thousands of illegal immigrants to
return to the stricken region where little shelter and no jobs
await them.
</P>
<P>
   While the visit to Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala helps turn attention from the president's scandals, which
seem to get new life each week, it also helps burnish his image as
a caring international leader.
</P>
<P>
   It also will freshen in the American public's mind the images of
the devastation from Hurricane Mitch, the worst national disaster
to hit the Americas. The storm left more than 9,000 dead, thousands
more homeless, and as much as $10 billion in infrastructure damage
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   No area was hit harder than Posoltega, an agricultural area near
the base of La Casita volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Along the road that Clinton took to one of the two villages,
small wooden crosses dotted the hard, brown dirt. The landscape was
broken only by twisted trees and scattered encampments of tents
made from plastic sheeting and corrugated tin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am moved, I am humbled,'' Clinton said moments after he and
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman placed flowers at the shallow
grave of a 6-year-old student. The youngster was buried at the spot
where she died when the mudslide smothered part of her school as it
spread over 60-square miles northwest of Managua.
</P>
<P>
   Even vivid news coverage of the late-October storm's damage
``cannot convey the depth of destruction,'' Clinton told reporters.
``No picture can convey the feeling of seeing the outline of that
small child's body by her grave and seeing the remnants of her
skeleton.''
</P>
<P>
   At Jose Delores Toruna High School, Clinton met with the
homeless and jobless survivors, many of whom still live in plastic
tents. Mitch swept away their villages or encased their homes in
mud four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   An intact portion of the building was covered with soot,
indicating where survivors sought shelter, using students' desks
and chairs to build fires for cooking. The homeless villagers were
relocated four weeks ago so classes could resume.
</P>
<P>
   To help reopen the school, Clinton delivered 3,000 pounds of
supplies, including six boxes unloaded from Air Force One. The
boxes contained pens, pencils and writing tables collected from
White House staff members.
</P>
<P>
   The president also announced that the U.S. government would
spend $120 million in the region to improve health care, build
temporary shelters and support schools. Immediately after the
storm, the United States sent about $350 million in disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   For Nicaragua, U.S. aid will amount to:
</P>
<P>
   _ $10.6 million from the Agency for International Development to
repair, equip and staff health clinics, and $12.5 million for
elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another $1.5 million in AID money for the International Red
Cross to build 4,000 temporary homes starting this month.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1.8 million from the State Department to find and remove land
mines remaining from Nicaragua's civil war. The task of removing
the mines from Nicaragua and neighboring Honduras was complicated
when floods and mudslides associated with Mitch shifted mapped
areas where explosives had been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Similar aid packages for El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala
will be announced at Clinton's subsequent stops this week, when he
engages in talks with regional leaders on immigration and ongoing
efforts to strengthen ties between the isthmus nations and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the aid he announced Monday totals far less than the
$956 million Clinton is trying to secure from Congress. The
disaster aid, which Clinton wants to fund from the anticipated
budget surplus, was stalled last week by Republican congressional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using the federal budget surplus, the GOP leaders
proposed raising money to finance the disaster aid by cutting
programs for the poor and the environment that Clinton historically
has fought to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somos humanos nos ayudamos,'' Clinton told hundreds who
gathered in the hot sun. ``We are brothers and sisters, neighbors
and friends. We must help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating Clinton's arrival, thousands of people poured into
Posoltega by truck, bus or on foot. Many carried U.S. flags or
signs greeting the president. ``Welcome Bill Clinton,'' said one
sign held aloft in the mass of people.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Jose Ronaldo Romero, 40, a cane worker who earns
about $53 a month, who wanted Clinton's help obtaining a coffin so
he could re-bury his father-in-law. Romero also wanted eyeglasses
for his daughter Escarlina, 9, whose vision was damaged when she
and her mother were buried in mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is in solidarity with us,'' Romero said. ``We want to
thanks him for his visit to our humble town.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Clinton flew to El Savador, where Salvadoran
President Armando Calderon Sol has already made clear his
displeasure with the U.S. president's decision not to extend a stay
of deportations of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The stay, issued in the wake of Hurricane Mitch to help
alleviate pressure on the strapped Salvadoran and Guatemalan
governments, expired Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To have them return now ``would cause us tragic problems of
stability,'' Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3 million Central American citizens live in the United
States, about one-third of them illegally. The money they earn,
and, in most cases, send home is a major element in the regional
economy. In Guatemala and El Salvador, it is the principal source
of currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is frankly hard to fathom,'' Guatemalan
President Alvaro Arzu said in a letter to Clinton last week asking
that the suspension be extended. ``It is strange and
contradictory,'' Arzu wrote.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael Hammer said the administration has
determined the region is capable of ``beginning to receive their
nationals'' who entered the United States illegally. At the same
time, Hammer said, deportations are not expected to begin
immediately.

spend $120 million in the region to improve health care, build
temporary shelters and support schools. Immediately after the
storm, the United States sent about $350 million in disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   For Nicaragua, U.S. aid will amount to:
</P>
<P>
   _ $10.6 million from the Agency for International Development to
repair, equip and staff health clinics, and $12.5 million for
elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another $1.5 million in AID money for the International Red
Cross to build 4,000 temporary homes starting this month.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1.8 million from the State Department to find and remove land
mines remaining from Nicaragua's civil war. The task of removing
the mines from Nicaragua and neighboring Honduras was complicated
when floods and mudslides associated with Mitch shifted mapped
areas where explosives had been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Similar aid packages for El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala
will be announced at Clinton's subsequent stops this week, when he
engages in talks with regional leaders on immigration and ongoing
efforts to strengthen ties between the isthmus nations and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the aid he announced Monday totals far less than the
$956 million Clinton is trying to secure from Congress. The
disaster aid, which Clinton wants to fund from the anticipated
budget surplus, was stalled last week by Republican congressional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using the federal budget surplus, the GOP leaders
proposed raising money to finance the disaster aid by cutting
programs for the poor and the environment that Clinton historically
has fought to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somos humanos nos ayudamos,'' Clinton told hundreds who
gathered in the hot sun. ``We are brothers and sisters, neighbors
and friends. We must help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating Clinton's arrival, thousands of people poured into
Posoltega by truck, bus or on foot. Many carried U.S. flags or
signs greeting the president. ``Welcome Bill Clinton,'' said one
sign held aloft in the mass of people.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Jose Ronaldo Romero, 40, a cane worker who earns
about $53 a month, who wanted Clinton's help obtaining a coffin so
he could re-bury his father-in-law. Romero also wanted eyeglasses
for his daughter Escarlina, 9, whose vision was damaged when she
and her mother were buried in mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is in solidarity with us,'' Romero said. ``We want to
thanks him for his visit to our humble town.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Clinton flew to El Savador, where Salvadoran
President Armando Calderon Sol has already made clear his
displeasure with the U.S. president's decision not to extend a stay
of deportations of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The stay, issued in the wake of Hurricane Mitch to help
alleviate pressure on the strapped Salvadoran and Guatemalan
governments, expired Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To have them return now ``would cause us tragic problems of
stability,'' Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3 million Central American citizens live in the United
States, about one-third of them illegally. The money they earn,
and, in most cases, send home is a major element in the regional
economy. In Guatemala and El Salvador, it is the principal source
of currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is frankly hard to fathom,'' Guatemalan
President Alvaro Arzu said in a letter to Clinton last week asking
that the suspension be extended. ``It is strange and
contradictory,'' Arzu wrote.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael Hammer said the administration has
determined the region is capable of ``beginning to receive their
nationals'' who entered the United States illegally. At the same
time, Hammer said, deportations are not expected to begin
immediately.

 &HT;    DiMaggio: 'Persona extended beyond playing field'
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fisherman's son who came to define not just baseball but all
American sport for mid-century America, Joe DiMaggio once said
about his life's work, ``There's no skill involved. Just go up
there and swing at the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   At once modest and aloof, the words described how DiMaggio lived
his life as well, a rich and full existence that ended early Monday
morning, when the Yankee Clipper succumbed after a fight with lung
cancer. He was 84 when he died shortly after midnight at his home
in exclusive Harbour Island, Fla., with his brother Dom, two
grandchildren and family friends at his beside.
</P>
<P>
   ``His persona extended beyond the playing field and touched all
our hearts,'' baseball commissioner Bud Selig said. ``In many
respects, as an immigrant's son, he represented the hopes and
ideals of our great country.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio came close to death late last year and twice was
administered last rites while at a local hospital. He had been home
since Jan. 19, recovering from surgery and lived long enough to
suffer the indignity of seeing his death reported prematurely on
television several weeks ago. It had been hoped that he could throw
out the first pitch for the New York Yankees' home-opener April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner visited DiMaggio last Tuesday
and said, ``He was weak but spirited and alert. I told him, 'Joe,
you have a date with the Yankees (on) opening day. We are counting
on you to throw out the first ball.' He just smiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Until his hospitalization, DiMaggio had remained vibrant and
made regular ceremonial visits to Yankee Stadium, where he was last
honored Sept. 26 on Joe DiMaggio day and presented replicas of the
10 World Series rings the Yankees won during his 13-year career.
</P>
<P>
   But he was unable to accept the club's invitation to throw out
the first pitch of the 1998 World Series and already had been
hospitalized five days when the Yankees-San Diego series began. He
was the last link to the first Yankees dynasty, having broken in
with the team in 1939, the same year Lou Gehrig was forced into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looked up to back then, since he and (Ted) Williams
were the best of their time,'' said Riverdale, Ga.'s Cecil Travis,
85, who for 11 seasons faced DiMaggio regularly as a shortstop, and
a career .314 hitter, for the Washington Senators. ``He could do
most everything. Yeah, he was a pretty good fellah to look up to. I
mean, you don't get too many bad things about him, the way you do
some of them these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Although linked forever to the 56-game hitting streak that
endures 57 years later, DiMaggio's grace in center field left a
stronger imprint on New York, which watched him rise as the first
Italian-descended sports hero the nation had produced. The fly ball
never seemed to fall until DiMaggio arrived beneath it, prompting
his detractors to gripe that he'd never had a tough chance out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't compare him to anyone,'' Travis said. ``He just
glided. He didn't stand on his head or dive or things like that.
The plays looked easy to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No outfielder is a real workman unless he can turn his back on
the ball, run his legs off and take the catch over his shoulder,''
DiMaggio once said. ``Back-pedaling outfielders get nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He had come up a shortstop, one of three baseball playing sons
of Joseph DiMaggio, an Italian-born fisherman who settled in San
Francisco. He was 17 when he signed with the Pacific Coast League's
Oakland Seals, and the following year, DiMaggio put together a
61-game hitting streak for the Seals. He finally made it to the
Bronx to stay in 1939 at age 24. Except for three years of military
service, he was the Yankees' constant presence into the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one Ted Williams admired, respected and envied
more than Joe DiMaggio,'' Williams said in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was a career .325 hitter, but batting average hardly
defined his exactitude at the plate. He went the entire 1941 season
with just 13 strikeouts in 541 at-bats. He finished his career with
369 strikeouts and 361 career homers. A three-time American League
MVP, some of his offensive statistics suffered from playing in
spacious Yankee Stadium. But DiMaggio's game was far more than
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball isn't statistics,'' New York writer Jimmy Breslin
once said. ``It's Joe DiMaggio rounding second base.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 14, 1941, DiMaggio singled off Chicago's Eddie Smith,
beginning a run that might never be equaled. Nearly a month later,
another single against the White Sox gave him a 29-game hitting
streak, breaking the Yankees' club record. Rogers Hornsby's NL
record of 33 fell, as did George Sisler's AL mark of 41. And when
historians insisted that Wee Willie Keeler had recorded a 44-game
streak in 1887, DiMaggio broke it, too, before three ground-outs
July 17 in Cleveland ended the run at 56 games.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, DiMaggio had 56 singles, 16 doubles, seven
triples and 15 home runs. The following day, he began a 16-game
streak that did not include a hit recorded in Detroit in the 1941
All-Star game. Pete Rose summoned a 44-game streak in 1978, but no
one else has come close.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, DiMaggio's shadow was diminished purposely. He
often dined alone, was polite but distant with teammates and,
partly as a result of public criticism he received in a contract
hold-out, was wary of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he said hello to you,'' Detroit's Hank Greenberg said,
``that was a long conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 37, slowed by back and foot injuries, DiMaggio turned
down a new $100,000 contract and announced his retirement in 1951
by saying simply, ``I no longer have it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last World Series that fall, he shared the Yankees
outfield with a strong kid from Oklahoma, at least until he waved
Mickey Mantle off a fly ball in Game 2. Mickey Mantle slipped and
hurt his knee on the play, opening a new chapter in Yankees lore.
</P>
<P>
   A failed marriage to Marilyn Monroe broke his heart but only
increased his public persona in retirement. Celebrated in music and
literature _ Simon and Garfunkel's ``Mrs. Robinson'' and Ernest
Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea'' _ DiMaggio's name came to
represent new things to each new generation, even as he was hawking
a coffee maker.
</P>
<P>
   He sold a lot of them too, which fit a larger pattern. When
asked once how DiMaggio excelled, New York teammate Tommy Heinrich
replied, ``He does everything better than anyone else.''

INDIA REVOKES TAKEOVER OF ITS POOREST STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Bowing to certain defeat in the upper house
of Parliament, the Indian government on Monday revoked its takeover
of the government of Bihar, the poorest and second-most populous
state.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the national government dismissed the state
government of Chief Minister Rabri Devi and her husband, Laloo
Prasad Yadav, who belong to the low-ranking cowherds' caste, on the
ground that the state, home to almost 100 million people, had
descended into lawlessness in the nine years that they had
governed.
</P>
<P>
   The move required the approval of both houses of Parliament.
Home Minister L.K. Advani conceded Monday morning that Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee had failed to persuade the opposition
Congress Party to support the takeover, dooming it to defeat in the
House, where the governing coalition, led by Hindu nationalists, is
in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the opposition thumped their desks in delight after
Advani's remarks. Yadav, a member of Parliament, held a triumphant
news conference in New Delhi, while his wife, Mrs. Devi, who is
generally expected to reclaim her post as chief minister, greeted
well-wishers in Patna, the state capital. Many of them garlanded
her with necklaces of marigolds.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate sparks for national rule in Bihar, imposed last
month, were two massacres in which an outlawed upper-caste army
formed by landowners killed 34 men, women and children, mostly poor
farm workers from the lowest castes, formerly called untouchables.
</P>
<P>
   The government had an uphill battle to pass its measure in the
lower house, where it has a slender majority. Vajpayee, who heads
the Bharatiya Janata Party, turned the issue into a virtual
referendum on his government, aggressively lobbying reluctant
parties in his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   They have traditionally opposed using the constitutional
provision that allows the national government to unseat
democratically elected state governments, a power that has been
invoked more than 100 times in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee met for 45 minutes on Sunday with the Congress Party
president, Sonia Gandhi. But she would not reverse her position and
support the Bihar takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties said they were acting in the best interests of the
residents of Bihar. Vajpayee said his party was seeking to protect
low-caste laborers. Congress officials accused his government of
seeking to strengthen its position in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress, which dominated Bihar
politics for decades, have been struggling to win ground in the
vote-rich state, which is essential to their dreams of ruling in
New Delhi without a heavy reliance on unreliable coalition
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Yadav's National People's Party has dominated Bihar's politics
with a coalition of middle- and lower-caste voters and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers and political analysts in Bihar said the
Bharatiya Janata Party, which draws most of its support there from
the upper castes, wanted to do away with the current government and
get its hands on the reins of patronage in the state. That was a
prospect that the Congress Party was loath to support, even though
Mrs. Gandhi said Mrs. Devi's government had lost the moral
authority to rule after the second massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The landlords' armies sprang up in the 1970s in Bihar and have
periodically committed atrocities against landless workers.

 &HT;    Atlanta fans gobble up Thrasher tickets
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most expensive ticket in Atlanta sports apparently
hasn't scared off ticket buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers, still seven months away from their inaugural NHL
season, satisfied the league's mandate for season-ticket sales by
surpassing the 12,000 mark this past weekend. If the team didn't
sell another ticket, it still would average more than the Flames
did in their last three seasons in Atlanta, 1977-80.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows there's a tremendous amount of interest in the sport
in this area,'' Thrashers president Harvey Schiller said. ``At each
stage, we'll see more interest. The biggest push will be when we
start naming players.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90 suites in the still-unfinished Philips Arena are sold out
and account for approximately 1,600 seats. The majority of seats in
the top price ranges _ $70 and $65 _ are sold out. The Thrashers'
average price of $45 per ticket is the highest among Atlanta's four
pro sports teams, although team officials are quick to make mention
of 1,000 day-of-game tickets at $10.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller said he was not concerned about reaching the sales
minimum as much as doing it by the NHL's March 15 deadline, which
the Thrashers reached by only a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern was the time period,'' he said. ``You have to
remember we were sitting here in an unusual position. We're the
only expansion club that didn't have an arena or a team. It's like
Quebec (Nordiques) moving to Denver or Winnipeg moving to Phoenix.
The issues of sight-lines and seats have had to be (communicated)
through computers or visualization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flames' topped out at an attendance average of 14,162 in
their second season of 1973-74 but dropped to a low of 10,024 in
their final year before moving to Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller said he would be ``pleased'' if the Thrashers exceed
14,000 season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to his joking remark that he would fire his son, Derek,
the team's vice president of marketing and sales, if 12,000 season
tickets weren't sold, Schiller said, ``The poor kid has an ulcer
right now.''

SUPREME COURT ALLOWS `CRIMINAL ALIENS' TO CHALLENGE DEPORTATION
ORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday left intact a crazy
quilt of legal protections that are available to immigrants facing
deportation orders.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and other parts of the country covered by some
appealate court rulings, immigrants with criminal records are
allowed to appeal some deportation orders to judges. In other parts
of the country, in different appealate circuits, immigrants with
criminal records have no such right.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had asked for a prompt review, arguing for a
definitive answer supporting its view that the 1996 law allowed
deportation, without judicial review, of non-citizens who had
committed drug offenses or other crimes, even some that were minor
or had been committed long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals courts in three federal judicial circuits have ruled
either that Congress did not or, as a constitutional matter, could
not strip the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear these cases
and, further, that the harsh provisions should not apply to cases
that were in the pipeline when the new law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court Monday left intact those rulings from two of
the circuits, covering seven states in the northeast. At the same
time, the court vacated a ruling from the federal appeals court in
San Francisco, sending the case back for further consideration in
light of the Supreme Court's decision last month, unrelated in most
respects, in a case involving the government's effort to deport a
group of Palestinians in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of cases now in the pipeline involving the
category of immigrants known as ``criminal aliens.'' These are not
illegal aliens in the usual sense, in that they typically entered
the country legally, sometimes in early childhood, and have been
living as lawful permanent residents, often with spouses or
children who are U.S. citizens. But Congress decreed that people in
this category have forfeited their right to remain here if they
commit drug offenses or any of a list of other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Congress left the retroactive effect of this provision unclear,
and the Board of Immigration Appeals, the top administrative review
body in the immigration system, ruled that it should not be applied
retroactively. Attorney General Janet Reno exercised her power to
overturn that ruling and, in a highly controversial executive
decision in February, 1997, declared that the new treatment for
criminal aliens should apply to all deportation cases then in the
pipeline as well as to crimes that a noncitizen had committed in
the past, even if the crime had not yet become the occasion for a
deportation proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the administration has taken the position that the
attorney general's ruling on retroactivity, known as the Soriano
decision, is itself unreviewable in any federal court. A growing
list of lower federal courts has rejected that position, although a
few have accepted it. In all three of the cases before the Supreme
Court Monday, the lower courts had ruled that the Soriano decision
could not be insulated from judicial review and that immigrants
were entitled to challenge deportation orders through petitions for
writs of habeas corpus in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Filing appeals in all three cases, the administration urged the
justices to use at least one of the cases as a vehicle for the
range of procedural and substantive issues presented. As a
practical matter, the court's denial of review in cases from the
1st and 2nd U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals, in Boston and New York,
means that within the seven states of those two circuits, the 1996
law no longer has the retroactive effect and immigrants facing
deportation can be heard by a U.S. district judge.
</P>
<P>
   This was good news to lawyers representing immigrants. ``It's a
vindication of the right to judicial review,'' said Lucas
Guttentag, director of the immigrants' rights project of the
American Civil Liberties Union, who was involved in all of Monday's
cases. He acknowledged that the court's denial of review was not a
ruling on the merits of the cases, and that the justices remained
free to take up a subsequent case that presented the same issues.
He predicted, however, that the court's action would add momentum
to the trend against the administration in the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, a spokeswoman said that lawyers there
``need to review these orders and how they fit together before
commenting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reno vs. Navas, No. 98-996, the New York case in which review
was denied Monday, was a consolidated appeal of five cases. Saul
Navas, a native of Panama who entered the United States as a legal
immigrant in 1987, was convicted in the New York courts in 1995 of
robbery and possession of stolen property, rendering him deportable
even under the prior immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed to an immigration judge, as was his right under the
old law, and won relief from deportation. But his case was still
pending in 1997 when, under the attorney general's retroactive
application of the new law, his relief from deportation was
canceled, and he was ordered deported. A U.S. district judge,
rejected the government's view that habeas corpus jurisdiction no
longer applied, ordered Navas released, in a decision that the 2nd
Circuit upheld while also rejecting the attorney general's view on
retroactivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1st Circuit case, Reno vs. Goncalves, No. 98-835, the
immigrant, Raul Goncalves, legally entered the United States from
Portugal with his parents at the age of 3. Several convictions for
theft placed him in deportation proceedings in 1990. His appeal was
still pending in 1997 when he was found ineligible for relief under
the new law. The 1st Circuit ruled that the law should not be
applied retroactively and that under a proper interpretation of the
new law, Goncalves could still seek habeas corpus review in U.S.
District Court.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit, in Immigration and Naturalization Service vs.
Magana-Pizano, No. 98-836, took a different approach, reaching a
constitutional issue that the other two courts had avoided. Unlike
the others, the 9th Circuit ruled that Congress actually had
eliminated judicial review. But because Congress could not
constitutionally do so, the appeals court said, the U.S. District
Courts retained their habeas corpus jurisdiction nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrant in that case, Daniel Magana-Pizano, entered the
country legally from Mexico, as a 5-year-old child accompanying his
parents. In 1995, he pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor drug
offense, thus becoming eligible for deportation. His appeals were
cut off under retroactive application of the new law before the 9th
Circuit ruled that he was entitled to proceed through a petition
for habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation for why the justices vacated that
decision Monday, rather than denying review as they did in the
other two cases, was the court's general aversion to constitutional
rulings when the same result can be achieved through statutory
interpretation. The court might have wanted to give the 9th Circuit
a chance to reconsider its view of the statute and find that
Congress had not intended to eliminate judicial review in the first
place.

<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Dave Cowens wasn't answering the telephone
Monday. His wife, Deby, said her husband was going to ``let it ride
out a bit'' before talking about his sudden resignation as coach of
the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   But down here in the land of obligatory gun racks, college
basketball, and NASCAR, Cowens's resignation was greeted largely as
another numbing Hornets moment. By mid-afternoon Monday, the
all-sports radio station in town was too busy with UNC-Charlotte
and the NCAA tournament to be concerned about something as trivial
as the resignation of the most successful coach in the brief
history of the NBA franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Cowens's timing has never been his strong suit. He retired as an
NBA player during the exhibition season of what would be a Celtics
championship campaign. He slept on a park bench after one Boston
title and abruptly quit during another season because he had lost
his spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This most recent move was surprising only for its timing. He was
in the final year of his contract, as jughead owner George Shinn
reneged on an extension because Cowens wasn't appreciative enough
of being the lowest-paid coach in the NBA. Cowens had talked openly
in the past few weeks of being underpaid (which he was),
underappreciated (which he probably was), and unlikely to be around
next year (which he definitely was).
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, when he broke the news to his assistants, it was
unexpected. ``I was in total shock,'' said assistant Paul Silas,
who now is the ``interim'' head coach, which is sort of like the
Hornets' version of Alexander Haig in the Reagan White House. ``I
immediately tried to talk him out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just listing what's happened to the Hornets recently makes the
M.L. Carr years in Boston look Auerbachian by comparison. As bad as
it seemed for the Celtics back then, they still didn't have an
owner who deliberately moved out of town, was embroiled in a saucy
civil suit, and is so hated by the business community that it won't
even consider building an arena until he sells the team.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Shinn legacy. He was one of the most popular men in
town when he secured an NBA franchise for Charlotte, but his penury
and idiocy make Ted Stepien or George Steinbrenner a palatable
alternative. We'll pass on the civil suit, except to note that it
doesn't bode well for an owner who ran the only NBA franchise that
got a religious blessing before each game.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same guy who agreed to an extension for Cowens,
then did the Lucy-with-the-football thing because Cowens didn't
grovel enough. But coaches come and go. Unfortunately in Charlotte,
so do the best players. Their latest best player, Glen Rice, may be
in Los Angeles by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn wouldn't pay Alonzo Mourning ``market value,'' so what
looked to be a terrific young team was rent asunder when Zo was
dealt to Miami. This, of course, came after Shinn agreed to what
many NBA general managers still think is the single most
destructive and stupid contract of the decade: the $84 million deal
for Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer saw Shinn at his best. Given the lack of centers in
the NBA, the Hornets had a veritable cornucopia in two: Vlade Divac
and Matt Geiger. They were both free agents and they both signed
elsewhere because the Hornets wouldn't pay. Can you imagine how
someone like Rick Pitino, who's looking under rocks for big men,
must have felt when he saw a team with two big men not even bother
to keep one?
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, the Hornets turned around and signed Derrick
Coleman, whose chief contribution to the game has been the phrase,
``Whoop De Damn Do.'' And he's not a center.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets then lost Rice and Anthony Mason to injuries and the
season went right down the tubes. Cowens almost acted as if he
wanted to be fired, knowing the season was a waste and the future
was bare.
</P>
<P>
   He was called in Sunday to discuss the possible Rice deal with
the Lakers, which has been on the back burner for more than a
month. The Hornets won't pay Rice the maximum when his contract is
up, so the reasoning goes that they had better deal him, the way
they dealt Mourning. The Hornets would get the two Lakers on the
verge, Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones. When asked by general
manager Bob Bass what he thought, Cowens said it really didn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt awkward even giving my opinion,'' he told the Charlotte
Observer in his only post-resignation interview, ``because, yeah,
I'm here this year and a trade might help now, but what about the
future?''
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to another and Cowens decided to resign. Silas
said Monday that the sole reason he came to Charlotte was because
of Cowens, a former Celtics teammate. He also said he wasn't aware
of the franchise history. He certainly is now.

 &HT;    Barr to offer legislation preventing state gun suits
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) plans to unveil legislation
today that would block cities and states from suing gunmakers,
saying they are fast becoming victim to a rash of ``unfair''
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, a board member of the National Rifle Association, said he
was prompted to introduce the legislation after watching Atlanta
and four other cities file lawsuits that seek to hold the firearms
manufacturers accountable for gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lawsuits are a frontal assault on lawful manufacturing
of products in America,'' Barr said. ``This is a shameless effort
by certain cash-strapped cities to grab a bag of money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is not a cash-strapped city, and Mayor (Bill) Campbell
(of Atlanta) did not file this suit for monetary gain,'' said Nick
Gold, spokesman for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the suit was to get gunmakers to make their
products safer. We feel there is technology available today where
that could be achieved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's bill is drawing controversy even before it has been
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Groups advocating gun control say Barr's bill would offer the
industry special legal protection and that it is time for gunmakers
to be responsible for the damage caused by their product.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amounts to political obstruction of justice,'' said Bob
Walker, president of Handgun Control, a Washington-based
organization that pushes gun violence prevention. ``Barr is trying
to use political means to stop lawsuits. If these cases are so
frivolous, let the courts throw them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits filed by Atlanta; Bridgeport, Conn.; Chicago,
Miami-Dade; and New Orleans seek to force the gun industry to take
steps that ensure that guns are used properly and not distributed
into the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is the next shoe to drop,'' said Barr, comparing
the lawsuits against the gun industry to the slew of lawsuits filed
against the tobacco industry by the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial lawyers have eaten their Cheerios and gotten the
tobacco industry to cave in looking around for another industry to
go after,'' Barr said. ``They've found shameless mayors who are
looking for a windfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr's bill builds on what already is happening at the state
level. The Georgia Legislature passed a bill last month that would
ban local governments from suing gunmakers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filed the suit before the Georgia General Assembly passed
its bill,'' said Gold. ``We feel it's up to a court of law to
determine the validity of this lawsuit, not Mr. Barr or the General
Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Legislature is looking at a law that would make it a
felony for a local official to file a lawsuit against the gun
industry. And several other states are considering prohibiting
anti-gun lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Even the unveiling of the legislation is expected to be
controversial. Barr is to introduce his legislation at a news
conference that will feature Wayne LaPierre, executive vice
president of the gun owner's organization.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's presence at the bill's unveiling spawned a round of
attack from handgun control groups who see it as a conflict of
interest for a board member to sponsor legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barr takes his marching orders from the NRA,'' said Desmond
Riley, the program director for the Educational Fund to End Handgun
Violence, based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Riley finds it ironic that Barr crafted legislation that seeks
the federal government's intervention on a local gun control issue
when he is constantly arguing that the federal government should be
less intrusive in people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Barr is unmoved by the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how these gun control people operate,'' Barr said.
``If anyone disagrees with them they raise the bogeyman. People are
going to criticize me no matter what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said several Democrats have vowed to support his bill, but
he would not disclose their names. One group that is unlikely to
back it is the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strongly that mayors will stand united in opposing the
federal government or any state entity in prohibiting the rights of
a municipality from filing a lawsuit on guns or any other issue,''
said Katie Cullen, the organization's associate executive director
of public affairs.

ANN CORIO, WHO HELPED KEEP ALIVE THE MEMORY OF BURLESQUE, IS DEAD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ann Corio, the auburn-haired, green-eyed queen of
burlesque whose long-running show, ``This Was Burlesque,'' kept
alive the art of strippers and the comedy of baggy-pants clowns in
the age of the X-rated film, died on March 1 at Englewood Hospital
in Englewood, N.J. Ms. Corio, a resident of Cliffside Park, N.J.,
kept her age a closely guarded secret, but was believed to be in
her 80s.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor of a shapely sisterhood that included Gypsy Rose Lee,
Maggie Hart and Georgia Sothern, Ms. Corio lasted long enough to
reach the iconic status that enabled her to present the striptease
as a put-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphasize comedy,'' she said one day in 1976 as she
discussed her show, which began Off Broadway in 1962 and continued
for at least two decades in various productions, tours and revivals
with Ms. Corio as author, director, star and interlocutor. ``There
is no total nudity. The girls are lovely and artistic, and they're
terribly, terribly pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is called burlesque today isn't that at all. Those girls
aren't artists. They just take clothes off, and they don't even do
that very well. Burlesque is exactly what it says it is. It's from
the Italian word burlare, to satirize, to laugh. That's what we do,
and we are not offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Those old enough to remember when strippers in burlesque houses
were regarded as hot stuff could recall Ms. Corio as a reigning
beauty of the East Coast wheel of burlesque houses that extended
from Boston to Washington, with many a whistle-stop in between.
</P>
<P>
   Her fame won her roles in jungle films like ``Swamp Woman''
(1941) and touring stage productions like ``White Cargo,'' in which
she sashayed onstage one night in Boston, playing a native girl
under a light layer of brown powder and not much more. When she
declaimed, ``I am Tondelayo,'' a Harvard undergraduate leaped from
his seat and shouted, ``What an actress!''
</P>
<P>
   Legend had it that it was said in Boston, ``You can't graduate
from Harvard until you've seen Ann Corio.''
</P>
<P>
   The play had the honor of being banned in Boston, Chicago and
Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Of her movies, Ms. Corio said, ``Those pictures always made
money, and I made a lot of money. I asked for $10,000 a week and a
percentage and got it, but I didn't know they were going to shoot
the movie in six days. They didn't want the movie good. They wanted
it Tuesday. I was the Queen of the Quickies. Those pictures weren't
released, they escaped.''
</P>
<P>
   As burlesque faded away, Ms. Corio toured in shows like
``Rain,'' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' and ``Once More With Feeling''
until she conceived the idea of ``This Was Burlesque.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're naughty and bawdy, but never vulgar,'' she said. ``More
than half our audience are women. They love it. Even the kids
respond to it. To go to a movie these days, you need a computer to
figure out the ratings. The whole family can see my show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nudity,'' she added, ``is an invasion of privacy on both sides
of the footlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corio was one of 12 children of Italian immigrants from
Naples who settled in Hartford, Conn., where, she said, she was
once a Sunday school teacher. Her father died when she was young,
and, at 16, after working as a dancer, she discovered she could
earn more on the burlesque circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, Michael P. Iannucci, she is survived
by two sisters, Helen LaRue of West Hartford, Conn., and Lillian
Denote of Bristol, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Was Burlesque,'' billed as a musical satire based on Ms.
Corio's recollections, opened at the Casino East Theater on Second
Avenue and 12th Street in Manhattan and ran for 1,509 performances
before it moved to the Hudson Theater on Broadway and ran for 124
more. Over the ensuing years, numerous productions played across
the country from Miami to Las Vegas to San Juan. The last
performance was in St. Petersburg, Fla., in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1981 review of a revival at the Princess Theater on West
48th Street, Richard F. Shepard of The New York Times wrote: ``Miss
Corio, who looks radiant, does it all by the book and, whether you
like the book or not, it is to her credit that she catches the
flavor of the old burlesque with little attempt to ennoble or
elevate it. This is close to the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corio and her third husband, Iannucci, a former linebacker
for the Pittsburgh Steelers, made millions from the show.
Eventually, they leased the Playhouse on the Mall in Paramus, N.J.,
where, for many years, they presented legitimate productions and
where ``This Was Burlesque'' was eventually filmed as an HBO cable
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corio, who retired about eight years ago, recalled that
shortly after the show first opened on Second Avenue, the police
showed up. ``One night we thought we were being raided, but it was
only the cops arriving to escort Mike to the bank. We never had
trouble with the police. And I was invited to Gracie Mansion. Mayor
Wagner insisted I sit next to him for the photographers.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of charges that burlesque had become lewd and
unsavory, it was banned in New York in 1937. Five years later, it
was permitted to return, but without the use of the label and in a
restricted format. A court finally lifted the ban in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ms. Corio's efforts to present her show at the
1964-65 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens, were rebuffed by
Robert Moses, the pillar of municipal rectitude who presided over
the corporation that ran the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're really quite mild compared to what children
are exposed to on television _ topless bathing suits and all,'' Ms.
Corio said.
</P>
<P>
   But the show did not go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing really new,'' she said. ``It's comedy, pretty
girls, bubble gum, stepping on toes, the kind of stuff you can
leave your brains home for. It's burlesque.''
</P>
<P>
   As she once put it, ``We do nothing you wouldn't write home
about to your aunt in East Cupcake, Ohio.''

NEW RULES PROPOSED ON LTC INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In an attempt to curb consumer confusion and insurance
industry abuses, Massachusetts insurance regulators Monday proposed
new rules on insurance to cover the cost of nursing home stays and
other long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term care insurance is often sold on a fear basis,''
Massachusetts insurance commissioner Linda Ruthardt said in an
interview. ``These new regulations try to make it possible for
consumers to understand what they're buying.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is the first revision in long-term care regulations
in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   So far fewer than 50,000 of Massachusetts elders, or 4 percent
of that population, are believed to have purchased such coverage.
However, insurers and regulators expect the market to increase
substantially with the aging of the baby boom generation. The
number of companies offering such coverage in the Bay State has
jumped from three in 1992 to at least 32 today.
</P>
<P>
   State officials and consumer advocates say that many low- and
middle-income elders are talked into buying expensive long-term
care insurance they can't afford and don't need.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who really don't have sufficient assets
to be buying long-term care insurance, but for one reason or other
they're scared into it,'' said Joanna Connolly, an assistant
attorney general who served on a state task force to develop the
new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A third of the people in this market are probably unsuitable
applicants,'' agreed Al Norman of Mass Home Care, a group of 30
nonprofit elder services agencies. ``They're people who are scared
about being left penniless by a nursing home stay and they
mistakenly think they couldn't qualify for Medicaid. So they buy
long-term care insurance when they can barely afford it. As a
result, many of them don't hang onto it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a state survey, nearly one in three consumers who
bought coverage for long-term care let it lapse within four years.
The great majority forfeited the money they had paid.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would require salesmen to let consumers know
if they have assessed their need for coverage, and what the
assessment says. But agents are not required to do the
``suitability'' assessment in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations would require agents to offer coverage that
adjusts for inflation and returns premiums if the policyholder lets
coverage lapse. It would require agents to be trained in selling
the complex coverage.
</P>
<P>
   However, the proposal does not standardize benefits to make it
possible for consumers to comparison shop. And unlike current
regulations, the new ones do not require policies to cover home
health services, an omission that Norman plans to contest.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations will be the subject of a public hearing
March 31.

 (SUBS to add the dropped word ``Mr.'' in 13th graf and clarify

 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Joe DiMaggio had fresh flowers placed at Marilyn
Monroe's grave; now he takes her memory to his grave. During the
baseball memorabilia boom, he sold himself as an icon for the
millions of dollars he never made as a player, but he never sold
his memories of the Hollywood goddess he was married to for 274
days.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a book publisher talked to him about writing his
autobiography, he declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want me to write about Marilyn,'' he once said. ``I don't
want to do that. I'll never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's maintaining your privacy, which Joe DiMaggio did even
better than he played baseball.
</P>
<P>
   You can still see him on television in grainy black-and-white
newsreel film, but only today's old-timers really saw him swing a
bat with that sweeping follow-through and really saw him run down
deep fly balls in Yankee Stadium in the days when center field was
much bigger than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did everything so easily,'' his first Yankee manager, Joe
McCarthy, once said. ``You never saw him make a great catch. You
never saw him dive for a ball. He didn't have to. He was already
there to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   He inspired songs. His 56-game hitting streak prompted Les
Brown's band to record ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio.'' Paul Simon sang,
``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   He even inspired literature. In Ernest Hemingway's ``Old Man and
the Sea,'' the old Cuban fisherman says: ``I would like to take the
great DiMaggio fishing. They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe
he was as poor as we are and would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's father had come over from Sicily and settled in
Martinez, Calif., where the great DiMaggio was born across the bay
from San Francisco. He would have a 61-game hitting streak as an
18-year-old outfielder for the San Francisco Seals in the Pacific
Coast League before joining the Yankees in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would get The San Francisco Chronicle at 5 in the
morning,'' he once said. ``If I had a good day, he'd wake my mother
up. If I didn't, he'd let her sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother was usually awakened. In 13 seasons interrupted by
three years in the Army for World War II, he batted .325 with 361
homers and 1,573 runs batted in as the Yankees won 10 American
League pennants and nine World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walked into the clubhouse, the lights flickered,''
Pete Sheehy, the legendary Yankee clubhouse man, often said. ``Then
he'd turn to me and say, `Half a cup.'''
</P>
<P>
   He meant half a cup of coffee. Years later he shilled for Mr.
Coffee, an automatic coffee maker, and served as the longtime
spokesman for the Bowery Savings Bank. Although not yet 33 after
the 1951 season, he had turned down the Yankees' offer to continue
his $100,000 salary even as a part-time player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer Joe DiMaggio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's maintaining your pride, as he did the night his 56-game
hitting streak was stopped in Cleveland when Ken Keltner played a
deep third base for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keltner was daring me to bunt,'' he once said. ``I hadn't
bunted during the streak.''
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't bunt that night as Keltner turned two sizzling
grounders into outs.
</P>
<P>
   In the years when the St. Louis Browns were in the American
League, DiMaggio was sitting in the dugout at steaming Sportsman's
Park before a Sunday afternoon doubleheader when he was asked how
he was always able to perform at such a high level. He gestured
toward the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some of these people,'' he said quietly, ``never saw me
play before.''
</P>
<P>
   That's maintaining your ego, which all the great ones have, with
dignity. His teammate Bobby Brown, later the American League
president, best described DiMaggio's blend of ego with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe goes through life scared to death people will ask for his
autograph,'' Brown said. ``And scared to death they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   He could laugh, too. He often told about the time he hit a home
run off Bobo Newsom's fastball. Connie Mack, the Philadelphia A's
manager, ordered Newsom never to throw DiMaggio a fastball again.
His next time up, he hit a curveball for another homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I rounded third base,'' he remembered, ``I heard Bobo yell,
`Hey, Mack, he hit yours farther than he hit mine.'''
</P>
<P>
   But now Joe DiMaggio, fulfilling Paul Simon's song, has really
``left and gone away.'' And taken Marilyn Monroe with him.

 &HT;    Taft to deliver first State of State
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Dayton, Ohio's Kimberly Brown today will help
Gov. Bob Taft use his first State of the State address to
demonstrate that education can transform the lives of Ohioans who
are willing to study and work.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years of living on public assistance, Brown, 37, used
the Job Training Partnership Act to return to school and become a
licensed practical nurse. Since October, she has been working at
the Riverside Nursing Center where she earns $17 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love nursing, just dealing with people,'' said Brown, a
single mother of four children ranging in age from 16 to 21.''
</P>
<P>
   Her two youngest children as well as a 12-year-old niece still
live at home with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   She was selected as one of three special guests for the speech
and was scheduled to spend Monday night at the Governor's Mansion
in suburban Bexley, Taft aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said her own transformation began when she concluded that
she was ``not getting any younger.''
</P>
<P>
   She passed the General Educational Development Test - qualifying
her for the equivalent of a high school diploma - and then studied
nursing at the Miami Valley Career Technological Center. Brown's
education was financed by the Job Training Partnership Act, a
federal program administered at the state and local levels.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she realizes the value of what she has accomplished
``every time I see my pay check.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft considers her an excellent example of someone who went back
to school and got the necessary training to get a good job, said
Mary Anne Sharkey, Taft's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   During the speech, the 57-year-old governor will emphasize
``education, education, education,'' Sharkey said. Taft also will
discuss health care reform and will unveil plans for a statewide
urban revitalization task force to help the economies of cities
such as Dayton, said Scott Milburn, Taft's press secretary. The
task force will be led by Lee Johnson, Taft's development director.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has said that he considers education the key to
conquering what he calls the ``frontier of knowledge and
technology,'' a frontier that Taft considers even more challenging
than the geographical frontier that challenged earlier generations
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor from Cincinnati will reinforce his
campaign pledge to make paying for primary and secondary education
the top priority of his administration, said Milburn, the press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   His school funding plans will have to be considered against the
backdrop of Perry Count Judge Linton Lewis' Feb. 26 decision last
month that threw out the plan former Gov. George Voinovich and the
legislature had come up with to pay for schools. Lewis said the
plan failed to meet the Ohio Supreme Court's 1997 order to create a
``thorough and efficient system of public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft, Senate President Richard Finan, R-Cincinnati, and House
Speaker Jo Ann Davidson, R-Reynoldsburg, have said they will appeal
the decision to the Ohio Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has said he wants to do all he and the legislature
can do to improve the system while the appeal is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Taft's fellow Republicans both say they are eager
to hear what he has to say about the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to provide leadership to correct the ills in our
education system,'' said David Leland, chairman of the Ohio
Democratic Party. ``He needs to step up to the plate and talk about
education funding.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Robert Netzley, R-Laura, the senior member of the the
Ohio House, said the challenge Taft faces is not a new one for Ohio
governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably talk about the same thing all the governors
talk about - education. They don't know what to do. Nothing has
changed in 40 years,'' said Netzley, who came to the legislature in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   The time is right for Taft, Netzley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a golden opportunity,'' Netzley said. ``I don't know if
he can figure it out or not.''

HILTON RETURNS TO DOWNTOWN BOSTON WITH HOTEL BUY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD KINDLEBERGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nine years after he bought the Back Bay Hilton, James
A. Daley is selling the 385-room hotel to Hilton Hotels Corp. _
apparently for a multimillion-dollar profit _ and exiting the hotel
business.
</P>
<P>
   Daley declined to reveal the sale price in advance of a planned
April 30 closing, but industry observers suggested he would get
about $200,000 a room, or almost $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel was purchased by Daley for $34.5 million in November
1989. He said Monday it carries only $30 million in debt. A 44-room
expansion, completed last July, and a top-to-bottom overhaul were
mostly financed out of income, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A purchase-and-sale agreement was signed last Friday, according
to Daley. Mark Grossman, a Hilton executive, confirmed the chain
agreed to buy the hotel but declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in his office in the hotel, Daley said he will miss
the people he has worked with but said, given the strength of the
market, ``this is a time to sell.'' He said he has no immediate
plans except to work on his golf game and play with his
grandchildren. He did not rule out another business venture if the
right opportunity arose.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel deal will give the Hilton chain its first downtown
Boston hotel since it sold the Statler-Hilton, now the Park Plaza
Hotel, in 1976. It plans to open a 600-room Logan Airport Hilton
later this year to replace an older airport hotel.
</P>
<P>
   If Hilton had not exercised its right of first refusal to buy
the Back Bay hotel, it would have run the risk of losing its only
downtown flag, according to Daley. Its franchise agreement was due
to expire in three years, and the hotel's owner could then have
chosen another operator.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the hotel, Hilton will acquire plans for a major
expansion that would nearly double the size of the hotel. Daley
said the plans, which call for building a 40-story glass tower over
a garage behind the current structure, is regarded favorably by
city officials and the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The sale caps a remarkable rise to riches for Daley, 57. Born
the son of a Boston truck driver, he dropped out of a chiropractic
school and never went to college.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he got into the nursing home business, buying ``an old,
broken-down nursing home in bankrupcty.'' He cleaned it up and got
it back on a solid financial footing. His wife, Kathleen Yvonne,
ran it while he served six months of active duty in the US Army
Reserves.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades in the business, he sold off the last of his
16 nursing homes and got into hotels. He bought the Bradford Hotel
on Tremont Street, now the Tremont House, in 1986. Two years later
he bought the Copley Plaza. He sold his interest in the Copley two
years ago, and the Tremont the year before that.
</P>
<P>
   It has not always been a smooth ride. Coming out of recession,
Daley couldn't keep up the payments on the Copley and had to give
up his majority stake to Harvard Management Co. in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As he contemplated his move toward at least temporary retirement
Monday, Daley took satisfaction in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked very hard for the 20 years I was in the nursing home
business to develop the best nursing homes in the state,'' he said.
``I like to think I've done the same thing with the hotels. I'm a
lucky kid. It's takes luck along with a lot of hard work.''

 &HT;    State in a hurry to get new tests to schools
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A Xenia, Ohio newspaper story containing Ohio
Proficiency Test questions is the worst security breach since the
test's inception nine years ago, according to the Ohio Department
of Education.
</P>
<P>
   But a Xenia school official criticized the state's practice of
letting year-round schools test students earlier than most other
schools because it makes maintaining test security more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say kids taking it early aren't going to tell their
friends or neighbors who go to another school?'' said Judy Lowrey,
the superintendent's administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the state department of education invalidated both
writing questions on the fourth grade test and both on the sixth
grade test after the Xenia Daily Gazette published the questions.
</P>
<P>
   The state is rushing to come up with four new questions, reprint
the writing portion of the exam and mail it to schools in time for
proficiency tests scheduled for the week of March 15 or 22, said
Dottie Howe, a department of education spokesperson. District's
planning to administer the test next week will be asked to delay
the writing portion to the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the modified writing tests will go to 270,000 fourth and
sixth graders, Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   Howe said the state has not decided how to handle the six Ohio
schools giving the test this week, and she believes students in
those schools are taking the now-invalidated writing test. Howe
didn't know whether any Miami Valley schools would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Howe didn't know what it will cost to re-do questions and mail
them to school districts. The entire proficiency test booklet,
which includes all five portions of the test, costs $16.20 each to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   By law school districts keep questions confidential until July 1
because students take the test throughout the school year and the
same question may appear on more than one test, Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope the media understand that once they publish
writing topics and test questions, they're breaching this security
as well,'' Roger Trent, department of education director of
assessment and evaluation, said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Christie Gilpin, Xenia Daily Gazette city editor, declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's March 2 article quoted students who were
interviewed after taking the writing portion of the test at
McKinley Elementary, a year-round school permitted to administer
the test early. Test results for McKinley will not be invalidated
by the department of education action.
</P>
<P>
   Lowrey said reporters often have been allowed to interview
students during the week of testing and the assumption has always
been that they would not print the questions.

FISHING NATIONS, WORRIED ABOUT SUPPLY, WILL TRIM FLEETS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a stark recognition that many commercial fishing
stocks are being harvested to the verge of collapse, the world's
seafaring nations have promised to make the first far-reaching cuts
in their fishing fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite limits on how many fish can be caught, trimming the
fleets is now seen as the key to heading off economic and
ecological calamity, industry experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But they acknowledge that the new effort, a nonbinding agreement
sponsored by the United Nations, could take many years before
having much effect on overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   Without a solution, the question for some of the world's waters
will only be which would come first _ the bankruptcy of the fishing
companies or the extinction of their quarry.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand, government and private experts said, the
industry is wasting tens of billions of dollars each year trying to
catch ever-scarcer fish.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Rome in mid-February, delegates from virtually
every fishing nation agreed on a plan to reduce fishing capacity,
starting within six years. To meet targets, many governments will
probably have to pay owners to scuttle vessels, or the governments
will have to reduce immense subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that some folks are going to have to find a
new job,'' said David Schorr, a fisheries expert at the World
Wildlife Fund, adding that politicians will face some tough choices
about who is forced out of fishing, and where.
</P>
<P>
   Even without knowing whether the voluntary effort will work,
fishery officials call the plan one of the most significant to
address the need to preserve fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globally, the problem of overcapacity in the world's fleet is
probably the single greatest threat to the world's fish
resources,'' said Terry Garcia, chief American delegate to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the next decade or so, if we do not take steps to
address the problem of overcapacity, then the demand for wild fish
stocks is going to exceed the supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say this has already occurred. After decades of
growth, the catch has leveled off, suggesting that many fish are
being caught faster than they can reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement calls for nations to cap their fleets at
existing levels and then to scale them back progressively, and to
eliminate subsidies to companies that are deemed to overfish.
</P>
<P>
   Past efforts to control overfishing have focused on strictly
regulating the quantity of fish that can be legally caught, the
size of fish that may be kept, the length of the fishing season and
the type of equipment and nets used.
</P>
<P>
   But that approach, the nations agreed, is flawed, given the
capacity of many fishing fleets to catch more fish than permitted.
Increasingly, countries have recognized that they must find ways to
cut the industry's capacity. In 1997, fishing vessels at sea were
estimated to have caught 95 million tons, the international food
agency says.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite strict controls on fishing in recent years, New England
fishery managers concluded in December that the cod fishery in the
Gulf of Maine is collapsing. The Clinton administration has already
proposed new spending to take some of the region's boats out of
service, and last month the National Marine Fisheries Service
proposed guidelines for buying back licenses and scrapping boats
throughout American fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   The new international measures recommended in February, at the
U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization, will have no immediate
impact. The first step is to get an accurate measure of how much
fish the world's fleets really can catch.
</P>
<P>
   Each nation that signs the agreement pledges to reduce
overcapacity, starting between 2003 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first significant international document on the
management of fishing capacity,'' said Dominique Greboval, a
fisheries planning manager with the Food and Agricultural
Organization. ``It might not look like much, but in terms of
approach it is a significant departure.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency has estimated conservatively that the fishing
industry's overcapacity is at least 30 percent. Gareth Porter, a
fisheries expert for the World Wildlife Fund, has estimated
overcapacity at almost 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the food agency found several years ago that worldwide, the
fishing industry was spending $54 billion more than it was taking
in every year.
</P>
<P>
   The world's fishing fleet numbers about 4 million vessels _
about one-third of them large enough to have decks and motors, the
agency says. About 40,000 are larger than 100 tons and longer than
about 78 feet. And more than a thousand of those are owned in the
United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new agreement, which was pushed by the United States and
Japan, is one of a series of U.N. pacts since 1995 to address
overfishing, and the most explicit on controlling overcapacity.
</P>
<P>
   But the political barriers to following through are daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much invested in the way things are that changing
and downsizing the industry is an enormous task,'' said Anne Platt
McGinn, of the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research
organization. ``Probably the European Union is going to have the
hardest time of all, because their fishermen are so
over-subsidized.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, government programs in Europe have
encouraged the modernization and expansion of the fishing industry,
but other programs have aimed at reducing the size of the fleet to
control overfishing.

WALLACE STANDS BY EAPPEN BABY REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, it is CBS's ``60 Minutes'' and Louise Woodward. Last
week, it was ABC's ``20/20'' and Monica Lewinsky. The week before
that, it was NBC's ``Dateline'' and Juanita Broaddrick.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, TV newsmagazines are making front-page news _
and substantially enlarging their audiences in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, that prompts questions as to whether a hunger for
ratings is driving a search for sensational stories, especially at
a time when newsmagazines have become a profit engine for the
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace scoffs at such questions, at least as they pertain
to ``60 Minutes'' and the broadcast that has created an uproar in
Boston: Wallace's report suggesting Louise Woodward was wrongly
convicted in the death of Newton infant Matthew Eappen. But Dr. Eli
Newberger of Children's Hospital in Boston, who maintains ``60
Minutes'' twisted his words out of context Sunday night, calls the
broadcast ``hype in the guise of investigative journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a program that drew a higher-than-usual audience of
453,000 households in the Boston area on Sunday night, according to
Nielsen Media Research. (National numbers were not available
Monday.) Wallace, during an interview with the Globe in which he
vigorously disputed criticisms of his report, said it would be
foolish to impute a ratings motive to ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to worry very much about market share; for 20
years, we've been in the top 10,'' Wallace pointed out. ``I'd be a
fool to suggest that we aren't interested in a broad circulation,
just as (newspapers) are. But to suggest it was done for that
reason, and in those circumstances, well. . . . '' He paused, then
added sarcastically: ``I guess we should have done it in sweeps.''
</P>
<P>
   In or out of viewership sweeps periods, there is little question
of the vital importance of ``60 Minutes'' to CBS, or of other
newsmagazines to their networks, which raises the stakes for
controversial broadcasts. Tom Rosenstiel, head of the Project for
Excellence in Journalism, said that revenues from ``60 Minutes''
help ``subsidize not just all the other news shows, but helps
subsidize sports programming at CBS also.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lion's share, something like 40 percent of the profits at
NBC, come from NBC News, and most of that from `Dateline,' '' added
Rosenstiel. ``Increasingly, news is relied upon to make money as
the cost of sports and entertainment programs goes up and up.''
</P>
<P>
   Just four months ago, another Wallace report created a
controversy when ``60 Minutes'' broadcast a tape of a man's being
administered a lethal injection by Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Now comes
the Woodward report. It hinged largely upon two physicians who
argued that the baby died from strangulation, not from being shaken
and suffering a blow to the head. Dr. Floyd Gilles and Dr. Marvin
Nelson of Children's Hospital in Los Angeles said the strangulation
may have occurred up to 48 hours before the baby's death.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said that although the physicians examined medical
records for more than six months, at the request of ``60 Minutes,''
they were not paid ``a dime'' for their research. He admitted that
he was ``astonished'' at their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the Woodward story originated with Katie Leishman,
a freelance journalist who specializes in medical issues. Leishman
sent Wallace ``some material'' about a year ago, and after reading
it, he turned it over to a ``60 Minutes'' producer for
investigation. According to Wallace, several stories a year
originate with freelancers or via viewer suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after it aired, the ``60 Minutes'' report prompted
Woodward's attorneys to call for a new investigation. But it also
prompted cries of foul from prosecutor Martha Coakley, who called
its findings ``outrageous,'' and from Newberger, a pediatrician and
director of family development programs at Children's Hospital in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Newberger was quoted during the broadcast as calling the
strangulation theory ``speculative but potentially valid.''
However, the doctor said that his answer was to a question from
Wallace about evidence of possible prior abuse of the baby. He said
that while he discussed the possibility that Matthew Eappen
suffered neck injuries during his fatal assault, he did not lend
any support to the notion that strangulation was the cause of
death.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Wallace Monday stood by his report, saying of
Newberger's comments: ``I make of that that he was conceivably
distressed at his own candor.''
</P>
<P>
   Newberger replied: ``That's baloney. I was with Wallace for two
hours or so. My best recollection is that I never gave any credence
to this theory. It makes no sense. . . . The quote that they used
was in response to a different question.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilles is chief of neuropathology and Nelson is chief of
radiology at LA's Children's Hospital. Asked why ``60 Minutes''
relied on two experts from the same hospital, Wallace said that
Gilles and Nelson are both highly respected leaders in their
fields, and their analyses complemented each other.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he noted that Gilles's name was given to ``60
Minutes'' by a prosecution witness in the Woodward trial, Dr.
Umberto De Girolami, who described Gilles as ``the best totally
independent individual, having nothing to do with either defense or
prosecution, to go over this material,'' according to Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   But Newberger said the report was unbalanced. He said Woodward
and her defense attorney, Barry Sheck, ``were given too much
exposure,'' and Gilles was not pressed to explain holes in his
theory, such as how Matthew Eappen's skull had been fractured, or
``the profuse retinal hemorrhage.''
</P>
<P>
   Newberger's conclusion is that the ``60 Minutes'' story ``shows
the extent to which the Fourth Estate has descended into the
standards of entertainment and hype.'' Wallace, meanwhile, stands
by his story.

CHILD ABUSE EXPERTS DEBUNK NEW EAPPEN DEATH THEORY 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD SALTUS AND PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new and legally explosive theory that Matthew Eappen died not
from shaking but from strangulation as much as 48 hours previously
came under intense fire Monday from child abuse experts who called
it illogical and medically unsound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on e-mail all day'' with other child abuse experts
``and everybody's scratching their heads and saying, where did he
get this time frame _ there's nothing in the literature to support
it,'' said Dr. Robert Reece, director of the New England Medical
Center's Child Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
   His and others' criticism of the strangulation theory, put
forward on the CBS-TV show ``60 Minutes'' show Sunday, again
highlighted the stunningly divergent opinions of the same evidence
that scientific experts, even in the same field, can reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on who's doing the interpreting, and with what
incentive,'' said Dr. Marcia Angell, executive editor of the New
England Journal of Medicine. ``In any legal case, there are plenty
of incentives, and I smell a lot of legal activity here.'' Angell
said she was not familiar with the specifics of the evidence in the
death of Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   The new theory by Dr. Floyd Gilles, a neuropathologist at
Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, not only brings an entirely new
putative cause of death into the case, but suggests that it may
have been caused by someone other than British nanny Louise
Woodward, who was convicted of involuntary manslaugther of the
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Reece, who served as a prosecution consultant during the
Woodward trial but did not testify, said he was familiar with a
1987 journal article in which Gilles and others reported on the
deaths of three children by strangling. But Reece said that paper
does not support Gilles' argument that strangling in young children
can have such a delayed effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't account for the fact that Matthew was fine at
11:30'' the morning of his death, said Reece in an interview. ``You
don't lie around for 24 or 48 hours with brain damage and then
collapse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cindy Christian, head of the child abuse program at
Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to imply that the baby would be (seemingly
health) for 48 hours and then would go, kerplunk,'' said Christian.
She also objected that Gilles's argument failed to explain other
injuries noted by doctors who examined Matthew, including broken
blood vessels in the retina of the eye, a skull fracture and a
swelling and blood accumulation, or hematoma, on his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eli Newberger, a pediatrician and director of family
development programs at Children's Hospital in Boston and who
testified for the prosecution against Woodward, said Monday that
although the editing of his comments on ``60 Minutes'' seemed to
suggest he found Gilles's theory plausible, this wasn't the case.
``I never gave that any serious credence,'' he said. ``It makes
absolutely no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Reece, who in addition to his New England Medical Center
position is director of professional education for the
Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
attacked Gilles's credibility, saying his expertise isn't in child
abuse and he doesn't see patients clinically.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles's turn in the media limelight, said Reece, ``is highly
irresponsible and a reflection of academic hubris.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillis, and a colleague, Dr. Marvin Nelson, defended their
findings at a press conference Monday, saying they would stand up
to independent scrutiny. But as the latest tempest swirls around a
case that has worked its way through both the criminal and civil
court systems, it seems more likely that this newest theory may
simply fade away because the legal reality of testing it is so
risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great downside to moving for a new trial is you may get
it,'' said Marc Perlin, associate dean and professor at Suffolk Law
School in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the lawyers for Woodward are a long way from
taking that step _ one that could only be taken at Woodward's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the decision for the client to make,'' Harvey
Silverglate, a member of Woodward's defense team, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Silverglate said he wants to do is to speak to
Dr. Gillis and his colleague, Dr. Marvin Nelson, who told the CBS
news program that he'd found evidence that the baby had fractured
ribs and had been punched hard in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with the Los Angeles doctors, Silverglate said he
would like to bring all of the duelling experts together in one
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have preferred that the review of the evidence be
done by an independent organization like the National Academy of
Science or some other independent, prestigious medical or
scientific organization,'' said Silverglate. ``Instead, it was done
by `60 Minutes,' which in our view is better than nothing. . . . We
are very interested not only because of Louise Woodward, but
because other people have been convicted with fallacious
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Middlesex (Mass.) District Attorney Martha Coakley, who
helped prosecute Woodward before becoming district attorney,
dismissed Silverglate's suggestion of a meeting of the scientific
minds as ``a crazy idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see if there's anyone else in the country who has a
theory as to how Matthew Eappen died,'' Coakley said caustically.
``Because one doctor on the West Coast has a new theory?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Natalia Toro, a 14-year-old senior at Fairview High School in
Boulder, Colo., was the youngest of the 40 finalists in the 1999
Intel Science Talent Search. But talent rather than age determined
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Miss Toro won a $50,000 scholarship prize as
the top winner of the contest, the nation's oldest and most
prestigious science competition for high school seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes referred to as the Junior Nobel Prize, the contest,
with $330,000 in prizes, was formerly sponsored by the Westinghouse
Electric Corp. The Intel Corp. assumed sponsorship last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her youth, Miss Toro stood out among the finalists
when they assembled in Washington last week for a series of
activities and interviews with leading scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were curious about my age,'' Miss Toro said in an
interview a few hours before she learned she was the top winner.
``After they asked how old I am, and I told them, they wanted to
know which grades I had skipped. I told them _ fifth, seventh and
eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Toro said that even her parents could not keep up with her
when she talked about her winning project, a study of the
oscillations of neutrinos that may have a significant impact on
high-energy physics.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Toro performed her research and analysis last summer at the
Research Science Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and expressed her thanks to Professor Edmund
Bertschinger of MIT, who served as her mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The other nine major prize winners, who range in age from 16 to
18, include David Moore, 18, a senior at Montgomery Blair High
School in Silver Spring, Md., who won the second prize of $40,000;
and Keith Winstein, 17, a senior at Illinois Mathematics and
Science Academy in Aurora, Ill., who won the third prize of
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth, fifth and sixth prizes of $20,000 each were won by
Carol Anne Fassbinder, 18, a senior at Valley Community High School
in Elgin, Iowa; Rio Gabriel Bennin, 17, a home-schooled senior from
Berkeley, Calif.; and Lisa Beth Schwartz, 17, a senior at Roslyn
High School in Roslyn Heights, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th prizes of $15,000 each were won by
Scott Alexander Fruhan, 17, a senior at Roxbury Latin School in
West Roxbury, Mass.; Kurt Elliott Mitman, 16, a senior at Thomas
Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria,
Va.; Diana Barnard Townsend-Butterworth, 17, a senior at the Chapin
School in New York City; and Alexander David Wissner-Gross, 17, a
senior at Great Neck High School in Great Neck, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 other finalists each received a $3,000 award.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,400 students from 49 states entered the competition
by submitting reports on their individual research projects. These
were judged on the basis of research ability, scientific
originality and creative thinking. The finalists were judged by
leading scientists in a variety of disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 semifinalists were announced on Jan. 11. Forty finalists
were chosen on Jan. 29, and last week they participated in final
judging, which determined the 10 top winners.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Westinghouse severed its ties to the awards program,
having decided to concentrate on its media businesses. Intel is the
leading maker of computer processing chips.

JUSTICES TO HEAR FORMER MENTAL PATIENT'S CASE AGAINST
PSYCHIATRISTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide if a
former mental patient can sue Dallas psychiatrists who he claims
kept him hospitalized against his will for care he did not need.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts in Texas have rejected, on procedural grounds,
Mark Rotella's claim that doctors needlessly admitted him to
Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion in Dallas in February 1985, when he
was 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Rotella, who spent 479 days in the hospital on what he calls a
trumped-up diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and major
depression, alleges the unnecessary hospitalization was part of an
illegal scheme in which the doctors were paid to fill hospital
beds.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas, followed by the
5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, ruled that
Rotella waited too long past the four-year window to sue the
doctors under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act. He waited 11 years since his release from
Brookhaven in 1986 before suing in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, when it hears Rotella's case this fall or
early next year, will consider whether the Texas federal courts
measured too strictly the four-year time limit for filing a lawsuit
under RICO. If it agrees with the argument by Rotella's lawyer,
Kevin Dubose of Houston, that the four-year deadline should be more
relaxed, the high court could order Rotella's lawsuit to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case
by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rotella's lawsuit against the doctors is part of the nearly
1,000 civil cases brought by former patients at Brookhaven and
other psychiatric hospitals once owned by National Medical
Enterprises Inc. NME pleaded guilty in 1994 to federal fraud and
conspiracy charges and paid a $350 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet Healthcare Corp. took over for NME in March 1995, closed
Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion and inherited the company's legal
problems. Last summer, Tenet paid $100 million to settle 700
wrongful hospitalization lawsuits filed in Texas, The New York
Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rotella, of Fort Worth, resolved his dispute with Tenet before a
lawsuit was filed. His attorney Robert Andrews, also of Fort Worth,
declined to disclose any details of that resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Dubose, Rotella's Supreme Court lawyer, argued that the lower
courts were wrong to count the time to file under RICO from when
Rotella was released from the hospital. He said the four-year clock
began eight years later, when NME admitted its guilt. The company
acknowledged that it had paid incentive bonuses to doctors based on
the number of patients at NME's hospitals and cut deals with
physicians who admitted patients to its health care facilities.
</P>
<P>
   This public guilty plea in 1994 put Rotella on notice that he
had a potential racketeering claim against the doctors, Dubose
argued. Rotella then filed his lawsuit three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Under the courts' flawed rationale, Rotella ``would have been
required to make judgments about his doctors' conduct when he was
being treated by those very doctors, who provided his only contact
with reality,'' Dubose wrote in his brief to the high court.
``Moreover, he would be charged with discovering an elaborate
scheme of deception so carefully disguised that federal prosecutors
considerably more knowledgeable and sophisticated than Mark Rotella
were not able to expose it until 1994 _ four years after Mr.
Rotella's (filing) period would have expired under (the lower
courts') rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the doctors, Debora Alsup of Austin, Texas,
failed to convince the justices to let the lower courts' decisions
stand. Alsup argued that Texas law, not the federal racketeering
statute, should apply to the personal injuries which Rotella claims
to have suffered at the hands of the doctors, including abuse and
intimidation.

SOFTWARE PRIVACY CONCERNS BRINGS CALL FOR LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nervous Americans are beginning to worry that their personal
computers can't keep a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of new technologies that create digital ``fingerprints''
of computer users that could violate their privacy have led to
embarrassment for two of the nation's leading high-tech companies.
As a result, privacy advocates have stepped up demands for federal
legislation to limit the way firms collect and use personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law that protects our privacy has not kept pace with rapid
changes in technology,'' says Barry Steinhardt, associate director
of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``We need to have some
safety net of national legislation that protects us from this kind
of information grab.''
</P>
<P>
   The privacy issue heated up following reports that Microsoft
Corp.'s Windows 98 software automatically creates a unique
identification number on every computer that uses it. This number
is then sent to Microsoft over the Internet when the software is
registered, without the user's consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been apparently collecting these hardware IDs for the
last eight months or so, ever since Windows 98 came out,'' said
Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software Inc. in Cambridge,
Mass., who discovered the ID numbers and contacted Microsoft to
object. The ability of Windows 98 to create such digital
fingerprints was first reported over the weekend in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows 98 ID number might not be much of a privacy threat
by itself. But a similar ID number is embedded in documents created
with Microsoft products like its word processing program, Microsoft
Word. Someone with access to Microsoft's database of Windows 98
users could identify the author of a particular e-mail message. For
instance, a court could subpoena Microsoft's records to identify an
anonymous message written using Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   Smith stresses that most home computer users have nothing to
worry about. Both ID systems rely on a unique number contained on a
piece of computer hardware called an Ethernet card, which is used
to link computers in corporate networks. Very few home users have
Ethernet cards, and on these systems the ID numbers couldn't be
used to track documents.
</P>
<P>
   But Ethernet cards are used on tens of millions of corporate PCs
and a handful of home machines as well, and these users could be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Microsoft says it never intended to collect the ID
numbers without users' permission. Microsoft originally developed
the ID system to help its customer support staff identify technical
problems reported by its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Product manager Rob Bennett said a bug in Windows 98 causes it
to transmit the number without the user's consent. This bug will be
replaced in future editions of the product. Microsoft also vowed to
delete the ID numbers from any of its corporate databases, and will
provide a free program that will let computer users remove the ID
numbers from their own machines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, chipmaker Intel Corp. may have settled its federal
antitrust case, but the company is still taking heat over a
controversial feature in its new Pentium III microprocessor. The
new chip can automatically identify itself to other computers on
the Internet. Furious privacy advocates are urging consumers to
boycott computers with the Pentium III chip. They say the chip's
identification system could be used to track a person's movements
on the Internet without his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, many Internet sites persuade consumers to provide
their name and address. Now such a site can also obtain the chip ID
of the visitor's computer. And the site can sell this information
to other Internet-based companies. If enough companies buy the
data, it becomes very difficult for a user to visit a Web site
without identifying himself. Hundreds of Web sites could use the
chip ID system to call up a complete dossier on the visitor, even
if that person has never been to the site before, and never agreed
to provide it with the information.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has sought to mollify critics by including software that
allows consumers to switch off the chip ID feature. But last month,
a German computer hacker demonstrated a program that could bypass
this safety feature and turn the chip ID on without the user's
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU, which once seemed willing to accept the Intel chip,
with proper safeguards, is now taking a harder line because of the
hacking incident. Over the weekend the organization joined other
privacy-rights groups to urge the Federal Trade Commission to halt
the sale of the Pentium III until the chip ID is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smith, editor of Privacy Journal, says technology firms
seem not to think about the privacy implications of their latest
gadgets. ``It's a really serious problem,'' said Smith. ``It's just
amazing to me that companies don't address it before they implement
new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Ed Markey (D-Mass.) takes a jaundiced view of
the computer industry's position. ``Trust us, believe us, we'll
never compromise anyone's privacy,'' said Markey. ``But whatever
you do, don't pass any legislation that'll hold us to what we
declare is our corporate policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey wants more than pledges of good behavior. He says he'll
introduce legislation to create a privacy bill of rights for
consumers. The law would give people the right to know what
information is being collected on them, and how it will be used, as
well as a right to refuse to provide this information.
</P>
<P>
   According to Markey, the recent Intel and Microsoft
controversies only strengthen his bill's chances of passage.

MEMORIES OF DIMAGGIO FROM THE PLAYERS WHO KNEW HIM

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They remembered Joe DiMaggio fondly and sadly Monday
and with the familiar words that had become forever linked with the
player who treated center field at Yankee Stadium like his own
playground. Class. Grace. Dignity. Greatness. The men who played
with and against DiMaggio took deep breaths, forced their minds to
rewind and spoke in reverential tones about perhaps the greatest
all-round baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   A day does not vanish without Al Gionfriddo being reminded by
someone, anyone, of his wondrous catch against DiMaggio in the 1947
World Series. A fly ball does not sail into the gap without Bobby
Brown telling himself that DiMaggio would have grabbed it, and
without diving. A discussion with Yogi Berra about the most
awe-inspiring dinner he ever had focuses on one of the meals that
he shared with DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe. A dialogue with Stan
Musial about superb hitters is incomplete unless DiMaggio is
prominently mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was the pride of the Yankees,'' Musial said. ``He was the
pride of baseball. He was a great, great player and a classy guy.
He was a really classy guy. But, in our era, a lot of folks are
passing on. It's part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Berra was stymied for a moment when asked to describe DiMaggio's
legacy with the Yankees before raising his hands and saying: ``He's
gotta be like Babe Ruth. The both of them. They were great.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was Whitey Ford getting misty about how he fell in
love while watching DiMaggio as a 9-year-old attending his first
game at the Stadium, Jerry Coleman chuckling as he discussed how
DiMaggio told the second baseman to get out of the way if he heard
him chasing a baseball or Hank Bauer revealing that the first time
he went out for a drink with DiMaggio was 20 years after they first
became teammates on the Yankees, splendid tales about DiMaggio
abounded. There was so much to recall about DiMaggio, whose
contemporaries referred to him as baseball's Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people have a hard time understanding how much of
a hero he was,'' said Brown, who played six years with DiMaggio.
``The difference between then and now is the coverage on TV. Most
of his career, there was no TV, or TV was in its earliest stages,
so what people knew about him was not from a television image. It
was the real thing. Once you saw him play and saw the way he
carried himself, it was something that you didn't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even if a player was wearing the same uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right off the bat, he was my hero,'' Ford said. ``He was the
first player that I noticed as a kid. When I got the chance to play
with him, I couldn't believe I was on the mound and he was in
center field.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Coleman added: ``He was the icon of baseball and in all of
sports in his day. There were people who dominated the sports pages
like Dempsey and Tunney and Louis, but he dominated them all.''
</P>
<P>
   What did opponents think of facing DiMaggio?
</P>
<P>
   ``That we had Joe DiMaggio and they didn't,'' Berra said.
</P>
<P>
   And what did Berra think of dining with DiMaggio and Monroe?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Marilyn Monroe,'' Berra answered incredulously. ``That
was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who hired DiMaggio for his coaching staff when he managed
the Oakland Athletics in 1968, said: ``He never made a play seem
hard. Everything looked easy to him. All around, I thought he was
the best ballplayer I had ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gionfriddo defeated DiMaggio for one moment more than 50 years
ago when he retreated to the fence at Ebbets Field to make a
one-handed grab on DiMaggio's 415-foot blast in Game 6 of the World
Series. The black-and-white footage of DiMaggio kicking at the dirt
after the catch is a rare moment when he displayed any emotion.
While Gionfriddo never played in another game after the Dodgers
lost the series in seven games, the 5-foot-6-inch left fielder
remained linked with DiMaggio for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my moment in the sun, I guess,'' Gionfriddo said, almost
apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, DiMaggio and Gionfriddo attended a baseball card
show together, and Gionfriddo asked DiMaggio to autograph a picture
of the famous catch. DiMaggio wrote, ``Al, 49 years have passed.
But it hasn't passed. Joe DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the record that is synonymous with the great DiMaggio
is his 56-game hitting streak in 1941. It is a record that Musial,
a Hall of Famer who accumulated 3,630 career hits, gushed over.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Joe did in baseball will never be equaled,'' Musial said.
``No one has ever come close to 56 games, and no one will. Joe was
great for baseball. No question, he was one of the best players of
all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Musial recalled how the Cardinals and Yankees shared spring
training facilities in St. Petersburg, Fla., during his rookie
season in 1942 and how impressive DiMaggio was in person. Coleman
visited troops in Vietnam with DiMaggio, Tony Conigliaro and Pete
Rose in 1967 and said the other men ``might as well have been
invisible.'' Brown, the former American League president, liked
sitting in private seats with his former teammate because that was
when DiMaggio relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe attracted people like the light that brought moths,''
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The men who played with and against DiMaggio watched the news
stations for updates on his condition and were buoyed when he was
released from the hospital. They hoped it was a good sign. That
routine of waiting for positive news ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see these things, you remember how young someone like
DiMaggio used to be and how you used to think that they were
indestructible,'' Brown said. ``You always find that we're human.
It's a stark feeling. No one is immune to aging. You wish that some
were. There are people who we'd like to keep the way that we
remember them forever.''

INTEL, FTC SETTLE ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only a day before the opening gavel was to sound,
Intel Corp. averted a lengthy antitrust trial by settling federal
charges that it had abused its commanding position in the computer
chip market to hurt competitors, including Digital Equipment Corp.
of Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the agreement Monday will not be revealed until the
deal is approved by the four-member Federal Trade Commission,
expected within two weeks. However, a source said the settlement is
``very, very narrow'' and affects only a limited number of Intel's
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the settlement, the FTC was seeking far more limited
constraints on Intel than the Justice Department is likely to
demand from Microsoft Corp., the defendant in another high-profile
antitrust case. However, government action against either company
is closely watched in the computer industry, which has long
operated in the shadow of the so-called ``Wintel duopoly'' _ a
reference to the overwhelming market power of Microsoft's Windows
software and Intel's computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Many antitrust specialists said Intel was carrying a strong hand
into the trial, which was due to begin Tuesday before an
administrative law judge. But had a court ruled that Intel is a
monopoly, other companies would have had an easier time bringing
private antitrust actions against Intel. Moreover, the government
might have gained new ground to bring additional charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this compromise agreement as a win-win for both
parties,'' said Craig Barrett, president and chief executive
officer of Intel. The company still faces a separate and ongoing
federal investigation into whether it illegally used monopoly
powers to push into new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The case settled Monday turns on the what rights a company has
to control its own intellectual property _ in this case, ``color
books'' in which Intel shares sensitive technical information about
its chips with other companies. The books have red, orange, or
yellow covers, signifying the level of competitive value of the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Like other high-tech firms, Intel routinely shares proprietary
information about the products it is developing so that other firms
can design compatible products to be ready at the same time. A
computer maker, for example, cannot design a computer to run on a
new Intel chip unless it has technical details about the chip.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., says it has the right to
control who gets its color books and under what circumstances. But
last June, the FTC said Intel acted illegally when it denied three
of its customers access to the books, after those companies filed
lawsuits against Intel or its partners to assert patent rights in
unrelated cases.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies were: Intergraph Corp., an Alabama maker of
industrial computers; Compaq Computer Corp., the giant Texas
computer-maker; and Digital, which was purchased by Compaq last
year. The government said that if Intel could use its monopoly
position to prevent companies from enforcing their legal rights,
then those firms would be scared away from challenging Intel's
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the trade commission said, Digital sued Intel in
May 1997 for allegedly violating Digital's patents on the Alpha
chip, the speedy microprocessor that Digital hoped would revive the
company. In response, Intel cut off Digital's access to information
about Intel's Pentium chip, which Digital needed to develop
computers powered by the Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   Intel restored the flow of information only after the two
companies settled Digital's suit, the trade commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has acknowledged taking most of the actions alleged by the
trade commission, but it said they are perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   According to one person familiar with the FTC, the settlement
bars Intel from denying technical information to a company that
brings a patent lawsuit against Intel.
</P>
<P>
   However, Intel is free to deny information to companies that
take other aggressive actions against Intel, this person said. If a
company announces plans to develop a rival to Intel's Pentium chip,
for example, Intel could legally withhold color books or other
information, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very narrow order,'' the person said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect this to have zero impact on Intel on a day-to-day
basis,'' said Rich Gray, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who
followed the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unusual for the commissioners to reject a
settlement that had been fashioned by FTC staff, said Daniel
Schwartz, a former deputy director of the trade commission's Bureau
of Competition, now a partner with the law firm Bryan Cave LLP in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts said that the government faced long odds in making
its case. To begin with, it might have failed to prove that Intel
is a monopoly _ and therefore failed in its claim that Intel abused
its monopoly powers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's share of the chip market for personal computers has long
been pegged at more than 80 percent; the company posted sales of
$26.3 billion last year. But at least one rival company, Advanced
Micro Devices Inc., is making strong gains, and Intel chips powered
only 40 percent of the computers sold in January, according to PC
Data Inc.
</P>
<P>
   According to papers filed by Intel in the case, the government's
own economic expert, Frederic M. Scherer of Harvard University, has
said that Intel's high market share has not thwarted innovation or
competition in the chip market. His testimony might have hindered
the government in proving that Intel is a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ongoing Microsoft trial may have helped encourage
Intel to settle the case. A wide variety of observers have said
that Microsoft made many missteps in its own antitrust trial, which
is on recess after nearly six months of testimony. Some say the
missteps are so serious that Microsoft is in danger of losing the
case, and that the court could impose sweeping restrictions on its
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel had a very, very strong case and would probably have
won,'' said Gray, the Silicon Valley lawyer. ``But any time you go
into litigation there is some risk, and what Intel is doing by
reaching this settlement is taking all risk off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is prosecuting Microsoft, rather than the
FTC. The two agencies share responsibility for enforcing antitrust
law.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, said the Microsoft case did
not color Intel's decision to settle. ``We believe we made a
decision in the best interests of our shareholders. . . . We looked
at the possibility of a prolonged, expensive trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mulloy said it became clear two or three weeks ago that the
company might find common ground with the government, and that the
deal was struck Sunday afternoon. ``As a case gets ready for trial,
it gets clearer and you get to see what the case is on the other
side, and the lawyers get to know each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company still faces antitrust charges from its competitors.
Intergraph, one of the computer firms involved in the trade
commission litigation, vowed in a statement Monday ``to continue to
pursue our private lawsuit against Intel.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel shares climbed more than 4 percent Monday, rising 5 points
to close at 119 5/8 in Nasdaq trading. Microsoft shares rose 4 and
1/16 to close at 159 on Nasdaq.

   bisher for monday: (3/8/99)
</P>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. --- Any guy who has a hankering for
baseball, but doesn't know its history is missing half the fun.
This all came to me when I peered into the Atlanta Braves dugout
and saw a familiar face looking back at me. It had been probably 35
years since I last saw Ray Boone. He was then a Milwaukee Brave, a
darkly handsome man just around the corner from the end of a good
career, a very good one.
</P>
<P>
   He had not come here to see Cinderella, Mickey Mouse or ride the
rides. He was here watching the progress of a latter-day edition of
the Boones wearing Braves haberdashery. John Schuerholz made a
daring move to heal all the Braves wounds at second base when the
Braves' CEO traded Denny Neagle, Michael Tucker and a very good
pitcher out of the farm system, Rob Bell, for Bret Boone, Ray's
grandson. A pitcher, Mike Remlinger, was thrown in like the baker
adds a 13th roll.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodlines have never been as important in baseball as in horse
racing, but just through natural courses several family trees of
distinction have developed. The Griffeys, the Bondses, the Sislers,
the Berras. Some turned to other games, like Bob of the Friend
family and Chris of the Perrys, now playing on the PGA Tour. Some
deeper research may be required, but let it stand now, that the
Boones are the only third family generation of all-stars in the
history of the major leagues. All-stars three deep, from Ray to Bob
to Bret.
</P>
<P>
   The grandpa, Ray, came to Cleveland as a catcher, but was
converted to shortstop to follow the great Lou Boudreau. He was
traded to Detroit, became a third baseman and led the American
League in runs batted in 1955. Bob, his son, had a run of 19
seasons catching for California, the Phillies and Kansas City, and
later managed the Royals. As irony would have it, he was sitting at
the right hand of Jim Bowden when the Reds general manager traded
his son to Atlanta. Bob Boone is Bowden's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born too late to see my grandfather play, but I saw a
lot of my father,'' Bret Boone said. ``I got good baseball genes, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the runt of the litter, so to speak. Grandpa is still
stalwart of 6 feet. Bob Boone was well-constructed, six feet two,
tall for a catcher. Bret has a kid brother, Aaron, an infielder
with Cincinnati, who is 6-2. He is advertised as five-feet-10, but
grandpa spoke of him as a ``lot of talent in a five-nine body.''
</P>
<P>
   You know what they say, ``It's not the size of the dog in the
fight, but size of the fight in the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone has built some kind of reputation for crustiness in
his seven years in the majors. There is a certain self-assuredness
in his walk, the way he carries his body, the way he communicates
his mood. That's the line that has followed him from Seattle to
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they think I'm arrogant, but I'm just the way I am.
I'm confident of what I can do and I don't back off from anything
or anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He wears braces on his teeth, to correct an overbite. ``I've got
a year to go, then they break my jaw, actually, and reset it. There
are probably some guys who'd be happy to break it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had a jaw-breaking mood or two when the Gold Glove teams
have been announced. Those are the fielding all-stars. One season
he made only two errors and set a record for second basemen, yet
Craig Biggio of Houston got the call. Finally, last year, he made
it. He was beginning to lose his good disposition about it, ``But,
I guess they had to get used to me being around.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the trade, and how much the Braves gave up to get him,
Bobby Cox says this: ``Boone is the best second baseman in
baseball. He has no equal. He has a live bat and had a big year
last year. Look at that, 24 home runs and 95 runs batted in; that's
big for a second baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   The party line is that be brings needed fire to the Braves, adds
to their chemistry. ``No reflection on him,'' Manager Cox said,
``but we've got a lot of guys with fire. And we've already got good
chemistry. We got him to play second base.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, he goes on adding to the six decades of the Boone
Family in the Big League. Not only that, he's just before carrying
them into another millenium. Let some other family try to tie that
record.

<P>
   This week, it is CBS's ``60 Minutes'' and Louise Woodward. Last
week, it was ABC's ``20/20'' and Monica Lewinsky. The week before
that, it was NBC's ``Dateline'' and Juanita Broaddrick.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, TV newsmagazines are making front-page news _
and substantially enlarging their audiences in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, that prompts questions as to whether a hunger for
ratings is driving a search for sensational stories, especially at
a time when newsmagazines have become a profit engine for the
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace scoffs at such questions, at least as they pertain
to ``60 Minutes'' and the broadcast that has created an uproar in
Boston: Wallace's report suggesting Louise Woodward was wrongly
convicted in the death of Newton infant Matthew Eappen. But Dr. Eli
Newberger of Children's Hospital in Boston, who maintains ``60
Minutes'' twisted his words out of context Sunday night, calls the
broadcast ``hype in the guise of investigative journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a program that drew a higher-than-usual audience of
453,000 households in the Boston area on Sunday night, according to
Nielsen Media Research. (National numbers were not available
Monday.) Wallace, during an interview with the Globe in which he
vigorously disputed criticisms of his report, said it would be
foolish to impute a ratings motive to ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to worry very much about market share; for 20
years, we've been in the top 10,'' Wallace pointed out. ``I'd be a
fool to suggest that we aren't interested in a broad circulation,
just as (newspapers) are. But to suggest it was done for that
reason, and in those circumstances, well. . . . '' He paused, then
added sarcastically: ``I guess we should have done it in sweeps.''
</P>
<P>
   In or out of viewership sweeps periods, there is little question
of the vital importance of ``60 Minutes'' to CBS, or of other
newsmagazines to their networks, which raises the stakes for
controversial broadcasts. Tom Rosenstiel, head of the Project for
Excellence in Journalism, said that revenues from ``60 Minutes''
help ``subsidize not just all the other news shows, but helps
subsidize sports programming at CBS also.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lion's share, something like 40 percent of the profits at
NBC, come from NBC News, and most of that from `Dateline,' '' added
Rosenstiel. ``Increasingly, news is relied upon to make money as
the cost of sports and entertainment programs goes up and up.''
</P>
<P>
   Just four months ago, another Wallace report created a
controversy when ``60 Minutes'' broadcast a tape of a man's being
administered a lethal injection by Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Now comes
the Woodward report. It hinged largely upon two physicians who
argued that the baby died from strangulation, not from being shaken
and suffering a blow to the head. Dr. Floyd Gilles and Dr. Marvin
Nelson of Children's Hospital in Los Angeles said the strangulation
may have occurred up to 48 hours before the baby's death.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said that although the physicians examined medical
records for more than six months, at the request of ``60 Minutes,''
they were not paid ``a dime'' for their research. He admitted that
he was ``astonished'' at their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the Woodward story originated with Katie Leishman,
a freelance journalist who specializes in medical issues. Leishman
sent Wallace ``some material'' about a year ago, and after reading
it, he turned it over to a ``60 Minutes'' producer for
investigation. According to Wallace, several stories a year
originate with freelancers or via viewer suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after it aired, the ``60 Minutes'' report prompted
Woodward's attorneys to call for a new investigation. But it also
prompted cries of foul from prosecutor Martha Coakley, who called
its findings ``outrageous,'' and from Newberger, a pediatrician and
director of family development programs at Children's Hospital in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Newberger was quoted during the broadcast as calling the
strangulation theory ``speculative but potentially valid.''
However, the doctor said that his answer was to a question from
Wallace about evidence of possible prior abuse of the baby. He said
that while he discussed the possibility that Matthew Eappen
suffered neck injuries during his fatal assault, he did not lend
any support to the notion that strangulation was the cause of
death.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Wallace Monday stood by his report, saying of
Newberger's comments: ``I make of that that he was conceivably
distressed at his own candor.''
</P>
<P>
   Newberger replied: ``That's baloney. I was with Wallace for two
hours or so. My best recollection is that I never gave any credence
to this theory. It makes no sense. . . . The quote that they used
was in response to a different question.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilles is chief of neuropathology and Nelson is chief of
radiology at LA's Children's Hospital. Asked why ``60 Minutes''
relied on two experts from the same hospital, Wallace said that
Gilles and Nelson are both highly respected leaders in their
fields, and their analyses complemented each other.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he noted that Gilles's name was given to ``60
Minutes'' by a prosecution witness in the Woodward trial, Dr.
Umberto De Girolami, who described Gilles as ``the best totally
independent individual, having nothing to do with either defense or
prosecution, to go over this material,'' according to Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   But Newberger said the report was unbalanced. He said Woodward
and her defense attorney, Barry Sheck, ``were given too much
exposure,'' and Gilles was not pressed to explain holes in his
theory, such as how Matthew Eappen's skull had been fractured, or
``the profuse retinal hemorrhage.''
</P>
<P>
   Newberger's conclusion is that the ``60 Minutes'' story ``shows
the extent to which the Fourth Estate has descended into the
standards of entertainment and hype.'' Wallace, meanwhile, stands
by his story.

AEROSPACE, FOLLOWING TOYOTA'S EXAMPLE, GETS LEAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHULA VISTA, Calif. _ Two years ago, B.F. Goodrich Co.'s
aerospace division factory here fell so far behind schedule
producing parts for the new Boeing 737-700 that Boeing Co.
threatened to terminate the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had rafts of Boeing people coming down here helping us get
on schedule,'' recalled Martin Lodge, an executive here.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Boeing people are still coming _ but to help get
themselves back on schedule. This factory has significantly
improved its efficiency using so-called lean production, the
collection of techniques first perfected by Toyota Motor Corp. And
Boeing, facing serious production problems of its own, has sent
more than 300 people here to learn how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after American automakers and many other companies
began adopting just-in-time delivery and other lean manufacturing
techniques, the aerospace industry is embracing the concept to cut
costs in the face of reduced military spending and, in commercial
aircraft, stiff competition from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   Executives are now bandying about Japanese terms like kaizen
(continuous improvement; pronounced KI-zen) and kanban (the
just-in-time system; pronounced CON-bon). They often mispronounce
them horribly, but are applying them well enough to achieve some
startling efficiency gains in an industry long known as much for
high costs and wasteful procedures as for cutting-edge technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the Boeing factory in Long Beach, Calif., for instance,
production of the C-17 military transport has been doubled in the
last three years without raising the head count. That has helped
save the Pentagon hundreds of millions of dollars, said Richard
Harstad, the Air Force's chief of manufacturing and quality for the
C-17. Boeing's C-17 operation, which initiated the improvement when
it was part of McDonnell Douglas, recently won the Commerce
Department's Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives and analysts said aerospace manufacturers
lagged behind in adopting lean techniques mostly because Pentagon
contracts generally reimbursed them for their costs and they were
insulated from foreign competition that hit other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The automobile industry had the advantage, if you can call it
that, of an early threat,'' said Thomas Allen, a professor of
management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is
co-director of the Lean Aerospace Initiative, an MIT program
supported by the Air Force and many aerospace companies to spread
lean manufacturing techniques across the industry. ``The aerospace
industry hasn't until now had that kind of a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``lean'' is vaguely defined and refers to many
different techniques. But it generally focuses on manufacturing
things in smaller batches to meet demand, rather than in large
quantities. Parts are delivered just as they are needed and
problems are corrected as they occur. The idea is to cut out
operations, such as storing parts, that do not directly contribute
to the value a company is providing.
</P>
<P>
   Done right, lean manufacturing not only saves time and money
directly, but also helps a company quickly identify flaws in its
overall production process.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what the aerospace industry often calls lean, others
would call common sense, such as preparing kits of necessary tools
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop Grumman Corp. videotaped a mechanic whose job was to
apply about 70 feet of tape to the B-2 bomber. The mechanic walked
away from the plane 26 times and took three hours to gather the
chemicals, hoses, gauges and other material she needed just to
start. When the factory made kits with all the needed parts, the
mechanic did not have to leave the plane at all and time for the
job dropped to 1.62 hours from 8.4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the time needed to design and manufacture aerospace
products could have great economic impact. It now takes so many
years to design and build a fighter that the military threat can
change in the meantime. Commercial aircraft take so long to build
that Boeing has to order parts and materials years in advance. When
it reduces its production rate, as happened recently, it and its
suppliers are stuck with unneeded material.
</P>
<P>
   How much lean production will save is still open to question.
Despite some claimed successes in individual factories, it is
difficult to separate any cost savings from those achieved simply
because of big industry mergers and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, lean production is no panacea. Boeing is suffering
huge production glitches despite supposedly putting into effect
some lean techniques for years. Skeptics say leanness could become
just the latest in a series of short-lived cost-cutting initiatives
by the Pentagon and its contractors.
</P>
<P>
   James Womack, co-author of ``The Machine That Changed the
World'' (Rawson Associates), the 1990 book that introduced the term
and crystallized the Toyota production system for American
managers, said that aerospace was the industry most in need of lean
approaches. ``It's the most sclerotic industry out there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Womack, who now runs the Lean Enterprise Institute, a
nonprofit organization, said most companies were merely ``spray
painting'' lean techniques onto their existing procedures instead
of making fundamental changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whole square miles of factories have to be blown up,'' he
said. Pratt &AMP; Whitney, the engine maker owner by United
Technologies Corp., revived itself with such a radical shift, but
most executives are not ready for that, said Womack, who was
dismissed as a consultant to Boeing for being, as he put it,
``disruptive and obnoxious.''
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing would not discuss the reason for Womack's
departure, it said it remained committed to lean manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota system, designed for factories that make hundreds of
thousands of cars a year, is not perfectly adaptable to an
aerospace factory that might make only a dozen, highly complex
objects annually. In aerospace, which generally does not use moving
assembly lines, becoming lean means putting jobs that follow in
sequence next to one another.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In many aerospace factories, parts move in big batches to
various centralized production centers _ from metal pressing to
heat treating to cleaning and so on. Parts can travel miles, either
within a factory or around the country to different factories. It
can take years from the time a part is started until it ends up in
a functioning airplane.
</P>
<P>
   But most parts are actually being worked on less than 5 percent
of the time, according to a survey by researchers at MIT. The rest
of the time they sit idle. That contributes to excess inventory,
which takes up capital and is costly to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Chula Vista factory, which makes parts for engine
housings known as nacelles, work had been done in five separate
buildings spread over a mile. A map of how a part once traveled
through the production process looks like a plate of spaghetti.
Sometimes parts were even packaged in paper and loaded onto dollies
to be shipped from one building to the next, adding time and
expense. The factory was cluttered with excess inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago I would have been embarrassed to bring a
family member into this plant,'' said Harold Rhodes, a longtime
worker who has moved to factory management.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company is rearranging production in cells. Instead of
one big centralized degreasing center, for instance, there are now
dishwasher-size degreasers placed where needed in the various
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Metal skins for the Boeing 717 fan cowls, a part of the nacelle,
used to travel 17,000 feet and take 43 days to make. Now they
travel 4,300 feet and are made in 7 days. Two years ago, the
factory could not produce enough parts for even two Boeing 737-700s
a month. It now produces enough for 23, with only 14 employees
instead of 18.
</P>
<P>
   Production is being consolidated in two buildings, so that the
company will be able to give up half the land it is leasing and
still have room to spare.
</P>
<P>
   There are other changes as well. The manufacturing manager and
many engineers have been moved from carpeted office buildings out
onto the factory floor, making them more accessible to workers and
closer to the job.
</P>
<P>
   Layers of management have been flattened and the number of job
classifications, as defined by the union contract, has been cut
from 200 to 28. Workers no longer have to sit idle, unable to do a
nearby job because they lacked the proper classification.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota production system almost seems as if it were a
religion here, even though only one factory manager ever visited a
Toyota plant in Japan. (The company learned from Toyota's American
operations and from consultants.) The conference rooms above the
factory floor are named after former Toyota officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers greeted the introduction of lean production with
suspicion, in part because the word suggested layoffs. Others saw
it as just another passing phase. But most seem to appreciate it
now.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Fugate, the shop steward, said the number of grievances
filed through union procedure had fallen from several a day to only
one or two a month because workers were happier and managers were
more responsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe my eyes when I go through here,'' said Fugate,
a top representative of the International Association of Machinists
and a 25-year veteran of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Lean production can lead to job losses. While Chula Vista's work
force has grown to 1,030 union workers from 700 four years ago, it
is benefiting from cuts elsewhere. In December, Goodrich announced
that it would close four factories in its aerostructures division,
eliminating 775 jobs. Some of the work will move to Chula Vista,
such as consolidating assembly of parts once shipped to Arkansas.
This is already occurring here with fan cowls for the Boeing 717.
</P>
<P>
   The division, which includes the Chula Vista factory, was an
independent company called Rohr Inc. until its acquisition in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, however, are experiencing more worker
resistance to lean manufacturing as well as resentment about the
use of Japanese expressions.
</P>
<P>
   When workers who make composite parts for the Air Force's F/A-18
attack fighter at Northrop's factory in El Segundo, Calif., were
first organized into cells last October, they compared it to the
cells in the Los Angeles County jail, said Joe Geer, a team leader
in the section. But costs and time have been reduced 40 percent
since October, he said, so workers are coming to like it.
</P>
<P>
   Owing in part to lean production, operating profit margin for
Goodrich's aerostructures division has risen to 15.6 percent in
1998 from 9.9 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Lodge, director of continuous improvement in Chula Vista,
says that rearranging the factory furniture is the easy part. The
big challenge is to apply lean thinking to the company's entire
operations, including the engineers and office workers. One aim is
to speed product design and design products that can be more easily
maintained and manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're scratching the surface,'' said Lodge, who is already
spouting new terms like hoshin kanri (policy management; pronounced
HO-sheen KAHN-ree). ``It's daunting, daunting, daunting. Daunting,
with no alternative.''

DEATH PENALTY OPPONENTS FIND CAUSE FOR FRESH HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They petition. They pray. They rally. They litigate.
</P>
<P>
   And mostly they lose.
</P>
<P>
   In a movement without generals, the fight to end the death
penalty is left to the foot soldiers: the lawyer in North Carolina
and the laborer in Indiana, the computer worker in Texas, the
electrician in Ohio, the writer in New York, the Roman Catholic nun
in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   But after protesting in futility the more than 500 executions in
the United States in the last quarter-century, the
anti-death-penalty movement sees fresh inspiration for its cause.
The denunciation of capital punishment by Pope John Paul II in St.
Louis, together with the temporary halt on executions in Illinois
and a stay for a murderer in Nebraska, has brought a flicker of
hope to a battle some thought had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like there's light at the end of the tunnel,'' said
Lorry Post, a 67-year-old death penalty opponent in Florida. ``It
seems like we're seeing our best chance for a long while.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that chance is a slight one. Surveys generally show that
at least two-thirds of Americans support the death penalty. And
since Mario Cuomo lost his re-election bid as governor of New York
in 1994, there is virtually no lawmaker with national stature who
speaks forcefully against the state executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over and over, we lose,'' said Doug Magee, a 52-year-old
writer in New York, who has devoted his career to the issue of
state executions. ``There is this sense of impotency, the feeling
that you're beating your head against the wall. It grinds you down,
but you keep on.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know the precise size of the
anti-death-penalty movement, which includes the volunteers who
collect petitions in little Midwest towns, and the top-shelf legal
teams of groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of groups, sometimes no more than a handful of people
each, belong to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty, an organization in Washington that keeps people informed
about debates and upcoming executions.
</P>
<P>
   The size and power of the movement vary greatly by state, said
Richard Dieter, the executive director of the coalition, noting
that death penalty opponents in California often rely on big-money
contributors and Hollywood supporters, while the movement in Iowa
depends on a strong network of churches. In Texas, which leads the
nation by far in executions, death penalty opponents can scarcely
keep pace with executions.
</P>
<P>
   It does not make it any easier when the political climate makes
opponents of the death penalty seem so far removed from the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being a black sheep,'' said Patsy Alenik, 65, who
organized protests last year against the execution of Karla Faye
Tucker, the first woman executed in Texas since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight states have the death penalty, although some, like
New York, have not put any inmate to death in more than 30 years.
States without a death penalty are: Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Rhode Island,
Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-death-penalty leaders, lamenting that their movement
has failed to change public opinion in the last generation, have
criticized the traditional tactics, especially focusing on
individual cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five people out vigiling on the corner doesn't help the
movement, it marginalizes it,'' said Carter Van Pelt, 29, the
leader of Nebraskans Against the Death Penalty. ``I don't need to
befriend people on death row, read their poetry or look at their
artwork, to have a philosophical and moral objection to state
killing. These people are murderers. And I want them in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that some on death row are innocent, as the
Illinois cases demonstrate. These cases, some argue, highlight the
risks inherent in the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Some protests have been highly organized, like the virtual
machine that has developed around Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former radio
journalist who was convicted in the 1981 murder of a Philadelphia
police officer. Abu-Jamal has written extensively about his case
from prison, arguing that the court system is racist, and his
cause, emblazoned on posters across the country, has attracted the
interest of celebrities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Abu-Jamal, who was granted an indefinite stay of
execution in 1995, demonstrates how some inmates stir passions,
while others languish in obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the stay, an Amnesty International official
acknowledged that Abu-Jamal was ``pulled out of the pack'' partly
because of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's statement in St. Louis in January _ the most explicit
condemnation of the death penalty that the pope has made in the
United States _ has created the most excitement lately among death
penalty opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no asterisks in the pope's statement,'' said Sister
Donna Schneweis, the head of Amnesty International in Kansas. ``He
was being very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sister Schneweis and others say the pope's action could
profoundly change the political calculus in the national debate,
not just because he heads a church with tens of millions of
American followers, but because of his standing as a social
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a liberal,'' said Sister Schneweis, 40, noting
that conservatives in the Catholic Church have sometimes dismissed
the teachings of nuns and priests they see as being allied with the
political left. ``But the pope is seen as being in the court of the
conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Catholics who have labeled themselves as part of the
pro-life community,'' especially those who invoke the pope's
support, she added, ``this is a piece they're really going to have
to grapple with.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the anti-death-penalty movement has sometimes
seemed an abstraction, an idea that had no real political
application.
</P>
<P>
   Among people who might be expected to be allies, said Magee, the
New York writer, support for the movement is often lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in leftist circles,'' he said, ``this is seen as a
secondary issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Magee and others say they see a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   A conference at Northwestern University in November, which
brought together about one-third of the more than 75 people freed
from death row since the nation resumed executions in 1972,
provided a graphic portrait of the irrevocable risks inherent in
the death penalty. One after another, the former death row inmates
told the conference, ``If the state had its way, I'd be dead
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association called for a moratorium on
executions in 1997, saying the penalty was not being fairly
implemented. In the recent Nebraska case, an American Indian's
execution was halted based on a state constitutional amendment that
calls for equal rights. And the release of 11 death row inmates in
Illinois over a dozen years, two of them in February, has prompted
state officials to issue a moratorium on executions, saying cases
slated for an execution need further study.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, thousands of opponents of the death penalty do
what they have been doing for years.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Miller, a delivery route driver in her 50s, collects
signatures opposing the death penalty in Indiana, even though she
acknowledges that the state Legislature seems steadfast in its
support of executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do something to counter the bloodthirsty attitude
in this country,'' Ms. Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Van Daneker, a 19-year-old student at the University of
Notre Dame, stands with other opponents of capital punishment
outside prisons, sometimes singing softly, ``Be Not Afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Trafton, a 19-year-old sophomore at Colorado University in
Boulder, is putting together a weeklong schedule of events to
highlight the death penalty, including a rally, panel discussions
and perhaps a concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is just sitting in a dorm room having a
debate,'' Ms. Trafton said, ``trying to persuade people one at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Patti Brown, 42, the leader of Iowans Against the Death Penalty,
meets with death penalty opponents in rural restaurants, at church
groups and service clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we only talk to six or eight people, we've left some
seeds,'' Ms. Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lucero, a 53-year-old psychologist in Topeka, Kan., simply
sits down with anybody he can, and explains why he opposes the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was murdered,'' Lucero said, ``and I just don't
think it does any good to kill more people.'' &QL;

LITTLE CHANGE IN TREASURIES AFTER RALLY OF LAST WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices were little changed Monday after rising
smartly on Friday, amid increased prospects that tame inflation
will keep the Federal Reserve from increasing rates any time soon
even as the economy expands.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year benchmark Treasury issue rose 5/32, to
955 32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, fell to 5.59 percent from 5.60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Rupert, an economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS, a market
research and analysis company in San Francisco, said that after the
employment data released last week, the sigh of relief in the
Treasury market was audible. Gone were rumblings of unsustainable
growth and imminent rate increases by the Fed. Also gone was
roughly half the increase in yield that the 30-year bond had made
since Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, testified before Congress
late last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the progress in Treasuries last Friday to be
sustainable,'' Ms. Rupert said. ``But data, Fed commentary and
supply still pose a risk after this brief respite from the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts said trading Monday was within a narrow range,
as Treasury prices edged up. A speech by Greenspan to the Mortgage
Bankers Association in Washington on Monday was for a time a source
of concern, as is the case whenever he speaks, but he did not say
anything that surprised the market.
</P>
<P>
   Though the dampened fears of a rate increase have increased the
appeal of longer maturities, many traders will probably reserve
judgment on buying shorter maturities until after data on retail
sales and the Producer Price Index are released later this week.
The market may be intimidated by the threat of strong retail sales,
but if the script follows last week's lead-up to the employment
report, this week's figures could become a market rallying point if
the data come in weaker than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rupert said that Monday's gains were limited by remarks from
William Poole, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, who
is known as an advocate of early intervention to head off any
threat of inflation. Poole suggested Monday that the market's
judgment that the Fed might raise rates was probably correct. But,
Ms. Rupert noted that ``he is a nonvoting member, so his comments
were a bit diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the government's weekly bill auction went well, with
the best demand in a few weeks. The three-month bill was awarded at
4.510 percent, down from 4.570 percent last week, while the
six-month bill came in at 4.540 percent, down from 4.585 percent.

CLINTON OFFERS LITTLE TO CENTRAL AMERICAN NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR _ President Clinton arrived here Monday on a
mission of hope and support for the recovery efforts in the region
despite having little to offer in tangible benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The president began a four-day, four-country trip in Nicaragua,
one of the countries hardest hit by Hurricane Mitch, which
barrelled through the area in October. Nearly a week of torrential
rains caused flooding that uprooted families, killed 9,000 people,
and buried entire communities under mud.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman,
knelt at the spot where the imprint in dried mud of the body of a
small girl is all that remains of 2,000 victims who were covered by
a massive mudslide caused by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``No picture can convey the feeling of seeing the outline of
that small child's body by her grave, and seeing her skeleton,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by the president is intended to soothe anxieties among
many Central American officials that the ongoing struggles to
rebuild may create serious economic and political instability. They
are worried that the slow process of rebuilding may frustrate
victims of Mitch, worsen poverty and threaten to destabilize the
region's fledgling democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many bruises that we have to heal, many unpleasant
memories to erase,'' Aleman said at a stop in the village of
Posoltega. ``But we trust in God, in our friends like you, and in
our work and sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   But many leaders also hope to have the administration's ear on
other issues important to them, such as immigration and stronger
economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, 15,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans who illegally entered
the US after the hurricane but were granted a six-month exemption
from deportation became eligible for deportation. Immigrant
advocates and some members of Congress _ including Massachusetts
Rep. Joe Moakely _ tried to have the exemption extended, but
Clinton has refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have provided temporary immigration protection for Central
Americans in our country and I will seek a fair solution to all the
immigration issues this tragedy has heightened,'' Clinton said in a
speech to about 1,000 people north of the capital city of Managua.
</P>
<P>
   But Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, who greeted
Clinton Monday night when the US delegation arrived in San
Salvador, said a flood of returning refugees ``would cause us
tragic problems in terms of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the presidential palace in San Salvador last
week, Calderon Sol warned that massive deportations would result in
``an explosion in Central America and in El Salvador,'' and said he
would ask for the same 18-month extension given to immigrants from
Nicaragua and Honduras, which were hit harder.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said that although deportations were not
expected to begin immediately, the administration argued that the
nations have recovered sufficiently to resume accepting their
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to the region was the first by an American
president since Lyndon Johnson visited Nicaragua and El Salvador in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   It underscored the political and economic changes that the
region has undergone since the turbulent years of the 1980s, when
nearly all of Central America was immersed in civil wars and Cold
War-era politics. All of the region's seven countries have
democratically-elected governments.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already spent $305 million for Mitch
recovery in the region and the Clinton administration has been
trying unsuccessfully to get Congress to approve a $956 million
emergency aid package. The measure remained tangled in Capitol Hill
politics over domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit Monday to Nicaragua, however, Clinton announced
an additional $120 million in aid, including to repair health
clinics and rebuild damaged schools, and find and remove civil-war
era land mines buried in Nicaragua and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will announce similar packages at other stops in El
Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. But what some officials say they
want more than aid is enhanced trade agreements with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton introduced a proposal to Congress last week that would
increase trade under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. But leaders in
the region, including Calderon Sol, say they want market building
initiatives like the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Candido Cruz, a 51-year-old auto mechanic in Mejicanos, a
northern suburb of San Salvador, said he appreciated the attention
from the American president, but hoped the visit would lead to a
brighter economic future for his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not everyday that we get a visitor like this,'' Cruz said
on Sunday afternoon. ``He'll see that we're trying to make our
lives better. But maybe he'll see that we can't make it alone.''

U.S. FIRES NUCLEAR SCIENTIST SUSPECTED OF SPYING FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: an expanded version, adding approximately 400 words, is
scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET) 
(wg) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Taiwan-born scientist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory was fired Monday for security breaches in connection
with China's theft of American nuclear secrets, Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was questioned for three days by the
FBI, starting last Friday, but ``stonewalled'' during the
questioning, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a computer scientist who had been working in the nuclear
weapons design area at Los Alamos, has not been charged with any
crime. He was identified by Federal officials as the chief suspect
in the theft of the nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the nuclear secrets stolen from the lab, the
administration officials said, China has made a leap in the
development of nuclear weapons with much smaller warheads. Senator
Fred Thompson, an influential Republican, sharply criticized the
Clinton administration Monday for failing to notify Congress in
late 1997 that China had stolen nuclear secrets when the
administration certified that Beijing was no longer helping other
nations build a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   That certification lifted a 12-year ban on the sale of American
nuclear technology to China, an action long eyed by American
companies eager to bid on the estimated $60 billion Chinese market
for civilian nuclear power plants.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the help of nuclear weapons experts, the FBI began to
question Lee on Friday in an attempt to determine whether he had
passed American secrets to the Chinese. The questioning continued
through late Sunday, but Lee refused to cooperate, Richardson said.
Richardson then fired Lee on Monday, after receiving a green light
to do so from the FBI, senior administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He was dismissed for ``failure to properly notify Energy
Department and lab officials about contacts with people from a
sensitive country, specific instances of failing to properly
safeguard classified material, and apparently attempting to deceive
lab officials about security matters,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at their home in Los Alamos, N.M., on Monday afternoon,
Lee's wife, Sylvia, a former secretary at the lab, refused to
comment on the matter. Lee, who officials said is in his late 50's
and has been working at Los Alamos for more than a decade, did not
hire an attorney during his interviews with the FBI, U.S. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been the prime suspect in a nearly three-year FBI
investigation, code-named ``Kindred Spirit,'' into Beijing's theft
of U.S. nuclear technology from Los Alamos, senior officials from
the bureau and the Energy Department said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Monday, an influential Senate Republican
sharply criticized the Clinton administration for failing to notify
Congress in late 1997 that China had stolen nuclear weapons secrets
when the administration certified that Beijing was no longer
helping other nations build a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   That certification lifted a 12-year ban on the sale of American
nuclear technology to China, an action long eyed by American
companies eager to bid on the estimated $60 billion Chinese market
for civilian nuclear power plants.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working with the nuclear secrets stolen from the lab, the
administration officials said, China has made a leap in the
development of nuclear weapons with much smaller warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, China's nuclear weapons designs were a
generation behind those of the United States, largely because
Beijing had been unable to produce small warheads that could be
launched from a single missile at multiple targets.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, China had built and tested such small
bombs, a breakthrough officials say was accelerated by the Los
Alamos theft.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage is believed to have occurred in the 1980s,
officials said, but was not detected until 1995, when American
experts from Los Alamos analyzing Chinese nuclear test results
found similarities to America's most advanced miniature warhead,
the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   By February 1996, investigators from the Energy Department and
the FBI, searching travel records and other data at Los Alamos and
other U.S. weapons labs, had identified five possible suspects,
officials said. Lee quickly emerged as the prime suspect, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now believe that Lee gave the Chinese sensitive
nuclear detonation information during a 1988 seminar, senior
administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But after opening a formal criminal investigation in June 1996,
the FBI did not at first aggressively pursue the espionage case,
according to several senior U.S. officials familiar with the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last several weeks, after prodding from Congress and
the Energy secretary, did government officials administer lie
detector tests to Lee. After a first test was administered in
December, the FBI, unsatisfied with those results, gave Lee a
second test in February, and on that test he was found to be
deceptive, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI decided to interview Lee last Friday after he failed the
polygraph, or lie detector test, in February, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos spy case was the subject of a New York Times
article on Saturday. At the FBI's request, the Times had agreed to
delay the publication of the article until after the start of the
bureau's interviews with Lee on Friday.

HARVARD WRESTLES WITH DATE RAPE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Content in 12th graf may be offensive to some readers.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has become a familiar problem on campus: one student alleges
rape, the other says it was consensual. Public relations and angry
students demand that the university react swiftly and strongly to
punish the accused and be sensitive to the accuser.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of faculty at Harvard University is standing up to
those pressures, and for the accused, arguing that political
correctness should not get in the way of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   As the undergraduate faculty at the nation's oldest college
votes Tuesday on whether an undergraduate accused of rape should be
dismissed, a small group of faculty, including some women, are
arguing for a lesser punishment, one that would allow the student
to be readmitted to the university. The encounter was consensual
sex, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rules state there are a range of penalties for rape, and
that range of penalties should match roughly to the commission of
offenses,'' said William Paul, a physics professor and one of the
faculty members proposing the alternate punishment. ``There's a
difference between jumping someone in a dark alley and date rape,
and you've got to calibrate those two together. What we are arguing
is that this gets into one of the categories that is properly
adjudged by going to a lesser penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Many students have responded with outrage, saying that the
alternate proposal proves Harvard's longstanding pattern of
minimizing rape victims' complaints. Students expect hundreds at a
rally outside the faculty meeting, and spent much of the weekend _
Junior Parents Weekend _ getting parents to sign letters decrying
the proposal and demanding that the student be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of this student ``being allowed to return to Harvard is
very disturbing,'' said Alexis Karteron, a sophomore. ``It just
shows that they're not in tune with what students are thinking.
This person is not someone we want as a member of the Harvard
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is especially difficult for a college trying to address
a self-acknowledged ``women problem'' _ one that has left Harvard's
women feeling alienated as students and unwilling to donate as
alumnae.
</P>
<P>
   But the faculty behind the alternative punishment say those
concerns are getting in the way of the rights of the accused.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a problem, that if you say anything that puts some
reponsibility on the woman, it is seen as blaming the victim,''
Paul said. ``And that is what is happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   The faculty say students are demanding the expulsion of the
accused based on innuendo and rumor about the incident. Even the
students admit they do not know the details, because federal
confidentiality laws prohibit universities from making the
students' statements in the case public.
</P>
<P>
   The five faculty members proposing the alternative punishment,
two women and three men on the elected faculty council, say they
will ask their colleagues to agree to lesser punishment based on
the students' statements.
</P>
<P>
   The incident took place in April 1998. According to faculty who
have read the statements, the two students were lying in bed for
about four hours. They had been friends for some time, and had been
drinking much of the evening. There was some sexual interaction at
first, but not intercourse at that point. The woman drifted in and
out of sleep, and as she did, the man penetrated her.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the woman was upset. According to the man's lawyer,
he slid a letter under her door, apologizing and taking
responsibility for his actions. Later, she asked him to meet her by
the Charles, and again he apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was her friend, he felt very bad that he had offended
her,'' said his lawyer, James L. Sultan.
</P>
<P>
   The woman took the case to the college's administrative board,
and in statements and rebuttals, the two agreed that there had been
penetration, and the man took responsibility. The board recommended
dismissal. In Harvard code, that is essentially expulsion, allowing
for readmission only in the unlikely event that significant new
evidence exonerates the student, and the full faculty votes to
allow it.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman wanted him expelled outright. When the board
refused to expel him, she took the case to court.
</P>
<P>
   In court, the man pleaded guilty to indecent assault, which
Sultan characterized as ``improper sexual touching,'' and was
sentenced to 18 months house arrest at his home in Wisconsin, and
five years probation. The rape charge was not heard, and will not
be unless he violates probation. If he returns to Massachusetts, he
must register as a sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing a student requires a vote by the full arts and
sciences faculty _ with 650 eligible. But at a faculty meeting in
October, the question of whether the incident was consensual proved
so contentious that the faculty tabled the question. The
alternative would be a ``withdrawal,'' which would allow the
student to reapply after five years. The faculty members said they
could not predict whether it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Baker, a spokeswoman for the college, said Dean Harry
Lewis is recommending nothing short of dismissal. ``We take this
very seriously,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The case and the conflict over the punishment captures the
difficulties of campus rape, even beyond the thorny question of
what constitutes consent.
</P>
<P>
   It is often difficult to determine what happened between two
students _ alcohol is involved, memories become hazy. It is often
difficult to get women to report assaults; they may blame
themselves for subtly encouraging sex, or they may not want to put
themselves through the stress. Campuses try to project an image of
being understanding so that students will feel freer to come
forward.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, they want to be fair to the accused.
But with federal law forbidding them from discussing details of
cases, it is hard to explain to outraged students why the facts
might not present a clear cut case of rape. In the vacuum, gossip
fuels the idea that the school is weak on rape.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the April rape erupted publicly a few weeks ago,
when a liberal campus weekly published interviews with the rape
victim and another woman whose case has not come before the
faculty. That set off demands from a campus coalition against
sexual violence that the college adopt a firm policy stating that
any student convicted of rape be expelled, and accusations that
Harvard's services for rape victims do not match those at other
schools of its caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard's a pioneer in every other field, if an overwhelming
amount of students are being affected, you need to address it,
bring it up to the rank of your other institutions,'' said Brina
Milikowsky, a member of the coalition. ``I'm suspicious of what
could be behind this proposal. Is it just a backlash against
accusations of rape?''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ No matter where he lived, Joe DiMaggio's home
was always North Beach, where people knew him when he lived in a
rented flat on Taylor Street with eight brothers and sisters and
played sandlot ball in hand-me-downs, same as everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   In old North Beach, people know that DiMaggio was a brooder,
always had been, and let him be. True, most of that world is gone _
at least compared to the days when North Beach was all Italian and
everybody's father was a fisherman. There are trendy restaurants
there now, and nightclubs, and tourists five deep on the streets.
So in the end, Joe DiMaggio's movements around town became as
exquisitely predictable as his swing.
</P>
<P>
   He ate at the same few restaurants, nursed his beers at the same
few pubs, visited the same few friends.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he would pass by the San Francisco Italian Athletic
Club, across the park from the church where he married his first
wife, Dorothy Arnold. Or he would take a turn by the New Pisa
restaurant and drink black coffee at the bar, his back to the aging
photos of himself along the wall. He would retreat for the day to
the house overlooking the Marina that he bought for his parents the
year he starred in his fourth consecutive World Series, 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He almost never made public appearances, unless you count his
occasional stops at Liverpool Lil's, a dark, cozy neighborhood bar
not far from the Marina. Here, he drank working-Joe beers _ Pabst,
until the bar no longer carried it, then Budweiser _ at a small
table near the door. The table sat under two photos of DiMaggio: a
framed Time magazine cover with him in the middle of that balletic
swing, and a black-and-white picture of him leaning against a
field-box railing, signing a ball. Sitting at that table, he never
looked less than his best, in a crisp shirt, well-cut jacket and
spit-shined shoes. It was as if he were always poised to meet his
public, even as his posture told the world to keep its distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be gruff or cranky,'' said Christy Witherspoon,
Liverpool Lil's manager, who always brought honey-roasted peanuts
for DiMaggio to have with his beers. ``It just depended. It was
funny. He liked to get some attention, but not too much. He wanted
it when he wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes seemed as though he could not help enjoying the
buzz his presence created, especially among women. ``The ladies
would go bananas when he came in,'' Witherspoon said. ``Sometimes,
someone would approach him, or send their kids up to talk to him,
and he could be pleasant.'' But the smiles turned to stone when the
questions became personal. Whenever anyone mentioned Marilyn
Monroe, ``he would just hustle out of here,'' Witherspoon said.
</P>
<P>
   His friends were amazed that DiMaggio landed Monroe, whom he
married here at City Hall in 1954, showing her off afterward at his
brother Tom's restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf. What was so
remarkable about the union was that even after he became Joltin'
Joe, American hero, he was still Joe DiMaggio of North Beach: shy,
bashful and awkward around women.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he had taste,'' said Dante Benedetti, who runs the New
Pisa restaurant. ``I guess he went for the ones who led the team in
hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedetti, 79, was a part of baseball-crazed North Beach in the
1930s, when it was producing several major &UR; - &LR; league players,
including three DiMaggio boys. In those days, Joe and his brothers
_ Tom and Mike, who never pursued the game, and Vince and Dom, who
did _ were the stars of the diamond. They played on a horse lot,
with piles of fresh manure, covered with sacks, serving as their
bases.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of kids, Benedetti said, and they would choose
up sides. ``If Joe was sitting there, he'd be picked first.''
</P>
<P>
   But often, Joe DiMaggio was not waiting around to play ball. He
was selling newspapers on the street. ``Joe was not a guy to pal
around with,'' Benedetti said. ``He had his own way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The veterans at the Italian club, who went back more than 70
years with DiMaggio, remember him the same way. Mario Vigo, 91,
remembers when the two played in an organized league together,
before DiMaggio joined his brother Vince with the San Francisco
Seals of the Pacific Coast League. ``He played with the Jolly
Knights team, and I played with him, and against him,'' Vigo said
of Joe. ``I didn't really pal around with him. He was just a
regular guy, more of a loner, very quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Guido Alasia, a former president of the Italian club, said he
always saw Joe alone. ``I used to see him at St. Brigid's church on
Sunday, and he'd be there alone.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was surprised when DiMaggio showed up in a line at the
Marina Middle School _ alone _ after the 1989 earthquake, waiting
to see if his house, where he lived with his widowed sister Marie
until she died last year, had to be demolished.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was never one to flaunt his status. In fact, some of
the guys at the club said DiMaggio had zippers on his pockets, that
he was tight with a dollar. But Benedetti said DiMaggio simply
remembered what it was like to be poor. ``He was brought up in a
fisherman's family. He just happened to become a great
ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedetti remembers the time he asked DiMaggio why he didn't get
out and show himself off to his public more. ``He told me, `Believe
me, Dante, you'd get tired of it too,''' Benedetti said.
</P>
<P>
   That made DiMaggio's appearance at the dedication of a field
named for Dante Benedetti at the University of San Francisco all
the more spectacular. Benedetti had been baseball coach at the
university for 26 years, and the dedication, on March 2, 1985, had
been announced in The San Francisco Chronicle. Since DiMaggio for
years ignored all requests to appear at ceremonies, his homage to
Benedetti at the dedication was a complete surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had written Joe a letter and asked him to come and
talk the day they named the field for me,'' Benedetti said, ``he
never would have come. But on his own, he did it.''

REBEL ARMY IN KOSOVO IS READY TO SIGN PEACE TREATY, U.S. SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ethnic Albanian rebel army in Kosovo has told
the United States that its leaders are ready to sign a peace
agreement intended to end months of fighting in the troubled
province and to allow for the entry of a NATO peacekeeping force,
the State Department announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The department welcomed the decision but acknowledged that there
was still far to go in the peace effort and that there was no date
for the ethnic Albanians to actually sign the document. The rebels
proved themselves maddeningly unpredictable during peace talks last
month in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I will conclude that the agreement has been signed
when it's been signed,'' said James P. Rubin, the department
spokesman, expressing the wariness of many administration
officials. ``We would want it signed as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week to go before the scheduled resumption of
peace talks in France, the peace agreement also has not been signed
by the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, who insisted again on
Monday that he would never accept a settlement that called for the
presence of foreign peacekeeping troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If the rebel leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army are true to
their word, the decision to sign the accord would allow the United
States and its NATO allies to raise the diplomatic and military
pressure on Milosevic, whom they have always attempted to paint as
the villain in the fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said that Richard C. Holbrooke, the veteran
diplomat who has served as the Clinton administration's principal
emissary to the Yugoslav leader, was leaving on Monday for Belgrade
to meet with Milosevic and pressure him to join in signing the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The department said that leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army
conveyed their decision to sign the peace agreement during a
meeting in Kosovo with Ambassador Christopher Hill, the American
envoy to the region. But almost as soon as the announcement was
made in Washington, there was evidence that the guerrillas might
not live up to the promises made on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press said in a report on Monday that it had
interviewed a senior rebel commander, Ramush Hajredinaj, and that
he had vowed not give up his weapons, a key requirement of the
peace plan. Clinton administration officials acknowledged that it
was unclear whether another key guerrilla leader, Hashim Thaci, had
signed off on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say what we need to do is get the maximum clarity from
the Kosovar Albanian side so that we are in a position to put the
necessary pressure on the Serbs,'' Rubin said. ``The point is that
until an agreement is signed, it's not signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, who was sent to the Balkans last week as a
White House emissary to the ethnic Albanians, said he spoke by
telephone on Monday with one of the Kosovo Liberation Army
commanders ``who assured me again that they were going to sign the
document.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, well, just sign it, sign,'' he said at a news
conference in Denver, where he was delivering a speech to a local
business group. ``It's frustrating when you should have signed this
in France two weeks ago.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration will bring pressure on Milosevic in the
person of Holbrooke, the architect of the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement that ended the war in Bosnia and President Clinton's
nominee to be the chief American delegate to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who hammered out a cease-fire agreement in Kosovo
last fall that has since collapsed, is expected to meet with
Milosveic in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, on Wednesday. Before
leaving Washington, Holbrooke met at the State Department on Monday
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to discuss tactics in
dealing with the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambassador Holbrooke will convey to the authorities in
Belgrade the necessity for full compliance with all of their
commitments to the international community and for maximum
restraint in the period leading up to the March 15 conference,''
the State Department said in a statement, referring to the planned
resumption of peace talks in Paris next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that Holbrooke would remind Milosevic in forceful
terms that the United States and its NATO allies still held out the
threat of air strikes against Yugoslav forces if he did not abide
by the peace accord or if there were further human rights abuses by
his troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader has continued to object strenuously to the
main element of the plan, the deployment of 28,000 NATO-led
peacekeepers to Kosovo, including 4,000 American soldiers. On
Monday, the official Yugoslav news agency quoted him as saying that
any political accord for Kosovo must ``exclude foreign troops.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has said that the presence of a
NATO military force in Kosovo is non-negotiable, a viewpoint also
expressed on Monday by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain during
a ceremony in London to mark the 50th anniversary of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make an agreement work, to bring stability to Kosovo, an
international force is an indispensable element,'' he said.
``Political agreement is not enough. The Balkans are littered with
agreements that are signed but not implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert announced that he had
scheduled a debate in the House this week on whether American
troops should be included in a peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become increasingly clear that the president is
planning to send approximately 4,000 U.S. troops to Kosovo in
support of a negotiated interim agreement,'' Hastert said in a
letter to House members. ``I have admitted frankly to the President
and his senior advisers that I have reservations regarding the
wisdom of deploying additional U.S. troops to the former
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said that while it welcomes
expressions of support from Congress for the deployment of American
soldiers to Kosovo, the move does not require a congressional vote.

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS SURGE, BLUE CHIPS DROP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks were mixed Monday as technology issues surged
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set a new high. But
blue-chip securities, which soared to new records on Friday,
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a consolidation type of day'' for the stocks that make
up the Dow Jones industrial average, said Bryan Piskorowski, a
market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``But there is pent-up
demand for technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a number of factors were helping to power big-name
technology issues like Microsoft, Cisco Systems, EMC and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate catalyst Monday was word that Intel and the
Federal Trade Commission had reached a tentative agreement to
settle the FTC's suit against the chip maker.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, however, a broad array of technology stocks were
battered in February and early this month, as investors were jarred
by worries about earnings as well as rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks had a sharp decline, and it kind of put a damper
on them,'' said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. ``I guess they were entitled to a bounce-back, and the
Intel news was sort of a trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Nasdaq composite index was up 60.50, or 2.6
percent, to 2,397.61. The index is well below its all-time high of
2,510.09, set on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Strength in technology shares and in energy stocks helped to
push the S&AMP;P 500 index to a record close of 1,282.73, up 7.26
points, or six-tenths of 1 percent. Oil stocks like Exxon gained on
speculation that weekend talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia could
spur production cuts by members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, or OPEC, later this month.
</P>
<P>
   After rising so sharply late last week, analysts said it was not
surprising that the Dow Jones industrials took a bit of a breather.
The Dow closed at 9,727.61, down 8.47 points.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was fairly light,
at 714.6 million shares. On the Nasdaq market, 970.6 million shares
changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Among individual issues, word of the Intel settlement lifted the
stock 5, to 119 5/8. Shares of Intel recorded a high of 140 15/16
on Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Other big-cap technology issues also soared. Microsoft gained 4
1/16, to 159. Cisco Systems was up 3 3/4, to 104 9/16. Dell
Computer gained 2 3/8, to 45 3/8. Hewlett-Packard, a Dow component,
climbed 1 3/4, to 69 7/8. And EMC soared 6 7/16, to 111, a new
high.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks also moved sharply higher. TheStreet.com's
Internet index gained 37.07, or 7 percent, to 571.43.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement late Monday from Advanced Micro Devices may
cause doubts about the sector's earnings power to reappear.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed, Advanced Micro, a chip maker that has
been gaining market share but losing money in the process, said it
would report a significant loss for the current quarter and would
cut about 300 jobs over the next two quarters as part of a
restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Advanced Micro closed at 18 15/16, up 1/2; in
after-hours trading, it slipped as low as $17.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's push into record territory last week, and its weak
retrenchment Monday, had traders and analysts speculating about
when the index would broach the 10,000 level.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe, the Merrill Lynch analyst, expects that to be
accomplished in the next couple of weeks. But unless the
composition of the market changes, a move above 10,000 probably
will not last long, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the market broadens out, I think you have two or three
weeks of advance to work off the technical overselling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But going through 10,000 itself would not mean much. It's a
nice, big, round five-digit number, but unless there is breadth
accompanying it, it wouldn't mean much. Often these rallies above
big magical numbers tend to be anticlimactic.''
</P>
<P>
   The last three times the Dow has broken through a new 1,000
barrier, it has inched a bit higher and then fallen back, McCabe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the breadth gets better, the same may be true here,''
he said.

LAWMAKERS DEBATE POPULAR `ED-FLEX' BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate bogged down in debate Monday over
whether to earmark $11 billion to hire more teachers as lawmakers
tried to wrap up a bill to give local school districts more
flexibility in spending federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 54-41, the Senate refused along party lines to
allow Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to attach the teacher amendment
to the so-called ``ed-flex'' measure.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused the Democrats of playing politics with the
popular ed-flex bill _ which has the support of all 50 governors
and most Democrats and Republicans _ to push through some of
President Clinton's favorite education proposals. They said there
would be plenty of time to vote on the teacher spending measure
when Congress takes up the education reauthorization bill later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is being held hostage ... to the political agenda of
Democrats,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. ``It is inappropriate, to
say the least, because everybody supports this ed-flex bill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle described the cloture
vote as ``a referendum on whether we want to reduce class size,''
and predicted that the Republican leadership would continue to
oppose Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 more teachers over the next
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans view this as Democrats trying to invoke
some sort of an agenda here on education,'' Daschle said. ``It has
nothing to do with an agenda as much as it has to do with a
senator's right to offer a legitimate education amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposition from Republicans, Murray insisted that her
amendment was ``necessarily timely,'' as she put it, because school
districts are in the process now of deciding what their budgets
will look like for next year. She said for senators to suggest that
more funding for teachers will be considered later in the year is
an empty commitment that no governor or school district
administrator will rely on, given Congress' record of not
delivering on some of its promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a commitment now so they can put those budgets
together and hire those teachers,'' said Murray, a former teacher
who has long been an advocate of hiring more teachers to help
reduce class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the ed-flex bill started off last week in a
noncontroversial way, with both sides hailing it as a step forward
in reducing federal restrictions on education money that the states
receive each year. But Senate Majority Leadert Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
told his colleagues Monday that it's in danger of ``being bogged
down'' in fights over various amendments that both Democrats and
Republicans are now trying to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a raft of amendments starting that threatens to
unravel the bipartisan agreement on ed-flex,'' Lott said. He warned
Democrats that unless they back off on their attempts to amend the
bill, Republicans ``will have no choice but to introduce amendments
of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's free the ed-flex bill,'' Lott declared.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., however, said Democrats are
worried that the ed-flex bill may well turn out to be the only
vehicle for ``serious debate on education for the whole year''
because the current education spending bill doesn't expire until
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The ed-flex bill, as it stands now, does not contain any new
funding for education. It would simply allow states and local
school districts to spend up to $12 billion in federal aid to the
states as they see fit. Modeled after a pilot program begun several
years ago in 12 states, it would grant waivers to all 50 states
that allow them to experiment with spending without the hassle of
federal red-tape.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over ed-flex is expected to continue for two more
days and spill over into the House later this week when a similar
measure is introduced there.

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission announced Monday that
it had reached a tentative settlement of its antitrust suit against
Intel Corp., the world's largest producer of computer chips, a day
before opening arguments were set to begin in the case.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was Intel's refusal to share technical details of its
microprocessor chips with companies that build computers unless
those companies agreed to turn over their own technologies in
exchange. The government suit asserted that such practices violated
federal antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Microprocessors are the brains of computers. Without information
about how the chips work, manufacturers cannot design their next
generations of personal computers and work stations. As part of the
proposed deal, Intel agreed to abide by an order that prohibits it
from pressuring computer manufacturers to turn over their own
technology in exchange for technical information about Intel's
chips, people involved in the case said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although government officials and Intel executives said they
could not disclose the precise terms of the proposed settlement
until it had been formally submitted to the Federal Trade
Commission, officials did say that it achieved the purpose of the
lawsuit. Lawyers for the commission had asked an administrative law
judge to order Intel to end its practice of withholding valuable
technology from computer manufacturers as a weapon in patent
disputes with those companies. The government had not sought
monetary penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission sought to establish a principle, and the staff
believes the proposed agreement achieves that goal,'' said Victoria
Streitfeld, the agency's top spokeswoman. ``The staff got the
relief it wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's clout in the industry is derived from the fact that its
microprocessors power more than 80 percent of personal computers in
use Monday. Although it has lost some market share to competitors
in the last two years, it still sets the technological standards
for the chip industry with each new generation of its Pentium
processors.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Justice Department's trial against the Microsoft
Corporation, the Intel case has been widely viewed as among the
most significant antitrust lawsuits in recent years. The two
companies _ known as the ``Wintel duopoly'' because of their
domination of the personal computer industry with Microsoft's
Windows operating system and Intel's microprocessors _ have been
accused of maintaining monopolies in their respective industries by
stifling competition and bullying computer makers, who are their
biggest customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Intel case, government lawyers accused the company of
stifling innovation by existing and potential rivals by trying to
force three other companies _ Compaq Computer Corp., Digital
Equipment Corp. and Intergraph _ to surrender their patent rights.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has acknowledged that it withheld information about its
chips from the three companies. However, Intel executives said that
practice was not part of a larger effort to coerce rivals into
giving up technology but a legitimate defense in response to patent
claims asserted by those companies.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed order at the center of Monday's agreement contains
specific provisions that describe when it would be appropriate for
Intel to withhold such technology in the future, said lawyers and
others involved in the case who spoke on condition of anonymity. By
setting guidelines that determine when cutting off customers is
based on a valid business decision rather than as part of a
monopolistic scheme, the agreement provides a clarity that Intel's
executives and lawyers found to be particularly attractive, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposed settlement, once approved, will resolve a
government case that some antitrust experts said could have gone
either way as a matter of antitrust law, the deal provides several
significant benefits for Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Barrett, president and chief executive of Intel, issued a
statement this morning praising the proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this compromise agreement as a win-win for both
parties, and we are satisfied that the agreement gives us value for
our intellectual property rights,'' Barrett said. ``This is
acceptable to both parties and was the result of constructive
dialogue between Intel and the FTC.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will avoid the spectacle of a two-month trial that
could have become a public forum for airing its dirty laundry.
Intel executives and lawyers had been closely watching Microsoft
take a public relations beating in its antitrust case in a federal
district court here. That suit was filed by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   With Intel taking the position that it was not a monopoly, FTC
lawyers were preparing a legal strategy similar to that employed by
Justice Department lawyers in the Microsoft case. That strategy
entailed introducing as much evidence as the lawyers could find to
support assertions that the company used strong-arm tactics to
dominate the chip business.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as part of the proposed agreement, the commission staff
reached no legal conclusion that Intel is a monopoly, a finding
that would have had significant legal and practical consequences
for the company in other cases. Incriminating evidence in the FTC's
case, for instance, could have been used in a separate civil case
brought against Intel by Intergraph, a producer of specialized
computer workstations.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Intergraph has accused Intel of fraud, theft of
trade secrets and anti-competitive conduct. Last year, the federal
district judge hearing that case tentatively concluded that Intel
had engaged in monopolistic practices. A trial in that proceeding
is set to begin next February.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Intel's shareholders applauded the proposed agreement. The stock
closed at $119.625, up $5 a share, in heavy trading, and it was
widely credited with boosting much of the technology sector,
driving the Nasdaq up 60.51 points, or 2.6 percent, to 2,398.62 on
a day when the Dow lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tentative settlement announced Monday does not close
the FTC's books on other Intel inquiries. Government officials
emphasized that issues arising out of a broader investigation that
has been under way for the last year have yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   There are remaining issues under investigation by the
commission,'' said William Baer, director of the agency's bureau of
competition, which brought the case that was settled Monday. The
commission's staff is committed to working expeditiously to resolve
those concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been examining a variety of Intel's business
practices, including the contract restrictions imposed on customers
through nondisclosure agreements, Intel's control of industry
standards and the special pricing arrangements and restrictions
required of computer makers as part of Intel's highly successful
``Intel Inside'' marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers said that Monday's proposed settlement will permit
the agency merely reassigned the lawyers involved in the lawsuit to
focus more heavily on other aspects of the agency's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Federal Trade Commission has not disclosed the details
of the proposed settlement, computer makers and Intel rivals said
they could not assess its long-term impact on the computer
industry. But they said that any restraints on Intel's dominance of
the industry could only help encourage competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that is a settlement that forces Intel to make
concessions basically supports the case that we have filed,'' James
Meadlock, the chairman and chief executive of Intergraph, said
shortly after emerging from a briefing at the Federal Trade
Commission here. ``It has to be a positive development for our
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Siekman, senior vice president and general counsel at
Compaq, which last year acquired Digital Equipment, also praised
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that the interests of Compaq, Intel and our
customers will be satisfied through the ultimate approval of the
settlement by the FTC,'' Siekman said.

SALVADOR'S LEADER MAY BLEND A GURU'S NONVIOLENCE WITH RIGHT-WING
POLITICS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ El Salvador's newly elected
president is both the philosophical follower of an Indian guru who
teaches nonviolence and the political heir of a far-right leader
linked to death squads during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Flores a former president of El Salvador's unicameral
National Assembly, ran as the new face of a renovated Nationalist
Republican Alliance, or Arena, the conservative governing party
that has captured the presidency in the last three elections.
</P>
<P>
   But as he celebrated with supporters late Sunday night as the
polls closed, he paid homage to Arena's main founder, the late
Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former national guard officer and ally of
wealthy landowners who was a suspect behind many right-wing
killings during this country's civil war, including the 1980
slaying of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's remember the values of our founder,'' Flores told to a
cheering crowd. ``Let's remember Roberto d'Aubuisson.''
</P>
<P>
   The solemn, bespectacled Flores, 39, who holds a bachelor's
degree in political science from Amherst College and attended study
programs at both Harvard and Oxford's Trinity College, runs little
risk of being associated with Arena's murky past. But many
Salvadorans still regard him with apprehension, wondering whether
he represents meaningful change or just a fresh image for business
interests adverse to political reform in this poor country of 5.8
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Final election results were not expected until Wednesday, but
electoral officials said on Monday that Flores' lead was expected
to hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a transformation or is he a professional at the
service of millionaires?'' asked the Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the
Roman Catholic rector of the Central American University here.
``Arena is more moderate than in d'Aubuisson's days but it's in the
hands of rich people who don't favor social change.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores, who won a five-year term starting on June 1, said in a
recent interview that his candidacy was a response to Salvadoran
citizens' demands for more participatory politics. The day of
reckoning came, he said, after legislative and municipal elections
in 1997 where Arena suffered heavy losses to the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, the party of former guerrillas whose
presidential candidate came in second on Sunday with 29 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in the political spectrum, you had the FMLN, and, on the
other side, Arena, there was a need to make a move to the center by
both parties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FMLN, Flores said and many others agree, tried to broaden
its appeal for the 1999 elections but failed to come up with a
candidate ``without the smell of gunpowder,'' as a political
analyst with the newspaper ``El Diario de Hoy'' put it in a column
on Monday. Internal power struggles led them to settle on a former
guerrilla commander, Facundo Guardado, a moderate who could not
overcome many voters' aversion to a left they still remember as
violent and destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Arena, on the other hand, came up with Flores, who has no direct
ties to the war and was known as a consensus builder in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the party realizes that its survival as a
political institution lies on a real opening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Known by the nickname ``Paco,'' Flores said he spent the war
years between 1983 and 1990 teaching philosophy and managing an
irrigation project for a community of 300 families next door to the
cattle ranch and stud farm he had inherited from his grandfather.
He said he paid for the project himself while his wife, a school
teacher, ran an elementary school for the families.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been gone from El Salvador between 1977 and 1983,
when he went to college in the United States and ended up moving to
India to study oriental philosophy after being ``fascinated'' by a
professor's lecture at Harvard. In 1981, he went to the World
University of America in Ojai, Calif., a small unaccredited school
molded after the teachings of an Indian guru, Sri Sathya Sai Baba,
with followers in more than 130 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Back in El Salvador, Flores said he did not think of entering
politics until leftist guerrillas killed his father-in-law, the
chief-of-staff to then-President Alfredo Cristiani, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they killed my father-in-law the options were few,'' he
said. ``I didn't want to be part of the conflict. I wanted to be
part of the solution and I didn't want to remain in the
sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores served in the administrations of both Cristiani and
current President Armando Calderon Sol in various ministerial and
advisory positions before he ran for the National Assembly. He now
inherits from Calderon Sol a country reeling from one of the
highest murder rates in Latin America, high unemployment, and other
problems partly attributed to vestiges of a 12-year civil war that
killed 70,000 and ended only in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Flores promised to fight crime by upgrading
the skills of the civilian police force created after the war and
to generate jobs with new investment in agriculture, manufacturing
and small businesses and by attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether he can restore confidence
after an election where turnout did not even reach 40 percent,
largely because voters held no hope that a new government could
solve the country's problems, polls showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war left a psychological effect of a hate of war,''
Tojeira said. ``That gives us a margin of 20 years. But if the
economic and social problems continue, these factors could be
dangerous in the long term.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a warm afternoon in early summer of '49, and
all of New York was jammed into Jones Beach, blanket to blanket,
shoulder to shoulder. The triumphal bellow of Mel Allen, emanating
from rudimentary portable radios, drowned out the waves themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that all of New York was tuned into the return of Joe
DiMaggio, the aging Yankee Clipper, who had missed nearly three
months because of a heel spur.
</P>
<P>
   This was the age when baseball players were the princes of
American sports, along with heavyweight boxers and Derby horses and
the odd galloping ghost of a running back from down South or the
occasional lanky basketball player in short shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball players were the souls of their cities _ Stan the Man
in St. Louis, The Kid in Boston, Pee Wee and Jackie in Brooklyn,
and Giants fans waiting for Willie Mays to arrive on his magic
spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   These were times of innate sportsmanship, none of those ugly
chants that you hear today. Dodger fans accepted Musial's doubles,
Midwesterners took their children to see Williams put dents in the
walls and fans everywhere worshiped Joseph Paul DiMaggio, long and
slender, like a holy man in an El Greco painting.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn fans did not love him the way perhaps they loved Musial
or Mays, if they admitted the secret of their hearts, but they
respected DiMaggio. They did not wish him harm.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the basketball players are just dunking each other into
submission, and the hockey players are toting the Stanley Cup in
the slush of late June. But back then, DiMaggio was quite
noticeably three months late in the most important sporting season.
</P>
<P>
   On that afternoon of June 28, 1949, with the Northeast
celebrating the arrival of summer, the papers were full of
speculation about whether DiMaggio would hold up, and why should he
begin in Boston, of all places?
</P>
<P>
   He answered the questions across the sands of Jones Beach, the
boardwalks of Coney Island, the roofs of Tar Beach, the towns of
Jersey, the villages of upstate, the hills of Connecticut _ a
weekend of baseballs soaring toward distant fences, the blare of
Mel Allen gleefully announcing four homers in three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won the World Series that year, and they won it
again in 1950, and they won it again in 1951, and then DiMaggio
retired at the age of 36. He had a great sense of self, and he knew
it was time to go.
</P>
<P>
   He left two of the greatest statistics in the history of
baseball. Everybody knows about the 56-game hitting streak in 1941,
but Frank Robinson, a great player of a later generation, says he
is awed by DiMaggio's career totals of 361 home runs and only 369
strikeouts, a staggering blend of power and self-control. Robinson,
by contrast, hit 586 home runs and struck out 1532 times, nearly a
1-3 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was poised off the field as well. His journey is surely
not to be compared to that of Jackie Robinson, but
Italian-Americans became bank presidents and college professors a
bit more easily in the wake of this well-dressed and well-mannered
son of a fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   He effortlessly worked at never being embarrassed. It is quite
possible that he knew he did not have much to say, so he did not
say it, an exact opposite of the twits who cannot wait to tell
their dismal stories to Barbara Walters or Jerry Springer. I
suspect he would have held his counsel even if he were not
shielding a terrible pain over Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did I ever see him look foolish _ as a coach in the
garish green and gold uniform of Charles O. Finley's Oakland A's.
It was like displaying an El Greco in El Rastro, the flea market of
Madrid, Spain, instead of the Prado.
</P>
<P>
   He had a long time for other roles, as pitchman or citizen. At
the 1983 World Series in Philadelphia, an elevator operator closed
the door on DiMaggio, snapping, ``Press only!'' Asked if she knew
who that was, she replied, ``Sure, Mr. Coffee.'' And in the wake of
the Bay Area earthquake of 1989, DiMaggio visited an emergency
center in the Marina District to discover where his sister had been
relocated. He stood in line, I am told, like any other worried
relative.

   Normally, the Yankee Clipper did not suffer strangers easily. He
could ice you if you approached him at the wrong moment. Burned by
the Yankees when he held out as a young player, he set the
conditions for his appearances on Old-Timers' Day. He was always
introduced last, always described as ``the greatest living
ballplayer,'' which was, of course, always true, right up until
Monday.

   For years, Joe DiMaggio had fresh flowers placed at Marilyn
Monroe's grave; now he takes her memory to his grave. During the
baseball memorabilia boom, he sold himself as an icon for the
millions of dollars he never made as a player, but he never sold
his memories of the Hollywood goddess he was married to for 274
days.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a book publisher talked to him about writing his
autobiography, he declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want me to write about Marilyn,'' he once said. ``I don't
want to do that. I'll never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's maintaining your privacy, which Joe DiMaggio did even
better than he played baseball.
</P>
<P>
   You can still see him on television in grainy black-and-white
newsreel film, but only today's old-timers really saw him swing a
bat with that sweeping follow-through and really saw him run down
deep fly balls in Yankee Stadium in the days when center field was
much bigger than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did everything so easily,'' his first Yankee manager, Joe
McCarthy, once said. ``You never saw him make a great catch. You
never saw him dive for a ball. He didn't have to. He was already
there to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   He inspired songs. His 56-game hitting streak prompted Les
Brown's band to record ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio.'' Paul Simon sang,
``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   He even inspired literature. In Ernest Hemingway's ``Old Man and
the Sea,'' the old Cuban fisherman says: ``I would like to take the
great DiMaggio fishing. They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe
he was as poor as we are and would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's father had come over from Sicily and settled in
Martinez, Calif., where the great DiMaggio was born across the bay
from San Francisco. He would have a 61-game hitting streak as an
18-year-old outfielder for the San Francisco Seals in the Pacific
Coast League before joining the Yankees in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would get The San Francisco Chronicle at 5 in the
morning,'' he once said. ``If I had a good day, he'd wake my mother
up. If I didn't, he'd let her sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother was usually awakened. In 13 seasons interrupted by
three years in the Army for World War II, he batted .325 with 361
homers and 1,573 runs batted in as the Yankees won 10 American
League pennants and nine World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walked into the clubhouse, the lights flickered,''
Pete Sheehy, the legendary Yankee clubhouse man, often said. ``Then
he'd turn to me and say, `Half a cup.'''
</P>
<P>
   He meant half a cup of coffee. Years later he shilled for Mr.
Coffee, an automatic coffee maker, and served as the longtime
spokesman for the Bowery Savings Bank. Although not yet 37 after
the 1951 season, he had turned down the Yankees' offer to continue
his $100,000 salary even as a part-time player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer Joe DiMaggio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's maintaining your pride, as he did the night his 56-game
hitting streak was stopped in Cleveland when Ken Keltner played a
deep third base for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keltner was daring me to bunt,'' he once said. ``I hadn't
bunted during the streak.''
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't bunt that night as Keltner turned two sizzling
grounders into outs.
</P>
<P>
   In the years when the St. Louis Browns were in the American
League, DiMaggio was sitting in the dugout at steaming Sportsman's
Park before a Sunday afternoon doubleheader when he was asked how
he was always able to perform at such a high level. He gestured
toward the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some of these people,'' he said quietly, ``never saw me
play before.''
</P>
<P>
   That's maintaining your ego, which all the great ones have, with
dignity. His teammate Bobby Brown, later the American League
president, best described DiMaggio's blend of ego with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe goes through life scared to death people will ask for his
autograph,'' Brown said. ``And scared to death they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   He could laugh, too. He often told about the time he hit a home
run off Bobo Newsom's fastball. Connie Mack, the Philadelphia A's
manager, ordered Newsom never to throw DiMaggio a fastball again.
His next time up, he hit a curveball for another homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I rounded third base,'' he remembered, ``I heard Bobo yell,
`Hey, Mack, he hit yours farther than he hit mine.'''
</P>
<P>
   But now Joe DiMaggio, fulfilling Paul Simon's song, has really
``left and gone away.'' And taken Marilyn Monroe with him.

MIND OVER MATTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone once asked Jeremy NC Newman what he would do if he lost
the use of his legs, and he thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``I rely on the use of my legs for
everything I do . . . I'd probably put a gun in my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks later, it happened.
</P>
<P>
   A skydiving accident left the 31-year-old Reseda resident with a
ruptured aorta, two collapsed lungs, head trauma, a spinal-cord
injury as well as broken bones and torn muscles. He had to be
resuscitated twice. Within a few months, he was back at work as a
personal trainer but was now wheelchair bound.
</P>
<P>
   Newman redirected his passion from extreme sports such as
skydiving, bungee jumping and motorcycle riding. On Sunday he
competes in his second L.A. Marathon. The race is part of his
preparation for a transcontinental triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was faced with that (reality), (suicide) wasn't an
option for me, because I'm not a quitter,'' Newman said. ``I don't
give up. I look at what's happened to me as just one in a series of
hurdles that I have to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York native played competitive sports all his life. He
was on the rowing team at Columbia University and went into the
personal-training business 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The skydiving incident occurred during Memorial Day weekend
1997. Newman's plan was to release the ashes of his recently
deceased cat in what he calls ``my favorite playground.'' His first
jump of the weekend was his last. He has no memory of the accident
or the month that followed, but believes he hit a thermal, which
sucked the air out of his parachute and sent him into a free fall.
</P>
<P>
   While Newman recovered, his co-workers at the Sherman Oaks gym
where he still works trained Newman's clients and gave him the
money. His job was waiting for him whenever he was ready. The gym's
continued support of Newman includes purchasing special equipment
to help him train and allowing him time off for endeavors such as
the triathlon that starts next month. The cross country event is
expected to last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big inspiration,'' said Lance Fessler, the gym's owner.
``He shouldn't be alive. When I saw him in the hospital and the way
he looked, I never thought he'd be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some of his clients had doubts after he returned to
work, Fessler said no one questions Newman's ability now.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not training others, Newman spends the majority of his
time training himself. He competed in four marathons as an
able-bodied athlete. He always thought about triathlons but never
attempted one prior to the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in his current situation, even though he enjoys his
occupation, the aspirations he had before he was in a wheelchair
are still there,'' Fessler said. ``This is a good way for him to
fulfill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman finished last year's L.A. Marathon in 2 hours, 42
minutes. He hopes to break 2:30 this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dictate what my body's going to do,'' Newman said. ``I don't
let my body dictate what I'm going to do. By convincing myself that
the pain I'm experiencing is temporary, I can keep going. If I
convince myself that I can't stop, not only because I've got so
many people expecting me to do it, but also because I've got this
other thing coming up in a month. It's just another challenge that
I refuse to give into.''
</P>
<P>
   He's using his participation in the marathon and triathlon to
benefit his other love: children. Newman is raising money for the
the Try 4 Life organization and the Challenged Athletes Foundation,
which purchased his racing chair. He hopes his participation in the
events inspires disabled children and other people with the bleak
outlook he once possessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that I thought (after the accident) was that my
life was over,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have not only adjusted well to my situation, but I
really have embraced the fact that I'm in a wheelchair. My life is
completely changed and I love it. I love my new life and love who I
have become.''

A CLEMENCY CASE PUTS A GOVERNOR ON THE SPOT
</HEADLINE>
   (See also DEATH-PENALTY) 
(sw) 
 By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Little more than a month after bowing to a
plea from the pope and commuting the death sentence of a confessed
triple killer, the governor of Missouri faces the clemency petition
of a condemned man who has submitted to a lie detector test to
buttress his claim of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The test, given on Feb. 19 to Roy Roberts, who is to be executed
early Wednesday morning for the fatal stabbing of a prison guard,
showed no deception in his denial of involvement. It was
administered by a former officer on the police force here who was
described by Roberts' lawyer, Bruce D. Livingston, a federal public
defender, as a ``reputable, well-respected polygrapher not known as
defense-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing for which Roberts was sentenced to death occurred
during a riot in 1983 at the Moberly Training Center for Men, about
midway between Kansas City and St. Louis. Roberts, who was then
serving an 18-year sentence for an armed robbery in St. Louis four
years earlier, was charged with holding the guard, Thomas Jackson,
while other prisoners killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, now 45, contends that he could not have had a role in
the slaying because he was brawling with another guard when it
occurred. At the trial, Livingston's clemency petition notes, this
guard confirmed that he and Roberts fought during the melee,
involving 25 to 30 prisoners. But three other guards identified
Roberts as the man who had held Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston says these three guards failed to identify Roberts
when the state initially investigated the riot. They did so, he
says, only after they underwent hypnosis in an intense pretrial
effort by prosecutors. ``Such `evolving' testimony is inherently
suspect,'' Livingston said in the clemency petition, delivered to
Gov. Mel Carnahan last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 28, Carnahan, a Democrat who supports capital
punishment, commuted the death sentence of Darrell J. Mease to life
in prison without parole, granting the personal appeal of Pope John
Paul II, who had just visited St. Louis. Mease, who had admitted
killing a 19-year-old paraplegic and that victim's grandparents,
was widely considered a very weak candidate for clemency. But he
was the prisoner next scheduled for execution in Missouri, and the
pope, in a demonstration of the church's opposition to the death
penalty, urged the governor to spare his life.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, a Republican whom Carnahan intends to
challenge in the elections next year, criticized the governor's
decision. Although the senator has said nothing about the Roberts
case, Livingston's clemency petition urged the governor to show
``courage'' and said he hoped that ``fear of additional political
fallout will not prevent Governor Carnahan from granting clemency
in this much more deserving case.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carnahan acted in the Mease case, he had allowed 26
executions to proceed during his six years in office and had
granted clemency only once. Since then, he has allowed one
execution, that of James Edward Rodden, put to death on Feb. 24 for
the fatal stabbing of a woman in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In the Roberts case, Livingston argues, the outcome of the lie
detector test and conflicting witness accounts justify clemency, or
a delay of sentence for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   His argument has received strong support in recent days from a
long editorial and a column in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Bill
McClellan, a columnist for the paper, reported that it was possible
that Roberts was innocent not only of the prison killing but also
of the robbery for which he had been sent to prison in the first
place. McClellan quoted an old acquaintance of Roberts as having
said in an interview that he himself had committed that robbery,
which involved restaurant receipts of $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said Roberts had insisted on taking the lie detector
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous about his doing it,'' Livingston said. ``I told
him, `If you fail, it's all over.' I also told him we had to have
it done by someone whose reputation will mean something to the
governor. Roy said: `I don't care. I didn't do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The man who administered the test was Donald I. Dunlap, who
before retirement served for 30 years in the Kansas City Police
Department. Dunlap's written report says that Roberts showed ``no
deception'' in his answers denying involvement in the killing and
that he specifically denied holding the victim during the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was one of three prisoners charged with the killing of
Jackson. All &UR;  &LR; the defendants' lawyers won changes of venue out of
the town of Moberly, where the prison is situated, and each of the
trials was held in a venue different from the others. In one case,
Rodney Carr, identified by guards as having stabbed Jackson, was
sentenced to life in prison. In another, Robert Driscoll was
sentenced to death, but his conviction was overturned after it was
discovered that there was no blood on the knife he carried during
the uprising; he awaits a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who was not armed, was charged with grabbing the
victim, pulling his hair and forcing him against a window as the
stabbing ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, Roberts is the only person who was sentenced to death
for the crime, even though he is the least culpable, even under the
state's version of the evidence,'' Livingston's petition said.
``This disproportionality pales in comparison, however, to that
which arises if, as we contend, Roberts is indeed innocent of the
crime.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mourning and the tributes for Joe DiMaggio had
hardly begun Monday when a rhubarb of sorts swirled up _ this one
with political overtones _ over renaming a New York City highway
for the Yankee Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wanted it to be Manhattan's West Side
Highway, while Gov. George Pataki was said to favor the Major
Deegan Expressway in the Bronx. In Albany, a bill that might have
settled the matter _ the mayor's way _ was held up, apparently
because neither side wanted an unseemly brouhaha on a day of
solemnity for DiMaggio's family and multitudes of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work out with the city, with the Yankees, the
appropriate tribute at the appropriate time,'' the governor said
when asked about the rival plans at a news conference in Manhattan.
Pataki, effusively lauding DiMaggio, said his family should also be
consulted.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not express a preference or even acknowledge a
difference with the mayor over which road to rename. But an aide to
Pataki, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Major Deegan
was the obvious choice because it runs past Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was anything but obvious to the mayor, however. For months,
as DiMaggio's health has faded, Giuliani, a longtime New York
Yankee fan and DiMaggio devotee, has pressed his case for renaming
the West Side Highway after DiMaggio. He cited it in his State of
the City address in January. And at his behest, state Sen. Serphin
Maltese, R-Queens, introduced a bill to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative aides said that talks among leaders of the
Republican-controlled Senate, the Democratic-controlled Assembly
and the governor's office had concluded that any change should be
ceremonial, rather than formal, because the latter would
necessitate changing hundreds of road signs.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver of Manhattan agreed to sponsor
the bill, and until recently it seemed that both houses were ready
to pass it. Then, the aides said, Pataki's office objected, saying
it had encountered opposition from West Side residents. Assemblymen
from the West Side said they had heard no such objections, however.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side seemed concerned about the honor of Major William
F. Deegan, an architect who served in the Army Corps of Engineers
in New York in World War I, and later as Mayor James Walker's
commissioner of tenement housing. He died in 1932, and political
friends gave his name to the expressway completed in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   There was, as usual, a subtext to the Giuliani-Pataki
disagreement. The mayor's Joe DiMaggio Highway would run down the
Hudson River shore past the sprawling West Side site where Giuliani
has proposed a major sports complex with a domed stadium _ and
which he had once touted for a new Yankee Stadium, an idea he has
since backed away from.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's Joe DiMaggio Highway would run down the Bronx bank of
the Harlem River, right past Yankee Stadium, which the governor has
favored keeping in the Bronx. Geopolitics aside, the governor has
often quietly contradicted the Mayor in a rivalry that goes back to
Giuliani's endorsement of Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the differences, the mayor's bill had picked up support
in both houses recently, and legislative leaders had made tentative
plans to release it from committee and have it put to a vote in the
wake of DiMaggio's death.
</P>
<P>
   But the plans were put on hold Monday. Some officials cited
Pataki's opposition; others said Giuliani had asked for the delay.
It was clear that neither wanted to seem combative on a day of
mourning. But it was also clear that neither was backing down.
</P>
<P>
   As he extolled ``the personification of Yankee pride,'' the
mayor said, ``I'm comforted, as are all New Yorkers, that we
informed him before he died that the West Side Highway will be
renamed the Joe DiMaggio Highway.''

FINLEY'S MRI SHOWS ONLY MUSCLE STRAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ The Angels breathed a collective sigh of relief
Monday after learning the results of pitcher Chuck Finley's MRI
were normal.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels decided Finley would have the MRI because of
continued discomfort and stiffness in his upper back and neck. But
with nothing wrong other than the initial diagnosis of a muscle
strain, Finley will continue to get treatment. However, there is no
timetable for his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no big spurs, no disc problem, it was just
normal,'' trainer Ned Bergert said. ``He might toss a little bit
(today). Basically, it's `spring-training neck.' When he feels his
shoulder is ready, he and (pitching coach) Dick Pole will decide
when it's time to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does not start a Cactus League game by this weekend, his
opening-day start would be in jeopardy. But Finley might jump into
the starting rotation within the first five games, meaning he
really wouldn't miss a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Finley deserves to be the opening-day starter,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``If he can't, we won't worry about it.
Once we start the season, it doesn't matter as long as Chuck's out
there in the rotation and we run him out there 35 times. That's all
that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Joltin' Joe remembered: Joe DiMaggio's death didn't come as a
surprise but made some reflect on the type of hitter he was. Angels
hitting coach Rod Carew, a seven-time batting champion and Hall of
Famer, said he doesn't expect to see another hitter come along like
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's probably on a team up there with all the Yankee
legends,'' Carew said. ``He's got to be one of the best (hitters of
all-time).''
</P>
<P>
   As far as DiMaggio's record 56-game hitting streak, Carew said
it's not likely to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' said Carew, whose longest hitting streak
was 25 games. ``With all the specialty of today's game, it's going
to take someone special to do it. But we didn't think someone could
hit 70 homers either.
</P>
<P>
   ``(In order to break the record) it's going to take a line-drive
hitter, a guy who can bunt for a base hit if he's struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started playing baseball in the '50s, DiMaggio was the
guy everybody talked about,'' Collins said. ``Everybody was going
to be compared to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners manager Lou Piniella played for the Yankees and met
DiMaggio several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always enjoyed when Joe would come over to our clubhouse and
talk to us when I was there,'' Piniella said. ``He talked about the
championship clubs and it was always a thrill for me. He epitomized
what baseball is all about.''

U.S. SHIPYARD TO BUILD 2 LARGE PASSENGER VESSELS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A shipyard in Mississippi is planning to announce
on Tuesday that it will build two cruise ships, the first big
passenger ships built in this country since 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls Shipbuilding of Pascagoula, Miss., a subsidiary of
Litton Industries, and American Classic Voyages Inc., based in
Chicago, plan to announce a contract for the shipyard to build two
1,900-passenger cruise ships, for $440 million for use in the
Hawaiian Islands, according to people involved with the deal. The
contract includes an option for four additional vessels.
</P>
<P>
   American Classic Voyages already operates one cruise ship in the
Hawaiian Islands, the S.S. Independence, the only cruise ship that
flies an American flag. The two new ships will also be registered
in this country, which is a requirement for picking up and
discharging passengers in U.S. ports without visiting a foreign
port in between.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for agreeing to order the ships, Congress gave
American Classic Voyages special rights that will make it difficult
for other companies to join it in the Hawaiian cruise market. With
those rights, included in a 1997 military appropriations bill,
Congress reaffirmed 19th-century rules that limit the presence of
foreign-flag carriers. Foreign carriers can continue to take
passengers between Hawaii and the West Coast by stopping in Canada
or Mexico in between, or can stop in Hawaii on trans-Pacific
voyages.
</P>
<P>
   American-flag ships must be built and registered in this
country, use an American crew, be owned by Americans, and meet
certain Coast Guard regulations. Such ships are much more expensive
to build and operate, and most oceangoing ships that maintain
American-flag status do so because the cargoes they carry must
travel on American-flag vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The existing American-flag ship, the Independence, made its
maiden voyage in 1951, although she has been refurbished twice in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The last two big passenger ships built in this country were the
Brasil and the Argentina, both built for Moore-McCormack Lines, in
1958, according to George C. Devol, the publisher of Ocean and
Cruise News, a monthly magazine published in Stamford, Conn. The
two new ships, he said, will ``probably be the largest ever built
in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Most passenger ships are built in Finland, Italy, Germany or
France. One industry executive said that the two ships could have
been built for about 20 percent less in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of Ingalls' current business is ships and submarines
for the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials are expected to be present at the announcement on
Tuesday. Defense officials say the civilian contract will reduce
the shipyard's dependence on military procurement. The 1997
appropriations bill also included $250,000 for initial design, but
not construction, of civilian ships.
</P>
<P>
   The two ships, each 72,000 gross tons and 840 feet long, have
not yet been named; the company refers to the construction of both
as ``Project America.'' The first is scheduled for delivery in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   While the first two are expected to cruise within the Hawaiian
Islands, if more are ordered, they could provide the only direct
routes from West Coast ports to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   American Classic Voyages, which also operates paddle wheel boats
on the Mississippi River, is controlled by the investor Sam Zell.

NEW IMF AID PACT FURTHER RESTRICTS BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The Brazilian government and the
International Monetary Fund announced a revised loan agreement
Monday that commits Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, to
more stringent conditions for receiving further aid.
</P>
<P>
   The new accord, reached after more than a month of negotiations,
requires this country to produce a bigger budget surplus than was
initially agreed upon and restricts the Brazilian central bank's
ability to spend dollars defending the value of the real, the
national currency.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and the IMF originally signed a $41.5 billion rescue
package in November aimed at helping the country avoid the kind of
economic collapse that has ravaged Asian and the Russian economies.
The accord was aimed at applying pressure on Brazil to reduce
spending and ease increasingly burdensome debts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Brazilian decision in January to end controls that had
kept the value of its currency artificially high against the dollar
led to a decline of nearly 40 percent in the currency's exchange
value. The currency decline caused notable increase in interest
rates and inflation and required a resetting of the IMF's
performance targets from last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement calls for Brazil to increase its budget
surplus, excluding interest payments on debt, to 3.1 percent of the
gross domestic product, compared with 2.6 percent agreed upon
previously.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires Brazil to reduce overall public debt to a level
below the 46.5 percent of the gross domestic product specified in
the original agreement. The new level has not been specified.
</P>
<P>
   Once approved by the IMF's board, the new agreement will enable
Brazil to draw on a second aid installment, worth $9 billion, from
the loan package agreed upon in November. Although the money is not
expected to be deposited until early in April, assurances of the
new financing are seen as giving an important psychological boost
to investors and creditors here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Arminio Fraga, the new president of the central bank, said last
week that he intended to use part of the IMF loan to protect the
real against speculative selling, by purchasing reais with dollars
in the foreign-exchange market. But the terms of the accord just
reached limit the bank's ability to intervene in the currency
markets, establishing a ceiling of $3 billion this month, $2
billion for April and $1.5 billion each for May and June.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the announcement of the revised agreement,
the real strengthened slightly Monday in light trading on Brazilian
currency markets, settling at 1.97 to the dollar after dropping as
low as 2.22 to the dollar last week. Brazil's main stock index rose
3.39 percent in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Monday morning, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
described the revised agreement as an important step in restoring
confidence in the economy. ``The accord will set the conditions for
a resumption of growth in our economy, a revaluation of our
currency, encourage exports and finally, it will put Brazil on the
right track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview with Epoca magazine published Monday,
Cardoso also warned the nation's nearly 165 million people that
``the first half of 1999 is going to be very tough.'' Indeed, the
agreement foresees a decline of as much as 4 percent in economic
activity this year and inflation of just under 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Brazil's inflation rate in 1998 was below 2
percent, and as recently as mid-January Finance Minister Pedro
Malan was predicting that it would remain ``in single digits'' this
year. Hoping to calm fears of a spurt of price increases, Fraga
said at a news conference Monday that he intended ``to repeat ad
nauseam'' a single phrase: ``central bank, low inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new agreement in hand, Fraga, a former aide to
financier George Soros, along with Malan and other senior members
of the government's economic team, are to leave this week for
meetings with bankers in the United States, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Their objective is to regain access to foreign credit, which has
all but dried up in the last two months.

 SUSAN McDOUGAL BACK IN ARKANSAS FOR TRIAL  
(sw) 
 By STEVE BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ A still-defiant Susan McDougal returned to
Little Rock on Monday to stand trial on charges she attempted to
block the Whitewater investigation by refusing to tell a grand jury
about the personal and political finances of President Clinton and
his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As she has for more than four years, Mrs. McDougal, who was
jailed for 18 months after a federal judge cited her for civil
contempt for an earlier refusal to cooperate, maintains that the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, is interested only in
statements from her that would incriminate the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   She has said she has no such information and that, despite a
grant of immunity, she feared being charged with perjury should her
statements not meet Starr's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a personal vendetta'' on Starr's part, Mrs.
McDougal told reporters on Monday morning as she made her way into
the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   But W. Hickman Ewing, Starr's principal deputy in the Arkansas
phase of the investigation, said: ``We have to show that she had
relevant information and withheld it, and we're prepared to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal and her lawyer, Mark Geragos of Los Angeles, have
long promised to turn the tables and place Starr on trial,
insisting that his investigation is politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted her to lie,'' Geragos said. ``She wouldn't do it,
and she's innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal's present difficulty has its genesis in
Whitewater, the 20-year-old Arkansas real-estate venture that has
become an umbrella term for Starr's investigation of the Clintons
and several of their Arkansas associates.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal and her former husband, James B. McDougal, were
convicted in 1996 in a fraud conspiracy case in which Jim Guy
Tucker, a former Arkansas governor, was also found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The McDougals and the Clintons were partners in the Whitewater
resort, which federal prosecutors have said hastened the collapse
of a federally insured savings and loan association owned by
McDougal, who died last year while serving a federal prison
sentence for his conviction. Neither of the Clintons was charged.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation spread into Clinton's conduct in the White
House after it was revealed that the president had a liaison with a
White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, and sought to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers show that among the questions Mrs. McDougal refused
to answer was whether Clinton had testified truthfully when he
rebutted a prosecution witness who said that Clinton, while
governor of Arkansas, pressured him to make an improper $300,000
loan to Mrs. McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said at Mrs. McDougal's trial that a portion of the
loan was illegally diverted to the Whitewater project, which, like
McDougal's savings and loan, ultimately failed.
</P>
<P>
   Upon finishing her 18-month jail term for civil contempt last
year, Mrs. McDougal had barely begun the two-year prison sentence
she received for her fraud conviction in the Whitewater trial when
she was set free by the Federal District Court judge who sentenced
her, George Howard Jr. Howard said he had become convinced that
Mrs. McDougal's continued incarceration would aggravate a
degenerative spinal disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal was acquitted of embezzlement charges in
California in an unrelated case stemming from her employment
several years ago as a bookkeeper and personal assistant to the
symphony conductor Zubin Mehta and his wife, Nancy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under questioning on Monday, prospective jurors expressed
conflicting views of Starr, the president and Mrs. McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion of Kenneth Starr is that he has, at all costs,
pursued President Clinton, and has sacrificed a great deal in that
pursuit,'' said one potential juror, a white man in his 30s.
</P>
<P>
   But another prospective juror said that Starr had been
``misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I disapprove of Bill Clinton,'' the man said. ``I consider him
an ultra-liberal, almost a socialist.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as for Mrs. McDougal: ``She could have talked. She could
have avoided this whole thing.''

U.S. SAYS EUROPEANS WITHHOLD BANANA-TRADE DATA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The United States accused the European Union on Monday
of worsening a trans-Atlantic fight over banana imports by failing
to provide the World Trade Organization with data vital in
determining losses suffered by American fruit companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Hayes, the U.S. representative, made the accusation as the
trade organization met in a special session called on the request
of the European Union. The Europeans continued to denounce American
action last week aimed at punishing their 15-nation bloc for its
stance in the banana dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The world trade forum has found that the European Union's banana
import rules give unfair preference to exporters in Caribbean and
African nations, most of them former European colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Washington contends that European Union rules deprive
American-based banana companies of $520 million a year in lost
sales in Europe. The trade organization had planned to make a final
determination on the amount of damages a week ago, then requested
more information, and is not expected to rule until later this
month. Angered at the delay, the United States went ahead and
imposed 100 percent tariffs on $520-million worth of European
imports _ mostly luxury items such as pecorino cheese and cashmere
sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   At the session on Monday, Roderick Abbott, the European Union's
representative, said that the United States was single-handedly
``declaring war'' on any nation ``whose compliance it decides is
inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the European Union had hoped to get strong backing from
members of the 134-nation world trade body, representatives of some
countries said that the organization had been distracted by the
banana dispute and urged it to address other problems. John Weekes
of Canada told delegates that trade between the United States and
European Union nations amounted to only 5 percent of global
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was made at the meeting, which was closed to
outsiders. Delegates briefed reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The United States received a strong expression of protest from
Caribbean Community nations on Sunday, when they suspended an
anti-drug-trafficking agreement that President Clinton signed in
1997. Small Caribbean countries say their economies will be
devastated unless they have a ready market for bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hayes argued on Monday that the European Union had shirked
responsibility to comply with trade rulings, and had repeatedly
engaged in delaying tactics, including, she said, calling Monday's
special session.
</P>
<P>
   A key example, she maintained, was failure to give necessary
information to a panel of three arbitrators who were to determine
how much money U.S. companies exporting bananas from Central
America and elsewhere in the region had lost as the result of their
near-exclusion from European markets.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott hinted that some compromise could be reached.
``Discussions are getting more concrete,'' he told reporters,
adding that the Europeans thought the arbitrators would find
considerably less than $520 million in lost sales, though they did
not think the figure would be zero, either.

BOTH SIDES APPEAR TO HAVE EMERGED WITH PARTIAL VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With INTEL-ANTITRUST) 
(sw) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government's proposed antitrust settlement with Intel Corp.
is viewed as a careful compromise that seeks to clarify the ground
rules for how a powerful company can wield its intellectual
property as a weapon in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Both Intel and the Federal Trade Commission, according to
industry executives and antitrust experts, seem to have emerged
with partial victories. And both sides, they say, had incentives to
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The precise terms of the planned settlement have not been
disclosed, but the agreement does set guidelines for when Intel has
to disclose its technology to other companies. The FTC complaint
contended that Intel, the dominant producer of microprocessors that
power personal computers, had unfairly withheld its technical
information from the Intergraph Corp., the Compaq Computer Corp.
and the Digital Equipment Corp. (now a division of Compaq) as a
bullying response to patent disputes it had with the three computer
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, the courts have tended to protect the right of
dominant producers to use their patents to exclude competitors. The
three companies cited in the FTC complaint, however, are customers.
And the issue that most alarmed the commission staff and its
chairman, Robert Pitofsky, according to people close to the case,
was that Intel was cutting the computer makers off from trade
secrets they needed to bring new products to market.
</P>
<P>
   Intel routinely provides this advance information to computer
makers in thick books marked ``Highly Confidential'' and coded by
color _ yellow, orange and red, with red being the most
confidential. ``It was pulling back the trade secrets that the FTC
felt was too strong a move by Intel,'' one person close to the case
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's concern over that form of retaliation, industry
analysts say, is understandable. ``Intel essentially has the power
to devastate a personal computer company by refusing to deal with
it on the same terms as other computer companies,'' said Michael
Slater, the principal analyst for Microdesign Resources, a research
firm in Sebastopol, Calif. ``If a company does not get the prior
disclosure from Intel, it will trail way behind its competitors in
getting products to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what happened to Intergraph, a maker of
powerful work stations using Intel chips after it filed a patent
infringement suit against Intel in November 1997, according to the
FTC. And it took the company several months to make its work
station products competitive with rival products after a federal
judge ordered Intel last April to treat Intergraph the same as it
treated other customers, said Keith Britnell, an Intergraph
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has not disputed the facts in the FTC suit but asserted
its right to withdraw access to its intellectual property from
companies that were suing it. Antitrust experts say that while
Intel was aggressive in cutting off the three customers, the chip
maker's use of its intellectual property as a negotiating tool was
common in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Jack Kilby, an engineer for Texas Instruments,
invented the integrated circuit in 1958, the industry realized that
patent disputes could hobble this emerging high-technology
industry. All new semiconductor designs build on earlier, patented
technology, so rather than getting bogged down in endless court
cases two industry practices emerged.
</P>
<P>
   First, the major semiconductor makers, including Intel, National
Semiconductor and IBM, all agreed to broad cross-licensing pacts _
``the intellectual property equivalent of mutually assured
destruction,'' one industry executive noted. Second, the standard
industry practice became for the major companies to invoke their
intellectual property claims mainly ``defensively,'' if they were
sued.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that ``a pretty efficient barter market in
intellectual property has become part of the foundation of the
semiconductor industry,'' observed Mit Spears, a former general
counsel of the FTC, who is a partner of Shook, Hardy &AMP; Bacon in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With its settlement, the FTC apparently wants to avoid any
heavy-handed intervention that would threaten the industry's brisk
trade in intellectual property. Still, it does ``want to insure
that there is a more democratic sharing of information in the
semiconductor industry,'' said Richard Doherty, president of
Envisioneering, a technology research firm in Seaford, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Intel seems to have received the assurances that
its concessions would not devalue its intellectual assets. In a
statement on Monday, Craig Barrett, president of Intel, noted
pointedly, ``We are satisfied that the agreement gives us value for
our intellectual property rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel, according to a person close to the case, was most
concerned that any settlement with the government not force it to
disclose what it calls ``definition stage'' technology development
_ products that might be two or three years from the market. By
contrast, the company was more willing to compromise on
intellectual property that was at the center of the complaint,
which was sharing information with customers on chips that would go
into computers in three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had its own reasons for being willing to reach a
settlement. Antitrust is meant to protect competition and
consumers, while the FTC complaint focused on Intel's dealing with
its customers _ not rivals or potential rivals who might challenge
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply playing hardball is not an antitrust violation,'' said
Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``You have to show an actual effect on competition or a
likely effect on competition in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By settling this case,'' added Shapiro, a former senior
official in the Justice Department's antitrust division and a
consultant to Intel, ``the commission avoids putting the debatable
theory behind its complaint to the test.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission announced Monday that
it had reached a tentative settlement of its antitrust suit against
Intel Corp., the world's largest producer of computer chips, a day
before opening arguments were set to begin in the case.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was Intel's refusal to share technical details of its
microprocessor chips with companies that build computers unless
those companies agreed to turn over their own technologies in
exchange. The government suit asserted that such practices violated
federal antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Microprocessors are the brains of computers. Without information
about how the chips work, manufacturers cannot design their next
generations of personal computers and work stations. As part of the
proposed deal, Intel agreed to abide by an order that prohibits it
from pressuring computer manufacturers to turn over their own
technology in exchange for technical information about Intel's
chips, people involved in the case said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although government officials and Intel executives said they
could not disclose the precise terms of the proposed settlement
until it had been formally submitted to the Federal Trade
Commission, officials did say that it achieved the purpose of the
lawsuit. Lawyers for the commission had asked an administrative law
judge to order Intel to end its practice of withholding valuable
technology from computer manufacturers as a weapon in patent
disputes with those companies. The government had not sought
monetary penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission sought to establish a principle, and the staff
believes the proposed agreement achieves that goal,'' said Victoria
Streitfeld, the agency's top spokeswoman. ``The staff got the
relief it wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's clout in the industry is derived from the fact that its
microprocessors power more than 80 percent of personal computers in
use today. Although it has lost some market share to competitors in
the last two years, it still sets the technological standards for
the chip industry with each new generation of its Pentium
processors.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Justice Department's trial against Microsoft
Corp., the Intel case has been widely viewed as among the most
significant antitrust lawsuits in recent years. The two companies _
known as the ``Wintel duopoly'' because of their domination of the
personal computer industry with Microsoft's Windows operating
system and Intel's microprocessors _ have been accused of
maintaining monopolies in their respective industries by stifling
competition and bullying computer makers, who are their biggest
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Intel case, government lawyers accused the company of
stifling innovation by existing and potential rivals by trying to
force three other companies _ Compaq Computer Corp., Digital
Equipment Corp. and Intergraph _ to surrender their patent rights.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has acknowledged that it withheld information about its
chips from the three companies. However, Intel executives said that
practice was not part of a larger effort to coerce rivals into
giving up technology but a legitimate defense in response to patent
claims asserted by those companies.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed order at the center of Monday's agreement contains
specific provisions that describe when it would be appropriate for
Intel to withhold such technology in the future, said lawyers and
others involved in the case who spoke on condition of anonymity. By
setting guidelines that determine when cutting off customers is
based on a valid business decision rather than as part of a
monopolistic scheme, the agreement provides a clarity that Intel's
executives and lawyers found to be particularly attractive, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposed settlement, once approved, will resolve a
government case that some antitrust experts said could have gone
either way as a matter of antitrust law, the deal provides several
significant benefits for Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Barrett, president and chief executive of Intel, issued a
statement Monday morning praising the proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this compromise agreement as a win-win for both
parties, and we are satisfied that the agreement gives us value for
our intellectual property rights,'' Barrett said. ``This is
acceptable to both parties and was the result of constructive
dialogue between Intel and the FTC.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will avoid the spectacle of a two-month trial that
could have become a public forum for airing its dirty laundry.
Intel executives and lawyers had been closely watching Microsoft
take a public relations beating in its antitrust case in a federal
district court here. That suit was filed by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   With Intel taking the position that it was not a monopoly, FTC
lawyers were preparing a legal strategy similar to that employed by
Justice Department lawyers in the Microsoft case. That strategy
entailed introducing as much evidence as the lawyers could find to
support assertions that the company used strong-arm tactics to
dominate the chip business.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as part of the proposed agreement, the commission staff
reached no legal conclusion that Intel is a monopoly, a finding
that would have had significant legal and practical consequences
for the company in other cases. Incriminating evidence in the FTC's
case, for instance, could have been used in a separate civil case
brought against Intel by Intergraph, a producer of specialized
computer workstations.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Intergraph has accused Intel of fraud, theft of
trade secrets and anti-competitive conduct. Last year, the federal
district judge hearing that case tentatively concluded that Intel
had engaged in monopolistic practices. A trial in that proceeding
is set to begin next February.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Intel's shareholders applauded the proposed agreement. The stock
closed at $119.625, up $5 a share, in heavy trading, and it was
widely credited with boosting much of the technology sector,
driving the Nasdaq up 60.51 points, or 2.6 percent, to 2,398.62 on
a day when the Dow lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tentative settlement announced Monday does not close
the FTC's books on other Intel inquiries. Government officials
emphasized that issues arising out of a broader investigation that
has been under way for the last year have yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   There are remaining issues under investigation by the
commission,'' said William Baer, director of the agency's bureau of
competition, which brought the case that was settled Monday. The
commission's staff is committed to working expeditiously to resolve
those concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been examining a variety of Intel's business
practices, including the contract restrictions imposed on customers
through nondisclosure agreements, Intel's control of industry
standards and the special pricing arrangements and restrictions
required of computer makers as part of Intel's highly successful
``Intel Inside'' marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers said that Monday's proposed settlement will permit
the agency merely reassigned the lawyers involved in the lawsuit to
focus more heavily on other aspects of the agency's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Federal Trade Commission has not disclosed the details
of the proposed settlement, computer makers and Intel rivals said
they could not assess its long-term impact on the computer
industry. But they said that any restraints on Intel's dominance of
the industry could only help encourage competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that is a settlement that forces Intel to make
concessions basically supports the case that we have filed,'' James
Meadlock, the chairman and chief executive of Intergraph, said
shortly after emerging from a briefing at the Federal Trade
Commission here. ``It has to be a positive development for our
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Siekman, senior vice president and general counsel at
Compaq, which last year acquired Digital Equipment, also praised
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that the interests of Compaq, Intel and our
customers will be satisfied through the ultimate approval of the
settlement by the FTC,'' Siekman said.

   TAMPA, Fla. _ They began paying tribute to Joe DiMaggio here
early Monday morning, fans old and young visiting the pinstriped
plaque erected in his name outside Legends Field, many of them
wearing New York Yankees caps. A few brought flowers, others took
pictures, some prayed.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees players, too, honored the man introduced as ``the
greatest living ballplayer'' at Yankee Stadium every year. Before
Monday night's exhibition game with Philadelphia, they emerged from
their dugout, hats off, for a moment of silence, DiMaggio's No. 5
sewn onto the left sleeve of each uniform. Rob Cucuzza, the
Yankees' equipment manager, had brought 300 of the emblems to
Florida, just in case; he had hoped he would not have to use them.
</P>
<P>
   When a highlight reel was shown on the video scoreboard, the
fans all stood before anybody asked them to. ``It's a sad day
here,'' David Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Derek Jeter: ``There was a mystique about him, the way he
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Said George Steinbrenner: ``It was the class and dignity with
which he led his life that made him a part of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter learned of DiMaggio's death when the news crawled across
the bottom of his television screen. To Jeter and to most of the
other Yankees, DiMaggio was royalty who passed through the
clubhouse once or twice a year: You never initiated conversation
with him.
</P>
<P>
   You could joke and laugh and swap stories with Whitey Ford and
Reggie Jackson and other Yankee greats; with DiMaggio, most of the
Yankees remained silent until he spoke to them. Jeter, Darryl
Strawberry, Cone and others mentioned how they never had the
intestinal fortitude to ask DiMaggio for an autograph; you heard
stories, Andy Pettitte said, about how he refused autograph
requests. Cone, in fact, purchased a dozen balls autographed by
DiMaggio, rather than ask.
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio repeatedly surprised them. Someone apparently
mentioned to DiMaggio that right fielder Paul O'Neill had a
collection of autographed bats, and before an Old-Timers' Day game,
DiMaggio approached O'Neill and asked, ``You have that bat for me
to sign?'' That bat, O'Neill said, is encased in his basement,
``and always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio came face-to-face with Cone once, told him he had seen
him pitch on many occasions. ``Sometimes you look unhittable,''
said DiMaggio, ``and sometimes you look very hittable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone laughed Monday, recalling the exchange. ``I didn't know
what to make of it,'' said Cone. ``I walked away with my tail
between my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy and Laura Pettitte attended a team dinner following the
1996 World Series victory and DiMaggio happened by, looking for a
place to sit. He took the chair next to the pitcher and chatted
amiably throughout the meal. ``He really was very nice,'' Pettitte
said. DiMaggio once paused to compliment Bernie Williams, the
latest heir in the Yankees' long line of superlative center
fielders. The praise stunned Williams, so much so that he does not
recall anything else DiMaggio said to him.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, traded to Toronto less than three weeks ago, may
have had the most extensive contact with DiMaggio. Before DiMaggio
was honored before the final game of last season, on Joe DiMaggio
Day, he congratulated Wells on his perfect game. Wells was so
fidgety during the game that Manager Joe Torre facetiously
suggested that he go bother DiMaggio _ and Wells did, taking the
elevator to Steinbrenner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Wells joined DiMaggio, Phil Rizzuto and Steinbrenner, gabbing
and laughing. Wells asked DiMaggio _ ``Mr. DiMaggio,'' Wells called
him _ for an autograph, and the Yankees' legend obliged him. ``When
he showed up at the Stadium, George treated him like a king,''
Wells said Monday. ``He'd roll out the red carpet, and rightfully
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he threw out the first ball on Opening Day or on
Old-Timers' Day, DiMaggio shook hands with players in the dugout,
then strolled onto the field, ball in hand. O'Neill was struck by
the way DiMaggio moved in his 80s, his stride even and graceful.
You could see what a wonderful athlete he was, O'Neill said. Not
until recent years did DiMaggio concede to age and move forward
from the mound to shorten his toss to the catcher, and his throw
usually was right on target; some of the Yankees were sure that he
practiced.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing the first ball, he would move forward and shake
hands with the catcher _ Joe Girardi last April _ and say, ``Good
luck.'' And then he walked off steadily into the dugout,
disappearing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The daylight waned. Approaching DiMaggio's plaque, Pete
Mastrobono, 86, removed his blue Yankees cap and covered his heart,
silent words moving his lips. Now of Zephyr Hills, Fla., Mastrobono
grew up in Westchester County and went to Yankee Stadium on Sundays
with his friends, to watch DiMaggio with $2 tickets. Mastrobono
remembered, in his mind's eye, how DiMaggio slammed home runs, the
way he slowed gracefully after rounding first base once he knew the
ball had cleared the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Mastrobono had a ticket to Monday night's game, a birthday
present from neighbors who share his love for the Yankees and
looked out for him in recent years, after Mastrobono's wife passed
away. Ralph Zito _ a Yankees zealot reared in Newark, N.J. _
invites Mastrobono to watch games with his family, including his
daughter, Ginger, 14; she inherited the Yankees gene, and has a
particular affinity for Jeter. Mastrobono joined the Zitos for an
Italian meal before the World Series games, and every play seemed
to spur memories and Mastrobono would tell stories until the Zitos
would smile at each other and ask him to lower his voice. Ssshh,
Jeter is batting.
</P>
<P>
   Mastrobono backed away from DiMaggio's plaque before removing
his Yankees cap. His aged eyes bright, Mastrobono smiled and said,
``I just said hi to old Joe.''

`PEONY PAVILLION': FUSION COOKING FOR A MING RITUAL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The ``Peony Pavilion'' wars have been of a
civil nature up to now: traditionalists arguing among themselves
about how a 400-year-old Chinese opera should be put before the
public. Disputes over theatrical interpretation are often loud, but
this one became an international incident a year ago, much to the
consternation of the Lincoln Center Festival, which found its
imported centerpiece suddenly canceled by bureaucrats in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Not traditional enough, said Chinese cultural politicians,
although the updates of style were by all indications mild to
nonexistent. Other guardians of the status quo underlined the
conservative view a month ago in New York with a staid if somewhat
arthritic production of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Now the reverent have a common enemy in the Peter Sellars
``Peony Pavilion,'' which had its first American performances over
the weekend here at Zellerbach Hall. Sellars' production is also
filled with reverence but for no one thing in particular. It opens
its arms wide and squeezes everything within reach to its bosom.
</P>
<P>
   The story, long frozen in Ming-period ritual, is not used to
such freedom. In it, a maiden dreams of a lover, wastes away from
frustration, and is resurrected, first as ghost then as
reconstituted flesh and blood, when he appears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peony Pavilion'' is a vivid example of a genre popular
among the rich at the end of the 16th century when Chinese of all
classes seemed as theater-mad as their English contemporaries. Like
Shakespearean drama the so-called Kunqu school of opera survives
through a continually negotiated truce between preservation and
rebirth. Change is simultaneously resisted and embraced among the
Chinese, just as it is among modern performers of Haydn and Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   Tang Xianzu's original is 55 scenes lasting 20 hours. The
Sellars version concedes the limits of current attention spans and
producers' budgets and has come up with a synopsis of about three
hours. Then it lays out a series of choices: old versus new, East
versus West. Having done this, it chooses not to choose among them.
</P>
<P>
   So we are given multiple sets of heroine and hero: the Kunqu
lovers with their delicately choreographed gestures and swooping,
high-pitched song-speech; the Italian opera lovers emoting and
arpeggiating like so many Rodolfos and Normas; American teen-agers
putting on their makeup, reading fashion magazines and dying as
much of boredom as lovesickness.
</P>
<P>
   There is more: a dancer (Michael Schumacher) who translates
anguish into body language, and Tan Dun, a composer who revives
traditional kunqu music and adds extensive glosses of his own. One
gave thanks for a Zellerbach stage big enough to bear such heavy
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Peony Pavilion'' is at heart political: a multicultural
tract, a Pacific Rim jamboree. Here was Chinese theatrical
tradition as interpreted by the United Nations. It is as if Sellars
had sat down the 16th, 19th and 20th centuries along with Chinese
theater, European opera and American teen-age melodrama and asked,
``Why can't we all just get along?''
</P>
<P>
   Metaphors fly fast and furious across the stage. Chief among
them may be a dreamed-of America, various yet single-minded, where
many cultures tell a single story each in their own language. The
narratives are not homogenized but superimposed, so that unity and
individuality coexist rather than contradict. On the menu at lunch
before Saturday's performance were pork chops soaked in brine from
the American South covered with a Mediterranean sauce. They were
good; it was good. Maybe fusion cooking is what Sellars has in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The production, shared among the Vienna Festival, the Barbican
Center in London and Cal Performances at the University of
California at Berkeley, has good ingredients of its own. As the
heroine Du Liniang, Hua Wenyi is a radiant, graceful apparition;
for her, passion is reticence and decorum. Reconciling her ritual
restraint with the lesser levels of abstraction around her is a
problem the production never solves.
</P>
<P>
   For theater is not about real life, a phenomenon more accurately
discovered by looking in our next-door neighbor's window. Theater
is about shortened time, speeding clocks, exaggerations of speech
and surreality of events. It is in short about human control over
events, and the level of abstraction _ the balance between natural
and artificial _ varies wildly at every level of this ``Peony
Pavilion.''
</P>
<P>
   The multicultural metaphor fits Tan precisely. A musician
experienced in the Chinese tradition and now a freewheeling
operative in the West, he is a virtual vacuum cleaner of a
composer, sucking up every style, sentiment, gesture and device
around him. The first half of the evening finds Tan arranging and
augmenting old kunqu music. Later he uses tradition as a starting
point in a great melting pot of eccentric percussion rhythms,
operatic flourishes and electronic enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   Sellars, as always, puts on a good show. George Tsypin's design
is fitted with clear plastic walls and cabinets and strewn with
television screens. Sellars' uninhibited pursuit of his own fancies
is his truly lovable trait. Here the idea of hand-held cameras
extends to players carrying their own and training them on
themselves and others. A love scene of extended silence is
memorably touching.
</P>
<P>
   Intense in their different ways are the pairs of lovers: Lauren
Tom and Joel de la Fuente as actor and actress, Ying Huang and and
Lin Qiang Xu as soprano and tenor. Shi Jiehua is the daintily kunqu
Spring Fragrance; Takayo Fischer is the up-to-date Madam Du. Steven
Osgood conducted; Min Xiao-Fen played the mandolin-like pipa.
</P>
<P>
   One entered Saturday's performance filled with admiration for
such levels of ambition. One came out ultimately worn down by
multiplicity, exhausted by the task of sorting out the cultural
alternatives. Many elements placed together can add up to an
impressive conglomerate, but there is also the danger of their
adding up to nothing. It is this kind of indiscriminate generosity
that undermines so much of Tan's other music, and it doesn't do
this production much good either.
</P>
<P>
   After a period of great excitement in the nation's kitchens,
fusion cooking, I am told, has suffered a decline. In the zeal to
mix culinary metaphors (how about crab and papaya quesadillas?), it
was discovered that people were forgetting how the originals were
properly made. This ``Peony Pavilion'' is a kind of urban, ethnic
fusion: a big, teaming, multiracial Los Angeles of a production. It
is heartwarming in its way, fascinating to think about, but
Sellars' outstretched arms simply can't hold all the things it
reaches for.

KINGS SELF-DESTRUCT AS DUCKS MOVE AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At times when visiting the Pond, it is easy to forget that you
went there to watch a National Hockey League game.
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leaf Gardens, this ain't.
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed animals roam the stands, lasers beam, and when Mighty
Ducks goalie Guy Hebert makes a routine stop on an unscreened
75-foot lob by an opposing team's fourth-liner, a few fans shriek
as if they'd just seen Dominik Hasek stone Jaromir Jagr in the
seventh game of a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Pond these days is the site of the most
compelling hockey seen in these parts in six years, since Wayne
Gretzky and his crew led the Kings on their two-month march to the
Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   When the officials actually get around to dropping a puck, Paul
Kariya and Teemu Selanne _ and a solid supporting cast _ are
putting on a show.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have chemistry, they have skill and, at the moment,
they have a club-record seven-game winning streak. They aren't
going to win the Stanley Cup or even reach the finals, but at the
moment, they hold the promise of a fun ride on a dark horse when
the playoffs begin in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everybody believes you can beat anybody,'' Selanne said
the other day after the Ducks beat the Stanley Cup champion Detroit
Red Wings, ``you have a really strong team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks believe.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that one short year ago, the Ducks were
enduring an abysmal season and the Kings were heading to the
postseason. The reversal of fortunes for the local teams provide a
vivid example of just how fragile success is.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, Kariya has stayed healthy, new coach Craig
Hartsburg has built good chemistry and taught a sound defensive
system, Hebert often has been impenetrable, defenseman Fredrik
Olausson has contributed 14 goals, the power play is the best in
the league, many players not named Kariya and Selanne are making
major contributions, and the Ducks are beating the teams they're
supposed to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Remove any one element and maybe it all falls apart. Right now,
it's working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got a long way to grow,'' Hartsburg said. ``We're
a young team. A lot of the players are still learning. As a group,
we're still trying to gain more confidence and stay on the path we
have to stay on, and that's hard, simple hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stay cool: Rob Blake's dismay at the state of the Kings is
understandable. Here's hoping he doesn't let it get the better of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's hotheaded response to a third-period high stick by
Calgary's Clarke Wilm killed any hopes the Kings had of rallying
against the Flames. Whether referee Mick McGeough made the correct
call _ assessing Blake an instigator penalty for retaliating with a
hail of punches _ is immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   And Blake sent a discouraging message to his teammates after the
game when he defended his actions by saying, ``We're far enough out
of the playoff hunt that you're not going to sit there and take
that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they wake today, the Kings are only seven points out of
the playoffs with 18 games left. They have two games remaining with
San Jose, the team they are chasing. It is unlikely the Kings will
make the playoffs, but they are not so far out that they can take
the attitude that anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sigmund Fraud?: The Flyers were 16-1-7 from Dec. 16 to Feb.
6, but since then, they've posted a record of 2-9-3.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia general manager Bob Clarke swung into action,
recalling goalie Jean-Marc Pelletier from the minors to fill in for
struggling John Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   Also, before a game against Ottawa, Clarke called in team
psychologist Dr. Joel Fish to address the players. Fish's powerful
words had this effect: The Flyers lost to the Senators 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   __ Waning Gretzky:Not including Monday night's game against
Toronto, the New York Rangers were 4-0-1 since Wayne Gretzky left
the lineup and Petr Nedved began centering the first line. The New
York Daily News conducted a survey of its readers, asking the
question, ``Are the Rangers better off without Gretzky as the No. 1
center? Of the 315 readers to cast votes, 61.6 percent said yes.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fleury-less Flames:The big question now that Theoren Fleury
is with Colorado is whether he will stick to his word and test free
agency on July 1. If he does, the Kings are expected to be among
the bidders for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix said, ``I told his
agent (Don Baizley) that the next few months will give us a chance
to talk about (a contract), and he totally agreed. We know Theo is
in a unique situation, with a chance to be a total free agent, and
we respect that. But as far as we are concerned today, the thrill
that we have is that he is going to bring to our club what we need
to have to try and accomplish our ultimate goal (the Stanley Cup).
That's why we did it.''

U.S. FIRES NUCLEAR SCIENTIST SUSPECTED OF SPYING FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to expand with 8 grafs at bottom; tightens and rewrites
throughout)  (wg) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Taiwan-born scientist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory was fired Monday for security breaches in connection
with China's theft of American nuclear secrets, Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was questioned for three days by the
FBI, starting last Friday, but ``stonewalled'' during the
questioning, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a computer scientist who had been working in the nuclear
weapons design area at Los Alamos, has not been charged with any
crime. He was identified by Federal officials as the chief suspect
in the theft of the nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the nuclear secrets stolen from the lab, the
administration officials said, China has made a leap in the
development of nuclear weapons with much smaller warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's handling of the espionage matter is leading
to sharp criticism from Capitol Hill. Senator Fred Thompson, an
influential Republican, representing Tennessee, sharply criticized
the Clinton administration Monday for failing to notify Congress in
late 1997 that China had stolen nuclear secrets when the
administration certified that Beijing was no longer helping other
nations build a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   That certification lifted a 12-year ban on the sale of American
nuclear technology to China, an action long eyed by American
companies eager to bid on the estimated $60 billion Chinese market
for civilian nuclear power plants.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The FBI began to question Lee on Friday in an attempt to
determine whether he had passed American secrets to the Chinese.
The questioning continued through late Sunday, but Lee failed to
fully cooperate, Richardson said. Richardson then fired Lee on
Monday, after receiving a green light to do so from the FBI, senior
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials acknowledged last week that they did not have
enough to arrest him then, but hoped their interviews with Mr. Lee
would lead to a break in the case. While he agreed to talk with the
FBI and nuclear experts throughout the weekend, his failure to
fully cooperate has apparently still left the FBI without enough
evidence to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Richardson believed he had sufficient evidence to
dismiss Mr. Lee. He was dismissed for ``failure to properly notify
Energy Department and lab officials about contacts with people from
a sensitive country, specific instances of failing to properly
safeguard classified material, and apparently attempting to deceive
lab officials about security matters,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at their home in Los Alamos, N.M., on Monday afternoon,
Lee's wife, Sylvia, a former secretary at the lab, refused to give
his whereabouts or comment on the matter. Lee, who officials said
is in his late 50's and has been working at Los Alamos for more
than a decade, did not hire an attorney to represent him during his
interviews with the FBI, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been the prime suspect in a nearly three-year FBI
investigation, code-named ``Kindred Spirit,'' into Beijing's theft
of U.S. nuclear technology from Los Alamos, senior officials from
the bureau and the Energy Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, China's nuclear weapons designs were a
generation behind those of the United States, largely because
Beijing had been unable to produce small warheads that could be
launched from a single missile at multiple targets.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, China had built and tested such small
bombs, a breakthrough officials say was accelerated by the Los
Alamos theft.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage is believed to have occurred in the 1980s,
officials said, but was not detected until 1995, when American
experts from Los Alamos analyzing Chinese nuclear test results
found similarities to America's most advanced miniature warhead,
the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   By February 1996, investigators from the Energy Department and
the FBI, searching travel records and other data at Los Alamos and
other U.S. weapons labs, had identified five possible suspects,
officials said. Lee quickly emerged as the prime suspect, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now believe that Lee gave the Chinese sensitive
nuclear detonation information during a 1988 seminar, senior
administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But after opening a formal criminal investigation in June 1996,
the FBI did not at first aggressively pursue the espionage case,
according to several senior U.S. officials familiar with the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last several weeks, after prodding from Congress and
the Energy secretary, did government officials administer lie
detector tests to Lee. After a first test was administered in
December, the FBI, unsatisfied with those results, gave Lee a
second test in February, and on that test he was found to be
deceptive, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI decided to interview Lee last Friday after he failed the
polygraph, or lie detector test, in February, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (NEW MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism over their handling of the case, FBI
officials say that Chinese spy activities are far more difficult to
investigate than the more traditional espionage operations of the
former Soviet Union. The Chinese often take advantage of scientific
exchanges and many other forms of informal contacts, gathering
sensitive information from such a wide range of sources that it is
often difficult to pinpoint exactly how American secrets leaked
out. U.S. officials say they have concluded that Beijing is
continuing to steal secrets from the Government's major nuclear
weapons laboratories, which had been increasingly opened to foreign
visitors after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, since the theft of the W-88 design information
apparently occurred so far in the past, the Justice Department at
first lacked the grounds to obtain a secret wiretap on the suspect,
making it difficult initially to build a strong criminal case,
according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Energy Department failed to move Mr. Lee out of his
sensitive position, or remove his security clearances, for more
than a year after FBI Director Louis J. Freeh told Energy officials
in September, 1997 that there was no longer any investigative
reason to keep him in place. In espionage cases, the FBI often
wants suspects left alone by their employers for fear of tipping
them off to their investigations. He was finally moved out of a
sensitive area several weeks ago, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's wife, Sylvia, quit her secretarial job at the lab sometime
in the last year or two, Energy Department officials said. FBI and
Energy Department officials said that Lee's wife's activities had
raised questions while she worked at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, she was invited to China to give an academic
paper on parallel processing _ even though she was only a secretary
at Los Alamos. Her husband, who was the true expert, accompanied
her, according to a U.S. official. In addition, Energy Department
officials said co-workers at Los Alamos questioned the fact that
she frequently ``inserted herself'' into gatherings at the lab with
visiting Chinese delegations.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI officials said that she was not a target of their
investigation. FBI officials have said it is possible that others
were involved in the theft of nuclear secrets from Los Alamos, but
they have not yet identified other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in response to criticism of the lax security at Los
Alamos and other national weapons labs owned by the Department of
Energy, Richardson said Monday he is ordering that about 700 Energy
Department and laboratory employees be required to take periodic
polygraph examinations. The order does not cover all Energy and lab
employees with so-called ``Q'' security clearances giving them
access to nuclear secrets, Richardson said, but does cover those
who work in the most sensitive areas. Currently, only employees of
the CIA are required to submit to polygraph exams on a regular
basis.

BIG CHIP MAKER ISSUES WARNING ON JOBS AND EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Still struggling with manufacturing
difficulties, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said Monday that it would
report a significant loss for the current quarter, which ends March
28, and cut 300 jobs worldwide over the next two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro made its announcement after the close of the
market. Its shares, which closed up 50 cents at $18.9375 on the New
York Stock Exchange, slipped as low as $17 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's warning comes after a similar statement a month ago,
when Advanced Micro said that pricing pressures on microprocessors
might leave it with a loss for the quarter, prompting a two-day
rout of the technology-laden Nasdaq stock market. Advanced Micro
said then that price cuts by Intel Corp. would prevent it from
realizing the benefit of increased production volumes of its
fastest chips.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were already projecting a loss of 9 cents a share,
according to First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
Advanced Micro lost $55.8 million, or 39 cents a share, in the
quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But S. Atiq Raza, Advanced Micro's co-chief operating officer
and chief technical officer, said Monday that the company would
fall short of its goal of shipping 5.5 million units of its K6
family of microprocessors in the current quarter, leading to an
operating loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to ship no more than 5 million units of AMD-K6
family products in the first quarter,'' Raza said during remarks
delivered at the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Semiconductor and
Systems Conference in Laguna Niguel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Raza blamed the shortfall on lower yields in the first eight
weeks of the quarter and said that subsequent modifications had
improved production volume of the company's fastest chips.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst with S.G. Cowen Securities, said this
explanation left too many unanswered questions. ``It would seem to
be a resurrection of the same problem that caused them to
disappoint in the fourth quarter,'' he said. ``You're looking at a
company that has struggled with yields for years, and which is now
facing the toughest pricing environment it's ever seen. It's not a
pretty picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts who have covered the semiconductor industry
have seen this situation before. Intel introduces a new generation
of microprocessor; Advanced Micro rushes to offer a compatible
product but runs into manufacturing glitches that keep volumes low.
Then, when Advanced Micro catches up and is ready to begin shipping
increased numbers, Intel cuts prices and gets ready for the next
generation of chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMD's No. 1 problem has always been manufacturing,'' said
Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
The K6 ``is a good part, and they've taken a ton of market share,
but they just can't manufacture them at a profit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is we need a viable competitor to Intel just to
keep the market healthy,'' Joseph added. ``It's probably not a good
thing for consumers for the second-tier player to be losing so much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Advanced Micro announced that Gateway had begun
using its microprocessors and said that market research results
showed that its share of the retail desktop PC market had passed
that of Intel for the first time. Advanced Micro is particularly
strong in this segment because it was first to market with a
microprocessor aimed specifically at computers that cost less than
$1,000, which have become the fastest growing part of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand for our desktop and mobile products remains strong,''
Raza said. ``We plan to ship a minimum of 5 million units in the
second quarter and believe we will meet our goal of shipping 20 to
25 million microprocessors this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Advanced Micro said it would cut about 300 jobs, or
2 percent of its work force, over the next two quarters as part of
a reorganization, which is intended to focus the company more
closely on microprocessors and other PC-related products. The
company said it would take unspecified charges in the first and
second quarters for the cuts.

TUMULT FOR TURBODYNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the same day trading resumed in shares of
Turbodyne Technologies Inc., the company said Monday that it lost
an arbitration battle with Grand Technologies Inc. and has been
ordered to pay the firm more than $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne shares closed down $1.0975, or 20 percent, to close at
$4.25 in European trading on the Easdaq, a Brussels, Belgium-based
stock exchange modeled after the Nasdaq. Easdaq in mid-January
halted trading in Turbodyne shares after opening an investigation
into whether the company intentionally misled investors about its
earnings prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Following Easdaq's lead, Nasdaq similarly halted trading of
Turbodyne stock in the United States and said it will not resume
trading until it finishes its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released late last week, Easdaq said it found
Turbodyne did not intentionally mislead investors in a series of
press releases last year but had given an ``over-optimistic
impression'' of the firm's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne spokesman Peter Weichselbraun declined to comment on
the Easdaq release. But in its own statement last week the company
did say it could not guarantee that several previously announced
business deals would go through, including separate partnerships
with Royal Dutch/Shell and Trans Business Group, a Russian firm.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts responded harshly to Turbodyne's Monday stock
performance. ``It's a complete loss of investor confidence,''
Vincent Neefs, an analyst at Smeets Securities, told Bloomberg
News. ``Stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne generated the bulk of its $39.2 million in 1997
revenues from sales of aluminum parts to the automotive industry.
In addition, the company sells technology it claims can cut
pollution and improve the efficiency of internal combustion
engines. It was projected sales of this ``Turbopack'' technology
that got the company in trouble with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In separate news, the company said Monday that an arbitration
judge ruled against it and has ordered Turbodyne to pay Grand
Technologies $6.65 million for negligent misrepresentation, breach
of contract and breach of a purchase order. The charges stem from a
multimillion-dollar purchase of Grand Technologies products by
Turbodyne last year that Turbodyne canceled at the last minute.
Grand Technologies officials could not be reached Monday for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The amount Turbodyne has been ordered to pay is more than
two-thirds of its sales in the third quarter of last year. The
company had a third-quarter net loss of $4.23 million. Turbodyne
said it will appeal the decision.

   SEATTLE-SPILL (Seattle) _ The Alaskan activists who accurately
warned of a major oil spill before the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster
brought a message to Seattle on Monday: It could happen here. They
argued that Puget Sound residents should demand the same safety
measures _ notably tug escorts _ put in place after Prince William
Sound was fouled by 11 million gallons of oil. The wreck of the
freighter New Carissa, whose oil-laden bow was being towed out to
sea for the second time, was cited as evidence that the Pacific
Northwest is not ready to quickly deal with a marine accident in
which a ship loses power or runs aground.

<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the flawless center fielder for the New York
Yankees who, along with Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, symbolized the
team's dynastic greatness across the 20th century and whose 56-game
hitting streak in 1941 made him an instant and indelible American
folk hero, died early Monday at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio died shortly after midnight, nearly five months after
undergoing surgery for cancer of the lungs. He had spent 99 days in
the hospital while battling lung infections and pneumonia, and his
illness generated a national vigil as he was reported near death
several times. He went home on Jan. 19, alert but weak and with
little hope of surviving. Several family members and close friends
were at his bedside Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's body was flown to Northern California for a funeral
Thursday and for burial in San Francisco, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has idolized and immortalized its 20th-century
heroes, from Charles Lindbergh to Elvis Presley, no one embodied
the American dream of fame and fortune or created a more enduring
legend than Joe DiMaggio. He became a figure of unequaled romance
and integrity in the national mind because of his consistent
professionalism on the baseball field, his marriage to the
Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, his devotion to her after her death,
and the pride and courtliness with which he carried himself
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio burst onto the baseball scene from San Francisco in the
1930s and grew into the game's most gallant and graceful center
fielder. He wore No. 5 and became the successor to Babe Ruth (No.
3) and Lou Gehrig (No. 4) in the team's pantheon. DiMaggio was the
team's superstar for 13 seasons, beginning in 1936 and ending in
1951, and appeared in 11 All-Star Games and 10 World Series. He
was, as Roy Blount Jr. once observed, ``the class of the Yankees in
times when the Yankees outclassed everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He was called the Yankee Clipper and was acclaimed at baseball's
centennial in 1969 as ``the greatest living ballplayer,'' the man
who in 1,736 games with the Yankees had a career batting average of
.325 and hit 361 home runs while striking out only 369 times, one
of baseball's most amazing statistics. (By way of comparison,
Mickey Mantle had 536 homers and struck out 1,710 times; Reggie
Jackson slugged 563 homers and struck out 2,597 times.)
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's game was so complete and elegant that it
transcended statistics; as The New York Times said in an editorial
when he retired, ``The combination of proficiency and exquisite
grace which Joe DiMaggio brought to the art of playing center field
was something no baseball averages can measure and that must be
seen to be believed and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio glided across the vast expanse of center field at
Yankee Stadium with such incomparable grace that long after he
stopped playing, the memory of him in full stride remains
evergreen. He disdained theatrical flourishes and exaggerated
moves, never climbing walls to make catches and rarely diving
headlong. He got to the ball just as it fell into his glove, making
the catch seem inevitable, almost preordained. The writer Wilfred
Sheed wrote, ``In dreams I can still see him gliding after fly
balls as if he were skimming the surface of the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   His batting stance was as graceful as his outfield stride. He
stood flat-footed at the plate with his feet spread well apart, his
bat held still just off his right shoulder. When he swung, his
left, or front, foot moved only slightly foward. His swing was pure
and flowing with an incredible follow-through; Casey Stengel said,
``He made the rest of them look like plumbers.''
</P>
<P>
   At his peak, he was serenaded as ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio'' by Les
Brown and saluted as ``the great DiMaggio'' by Ernest Hemingway in
``The Old Man and the Sea.'' He was mentioned in dozens of films
and Broadway shows; the sailors in ``South Pacific'' sing that
Bloody Mary's skin is ``tender as DiMaggio's glove.'' Years later
he was remembered by Paul Simon, who wondered with everybody else,
``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? Our nation turns its lonely
eyes to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to anything written, spoken or sung about him, he
confessed that he was puzzled by Simon's lyrics and sought an
answer when he met Simon in a restaurant in New York. ``I asked
Paul what the song meant, whether it was derogatory,'' DiMaggio
recalled. ``He explained it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When injuries eroded his skills and he could no longer perform
to his own standard, he turned his back on his $100,000 salary _ he
and his rival Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox then drew the
largest paychecks in sports _ and retired in 1951 with the dignity
that remained his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   His stormy marriage to Marilyn Monroe lasted less than a year,
but they remained one of America's ultimate romantic fantasies: the
tall, dark and handsome baseball hero wooing and winning the woman
who epitomized Hollywood beauty, glamour and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   He was private and remote. Even Monroe, at their divorce
proceedings, said he was given to black moods and would tell her,
``Leave me alone.'' He once said, with disdain, that he kept track
of all the books written about his storied life without his
consent, and by the late 1990s knew that the count had passed 33.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he could be proud, reclusive and vain in such a composed,
almost studied way that his reclusiveness contributed to his
mystique. In the book ``Summer of '49,'' David Halberstam wrote
that DiMaggio ``guards his special status carefully, wary of doing
anything that might tarnish his special reputation. He tends to
avoid all those who might define him in some way other than the way
he defined himself on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio joined the Yankees in 1936, missed three years while he
served in the Army Air Forces in World War II, then returned and
played through the 1951 season, when Mickey Mantle arrived to open
yet another era in the remarkable run of Yankee success. In his 13
seasons, DiMaggio went to bat 6,821 times, got 2,214 hits, knocked
in 1,537 runs, amassed 3,948 total bases and reached base just
under 40 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, baseball fans argued over who was the better pure
hitter, DiMaggio or Williams. Long after they had both retired,
Williams said: ``In my heart, I always felt I was a better hitter
than Joe. But I have to say, he was the greatest baseball player of
our time. He could do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did it all with a sureness and coolness that seemed to
imply an utter lack of emotion. DiMaggio was once asked why he did
not vent his frustrations on the field by kicking a bag or tossing
a bat. The outfielder, who chain-smoked cigarettes and had suffered
from ulcers, replied: ``I can't. It wouldn't look right.''
</P>
<P>
   But he betrayed his sensitivity in a memorable gesture of
annoyance in the sixth game of the 1947 World Series after his long
drive was run down and caught in front of the 415-foot sign in
left-center field at Yankee Stadium by Al Gionfriddo of the
Brooklyn Dodgers. As DiMaggio rounded first base, he saw Gionfriddo
make the catch and, with his head down, kicked the dirt. The angry
gesture was so shocking that it made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In the field, DiMaggio ran down long drives with a gliding
stride and deep range. In 1947, he tied what was then the American
League fielding record for outfielders by making only one error in
141 games. He also had one of the most powerful and precise
throwing arms in the business and was credited with 153 assists in
his 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime manager, Joe McCarthy, once touched on another
DiMaggio skill. ``He was the best base runner I ever saw,''
McCarthy said. ``He could have stolen 50, 60 bases a year if I let
him. He wasn't the fastest man alive. He just knew how to run bases
better than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Three times DiMaggio was voted his league's most valuable
player: in 1939, 1941 and 1947. In 1941, the magical season of his
56-game hitting streak, he won the award even though Williams hit
.406.
</P>
<P>
   In each of his first four seasons with the Yankees, DiMaggio
played in the World Series, and the Yankees won all four. He
appeared in the Series 10 times in 13 seasons over all, and nine
times the Yankees won. And although he failed to get enough votes
to make the baseball Hall of Fame when he became eligible in 1953,
perhaps because his aloofness had alienated some of the writers who
did the voting, he sailed into Cooperstown two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Whitey Ford was a rookie pitcher in 1950 when he first saw Joe
DiMaggio, and he later remembered: ``I just stared at the man for
about a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Paul DiMaggio was born on Nov. 25, 1914, in Martinez,
Calif., a small fishing village 25 miles northeast of the Golden
Gate. He was the fourth son and the eighth of nine children born to
Giuseppe Paolo and Rosalie DiMaggio, who had immigrated to America
in 1898 from Sicily. His father was a fisherman who moved his
family to North Beach, the heavily Italian section near the San
Francisco waterfront, the year Joe was born.
</P>
<P>
   The two oldest sons, Tom and Michael, joined their father as
fishermen; Michael later fell off his boat and drowned. But the
three other sons became major league outfielders by way of the
sandlots of San Francisco. Vince, four years older than Joe, played
11 seasons with five teams and led the National League in
strikeouts six times. Dominic, three years younger than Joe, was
known as the Little Professor because he wore eyeglasses when he
played 10 seasons with the Boston Red Sox, hitting .298 for his
career. Of the three, Joe was the natural.
</P>
<P>
   He started as a shortstop in the Boys Club League when he was
14, dropped out of Galileo High School after one year and joined
Vince on the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, the
highest level of minor-league baseball. It was late in 1932, and
Joe was still 17 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, in his first full season with the Seals, he hit
.340 with 28 home runs and knocked in 169 runs in 187 games. He
also hit safely in 61 games in a row, eight years before he made
history in the big leagues by hitting in 56. He tore up the league
during the next two seasons, hitting .341 and .398. But he injured
his left knee stepping out of a cab while hurrying to dinner at his
sister's house after a Sunday doubleheader and was considered
damaged goods by most of the teams in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   He got his chance at the majors because two scouts, Joe Devine
and Bill Essick, persisted in recommending him to the Yankees. The
general manager, Ed Barrow, talked it over with his colleagues. And
for $25,000 plus five players, the Yankees bought him from the
Seals.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was left in San Francisco for the 1935 season to heal
his knee and put the finishing touches on his game, then was
brought up to New York in 1936 to join a talented team that
included Lou Gehrig, Bill Dickey, Tony Lazzeri, Red Rolfe, Red
Ruffing and Lefty Gomez. It was two years after Babe Ruth had left,
and an era of success had ended.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the rookie from California was arriving with a contract
for $8,500, and a new era was beginning. It was delayed because of
a foot injury, but DiMaggio made his debut on May 3 against the St.
Louis Browns. He went on to play 138 games, got 206 hits with 29
home runs, batted .325 and drove in 125 runs. In the fall, the
Yankees made the first of four straight trips to the World Series _
they would go on to play in 23 out of 29 Series through 1964 _ and
the rookie hit .346 against the Giants and made a spectacular catch
in deepest center field in the Polo Grounds before a marveling
crowd of 43,543, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's luster was sometimes dimmed by salary disputes. In
1937 he hit .346 with 46 home runs and 167 RBI and the following
year he held out for $40,000, but was forced to sign for $25,000.
DiMaggio's holdout lasted a couple of weeks into the season; when
he returned, he was booed. When he began the 1941 season, he had
missed four of his first five openers because of injury or salary
fights, and many fans resented it. ``He got hurt early in his
career, more than he ever let on,'' Phil Rizzuto once said.
</P>
<P>
   He also had to endure the casual bigotry that existed when he
first came up. Many of his teammates called him the Big Dago, and
Life magazine, in a 1939 article intending to compliment him, said:
``Although he learned Italian first, Joe, now 24, speaks English
without an accent, and is otherwise well adapted to most U.S.
mores. Instead of olive oil or smelly bear grease he keeps his hair
slick with water. He never reeks of garlic and prefers chicken chow
mein to spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   But he energized the fans by leading the league in hitting in
1939 (at .381) and again in 1940 (with .352). Then in 1941, he put
together what has since been known simply as The Streak, and
fashioned perhaps the most enduring record in sports. Streaks were
nothing new to DiMaggio. He had hit in those 61 straight games for
the Seals, in 18 straight as a rookie with the Yankees, in 22
straight the next year and in 23 straight the year after that. In
fact, in 1941, he hit safely in the last 19 games in spring
training, and he kept hitting for eight more games after the
regular season opened.
</P>
<P>
   The Streak began on May 15, 1941, with a single in four times at
bat against the Chicago White Sox. The next day, he hit a triple
and a home run. Two weeks later, he had a swollen neck but still
hit three singles and a home run in Washington. The next week
against the St. Louis Browns, he went 3 for 5 in one game, then 4
for 8 in a doubleheader the next day with a double and three home
runs. His streak stood at 24.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, he broke the Yankees' club record of 29 games. On
June 26, he was hitless with two out in the eighth inning against
the Browns, but he doubled, and his streak reached 38. On June 29,
a doubleheader against Washington, DiMaggio lined a double in the
first game to tie George Sisler's modern major league record of
hitting in 41 straight games and then broke Sisler's record in the
second game by lining a single. On July 1, with a clean single
against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, he matched Willie Keeler's
major league record of 44 games, set in 1897 when foul balls didn't
count as strikes. The next day he broke it with a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   As DiMaggio kept hitting safely, radio announcers kept an
excited America informed, Bojangles Robinson danced on the Yankee
dugout roof at the Stadium for good luck and Les Brown recorded
``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio ... we want you on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Streak finally ended on the steamy night of July 17 in
Cleveland's Municipal Stadium before 67,468 fans. The pitchers were
Al Smith and Jim Bagby Jr., but the stopper was the Indians' third
baseman, Ken Keltner, who made two dazzling backhand plays deep
behind third base to rob DiMaggio of hits. It is sometimes
overlooked that DiMaggio was intentionally walked in the fourth
inning of that game, and that he promptly started a 16-game streak
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In 56 games, DiMaggio had gone to bat 223 times and delivered 91
hits for a .408 average, including 15 home runs. He drew 21 walks,
twice was hit by pitched balls, scored 56 runs and knocked in 55.
He hit in every game for two months, and struck out just seven
times.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, fourth in the American League when the streak
began, were six games in front when it ended, and won the pennant
by 17.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was passing milestones in his personal life, too. In
1939, he had married an actress, Dorothy Arnold. In October 1941,
his only child, Josephe Jr., was born. He is survived by his son;
his brother, Dominic; two granddaughters and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1942, DiMaggio enlisted in the Army Air Forces and
spent the next three years teaching baseball in the service. Along
with other baseball stars like Bob Feller and Williams, he resumed
his career as soon as the war ended, returning to the Yankees for
the 1946 season and a year later leading them back into the World
Series. His most dramatic moments came in the season of 1949, after
he was sidelined by bone spurs on his right heel and did not play
until June 26. Then he flew to Boston to join the team in Fenway
Park, hit a single and home run the first two times he went to bat,
hit two more home runs the next day and another the day after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees entered the final two days of that season trailing
the Red Sox by one game. They had to sweep two games in Yankee
Stadium to win the pennant, and they did. There were poignant
moments before the first game when 69,551 fans rocked the stadium
and cheered their hero, who was being honored with a Joe DiMaggio
Day. He was almost too weak to play because of a severe viral
infection, but he did, and he hit a single and double before
removing himself from center field on wobbly legs.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees won yet another World Series in 1951, he
retired and eased into a second career as Joe DiMaggio, legend. It
included cameo roles as a broadcaster, a spring training instructor
with the Yankees and a coach with the Oakland Athletics,
appearances at old timers' games, where he was invariably the last
player introduced, and a larger role, with surprising impact, as a
mellow and credible pitchman on television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   He had long since created an image of a loner both on and off
the playing field, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s when he
lived in hotels in Manhattan and was considered something of a man
about town. He once was characterized by a teammate as the man
``who led the league in room service.'' But he spent many evenings
at Toots Shor's restaurant in Manhattan, where he hid out at a
private table far in the back while Shor protected him from his
public.
</P>
<P>
   But his legend took a storybook turn in 1952, the year after he
retired from the Yankees, when DiMaggio, whose marriage to Dorothy
Arnold had ended in divorce in 1944, arranged a dinner date with
Marilyn Monroe in California. They were married in San Francisco on
Jan. 14, 1954, and spent nine months trying to reconcile their
differences before they divorced in October. DiMaggio always seemed
tortured by Monroe's sex goddess image. He protested loudly during
the making of Billy Wilder's ``The Seven Year Itch'' when the
script called for her to cool herself over a subway grate while a
sudden wind blew her skirts up high.
</P>
<P>
   But when the actress seemed on the verge of an emotional
collapse in 1961, DiMaggio brought her to the Yankees' training
camp in Florida for rest and support. And when she died of an
overdose of barbiturates at the age of 36 on Aug. 4, 1962, he took
charge of her funeral and for the next 20 years sent roses three
times a week to her crypt in the Westwood section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When DiMaggio made an unexpected and dramatic return to the
public scene in the 1970s as a dignified television spokesman for
the Bowery Savings Bank of New York and for Mr. Coffee, a
manufacturer of coffee makers, he did it with remarkable ease for a
man who had been obsessed with privacy, who had once confided that
he always had ``a knot'' in his stomach because he was so shy and
tense.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the stage fright that had rattled him during earlier
sorties into broadcasting. Instead, he was the epitome of
credibility, the graying and trustworthy hero who had hit his home
runs and was now returning to extol the virtues of saving money and
brewing coffee. He promptly became a familiar and comforting
presence for a generation of baseball fans who never saw him play.
</P>
<P>
   For some years he lived in San Francisco with his widowed sister
Marie in a house in the Marina District that he had bought for his
parents in 1939 and that he and his sister had both shared with
Marilyn Monroe. When the damp San Francisco climate troubled the
arthritis in his back, he began to spend most of his time in
Florida, where he established his home. He played golf and made
selected excursions to Europe and the Far East, where the demand
for his appearance and his autograph returned high dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to take the most pleasure in establishing a
children's wing, called the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, at
Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. And he seemed to
relish the invitations back to Yankee Stadium, where he frequently
threw out the first ball on Opening Day, tall but slightly stooped,
dressed elegantly, as always, in a dark business suit, walking to
the mound and lobbing one to the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was there on the day the season ended this year, as the
Yankees set a team record with their 114th victory, that he was
acclaimed on yet another Joe DiMaggio Day, the timeless hero and
the symbol of Yankee excellence, acknowledging the cheers of Yankee
players and fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of cheering that accompanied him through life
and that he had quietly come to expect. It recalled the time when
he and Marilyn Monroe, soon after their wedding, took a trip to
Tokyo. She continued on to entertain American troops in Korea, and
said with fascination when she returned, ``Joe, you've never heard
such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   And Joe DiMaggio replied softly, ``Yes, I have.''

CENTER-FIELD COLLISION A SETBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Trenidad Hubbard is considered the
Dodgers' fifth outfielder. And Hiram Bocachica is trying to unseat
him. On Monday, the two collided in left-center field at Fort
Lauderdale Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, neither one will be able to prove his worth
for the next few days after both were taken to Coral Springs
Medical Center for precautionary X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, the center fielder, escaped with a bruised right thumb
and a contusion on the right side of his forehead. Bocachica,
playing left field, walked gingerly to a waiting ambulance with an
ice pack on his right side. He has bruised ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my ribs are broke,'' Bocachica said. ``I called
and he said he called it. He said maybe we called it at the same
time. I don't really know what happened, then I was just lying on
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players' X-rays were negative and they returned to
Dodgertown with team photographer Jon SooHoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't hear me at all,'' Hubbard said. ``I called and the
ball was coming back toward me because it was a right-hander
hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Dodger on the scene was shortstop Mark Grudzielanek,
who said he didn't hear either player call for the ball but added
that the gusting wind made it difficult to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran right into each other. It was Trenidad's head into
Bocachica's ribs, and Bocachica's knee hit Trenidad's thumb,''
Grudzielanek said. ``I thought both of them were kind of dizzy at
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Hairston wound up with an inside-the-park homer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Young has MRI: Second baseman Eric Young, bothered by a stiff
lower back, underwent an MRI on Monday afternoon. Results are
expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Young is the only projected starter not to appear in the
Dodgers' four spring- training games. His back has been bothering
him since last week, but he has improved enough to take grounders
and hit in the batting cage the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a continuation,'' Dodgers physical therapist Pat
Screnar said. ``Dr. (Frank) Jobe just wanted to have the test and
check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Park's pleased: Right-hander Chan Ho Park has devoted some of
this spring to working on his change-up, a pitch that could make
his fastball seem almost unhittable.
</P>
<P>
   In his spring-training debut he pitched three innings and
allowed one unearned run against the Orioles, and he did so by
using his change-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to improve my confidence in the change-up,'' Park
said. ``I felt good and had good concentration. I had a good curve
and a good change-up.''

SIEMENS SPENDS $550M FOR 2 MASSACHUSETTS FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Siemens A.G., the giant German telecommunications and
electronics firm, Monday said it had acquired two Massachusetts
start-up companies to help it enter the lucrative market for data
networking and Internet communications.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens confirmed it acquired Argon Networks Inc. of Littleton,
a 2-year-old developer of data switches, and Castle Networks Inc.
of Westford, which builds networking equipment that can more easily
separate voice and data calls.
</P>
<P>
   The two firms will form the core of a new Siemens subsidiary, to
be based in Burlington. Sources close to all three companies said
Siemens spent about $240 million in cash for Argon and about $310
million for Castle Networks.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's venture capital investors reaped a bonanza, receiving
about $160 million from Siemens after investing $18.25 million over
the last 13 months. Most of the remaining $150 million will go to
Castle Networks' founders and a good portion of the company's 70
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its North American rivals, which have grown substantially
by acquiring a mix of telecom start-ups and established companies
to gain a significant market share and brand identity among
telephone carriers in the United States, Siemens is a relative
latecomer to the fast-moving field of voice, data, and Internet
products.
</P>
<P>
   And while Siemens has strategic product development and
marketing partnerships with 3Com Corp. and others, it is reportedly
spending around $1 billion in cash to buy companies developing
voice and data networking products that its 26,000-strong worldwide
sales force can sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have crafted a string-of-pearls strategy, where we will
acquire small companies with the kinds of technology, products, and
people we need in Boston and in Silicon Valley,'' said Thomas
Rambold, president of the broadbands networks unit within Siemens'
Public Networks Group, which is based at company headquarters in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens also said it has invested $30 million in return for a 20
percent stake in Accelerated Networks Inc. of Moorpark, Calif.,
which is creating a switch to quickly capture voice and data.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies, along with some existing Siemens operations
in Florida, Canada, and Germany, will become the core of a new,
wholly owned subsidiary called Unisphere Solutions Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The new company _ the first not to carry the Siemens name _ will
have 500 employees, most of whom will continue to work at existing
facilities and at Siemens plants, according to Martin Claque, the
Unisphere president. Claque previously worked as vice president of
IBM's global industrial-solutions sales unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I foresee us doing about $200 million (in sales) within two
years,'' Claque said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Anderson, president of the Yankee Group of Boston,
questioned whether Siemens was ``late by three years'' in pursuing
its data networking and Internet strategy, following competitors
such as Lucent Technologies Inc., Northern Telecom Ltd., and Cisco
Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Lucent bought Ascend Communications Inc., and
Northern Telecom acquired Bay Networks last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a real player, Siemens has to aim higher and try to go
after 3Com,'' said Anderson, citing how other European and American
telephone-equipment manufacturers have pursued bigger companies.

TOBACCO WINDFALL SETS STAGE FOR CONFLICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new battle in the tobacco wars breaks out in
Congress Tuesday, as lawmakers escalate a struggle over how much
the federal government should control the $246 billion settlement
between cigarette makers and the states.
</P>
<P>
   Firing one of the first volleys, Representative Martin T.
Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, said Monday that he will join a House
Republican in filing legislation Tuesday that would require the
states to spend 25 percent of the settlement, or more than $60
billion over the next 25 years, on tobacco prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   Governors and state lawmakers across the country are planning to
spend the windfall on a range of projects, from prison construction
in Alabama to sidewalk repairs in California to tax cuts in
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The governors and many members of Congress want the federal
government to waive all claims to the tobacco settlement, which
effectively reimburses billions of Medicaid dollars that have been
spent treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton, noting that the federal government covers
more than 50 percent of Medicaid costs, has proposed a budget that
assumes Washington will receive nearly $19 billion over the next
four years from the tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a middle ground, Meehan and his GOP cosponsor,
Representative James V. Hansen of Utah, have joined antitobacco
activists in pressing for the federal government to waive all
claims to the settlement money on the condition that 25 percent is
earmarked for curbing tobacco-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan and Hansen, as chairmen of the Congressional Task Force
on Tobacco and Health, are key players in the long battle between
the Congress and the cigarette industry. Their bill is expected to
gain prominence over similar legislation filed recently by
Representative Robert A. Weygand, a Rhode Island Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very concerned that states are viewing the settlement as
a general revenue windfall rather than a historic opportunity to
reduce youth tobacco use,'' Meehan said. ``This shouldn't be about
building roads or prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Meehan-Hansen initiative clashes with legislation filed in
the House and Senate that would waive all federal claims to the
tobacco money on the grounds that the states successfully
negotiated the settlement with the cigarette industry last year
after Congress failed to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies settled with 46 states last November for
$206 billion over 25 years. The industry earlier agreed to pay the
other four states $40 billion in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``These settlements belong to the states,'' said Senator Kay
Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican who is leading the effort to
permit states to control the money without federal intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Antitobacco activists said the failure to require states to use
part of the settlement on prevention programs would increase
diseases and public health costs related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``These settlements resulted from the harms caused by tobacco,''
said Kathryn Kahler Vose, a spokeswoman for the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids. ``At least a part of it should be spent to
reduce that harm in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has indicated it will waive any
claims to the money if the states formally agree to spend a portion
of the settlement to prevent youth smoking, support tobacco
farmers, and bolster public health programs, as the Meehan-Hansen
bill proposes.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Governor Paul Cellucci has proposed using the
state's anticipated $7.6 billion from the agreement to improve
health care for children, the elderly, and the needy.

   CHICAGO _ In a case being closely watched by lawyers and
investigators, a group of seven prosecutors and sheriff's deputies
are to go on trial on Tuesday on charges that they conspired to
frame an innocent man.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, charged with perjury and conspiring to obstruct
justice, are accused of knowingly using false evidence or
withholding evidence in order to convict a man of the 1983 rape and
murder of a 10-year-old girl in DuPage County, outside Chicago. The
man, Rolando Cruz, was exonerated in 1995 after spending 10 years
on death row when one of the sheriff's officers recanted his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the charges involve allegations that deputies fabricated
a story that Cruz had told him about a detailed dream he had had
about the slaying, and that prosecutors presented that testimony
knowing it was false. Other charges contend that a prosecutor
failed to tell defense attorneys that another lawyer had told him
in 1985 that a client admitted to killing the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it is almost unheard of to put prosecutors on trial
for these kinds of offenses, in part because it is considered so
difficult to covincingly explain to a jury why prosecutors would
accuse someone if they had doubts about the person's guilt. If the
prosecutors in this case are convicted, experts said, they would be
the first prosecutors found guilty of a felony for this kind of
prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely rare,'' said Ron Allen, a professor of
criminal law at Northwestern University, who added that this case
was different from accusations of bribery or corruption that have
resulted in indictments of prosecutors in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This prosecution emerged out of the everyday actions of the
prosecutors,'' Allen said. ``When you're solving a crime,
especially a crime like the one they were investigating, you have
to make difficult decisions often based on ambiguous information
and those decisions are what led us here. The fact is, the system
makes mistakes; and the question being asked here is, how do you
deal with those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is hard to track cases going back decades, a search by
the Chicago Tribune turned up only six other instances nationally
in this century in which prosecutors have faced criminal charges
alleging similar misconduct. Of those prosecutors, the newspaper
reported, two were convicted of misdemeanors and fined $500; two
were acquitted; and charges were dropped against the other two
before trial.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The trial here will offer an unusual look inside the process
that prosecutors and the police go through when tackling a
complicated investigation, in this case one of the area's most
grisly and frightening murders, one that law enforcement officials
were under tremendous pressure to solve.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation and prosecution of Cruz were unwieldy and
bedeviled from the outset. Cruz was someone who initially was
courted by detectives as a source of rumors about the killing. He
was not indicted until 13 months after the murder. Nine months
after Cruz was arrested, a detective resigned after expressing
doubts about the case. In 1992, a lawyer in the Illinois attorney
general's office in charge of fighting Cruz's appeals, resigned,
saying she believed Cruz was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is coming at a difficult time for the Illinois justice
system, which has seen 11 death row inmates freed after
investigations found evidence of their innocence. Defense attorneys
and critics of the criminal justice system across the country say
this case may pull a veil off unacceptable prosecutorial and
investigative practices that they believe are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors worry that the case could have a chilling
effect, causing prosecutors to hesitate as they second-guess their
actions. Others say these allegations, if true, are an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Kent Schaffer, director of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said ``the important thing
about this case is it's going to tell prosecutors that they are not
immune from prosecution if they hide evidence, if they suborn
perjury or if they go after somebody who has not committed the
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the special prosecutor in the case,
William J. Kunkle Jr., known for prosecuting John Wayne Gacy, the
serial killer, will argue that some or all of the defendants knew
Cruz was innocent, or honestly believed he was guilty but cut
corners to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The men, known as the DuPage Seven, have all pleaded not guilty.
The parents of the murdered girl, Tom and Pat Nicarico, are
supporting them.
</P>
<P>
   The four sheriff's officers, James T. Montesano, Thomas E.
Vosburgh, Dennis Kurzawa, and Robert L. Winkler, are still working
for the sheriff's department. One of the former prosecutors,
Patrick J. King Jr., is now an assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago.
Another, Thomas L. Knight, has a private law practice; and the
third, Robert K. Kilander, is a DuPage County judge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The DuPage Seven case emerged out of the long, intricate
prosecution of Cruz, now 38, and another man, Alejandro Hernandez,
now 35, for the sexual assault and murder of Jeanine Nicarico, who
was home alone from school with a cold one February day when
someone kicked in the front door of her house in the affluent town
of Naperville and abducted her. Her body was found two days later
in a wooded area about six miles away and the crime, in a suburb
hardly used to such inexplicable violence, stunned the community.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was also convicted of the murder, sentenced to death
and then, in a second trial three years later, sentenced to 80
years in prison. He, too, was exonerated in 1995, but a judge ruled
that the DuPage Seven case should focus only on allegations in the
Cruz case.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those allegations involve the main strategy used to
convict Cruz and Hernandez: testimony by two of the sheriff's
deputies, Vosburgh and Kurzawa, that Cruz told them he had had a
dream about Jeanine's killing and revealed details the deputies
said only the killer could know.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz and his lawyers have repeatedly said that the deputies
fabricated the dream, and that there was no written investigator's
report about it. In 1995, in Cruz's third trial (his two previous
convictions had been overturned on appeal), another sheriff's
officer, Montesano, said he had testified falsely that the deputies
had informed him about Cruz's dream. As a result, the judge
acquitted Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Vosburgh's lawyer, Brian Telander, said on Monday that he would
present testimony from six of the grand jurors who originally
indicted Cruz, all of whom say that, although there is no written
record, Cruz babbled to them that he had had a dream about the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler is charged with falsely testifying that Cruz told him
about acquiring and disposing of a car used in the murder. King and
Knight are accused of presenting the false testimony, knowing it
was false. Kilander is charged with failing to inform defense
attorneys that a lawyer for a convicted child rapist and murderer
named Brian Dugan had told him that Dugan admitted to killing
Jeanine.
</P>
<P>
   Kilander's lawyer, Ronald D. Menaker, suggested that his client
had fulfilled his obligation because he had told defense attorneys
about an interview he had with Dugan shortly after he talked with
Dugan's lawyer. Lawyers for the other defendants either declined to
comment or did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Dugan, serving a life sentence for two rapes and murders, was
linked to the Nicarico murder by DNA testing in 1989, but has not
been charged in the case. He has said he will only talk with
authorities if they promise to spare him from execution.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Kunkle and his team have a tough task ahead of them.
They will not only have to prove that the sheriff's deputies
fabricated evidence, but that the prosecutors knew the evidence was
false. They also have to convince a jury to believe _ over the
assertions of upstanding law enforcement officers _ the contention
by Cruz, known at the time to be a street punk, that he never
described a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got very difficult problems because he's trying some
people of significant stature who are well-respected,'' said
Terrance A. Norton, a former federal prosecutor who is now a
clinical professor of law at Chicago-Kent College of law.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest job of all, however, may be to make the case that
the prosecutors, perhaps because they were under pressure to solve
a horrifying crime, behaved in a way that was criminal and not just
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between incompetent prosecutors and
criminal prosecutors,'' Allen of Northwestern said, ``and I think
that's going to be difficult to prove.''

TRYING TO DECODE THAT ENIGMA CALLED HUMOR, AND FAILING GLEEFULLY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ At one point, the question before the group was
whether there was any subject too dark to be claimed by humor. The
Holocaust? Cross burning? AIDS? And Martin Short, the actor and
sketch comedian, brought up the case of Doug Tracht, aka the
Greaseman, the radio shock jock who was fired by a Washington
station after playing a song by the Grammy winner Lauryn Hill, a
black singer, and dismissing the music with a reference to the
racially motivated murder of a black man in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder people drag them behind trucks,'' the Greaseman said
on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Joyner, an actor, stand-up comic and the only black person
at the table, shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't funny, though,'' he said. ``You could talk about
that and have it be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane Garofalo, the actress and comic, put in, ``You mean find
the joy in it?''
</P>
<P>
   Short said: ``But that's the question. Was it not funny because
it could never be funny?''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner said: ``Depending on how you say it, you can say
something funny that's racial without angering black people.'' He
paused briefly, and laughed. ``I do speak for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Short looked mock curious. ``And why would that be?''
</P>
<P>
   And the others around the table _ the playwright Neil Simon, the
film and television director James L. Brooks, the actress and
director Penny Marshall, and the stand-up comic Moon Zappa _
convulsed in giggles. The moment, which had been serious and
threatened to become tense, swiveled as the group members returned
to an informal discussion. And although they hadn't settled the
issue of taboo _ not even for themselves _ the point had been made
that the question of what is or is not funny is hugely informed by
context: time, place, circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion, which was organized at the request of The New
York Times, took place on Friday night here at the U.S. Comedy Arts
Festival. The event, in its fifth year, is a jamboree of comedy
performances, films and entertainment-industry panels, sponsored by
HBO. This year, Simon was honored with the festival's annual
writing award, Brooks was honored by the American Film Institute,
and SCTV, the comedy troupe that Short helped found in the 1970s,
was featured in a tribute. (Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David,
creators of the ``Seinfeld'' television show, were also honored,
but declined to participate in the panel.)
</P>
<P>
   With participants ranging in age from 31 (Ms. Zappa) to 71
(Simon), the subject, ostensibly, was ``What's funny now?'' But it
became perfectly clear that no one really knew. So it was obviously
a bad question. After all, if THEY didn't know, who would?
</P>
<P>
   At a tribute to Brooks _ the director of films like ``Broadcast
News'' and ``As Good as It Gets,'' and the creator of the
television series ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ``Taxi'' _ the
audience howled at the screening of a 1970 episode of ``Mary Tyler
Moore'' in which her character tries to stay calm in a job
interview in the early days of feminism while being hounded by her
prospective boss, Lou Grant (Edward Asner), about her personal
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, I was talking to Jay Sandrich, who directed that
episode,'' Brooks said. ``And we were amazed at how funny people
still think that is.'' Asked if the audience members were laughing
out of nostalgia, because they recognized the period, the
58-year-old Brooks was certain they weren't. ``Period is never
funny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged from a wide-ranging, wisecrack-filled,
profanity-saturated 90-minute chat is that what makes people laugh
is a mystery, and that the art of comedy is the quest, lifelong for
these people, to solve it. One issue that returned was taboo, and
if there is such a thing as a subject beyond humor.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks called ``Life Is Beautiful'' ``a movie about the comic
spirit,'' and said he was dumbfounded by criticism from people
offended by what they have perceived to be its lighthearted
treatment of the Holocaust. Ms. Garofalo, who had not seen the
film, said a friend was offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt that as a subject there was no way to put a positive
spin on it,'' she said, to which Brooks responded, ``I swear to
God, when you see the film, you'll drop the friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zappa said, ``I don't think I've ever seen something so
joyful,'' and Simon was lukewarm on the movie, but not because of
its subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it the subtitles?'' Short asked.
</P>
<P>
   So can you make a joke about dragging someone behind a pickup if
it is clever enough?
</P>
<P>
   ``The flip side of this Greaseman thing would be if he had some
really boffo great jokes about being dragged behind the truck or an
HIV guy staggering around,'' Short said, thinking out loud. ``I
still don't think it would play.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said, ``It's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon agreed. ``Impossible,'' he said. ``And about the
Holocaust, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joyner, who is 37, sounded another note. ``You can tell a
joke if it happened to you,'' he said. ``You'd have to live through
it in order to write jokes about it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Simon reiterated, ``No, I'm positive you can't.'' Then he
paused. ``Well, it depends on what kind of truck it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Brooks waffled. ``Wait a minute,'' he said. ``If Richie
Pryor was the person being dragged, I can conceive of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zappa suggested a contest. ``We should take out an ad and
find someone who can make being dragged or HIV funny.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Garofalo, sheepish and prompted by Ms. Zappa, intoned in
the voice of a radio pitchman, ``Have you been dragged or had
HIV?''
</P>
<P>
   And the group convulsed again.
</P>
<P>
   What was evident throughout the discussion was how the comics
engaged one another, listening with interest and seemingly genuine
curiosity. This was particularly true when the talk turned to their
generational comedic worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garofalo, 34, said the boom in the comedy business, with
clubs overflowing with copycat comics seeking their own sitcoms,
had lowered audience expectations and poisoned the circuit for
serious comedians. But Simon seemed surprised that there had even
been such a boom. And when Ms. Garofalo and Ms. Zappa discussed the
emerging venues for alternative comedy _ ``I sometimes drive
through the streets on a flatbed truck,'' Ms. Zappa said _ Brooks
asked for the names of places he could visit.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation worked the other way as well. Ms. Marshall, 55,
played Laverne on the television show ``Laverne and Shirley'' and
has directed films like ``Big'' and ``A League of Their Own.'' She
recalled that in the early '70s, when she was married to Rob
Reiner, gatherings in their living room would include the likes of
Brooks, Albert Brooks (who is no relation), Charles Grodin and
Harry Shearer, who did bit after bit for one another. The younger
comics on Friday's panel seemed entranced as if by a fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim, Albert, they were all at my house,'' Ms. Marshall said.
``You would've loved it. I didn't talk. Only the guys talked.
Everyone was very successful, but no one talked about that. No one
was saying: `You have a top show'; `you're the head writer.' They
were all just spritzing, playing off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks recalled the scene as well. ``I remember Harry Shearer
getting up with Rob, just doing straight for Rob,'' he said, ``and
it would be like a concert, people playing musical instruments and
jamming. And we were all just in her living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Less discernible were generational attitudes about what
constitutes appropriate material. The younger comics came of age in
a performance era distinctly less civil than that which fostered
Simon, Brooks and Ms. Marshall. Enactments of sex, bodily functions
and criminal behavior are all regularly on display; there were many
examples at the weekend festival.
</P>
<P>
   The work of Ms. Zappa, whose father was Frank Zappa, the
literate and often shocking rock musician, shows that she has
inherited her father's gift for challenging, profane wordplay. In
discussing shock comedy, she seemed to shock many at the table with
a simple confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up in a bizarre household,'' she said. ``My
earliest memories are of women wearing black masking tape on their
nipples offering me a baby bottle. So when a comic wants to take
his penis out on stage, this is so boring for me. I truly like the
mundane. I like people being absolutely themselves. The stuff
that's shocking to people means they didn't have enough craziness
in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Short jumped in. ``That's true,'' he said. ``There's something
often condescending about trying to shock the audience. `See, I'm
so hip and you're so square, and I'm going to do this and you're
going to freak out and run.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said: ``But why talk about what's bad? Some people did it
great, people who broke through and did things no one ever did
before. Andy Kaufman raised it to an art form.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zappa smiled sweetly. ``Hello, half-full,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, continuing to be an optimist, generated the liveliest
debate when he asserted of ``There's Something About Mary,'' a film
by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, that ``You almost can't not talk about
that movie if you're talking about comedy now.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon agreed: ``It is so today.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Garofalo added, ``Somehow, it works shockingly well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics were cooler on the film, believing that even though
there were many successful, broad jokes, it didn't hold together
and its overall spirit was childish. Of its two famous jokes, one
is about a boy in a bathroom who catches his penis in a zipper, the
other about a bodily fluid that ends up as hair gel. The discussion
that ensued was lively.
</P>
<P>
   Simon: ``It wasn't consistent, but when it was funny, it was
really funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks: ``I just think it has more big jokes in it than anything
I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall: ``How many people came into the bathroom before
they cut to his zipper? How many people? How long did they milk
that before they cut to him? Now that was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't really about anything, was it?
</P>
<P>
   Brooks: ``But who made that rule?''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner: ``It just has to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall (sheepishly): ``I did. I made the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks: ``But what about the Marx brothers? What did they make
movies about?''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner: ``Being the Marx brothers and being funny in the
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall: ``The opera. Soup.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks: ``It's true, I think, that when you have jokes that
great, you're great. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon: ``Billy Wilder said to me once, `If you've got three
great scenes in a movie you have a hit.' One of the reasons the
picture may have been so funny is because when it wasn't funny you
dropped off for a minute and then it hit you again, so it becomes
bombastic, it hits you so strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Short: ``You can feel that in a play. In a well-crafted play,
you can sometimes feel the audience gets exhausted from laughing.
You'll think, `How come this scene isn't playing?' And there's
nothing wrong with the scene, they just need a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks: ``I think that's your manager who's saying that to you,
Marty.''
</P>
<P>
   When the howling died down, Short had the last word.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest stupidity,'' he said, ``is trying to figure out
what's funny.''

CITIGROUP CO-CHAIRMEN PAID MORE THAN $26 MILLION EACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While last year was hardly a stellar one for the financial
services giant Citigroup Inc., the newly merged company paid its
co-chairmen, John Reed and Sanford Weill, handsomely for their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Each executive received more than $26 million in total
compensation and stock options, according to a proxy statement
Citigroup filed Monday. Reed's compensation totaled about $26.4
million, while Weill received about $27.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were surprised at how lushly the executives were
compensated given the lack of success Citigroup had managing the
global financial turmoil that battered many companies last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two of them appear to be sharing the compensation of about
five CEOs because I think you could hire very good executives to
run these companies for about $10 million,'' said Graef Crystal, a
compensation expert and publisher of The Crystal Report, a
newsletter. ``You clearly don't want to extend this policy too far
down in the organization or they'd be declaring Chapter 11.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's operating earnings fell 27 percent in the fourth
quarter, to $1.4 billion, from $1.93 billion in the comparable
quarter a year earlier. For the year, Citigroup had operating
earnings of $6.3 billion on revenue of $49.8 billion, compared with
earnings of $7.8 billion on revenue of $47.8 billion in 1997.
Figures for 1997 were computed as if the merger of Citicorp and
Travelers Group had been completed then.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, which has announced thousands of job cuts and layoffs
affecting lower-level employees, said its criteria for determining
the compensation awarded its co-chief executives included the
successful completion of the merger; ``disappointing earnings
performance in some businesses'' but a strong showing from the
bank's consumer business; early and active completion of
cross-selling initiatives, and an aggressive approach to
restructuring the company and cutting expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to blunt any discomfort shareholders might feel over the
compensation of Reed and Weill, Citigroup sent a letter to
shareholders and the news media Monday saying that the company
would try to double its earnings every five years and achieve a 20
percent return on equity.
</P>
<P>
   The company also pointed out in its proxy that it would pursue a
new stock incentive plan to allow more employees to own shares. It
also said that the bank's top 70 senior executives had agreed to
retain ownership of at least 75 percent of their shares during
their entire tenure as senior executives.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's pay included a $1.7 million salary, a $7.8 million bonus,
and options worth more than $16.9 million. Weill's draw included a
$1 million salary, an $8.5 million bonus, and other stock and
options worth about $17.7 million. Weill's compensation, excluding
options, was no higher than in 1997, while Reed's compensation,
excluding options, more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Reed was one of my minor heroes because he never used to
take huge salaries,'' Crystal said. ``The minute Sandy Weill turned
up, John Reed started turning G-R-E-E-D positive. So much for
synergy.''

   A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on Crystal's
observations.

<P>
   Even with the bounce Reed enjoyed in his compensation last year,
Weill remains the more deep-pocketed of the two when it comes to
their Citigroup stakes. Weill currently owns about 21.2 million
Citigroup shares valued at about $1.3 billion at the close of
trading Monday, making him one of the company's top 15
shareholders. Reed currently owns about 4.7 million shares valued
at about $291.4 million. Weill's retirement benefits are currently
worth about $618,251 annually upon retirement, while Reed's
retirement package is valued at about $6.4 million annually.

   A shareholder resolution outlined in the proxy aims at
Citigroup's executive compensation practices. The resolution said
that chief executives' cash compensation nationally jumped 82
percent between 1990 and 1997, while chief executives' average
total compensation including stock options rose 298 percent, to
$7.8 million. During the same period, the resolution stated,
factory wages rose just 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution cited Weill as the highest-paid chief executive
in the country in 1997 and asked Citigroup's board to place a cap
on executive compensation calculated as a multiple of the earnings
of Citigroup's lowest-paid worker.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup is recommending that shareholders vote against the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's proxy also divulged the final compensation awarded
James Dimon, whose forced resignation as Citigroup's president last
year was highly publicized. An outline of Dimon's compensation was
first reported in Monday's Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon will receive a bonus of $4.3 million, a separation payment
of $1.3 million, and retain stock and options that bring the total
value of his severance package to about $30 million.

 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the flawless center fielder for the New York
Yankees who, along with Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, symbolized the
team's dynastic greatness across the 20th century and whose 56-game
hitting streak in 1941 made him an instant and indelible American
folk hero, died early Monday at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio died shortly after midnight, nearly five months after
undergoing surgery for cancer of the lungs. He had spent 99 days in
the hospital while battling lung infections and pneumonia. He went
home on Jan. 19, alert but weak and with little hope of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's body was flown to Northern California for a funeral
Thursday and for burial in San Francisco, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has idolized and immortalized its 20th-century
heroes, from Charles Lindbergh to Elvis Presley, no one embodied
the American dream of fame and fortune or created a more enduring
legend than Joe DiMaggio. He became a figure of unequaled romance
and integrity in the national mind because of his consistent
professionalism on the baseball field, his marriage to the
Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, his devotion to her after her death,
and the pride and courtliness with which he carried himself
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio burst onto the baseball scene from San Francisco in the
1930s and grew into the game's most gallant and graceful center
fielder. He wore No. 5 and became the successor to Babe Ruth (No.
3) and Lou Gehrig (No. 4) in the team's pantheon. DiMaggio was the
team's superstar for 13 seasons, beginning in 1936 and ending in
1951, and appeared in 11 All-Star Games and 10 World Series. He
was, as Roy Blount Jr. once observed, ``the class of the Yankees in
times when the Yankees outclassed everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He was called the Yankee Clipper and was acclaimed at baseball's
centennial in 1969 as ``the greatest living ballplayer,'' the man
who in 1,736 games with the Yankees had a career batting average of
.325 and hit 361 home runs while striking out only 369 times, one
of baseball's most amazing statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's game was so complete and elegant that it
transcended statistics; as The New York Times said in an editorial
when he retired, ``The combination of proficiency and exquisite
grace which Joe DiMaggio brought to the art of playing center field
was something no baseball averages can measure and that must be
seen to be believed and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   At his peak, he was serenaded as ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio'' and
summoned as ``the great DiMaggio'' by Ernest Hemingway in ``The Old
Man and the Sea.'' He was mentioned in dozens of films and Broadway
shows; the sailors in ``South Pacific'' sing that Bloody Mary's
skin is ``tender as DiMaggio's glove.'' Years later he was
remembered by Paul Simon, who wondered with everybody else, ``Where
have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? Our nation turns its lonely eyes to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   When injuries eroded his skills and he could no longer perform
to his own standard, he turned his back on his $100,000 salary _ he
and his rival Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox then drew the
largest paychecks in sports _ and retired in 1951 with the dignity
that remained his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio joined the Yankees in 1936, missed three years while he
served in the Army Air Forces in World War II, then returned and
played through the 1951 season, when Mickey Mantle arrived to open
yet another era in the remarkable run of Yankee success. In his 13
seasons, DiMaggio went to bat 6,821 times in 1,736 regular-season
games, got 2,214 hits for a .325 average, hit 361 home runs,
knocked in 1,537 runs, amassed 3,948 total bases and reached base
just under 40 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Three times DiMaggio was voted his league's most valuable
player: in 1939, 1941 and 1947. In 1941, the magical season of his
56-game hitting streak, he won the award even though Williams hit
.406.
</P>
<P>
   In each of his first four seasons with the Yankees, DiMaggio
played in the World Series, and the Yankees won all four. He
appeared in the Series 10 times in 13 seasons over all, and nine
times the Yankees won. And although he failed to get enough votes
to make the baseball Hall of Fame when he became eligible in 1953,
perhaps because his aloofness had alienated some of the writers who
did the voting, he sailed into Cooperstown two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Dimaggio married an actress, Dorothy Arnold. In October
1941, his only child, Joe Jr., was born. He is survived by his son;
his brother, Dominic; two granddaughters and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1942, DiMaggio enlisted in the Army Air Forces and
spent the next three years teaching baseball in the service. Along
with other baseball stars like Bob Feller and Williams, he resumed
his career as soon as the war ended, returning to the Yankees for
the 1946 season and a year later leading them back into the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   His legend took a storybook turn in 1952, the year after he
retired from the Yankees, when DiMaggio, whose marriage to Dorothy
Arnold had ended in divorce in 1944, arranged a dinner date with
Marilyn Monroe in California. They were married in San Francisco on
Jan. 14, 1954, and spent nine months trying to reconcile their
differences before they divorced in October. DiMaggio always seemed
tortured by Monroe's sex goddess image. He protested loudly during
the making of Billy Wilder's ``The Seven Year Itch'' when the
script called for her to cool herself over a subway grate while a
sudden wind blew her skirts up high.
</P>
<P>
   But when the actress seemed on the verge of an emotional
collapse in 1961, DiMaggio brought her to the Yankees' training
camp in Florida for rest and support. And when she died of an
overdose of barbiturates at the age of 36 on Aug. 4, 1962, he took
charge of her funeral and for the next 20 years sent roses three
times a week to her crypt in the Westwood section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For some years he lived in San Francisco with his widowed sister
Marie in a house in the Marina District that he had bought for his
parents in 1939 and that he and his sister had both shared with
Marilyn Monroe. When the damp San Francisco climate troubled the
arthritis in his back, he began to spend most of his time in
Florida, where he established his home. He played golf and made
selected excursions to Europe and the Far East, where the demand
for his appearance and his autograph returned high dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to take the most pleasure in establishing a
children's wing, called the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, at
Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. And he seemed to
relish the invitations back to Yankee Stadium, where he frequently
threw out the first ball on Opening Day, tall but slightly stooped,
dressed elegantly, as always, in a dark business suit, walking to
the mound and lobbing one to the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was there on the day the season ended this year, as the
Yankees set a team record with their 114th victory, that he was
acclaimed on yet another Joe DiMaggio Day, the timeless hero and
the symbol of Yankee excellence, acknowledging the cheers of Yankee
players and fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of cheering that accompanied him through life
and that he had quietly come to expect. It recalled the time when
he and Marilyn Monroe, soon after their wedding, took a trip to
Tokyo. She continued on to entertain American troops in Korea, and
said with fascination when she returned, ``Joe, you've never heard
such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   And Joe DiMaggio replied softly, ``Yes, I have.''

 Pacific Exchange Ending an Era   By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sometime early in the next decade, an era will end when the Pacific
Exchange abandons its Pine Street home, leaving San Francisco
without a central stock market for the first time in more than a
century.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown, quietly disclosed in connection with a regulatory
filing several weeks ago, is inevitable economically and
technologically.
</P>
<P>
   With most stock transactions now handled by computer, dealers
and brokers no longer need to do business face-to-face. A stock
trading floor, with traders scurrying from post to post to place
orders, is simply obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre it's still there,'' said Sandy Robertson, the
former chairman of San Francisco investment bank Roberston
Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Though the move makes sense as a business decision, the brokers
for whom the frenzy of the trading floor is in their blood say that
life will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor is jazz, the adrenaline in your body,'' said
independent floor broker Frank Gallagher, whose coffee-stained
workstation is a jumble of papers and risque newspaper clips. ``I'm
not looking forward to sitting in an office. I like my little
world.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Pacific Exchange isn't going away as a
stock-trading institution. When it shuts its trading floor, dealers
and brokers will operate from separate offices rather than a
central site.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, buying and selling of stock options will continue
for the foreseeable future at a less historic but far more active &LR; 
 &LR; Pacific Exchange trading floor in the Mills Building on Montgomery
Street.
</P>
<P>
   As a preliminary step toward phasing out its stock trading
floor, the exchange asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission last month to let its specialists operate off the
exchange floor. Specialists are the firms that promise to buy or
sell the shares of specific companies, ensuring that a market in
those stocks is always available.
</P>
<P>
   If it gets a go-ahead, Pacific will move two of its 38
specialists off site as a test. Presuming that goes well, the
exchange will close down its Pine Street site as well as a second
trading floor in Los Angeles within two or three years, Pacific
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific's lease expires in 2008, but the exchange can break the
contract earlier than that. The exchange's below-market rent is
scheduled to rise in 2001, which gives it added incentive to move
out.
</P>
<P>
   With San Francisco already reeling from the loss of its biggest
banks and brokerages, many see the closure of the city's equity
emporium as another psychological blow.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange's massive, granite edifice was built in 1915 to
house U.S. Treasury offices in the city. The exchange acquired it
just as the Great Depression set in and began operating there in
1930.
</P>
<P>
   With its broad steps, heroic ``Progress of Man'' sculptures and
imposing columns, the building became a sort of ground zero for the
Financial District, a symbol of the city's monetary might.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical location of the stock exchange in the Financial
District is very important,'' said John Regin, a broker for the
firm Herzog Heine Geduld who has worked on the exchange floor for
13 years. ``It's something that gives the district its character as
a financial center.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's status as the seat of an important regional
stock exchange gave the city cachet. ``San Francisco had the name
`Financial Capital of the West,''' said Warren Berl, retired
chairman of the brokerage firm Sutro &AMP; Co. and the exchange's chief
in 1960 and 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its physical and symbolic weight, Pacific's Pine
Street trading floor has become an expensive anachronism. Only
about 5 percent of the 17.5 million shares traded daily on the
exchange involve personal contact between a buyer and seller on the
exchange floor, said Robert Greber, Pacific's chief executive. The
rest are processed by computer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PSE09 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Tradition and custom were costing us an awful lot of money,''
Greber said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific's trading floor is a cavernous hall covered by a vaulted
roof and skylight, a room with one foot in the past and the other
in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned chalkboards for displaying prices, now unused,
line the walls. Electronic ticker tapes have been slapped on top of
the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden counters arranged in a horseshoe fill the floor. Computer
terminals crowd the countertops, from which spaghetti strands of
wiring spew in all directions. The floors are covered with order
slips, candy wrappers and discarded newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers in shirt-sleeves sit on stools at workstations with
banks of phones and terminals in front of them, bantering with
their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the exchange's floor brokers say they accept the
shutdown. ``It's a good move for us,'' said Jonathan Werts,
president of the San Francisco Specialists Association.
</P>
<P>
   Stock trading has been losing money for Pacific in recent years
as bigger, more-powerful markets such as the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market use their muscle to take a bigger
share.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all stock exchanges, including Pacific, are losing
business to so-called electronic communication networks,
proprietary systems such as Reuters Holdings Instinet that match
buy and sell orders by computer, eliminating the need for an
exchange as middleman.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with daunting competitive threats, Pacific nearly
abandoned its stock business. When it agreed to merge with the
Chicago Board Options Exchange last year, it said it would sell or
spin off its stock exchange business.
</P>
<P>
   CBOE pulled out of the merger two months ago, citing delays
caused by a federal antitrust probe. That prompted Pacific to dust
off a plan aimed at making the exchange competitive in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Pacific's stock strategy is a cutting-edge, and
much-hyped, electronic trading system called OptiMark. Pacific is
the first U.S. exchange to adopt OptiMark, an order-matching system
that lets traders handle large orders anonymously, avoiding the big
price moves that can occur when a large block of stock is put up
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of cost savings from shutting the trading floor
and new business attracted by OptiMark should make Pacific's stock
business profitable again, exchange officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the building itself, its owner said his plans are open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a definite answer except that we will take care
of it architecturally,'' said Martin Brown, president of the Empire
Group, which specializes in managing historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange building is a unique space, real estate experts
said, a wide open hall with a mixture of Classic and Art Deco
design in the middle of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The building could get leased by a law firm, as was the old
Federal Reserve on Sansome Street, realty specialists said. Brown
said he favors some kind of public as well as private use of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   That would represent a change from the current situation in
which public access to the building is restricted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the stairway, with guys hanging around eating their
lunch, there's not a lot of public use today,'' said Hamid
Moghadam, chief executive of AMB Property Corp. in San Francisco.''

 Getting 401(k) Investing Advice Online  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
There are 30 million U.S. workers whose hopes for a comfortable
retirement will hinge largely on how well they invest their 401(k)
pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the vast majority of them know next to nothing about
investing.
</P>
<P>
   To address this need, a couple of young, privately held
investment advisory firms _ Financial Engines of Palo Alto and
401(k) Forum of San Francisco _ have recently begun providing
401(k) participants with bargain-priced advice on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The online advice isn't available to just any Web surfer. Your
company has to sign up with the adviser, which then will give you a
user ID and password that let you obtain advice on funds approved
for your 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   The programs first grill participants about how soon they plan
to retire and their level of risk tolerance, then suggest what
portion of their portfolios should be invested in growth funds,
value funds, fixed-income funds and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Because their services are computer-based rather than
labor-intensive, the advisers can charge the employer as little as
$10 to $50 per employee per year.
</P>
<P>
   That is a far cry from the $200 to $400 per employee per visit
that investment advisers have traditionally charged companies for
hands-on tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   Employers themselves are barred by federal law from giving
employees specific advice about how to allocate their 401(k) funds.
Most companies have ``an intense paranoia'' about violating the
law, says Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefits
Research Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't just turn their backs on their employees. They
might get sued in coming years by employees who find that they
haven't accumulated enough assets to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have only one and three corporate clients
respectively, Financial Engines and 401(k) Forum are the leading
independent companies in their field.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``independent'' is key here, because some of the big
mutual-fund companies _ among them Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe
Price _ offer essentially the same services on their Web sites _
mainly, though not exclusively, to their own 401(k) plan clients.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of 401(K)09 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The mutual fund companies, however, could be perceived as having
a conflict of interest when a 401(k) plan offers funds from several
different fund groups, including their own. The independents
wouldn't have that problem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some of the nation's most savvy venture capitalists are
betting that Financial Engines and 401(k) Forum will be big winners
because they offer impartial advice and strong expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Financial Engines has received venture capital from New
Enterprise Associates, Foundation Capital, Charter Venture Capital,
Thomson Corp. and Financial Technology Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   401(k) Forum's backers include Arthur Andersen, Media Technology
Venture Partners, Norwest Venture Capital and GE Capital Services.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither company has scheduled an initial public
offering, both will almost certainly go public.
</P>
<P>
   Financial Engines was founded two years ago and 401(k) Forum
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They say their growth has been modest mainly because potential
clients have been skeptical about the value of investment advice
spewed out by a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The one client Financial Engines has in the bag is Alza Corp.,
the Palo Alto pharmaceuticals maker.
</P>
<P>
   401(k) Forum's three clients are Blue Shield of California,
Fujitsu America and Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The value of computer-based investment advice depends on the
quality of the underlying software, and on the investment expertise
of the people who created it.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, Financial Engines _ whose Web site is at
 &LR; www.financialengines.com &UR;  &LR; _ seems to have an edge.
</P>
<P>
   It was co-founded by Nobel Prize-winning economist William F.
Sharpe, a Stanford University professor, and the advice it gives is
based on his staggeringly complex, computerized asset-allocation
models, which have been used for years by many of the nation's
largest pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Fethe, Alza's senior vice president for human resources,
says he was attracted to Financial Engines because ``Bill Sharpe is
the 800-pound gorilla in portfolio theory. Numerous objective tests
of portfolio theory have ratified his approach.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of 401(K)09 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The Financial Engines asset-allocation model is based on a score
of economic variables, says Jeff Maggioncalda, the company's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take into account things like inflation, interest rates,
bond returns, equity returns, dividends and the expected returns of
large-cap, small-cap, mid-cap, international and domestic funds.''
</P>
<P>
   To use the model, you must key in answers to a long string of
questions about your existing portfolio, income, retirement plans
and risk tolerance. You can revisit the Web site for updated advice
as your circumstances change.
</P>
<P>
   After you have made all the entries, the Sharpe model spits out
a vital statistic: the percentage probability that you will have
the retirement income you want at the time you want it.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the result _ if the probability is, say, only
20 percent _ you can go back and adjust your input: such as your
risk tolerance, expected retirement date or retirement income
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the new entries, Financial Engines will recalculate the
probability that you will have a satisfactory income at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   When the probability is high enough, you receive specific
instructions for changing your portfolio. You will be told to buy
or sell precise numbers of shares in the mutual funds available in
your 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   401(k) Forum  &LR; (www.401kforum.com) &LR;  provides advice based on
models developed by a team led by Scott Lummer, former head of
international asset consulting with Chicago's Ibbotson Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our employees like using their product,'' says Susie
Hasselkuss, benefits administrator with Blue Shield of California.
``They are learning a lot more about investing and doing a better
job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 401(k) Forum's program asks users many of the same questions
as Financial Engines' model.
</P>
<P>
   401(k) Forum makes specific recommendations for altering your
portfolio. But it doesn't state the odds that your current
financial course will prove successful.
</P>
<P>
   However, Julie Annette, 401(k) Forum's marketing manager,
insists that her company's product is less dependent on ivory-tower
computations than Financial Engines.'

 &LR;  ``We're not just putting numbers into a black box,'' she says.
``We question fund managers about how they make decisions, and we
look carefully at the makeup of their portfolios. A fund that may
claim to be a value fund may in reality be leaning toward a growth
strategy. We make sure we have a good feeling for all the funds we

COURT LEAVES INTACT PROTECTIONS FOR IMMIGRANTS FACING OUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite hed and list the seven northeastern states in graf
5; no other changes.)  (lh) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday left intact a crazy
quilt of legal protections that are available to immigrants facing
deportation orders.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and other parts of the country covered by some
appealate court rulings, immigrants with criminal records are
allowed to appeal some deportation orders to judges. In other parts
of the country, in different appealate circuits, immigrants with
criminal records have no such right.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had asked for a prompt review, arguing for a
definitive answer supporting its view that the 1996 law allowed
deportation, without judicial review, of non-citizens who had
committed drug offenses or other crimes, even some that were minor
or had been committed long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals courts in three federal judicial circuits have ruled
either that Congress did not or, as a constitutional matter, could
not strip the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear these cases
and, further, that the harsh provisions should not apply to cases
that were in the pipeline when the new law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court Monday left intact those rulings from two of
the circuits, covering seven states in the northeast _ Connecticut,
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and
Vermont. At the same time, the court vacated a ruling from the
federal appeals court in San Francisco, sending the case back for
further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision last
month, unrelated in most respects, in a case involving the
government's effort to deport a group of Palestinians in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of cases now in the pipeline involving the
category of immigrants known as ``criminal aliens.'' These are not
illegal aliens in the usual sense, in that they typically entered
the country legally, sometimes in early childhood, and have been
living as lawful permanent residents, often with spouses or
children who are U.S. citizens. But Congress decreed that people in
this category have forfeited their right to remain here if they
commit drug offenses or any of a list of other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Congress left the retroactive effect of this provision unclear,
and the Board of Immigration Appeals, the top administrative review
body in the immigration system, ruled that it should not be applied
retroactively. Attorney General Janet Reno exercised her power to
overturn that ruling and, in a highly controversial executive
decision in February, 1997, declared that the new treatment for
criminal aliens should apply to all deportation cases then in the
pipeline as well as to crimes that a noncitizen had committed in
the past, even if the crime had not yet become the occasion for a
deportation proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the administration has taken the position that the
attorney general's ruling on retroactivity, known as the Soriano
decision, is itself unreviewable in any federal court. A growing
list of lower federal courts has rejected that position, although a
few have accepted it. In all three of the cases before the Supreme
Court Monday, the lower courts had ruled that the Soriano decision
could not be insulated from judicial review and that immigrants
were entitled to challenge deportation orders through petitions for
writs of habeas corpus in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Filing appeals in all three cases, the administration urged the
justices to use at least one of the cases as a vehicle for the
range of procedural and substantive issues presented. As a
practical matter, the court's denial of review in cases from the
1st and 2nd U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals, in Boston and New York,
means that within the seven states of those two circuits, the 1996
law no longer has the retroactive effect and immigrants facing
deportation can be heard by a U.S. district judge.
</P>
<P>
   This was good news to lawyers representing immigrants. ``It's a
vindication of the right to judicial review,'' said Lucas
Guttentag, director of the immigrants' rights project of the
American Civil Liberties Union, who was involved in all of Monday's
cases. He acknowledged that the court's denial of review was not a
ruling on the merits of the cases, and that the justices remained
free to take up a subsequent case that presented the same issues.
He predicted, however, that the court's action would add momentum
to the trend against the administration in the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, a spokeswoman said that lawyers there
``need to review these orders and how they fit together before
commenting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reno vs. Navas, No. 98-996, the New York case in which review
was denied Monday, was a consolidated appeal of five cases. Saul
Navas, a native of Panama who entered the United States as a legal
immigrant in 1987, was convicted in the New York courts in 1995 of
robbery and possession of stolen property, rendering him deportable
even under the prior immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed to an immigration judge, as was his right under the
old law, and won relief from deportation. But his case was still
pending in 1997 when, under the attorney general's retroactive
application of the new law, his relief from deportation was
canceled, and he was ordered deported. A U.S. district judge,
rejected the government's view that habeas corpus jurisdiction no
longer applied, ordered Navas released, in a decision that the 2nd
Circuit upheld while also rejecting the attorney general's view on
retroactivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1st Circuit case, Reno vs. Goncalves, No. 98-835, the
immigrant, Raul Goncalves, legally entered the United States from
Portugal with his parents at the age of 3. Several convictions for
theft placed him in deportation proceedings in 1990. His appeal was
still pending in 1997 when he was found ineligible for relief under
the new law. The 1st Circuit ruled that the law should not be
applied retroactively and that under a proper interpretation of the
new law, Goncalves could still seek habeas corpus review in U.S.
District Court.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit, in Immigration and Naturalization Service vs.
Magana-Pizano, No. 98-836, took a different approach, reaching a
constitutional issue that the other two courts had avoided. Unlike
the others, the 9th Circuit ruled that Congress actually had
eliminated judicial review. But because Congress could not
constitutionally do so, the appeals court said, the U.S. District
Courts retained their habeas corpus jurisdiction nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrant in that case, Daniel Magana-Pizano, entered the
country legally from Mexico, as a 5-year-old child accompanying his
parents. In 1995, he pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor drug
offense, thus becoming eligible for deportation. His appeals were
cut off under retroactive application of the new law before the 9th
Circuit ruled that he was entitled to proceed through a petition
for habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation for why the justices vacated that
decision Monday, rather than denying review as they did in the
other two cases, was the court's general aversion to constitutional
rulings when the same result can be achieved through statutory
interpretation. The court might have wanted to give the 9th Circuit
a chance to reconsider its view of the statute and find that
Congress had not intended to eliminate judicial review in the first
place.

 Deducting Educational Expenses  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I own and manage a small business. I am applying for a
university program leading to a doctorate in a different field. The
tuition is expensive, of course. Can I deduct my educational
expenses?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  I'm afraid not _ and the reason is that you will be
studying outside your present field. If you have decided on a new
career, the full financial burden is on you.
</P>
<P>
   As sad as this may seem, it makes sense. Would you like to see
your own taxes rise so that fuzzy-cheeked future lawyers and
investment bankers can deduct the cost of going through law school
or business school? I thought not.
</P>
<P>
   However, the tax rules are liberal for working people who incur
educational expenses in their current fields. Self-employed people
who study to expand their knowledge or skills in their present
businesses can deduct the costs of tuition, books and other
research and study materials.
</P>
<P>
   For example, physicians who take courses to keep up with
advances in medicine, or lawyers who go back to school to study the
latest legislative or judicial changes in the law, can claim
education deductions.
</P>
<P>
   The education deduction also is available to employees whose
employers require them to take courses as a condition for keeping
their jobs or maintaining their salaries. Employees also can take
courses on their own and claim deductions if the courses are
designed to help them maintain or improve their job skills.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes on Barter
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are letting a couple of starving artists occupy part of
our house rent-free. In exchange, they perform repairs and
maintenance on the house. Do we owe taxes on the value of their
work? And do they owe taxes on the value of the rent?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: It's possible that all of you owe taxes. What you have
there is a bartering transaction, which is subject to income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to figure it:
</P>
<P>
   _You, the homeowners, must declare as income the fair market
value of the services your tenants perform for you. However, you
can deduct from that a portion of your household expenses because
you are alloting partial use of your home in exchange for the
services.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the tenants occupy one-fourth of your house, you
can deduct a fourth of your mortgage interest, property taxes and
homeowners' insurance costs. However, your deduction can be no
larger than the value of the services you receive.
</P>
<P>
   _Your tenants must declare as income the fair market value of
the rent on the space they occupy. They can deduct from this any
out-of-pocket expenses they incur in working for you, such as the
cost of paint, lumber and other materials used to fix your house.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Started
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a college student, 24 years old, with no job. I recently
received a money gift from a relative and would like to invest it.
People suggest that I buy stocks or mutual funds, but I am new to
investing and know little about it. I have read books on the
subject and have scanned the Internet, but I find the jargon hard
to follow. How should I proceed?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MONEYBAG () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  A: You are in the same boat as a lot of other people. The
mutual fund industry was created to serve people like yourself.
Because you are still young, you probably can safely invest your
gift entirely in equity mutual funds _ those that invest almost
entirely in stocks. Stocks have been the most lucrative securities
investment over the long term, rising 9 to 10 percent a year on
average over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy shares in a mutual fund, you pool your money with
other shareholders, and all of you get the services of expert
investment managers working full time to analyze and trade
securities on your behalf. For this, you pay a small fee, typically
about 1 percent of your assets each year.
</P>
<P>
   That still leaves you the task of choosing a fund or funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that for many years, only about 20 percent of
equity mutual funds have performed better than the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index _ the principal U.S. measure of investment
performance. If that trend were to continue, the best strategy
would be to buy shares in a mutual fund that emulates the index,
such as the Vanguard Index 500 Fund. Index funds require minimal
management and therefore charge relatively small management fees _
typically, 0.25 percent of assets or less per year.
</P>
<P>
   Notice that I said ``if that trend were to continue.'' Neither I
nor anyone else can say for certain whether, or how long, the S&AMP;P
500 will continue to beat the majority of mutual fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the fundamental fact that investing, no
matter how much or little you know about it, will always be partly
a gamble.

TAYLOR SAYS TRADES POSSIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ With the NHL trading deadline approaching
and his team's playoff hopes flickering, Los Angeles Kings general
manager Dave Taylor said Monday that deals are possible in the next
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be interested in talking to any team if it means helping
our club for the short term, but in particular for the long term,''
said Taylor, whose team takes a four-game losing streak into
tonight's meeting at the Forum with the two-time defending Stanley
Cup champion Detroit Red Wings. ``We wouldn't be very interested in
giving up any of our young kids at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading between the lines, it appears that housecleaning _ or at
least some light dusting _ is likely around the March 23 trading
deadline if the Kings' playoff hopes have completely deteriorated
by then.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor insisted he hasn't given up on this season. The Kings
(23-36-5) are seven points out of the last Western Conference
playoff berth with 18 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll look beyond this year as long as we have a
chance to make the playoffs, and we still have a chance,'' he said.
``But we can't afford too many losses, and we could play great and
still not get in.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Back in town: Taylor returned Sunday after nine days in
Finland, where he scouted several Kings prospects, including Aki
Berg, who chose to play in his native country after failing to
reach contract terms with his NHL club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd like to come back and we'd like to have him
back,'' Taylor said. ``It's a matter of working out a contract.
He's a very good young defenseman.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Burning Staples A pile of insulating material on the roof of
the under-construction Staples Center caught fire Monday morning
and burned for about 30 minutes before it was put out by
firefighters. The cause of the blaze was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Said Michael Roth, spokesman for the new arena, which is
scheduled to open in October, ``It's not going to slow down
construction at all, and there's no reason it should delay the
opening. No one was hurt and no one was sent home.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks The Red Wings will be without center Sergei
Fedorov, who is serving a five-game suspension for a slashing
incident last week. The suspension cost Fedorov $386,178 in salary.
. . . Long Beach Ice Dogs goalie Ryan Bach practiced with the Kings
on Monday because Jamie Storr was ill. Storr's availability for
tonight's game will be determined today, as will that of defenseman
Mattias Norstrom, who also has a virus.

 Vivus Patents Sex Cream For Women  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A Mountain View drug company won a patent yesterday for a rub-on
cream or gel that might do for women what Viagra has done for men.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Vivus Inc. more than doubled to $4.81 yesterday after
the firm announced its patent covering topical use of the drug
alprostadil and other compounds for female sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Alprostadil is the active ingredient in Muse, a Vivus product
for male impotence that has been overshadowed by Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Vivus will now ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
permission to begin testing alprostadil on women's genitalia, chief
executive Leland Wilson said. A patent merely gives a company
commercial rights to a product. Only the FDA can approve a drug for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Vivus has only tested its compound on female rabbits and
cats.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Louann Brizendine, who studies female sexual
dysfunction at the University of California at San Francisco, said
it would be at least two years before scientists know whether
alprostadil creams or gels can safely improve orgasm in women.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the basic hypothesis is sound. Like the penis, the
female clitoris must become engorged with blood for the woman to
experience arousal. &UR;  &LR; Vivus said its tests in men have already shown
that alprostadil relaxes penile blood vessels, promoting erections
in some subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vascular dilation and improved erection of the clitoris might
result in better, stronger orgasms for women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lake Polan, chair of gynecology and obstetrics at Stanford
University, said it's far too early to say whether an alprostadil
cream for women would be more effective than a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a need for something like this,'' she said,
adding that sexual dysfunction is one of the most common complaints
of women who are soon approaching, experiencing or past menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Polan said the commercial success of Viagra for men has
legitimized discussion of sexual dysfunction for both genders.
Pfizer has tested its male potency pill Viagra for potential use on
women. So far, those tests have had mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra's success nearly sunk Vivus as a company. In January
1997, when Vivus started selling alprostadil for men under the
brand name Muse, it enjoyed a spurt of sales and popularity, and
its stock briefly reached the $40s.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, after Viagra's stunning debut, Muse
prescriptions plummeted, as did Vivus shares. Before yesterday's
news, Vivus was trading just above $2 per share and had hired an
investment banking firm to look for someone to buy it.

 Column: Homestake Sees Golden Opportunity With Canadian Company  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Once upon a time, a San Francisco 49er was something other than an
inside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Super Bowls, cioppino and silicon chips, a Niner, of
course, was a miner. And San Francisco was awash in gold _ and all
of the wealth and commerce that came with it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the historic weight that the precious metal bears on
this city, its presence in San Francisco's modern economy is as
rare as a nugget in a stream. With at least one exception:
Homestake Mining.
</P>
<P>
   Homestake's pedigree is guilded. The 122-year-old mining company
was founded in part by William Randolph Hearst's father, George
Hearst, who dominated the company from the outset, according to
company history. And it was Homestake proceeds passed from George
to William that enabled the son to build his newspaper empire.
</P>
<P>
   Homestake is so ``old San Francisco'' that it still makes its
living digging for gold. What's more, it is the oldest publicly
traded company (in its original business) listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those fun-facts, CQ &LR; Homestake is worthy of note
because it did a deal yesterday. The nation's fourth-largest gold
producer agreed to buy a Canadian-owned company, Argentina Gold
Corp., for about $200 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction by the Street wasn't, uh, golden.
Homestake's shares, which were already slumping, slipped about 6
percent to close at $8.88. What's worse for Homestake fans is that
its drop came in the face of about a $3 rise in the price of gold,
which closed at $292.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised that the stock is down, I'm surprised its
price is down as much as it is'' in the wake of gold's price jump,
says financial analyst Todd Hinrich of ABN AMRO in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that investors think Homestake is paying too much
for a promising South American mining operation. Homestake agreed
to pay the U.S. equivalent of $5.14 a share for Argentina Gold,
which is a whopping 63 percent above the company's close on Friday.
Homestake's bid is also significantly higher than a previous failed
bid by a Canadian competitor, Barrick Gold.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET09 (85201 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  A vexing problem for gold mining companies is that they have to
always find more gold in order to stay in business. And there's
only so much of the glittery stuff in the ground. So they have to
pay up. And Homestake's management is banking that it is buying low
(despite being up yesterday, gold prices have been on a downward
slide since the crash of 1987) and will be able to sell high.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is take advantage of the low price of
gold and make acquisitions when they are cheaper,'' says Homestake
chief executive Jack Thompson (no relation to the Throwin' Samoan,
a former Washington State quarterback of the same name).
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like these acquisitions to lower our costs of
exploration and development,'' Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   As you might guess, slugging it out in the global gold mining
business isn't the easiest way to make a buck. Long-term gold
prices have been under pressure as bears argue that gold has lost
its monetary value and has become just another commodity. What's
more, drilling holes through South American mountain ranges is
slightly more complicated and capital-intensive than, say, building
an e-commerce Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the CEO for nearly three years, has received high
marks from some Wall Street analysts for slashing Homestake's
operating costs by investing in technology and employee training
and for taking some calculated risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallmark of Homestake is the leadership of John
Thompson,'' says ABN's Hinrich.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the analyst rates Homestake a ``hold'' mostly because of
his pessimistic outlook for gold prices. ``I'm not exactly a raging
gold bull,'' Hinrich says.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are many of his peers when it comes to Homestake. Nine out
of the 15 financial analysts that cover the company rate it a
``hold.'' But if you believe in gold's future, Homestake's Thompson
thinks his company is where you want to park some of your
speculative assets.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET09 (85201 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Now that Homestake has shaved its operating costs, it's easier
for his company to earn a profit when gold prices are listless.
However, should gold prices ever begin to gain momentum, Thompson
contends that Homestake shares are a sophisticated way to play any
potential resurgence of the gold market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of gold doesn't have to move very far'' northward
for Homestake to benefit, Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Homestake fans, there is no guarantee that
gold will regain its luster.
</P>
<P>

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ASSERTS RIGHT TO INVESTIGATE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR
</HEADLINE>
   (lh) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department said in legal papers filed
Monday that only the attorney general had the authority to
investigate or remove an independent counsel like Kenneth Starr,
the Whitewater prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The filing to the three-member panel of federal appeals court
judges that appointed Starr asserted that the special division, as
the panel is known, had no authority to intervene in a disciplinary
matter like the Justice Department's pending investigation of
possible improprieties by Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the act grants the Special Division authority to
prohibit the attorney general from inquiring into whether `good
cause' exists to remove an independent counsel,'' said the brief
signed by Solicitor General Seth Waxman.
</P>
<P>
   The government legal papers represented the first time that the
Justice Department had addressed the issue of its powers to
investigate an independent counsel. They were filed at the panel's
direction after a conservative Virginia legal group, the Landmark
Legal Foundation, asked the judges to order the Justice Department
inquiry stopped, arguing that Reno did not have the authority to
investigate an independent counsel and that Congress should be
responsible for any disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law gives the attorney general sole
responsibility for removing an independent counsel, and Justice
Department officials have told Starr that inherent in that power is
the authority to conduct a fact-finding investigation necessary to
reach a judgment on whether Starr should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in a separate filing Monday, argued that Landmark did not
have any legal standing to ask the panel to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landmark has no legally cognizable interest in the case or
controversy presented by its application,'' said the brief.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear where the filings Monday left the matter.
Landmark intervened after news reports disclosed that the Justice
Department had notified Starr that it intended to open an
investigation into whether his prosecutors improperly coerced
witnesses like Monica Lewinsky or withheld possible conflicts of
interest from Justice Department lawyers at the outset of the
Lewinsky inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Reno and Starr have considered a separate
counsel to conduct the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Other legal documents related to the Starr case, unsealed last
week by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of U.S. district court here,
shed light on the behind-the-scenes battle over how far Starr could
go in restricting what Ms. Lewinsky would say in her interview with
ABC's Barbara Walters, which was broadcast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers argued that the independent counsel's
imposition of a prior restraint provision in Ms. Lewinsky's
immunity agreement was legally indefensible, given her full
cooperation with his grand jury and with Congress' impeachment
inquiry, as well as the fact that thousands of pages of material in
the case had already been released.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's office countered that her duties under the agreement
had not been completed, saying ``she has not yet testified at any
trials.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the two sides negotiated the interview's parameters.

   Cheap Air Fares: Bidding on the Web &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A New York tour operator and airline-ticket consolidator has
opened a Web site to accept bids on domestic and overseas tickets,
and the owner says that no bid _ not even $1 _ is too small to
start. Many of the fares have limited windows of availability;
others, particularly for students, offer a round trip to anywhere
in the United States to be used in a wide period of time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company, Magical Holidays at 501 Madison Avenue, set up
www.skyauction .com with no minimum price for any air ticket,
package tour or hotel stay. Registration to bid is free, with
payment by credit card or check.
</P>
<P>
   The president, Michael Hering, said that Magical Holidays was
begun in 1981 and, like other consolidators, has contracts with
most major airlines to sell tickets below advertised prices when
seats are not filling up at regular rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which has a student section with domestic tickets
and overseas tickets for long stays, opened Feb. 17. Among the
brands identified in the auctions are Virgin Atlantic, Continental,
United and Alitalia.
</P>
<P>
   One couple won an auction of two tickets to South Africa on
Virgin Atlantic for $685 each, plus tax, as against $1,299, plus
tax, for a 21-day advance purchase quoted by the airline. Bids can
be canceled by e-mail to the company, support(AT)skyauction.com.
There is a hypertext line on the site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skyauction bids can be based on how much has been bid _ bids in
the ball park are posted _ and how many tickets are available. In
each sale, the price necessary to get a ticket at a given moment is
posted, and others that qualify are listed.
</P>
<P>
   Most auctions go on for a week, but some of the offers, Hering
said, represent deals that airlines provide for particular dates
that are selling badly. These may last only a day. Some winning
bids are a loss for his company, Hering said, in that he pays the
airline more for them than they fetch. &QL;

   El Greco's Legacy To Three Countries &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of El Greco paintings, which opened in Madrid on
Feb. 4 and is due later this year in Rome and Athens, covers three
main stylistic periods, starting in Crete, where the artist was
born in 1541, to his introduction to the Renaissance in Italy in
1567 and finally to his many years in Spain, where he died in 1614
in Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Greco, Identity and Transformation'' features 70 of his
works, including 11 paintings that have never before been part of
an El Greco exhibition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Domenikos Theotocopoulos became known as El Greco (The Greek)
after he moved to Spain in 1577. The exhibition includes three of
his early works from Crete, including ``The Adoration of the
Magi,'' circa 1565, on loan from a Greek museum. From his Italian
period there are ``The Modena Triptych'' from 1569, depicting the
life of Christ, on loan from an Italian museum, and the ``Adoration
of the Shepherds,'' circa 1570, on loan from a private English
collection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the works on view _ such as ``St. Francis
Receiving the Stigmata,'' from 1580, from a private Spanish
collection _ are from his Spanish period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition continues through May 16 at the
Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid. Admission is $3.30; telephone:
(34) 91-420-3944. From June 2 to Sept. 19, it will reverse El
Greco's westward journey and travel to Rome, to the Palazzo delle
Esposizione, but with up to 20 paintings substituting for some that
will not leave Spain. Continuing to Athens, the show will display
57 works at the National Gallery, from Oct. 18 to Jan. 17, 2000. &QL;

   Poets Will Converge Upon Manhattan &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lower Manhattan has played host to poets and their movements for
more than two centuries. Edgar Allan Poe, Dylan Thomas, Allen
Ginsberg and e.e. cummings all embellished their talents, and
occasionally their habits, in the East Village, SoHo, the West
Village, and the Lower East Side. Next month poets from around the
world will visit these historic neighborhoods for the first
People's Poetry Gathering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From April 9 to 11, professional poets, amateurs and the curious
will partake in over 50 poetry recitations, conversation groups,
competitions and workshops. Although the festival is anchored at
Cooper Union (East Seventh Street between Third and Fourth
Avenues), events will take place throughout the downtown area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Presented by City Lore, a New York cultural center, and Poets
House, a literary center and home to a 35,000-volume poetry
library, the festival will explore two primary themes: ``Masters of
Oral Tradition'' and ``Emerging Forms and Formats.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Masters of Oral Tradition'' events will feature a performance
by Utah Phillips, Grand Master of the Rose Tattoo, a dispersed
troupe of hobo poets; Gabriel Segura and Rafael Perez Lopez,
Colombian decima (10-line verse) improvisers; and a picnic with the
cowboy poet Don Edwards, a former rancher and rodeo chaser. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 10-round ``Heavyweight Poetry Bout'' between Sherman Alexie
and Patricia Smith and ``Braggin' Rights,'' a free-style
street-corner rapping contest, are planned for ``Emerging Forms and
Formats.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other featured poets will include Robert Pinsky, the Poet
Laureate of the United States; John Cephas, the Piedmont blues
musician and National Heritage Award winner; and Galway Kinnell,
winner of the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also planned are a supper in honor of Robert Burns, midnight
readings of erotic poetry and Edgar Allan Poe, a workshop for
renga, a collaborative 36-stanza poem (saki provides inspiration
after the sixth stanza) with masters from the Spring Street Haiku
Group, and a literary tour and pub crawl. &QL;

   Danish Conquest: Legoland Comes to California &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Junior builders of America take note.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland California, a theme park inspired by those brightly
colored plastic bricks found in toy boxes the world over, is
scheduled to open Saturday in the seaside community of Carlsbad,
Calif. This will be the third Legoland, and the first in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The original opened in 1968 in Billund, Denmark _ Lego's
corporate headquarters _ and in 1996 a second park followed in
Windsor, England. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Designed for children between the ages of 2 and 12, Legoland
California occupies 128 acres and features 40 mostly interactive
rides, shows and attractions, as well as restaurants and shops,
spread among six theme areas.
</P>
<P>
   Fun Town, for example, has driving and boating ``schools'' for
children, while on Castle Hill visitors will participate in
simulated jousts. Thirty million Lego bricks have been used to
create the park's 5,000 models, which range from life-sized
giraffes and a dinosaur nine feet tall to highly detailed
scale-model versions of American landmarks like Mount Rushmore and
Grand Central Station. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lego plastic bricks were first made in 1947, and since 1949 more
than 200 billion Lego pieces have been produced. The first two Lego
theme parks have proved popular, with 1998 attendance reaching 1.4
million in Denmark and 1.5 million in England. At Legoland
California, 1.8 million visitors are expected during the first year
of operation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Legoland California is off the Cannon Road exit of Interstate 5
in Carlsbad, about 30 miles north of San Diego. It will be open
daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is $32, $25 seniors and children
3 to 16; two-day passes cost $36 and $29. Parking is $6.

SENATE EDUCATION BILL STALLS DESPITE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An education bill with bipartisan support got
bogged down on the Senate floor on Monday as Republicans feuded
with Democrats over President Clinton's initiative to reduce class
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans failed in their effort to cut off debate and
force a final vote on the bill, an attempt that they will make
again on Tuesday. The vote Monday to end debate was 41 against and
54 in favor, well short of the 60 required. It was strictly along
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan bill, dubbed ``ed flex,'' is supported by all 50
governors and, with some modifications, by Clinton. It would give
local schools more flexibility in the way they spend some $11
billion in federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first bill of the year that has broad bipartisan
support, and it is approaching gridlock,'' the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said in chastising the
Democrats. ``Let's not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the legislation has been greatly overshadowed by a
Democratic amendment that would trim class sizes by authorizing
federal spending to pay for the hiring of 100,000 teachers in
grades one though three. For days now, Republicans have worked to
keep the amendment off the Senate floor, arguing that while they
support the idea, it should be dealt with later this year, after
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday a procedural oversight by the Republicans left the
door open for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to force a test vote
on the proposal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more important to the families of this country than
the issue of education?'' Kennedy said after seizing the unexpected
opportunity. ``What is more important than having a debate on the
size of the classroom?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans immediately fired back with their own amendment,
which would allow local governments to choose how to spend $1.2
billion that was authorized last year: using it for either special
education or hiring teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's an excellent compromise,'' said Sen. James M.
Jeffords, R-Vt., who heads the Senate education committee.
</P>
<P>
   With the two sides at loggerheads in the first major education
debate of the year, Republicans are accusing Democrats of placing
political priorities above the needs of schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   And, converging Monday on a crowded town hall meeting in
Chester, Pa., Republican leaders not only lashed out at their
Democratic counterparts but also underscored their own education
ideas, hoping to convince voters that the issue is as important to
them as are tax cuts and military spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a partisan issue,'' Lott said at the town hall
meeting. ``Democrats are injecting politics where there is a broad
bipartisan consensus. They think the directions, control and money
should all come from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who shared the stage at the meeting with Sen. Rick
Santorum of Pennsylvania and other Republican notables, pointed to
his own bona fides as a onetime public school student and said he
would not ``cede this issue to people who didn't go to public
school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems in education are different than they were 10
years ago and require new kinds of solutions,'' Lott said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The battle on the ``ed-flex'' bill boils down to disagreement
over the Democratic amendment, proposed by Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash., to reduce class sizes by hiring 100,000 teachers over the
next seven years. A down payment of $1 billion for the teacher
proposal was approved by Congress last year as part of a larger
spending bill, but an additional $11 billion is needed to finance
the initiative fully.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy on Monday portrayed the Republicans as weak-willed on
education and said they wanted to ``gag'' the Democrats. He added
that ``Senator Lott told the governors that he was very willing to
have the Senate talk about education, but here in the Senate he's
much less willing.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher-hiring proposal, which Democrats call crucial to
improving schooling for young children, has put Republicans in a
tough spot. While they envision the initiative's ultimate approval,
they had hoped to deal with it later, as part of a more sweeping
education bill.
</P>
<P>
   But with the amendment headed to the floor now for a test vote,
in which the backing of 60 senators will be needed for approval,
Republicans will most likely reject it, despite their fears that
doing so will leave them vulnerable on the education issue.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to take up its version of the bill, which
does not include a teacher-hiring proposal, later this week. If the
Senate is unable to end debate on its bill, Lott may be forced to
pull the legislation so the body can proceed to other business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing politics with the future of our children, with
our children's education,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who
co-sponsored the ``ed flex'' bill.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing parents want, Frist said, is for Congress to
``stop playing politics and pass useful legislation.''

JAILERS WATCH MOTHER HELD IN 3 KILLINGS

   CHICAGO _ A 41-year-old nurse was under a 24-hour suicide watch
after being jailed in the deaths of her three children, who had
been drugged and suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Marilyn Lemak, had been rushed to a hospital for
surgery for a severed artery in her arm on Friday after calling the
police to report the children's deaths. Ms. Lemak was released from
the hospital on Sunday, and a judge on Du Page County Circuit Court
ruled Monday that Ms. Lemak must remain in jail without bond, while
also receiving a psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   A makeshift memorial has grown outside Ms. Lemak's home in
Naperville, a bedroom community west of Chicago, and on Sunday 500
people attended a Mass remembering the children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lemak and her husband, David, are divorcing, and her
husband, an emergency room doctor, had moved out of the house
several weeks ago. A family member told reporters that Ms. Lemak
had been struggling with depression since the birth of her last
child three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that when 7-year-old Nicholas Lemak and
6-year-old Emily arrived home from school on Thursday, Ms. Lemak
gave them and 3-year-old Thomas a mixture of prescription drugs to
make them sleepy. Once they were asleep, she suffocated each child
by placing one hand over the mouth and pinching the nose with the
other. She then took some of the same drug mixture and cut her arm,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Ms. Lemak appeared in a wheelchair in court, where her
lawyer, Jack Donahue, requested permission for a psychiatric
evaluation. Judge Stephen Culliton of Du Page County Circuit Court
granted the request but said the evaluation could not be used to
determine if Ms. Lemak was fit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lemak has not entered a plea to the three counts of
first-degree murder and is scheduled for arraignment on March 29.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators would not speculate on a motive for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lemak's divorce lawyer, David Kuhn, described her as a
caring mother and an active member of the community. He did notice
some depression, which he said was common with divorce, but he
noted that the Lemaks' divorce was not an ugly one.

 &HT;    California regent criticizes contracts deal, lends support to
Texas oppositionBy Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A recent legislative compromise to save a
program aimed at winning more state contracts for women and
minority business owners was nothing more than ``shuck and jive,''
says Californian Ward Connerly, a lightning rod in the debate over
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have a gun to your head if you're a contractor.
Good-faith efforts can still be quotas,'' Connerly said Monday in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California regent drew national attention
after he successfully campaigned to eliminate affirmative action by
California state government.
</P>
<P>
   In a Capitol news conference, Connerly criticized a deal forged
last week by state senators that revised the state's Historically
Underutilized Business program. The deal, made by Sens. Royce West,
D-Dallas, and Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, saved the program but
gave it a new focus.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of concentrating on the number of contracts that state
agencies make with businesses owned by women and minorities, the
new program will focus on the efforts made by a state agency to
diversify its contracting.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's appearance at the Capitol lent support to a bill
filed Monday by state Rep. Robert Talton, R-Pasadena, to prohibit
discrimination or preferential treatment in public employment,
contracting or education when that discrimination or preference is
based on race, color, gender, ethnicity or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, if enacted, would kill the Historically Underutilized
Business program.
</P>
<P>
   Both Talton and Connerly, standing beside him in front the State
Treasury office at the Capitol, called discrimination and
preferences morally wrong. With them was Edward Blum of Houston,
co-chair of the Campaign for a Colorblind America, which also
opposes affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, who also was scheduled to speak at the University of
Texas School of Law Monday night, said preferences would not make
up for deficient schools. But he also said too much blame has been
put on schools for students' poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   The California businessman praised Gov. George W. Bush's plan to
end social promotion in public schools, saying it stands as an
integral component to ending preferences based on race, gender or
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits in beautifully,'' Connerly said. ``I hope the governor
will be willing to do the heavy lifting. When you're looking at
higher office, you may be more compromising.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said he had not met with Bush. But would he be a Bush
supporter if the governor makes a presidential bid? ``Maybe,'' he
said. ``Maybe. But we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Osler McCarthy writes for The Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

HOW SAFE IS THE HOTEL SAFE?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J., Calif., Fla.)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Sept. 1, Dr. Odi Matityahu and his wife, Liat, arrived in
St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands, to celebrate her birthday. They
checked into the Renaissance Grand Beach Resort about 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Matityahu said that the hotel staff asked if they needed a safe
for their valuables, and they were given the key to a wall safe in
their room. They stored their valuables, including passports and
jewelry, and went swimming. When they returned at 5:20, the room
safe had been removed with a beer-can opener, which was left
behind. The room door had not been forced, they said.
</P>
<P>
   This situation, and a different problem that befell two other
hotel guests in Miami, illuminate aspects of hotel liability that
may come as unwelcome news to travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Matityahu said that he and his wife got a hotel and a police
report about the theft and that the resort manager said there was
nothing to worry about because the insurance company would take
care of them. After the couple returned home to Plano, Texas,
Matityahu said, an insurance adjuster called to say the couple
would be compensated for their losses _ up to a total of $200.
Since Matityahu's list includes more than $33,000 in jewelry, he
refused to accept.
</P>
<P>
   The $200 offer was not a random one. It is the limit of
``innkeeper liability'' in the Virgin Islands' legal code when
guests entrust their valuables to the hotel for safekeeping and the
valuables are lost through ``theft, damage, destruction or
otherwise.'' It is not that a hotel cannot pay more, but $200 is
the most it is obliged to pay.
</P>
<P>
   If valuables are not entrusted to the hotel, the guest is
entitled to no compensation in the event of a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Since the event, Matityahu said, he has received unsatisfactory
and ``rude'' responses from the hotel and some of its officers. He
turned the matter over to a lawyer at home and a suit was filed for
damages of $47,565, including losses caused by Matityahu's absence
from his chiropractic practice, airline tickets, new passports and
a replacement for his green card (he is an Israeli national). The
issue of whom to sue, in the age of real estate investment trusts,
franchising and hotel management companies, is difficult. George B.
Flint, the Matityahus' lawyer, filed the suit in Texas against
Marriott, which owns the Renaissance Group.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas lawyer representing Marriott in this case, Ellen
Presby of Mills, Presby &AMP; Associates, said ``they sued the wrong
company'' and that despite the name, the real owner of the hotel is
Hotel Property Investment Inc., whose address she did not know.
Flint has asked for this.
</P>
<P>
   The jewelry is carried on the family insurance policy, and
Matityahu is filing a claim. But he says his premiums will rise
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Flint says that the case will hinge on negligence. ``That was
not a safe as `safe' is understood in Texas law,'' he said in an
interview. ``I think if you asked 12 members of a jury if something
you could remove with a can opener is a safe, the vote would be
12-0 against it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The matter of limiting innkeepers' liability goes far back in
law. A cap on what an innkeeper must pay if travelers lose their
belongings came about to protect those who provided shelter to
people on the road _ a desirable situation in the view of public
policy _ from being put out of business by visitors who sued after
being robbed on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, every state and territory has a law
limiting this liability, and each state requires that notices of
this be posted in a particular way. No federal law is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these limits were set in the last century, and inflation
has made them out of date. In the last five years, some
legislatures have been pushed by consumers into raising the limits.
</P>
<P>
   John Hyland, a lawyer at Sherry &AMP; O'Neill in New York, which
specializes in hotel law, gave some figures for the limits in
states popular with tourists: New Jersey, $5,000; New York, $1,500;
Florida, $1,000; California, $1,000; Nevada, $750, and Illinois,
$500.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   John Sherry Jr., emeritus professor of law at the Cornell School
of Hotel Administration, whose father was an original partner of
Sherry &AMP; O'Neill, is more pragmatist than litigator. ``If you have
heirloom jewelry,'' he said, ``don't take it to a hotel, even for a
wedding. The best hotels attract the best confidence artists, and
they will get to you some way. You might as well wear good-quality
paste.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue of hotel liability appears in the case of Jim and
Judith Whalen of Seal Beach, Calif., who describe themselves as a
senior couple. On Nov. 19, on a business trip to Miami, they
returned to the hotel, the Doubletree at Coconut Grove, at 8 p.m.
When they were 50 feet from the hotel entrance, they said, they and
a couple leaving the hotel with two young children were set upon by
four youths, knocked down and robbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the proximity to the hotel entrance,'' Mrs. Whalen
wrote, ``hotel security did not respond to our collective
screams.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that research by friends who were members of the
Florida bar showed that Florida law provided no shield to forbid
lawsuits against good Samaritans who made mistakes in pursuit of
their good intentions. This resulted in security officers' normally
refusing to go outside a hotel's entrance and driveway to help
guests in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   It has a wrong-way sound to it, but a spokesman for the hotel
industry in Florida says hotels do not want their employees going
into the street to help people because of this liability issue. The
spokesman, Thomas A. Waits, president of the Florida Hotel and
Motel Association, said: ``Hotels have gone the extra mile, and
they can be held liable for these actions. Business does not win in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that with tort reform, good Samaritans would be
supported by law.
</P>
<P>
   Tort reform, a sticky political issue everywhere, is opposed by
law groups because it makes it tougher for consumers to sue
businesses. The Florida Legislature approved tort reform last year,
but it was vetoed by Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat. The new
governor, Jeb Bush, a Republican, has pledged himself to tort
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whalen said that when she talked to clerks in the hotel
afterward, she was told the area was unsafe at night. Although she
had earlier received directions from the hotel desk, that does not
create liability. Repeated calls to Doubletree management yielded
no response.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Robert M. Jarvis, an author of ``Travel Law, Cases and
Materials'' (Carolina Academic Press), said that hotels had won
cases in situations where concierges gave directions to places that
proved unsafe. ``Even though the hotel sets the trip in motion,''
said Jarvis, who teaches at Nova Southeastern University in Fort
Lauderdale, ``if it happens outside the perimeter, the hotel is not
liable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both stories remind travelers that although one's home may be
one's castle, one's hotel is not one's home. Costly jewelry should
be insured and not taken to hotels, and guests who suspect that an
area may be of doubtful safety should call for a cab.

TOURING LEBANON  
 LUGGAGE STORAGE IN MILAN

   Q. (italics)I want to visit Lebanon, but I don't speak Arabic.
Are there agents who handle guided tours of Lebanon? _ Brad John,
New York, N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. A 10-year ban on Americans' traveling to Lebanon was lifted
in 1997, and last summer President Clinton authorized airlines to
sell tickets to Beirut in the United States. But there are still no
direct flights to Lebanon, and the government is not encouraging
travel there.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the State Department said the recent announcements
``should not in any way be construed as a determination by the
Department of State that it is safe for Americans to travel to
Lebanon.'' The official travel warning says the southern suburbs of
Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   But a few agents are handling tours to Lebanon, a country that
was once a popular vacation spot and that is trying to rebuild its
tourism industry after a brutal civil war marked by terrorism
against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, for example, Kutrubes Travel in Boston, has
arranged two group tours and 10 individual trips to Lebanon,
according to Kathy Kutrubes, the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kutrubes said she went on her own group tour in November and
was ``pleasantly surprised'' at the sites and facilities. She saw a
lot of construction in Beirut, but noted that there were many
ruined buildings.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Kutrubes plans eight-day tours of Lebanon, which can
be doubled with a visit to Syria, departing April 15, May 12, Sept.
9, Oct. 7 and Nov. 4. Tour participants stay in Beirut at the
Napoleon Hotel or, for $200 more, the Summerland, and take daily
tours of the city and such sites as the Roman temples in Baalbeck,
the cedar forests of the north, the ancient city of Byblos and the
ruins at Tyre.
</P>
<P>
   The land price of $1,598 includes daily breakfast and several
other meals, transportation and guided tours. Air fares will be
about $900 to $1,200 more, Ms. Kutrubes said. Kutrubes Travel, 328
Tremont Street, Boston, Mass 02116; (800) 878-8566, fax (617)
426-3196.
</P>
<P>
   Also handling travel to Lebanon is Mill-Run Tours, 424 Madison
Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017, (800) 645-5786 and (212) 486-9840,
fax (212) 223-8129. According to George Villarino, director of
tours and cruises, Mill-Run's business to Lebanon has mostly been
as addenda to trips to Israel, Egypt, Syria or Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But he offers 12-day trips to Lebanon with group tours for about
$100 a day for ground costs, which includes daily breakfast, six
lunches and dinners, and admission to historic sites and museums.
Air transportation, usually on Air France, is extra. The tours are
usually in Arabic, French and English, Villarino said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q. (italics)I have got conflicting information about the
availability of short-term luggage storage at Central Station in
Milan, Italy. Have security precautions done away with lockers?
Will I have to rent a room for a half-day stopover to store my
bags? _ Bette A. Hahner, Westport, Conn.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Save your money for the Monte Napoleon fashion district or
for some fine Lombard cuisine rather than spending it on a room for
your bags. The Central Station in Milan has a luggage storage room
(``deposito bagagli''), where you can keep bags for about $2.85
each for 12 hours (at 1,754 lire to the dollar).
</P>
<P>
   The State Railway says that all major stations have such storage
areas. They shouldn't be too hard to find, since they are marked by
large signs with a baggage symbol. Many stations in Italy _ and
thus the storage areas _ close from about 1 to 5 or 6 a.m., but the
one in Milan is open 24 hours (though it doesn't accept bags from 1
to 4 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   These deposit rooms remained open even at the height of the
terrorism of the late 1970s and early 80s. In those years,
storage-room personnel were allowed to ask for identification and
even to open luggage for inspection. The few automated lockers in
train stations were removed.
</P>
<P>
   The self-storage lockers began to return in 1997 and 34 stations
now have some. But Milan is not one of the 34 (Rome's Termini
Station has the most, 441).
</P>
<P>
   You cannot reserve storage space at the deposit room, nor should
it be necessary, the office says. If you speak Italian and want
more information, you can call ahead to the Milan storage office at
(39-02) 6371-2212. The State Railway offers information numbers for
many stations on line at www.fs-online.com. &QL;

<P>
   Q. (italics)Four recent college graduates want to visit Germany
for Oktoberfest. How can we take in an occasional soccer match
while there? _ Bill Seibert, Lawrenceville, N.J.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Oktoberfest means Munich, which for a soccer fan is a rich
destination, with three teams in the Bundesliga, the national
league. Two of them, the perennial powerhouse Bayern Munich and the
less successful Munich 1860, play in the top division; both use the
63,000-seat Olympic Stadium for home games.
</P>
<P>
   According to the German National Tourist Office, there are no
agents selling advance tickets to matches of the Bundesliga. Mike
Woitalla, senior editor of Soccer America magazine, visited Germany
last year for some games and said getting tickets to league games
was rarely a problem.
</P>
<P>
   But an exception is Munich during Oktoberfest (this year, from
Sept. 18 to Oct. 3) _ so you should contact the clubs for tickets
(the cheapest are for standing room) well in advance. Here's where:
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich, 51 Saebener Strasse, 81547 Munich; (49-89)
699-310, fax (49-89) 644-165; www &QC; .bayernmuenchen.de. Current
prices are about $11 to $28, at 1.8 marks to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   TSV Munich 1860, Ticket Management, 114 Grunwalder Strasse,
81547 Munich; (49-89) 6427-8560, fax (49-89) 6427-8585;
www.tsv1860.de (German only). Tickets, available in August with a
Visa card number, cost about $16 to $38.
</P>
<P>
   The second-division club Unterhaching (which has a good chance
for promotion to the top division) plays in a 20,000-seat stadium
in the suburbs. SpVgg Unterhaching, 1 Am Sportpark, 82008
Unterhaching; (49-89) 6155-9160, fax (49-89) 6155-91688. Tickets
are $7 to $14, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bavarian option lies 95 miles north, where FC Nuremberg
plays in the 44,600-seat Frankenstadion. Contact it at 200
Valznerweiherstrasse, 90480 Nuremberg; (49-911) 940-790, fax
(49-911) 940-7977; www.1.fc.nuerenberg.com (German only). Tickets:
$22 to $47.

 &HT;    Exploratory panel adds to Bush sites on Web
 &HT;    By Austin American-Statesman staff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There's a crowd of George W. Bush Web sites
clogging the Internet these days. Add one more.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush exploratory committee has launched georgewbush.com, the
official site of Bush's test of the presidential waters.
</P>

<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the flawless center fielder for the New York
Yankees who, along with Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, symbolized the
team's dynastic greatness across the 20th century and whose 56-game
hitting streak in 1941 made him an instant and indelible American
folk hero, died early Monday at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio died shortly after midnight, nearly five months after
undergoing surgery for cancer of the lungs. He had spent 99 days in
the hospital while battling lung infections and pneumonia. He went
home on Jan. 19, alert but weak and with little hope of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's body was flown to Northern California for a funeral
Thursday and for burial in San Francisco, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has idolized and immortalized its 20th-century
heroes, from Charles Lindbergh to Elvis Presley, no one embodied
the American dream of fame and fortune or created a more enduring
legend than Joe DiMaggio. He became a figure of unequaled romance
and integrity in the national mind because of his consistent
professionalism on the baseball field, his marriage to the
Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, his devotion to her after her death,
and the pride and courtliness with which he carried himself
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio burst onto the baseball scene from San Francisco in the
1930s and grew into the game's most gallant and graceful center
fielder. He wore No. 5 and became the successor to Babe Ruth (No.
3) and Lou Gehrig (No. 4) in the team's pantheon. DiMaggio was the
team's superstar for 13 seasons, beginning in 1936 and ending in
1951, and appeared in 11 All-Star Games and 10 World Series. He
was, as Roy Blount Jr. once observed, ``the class of the Yankees in
times when the Yankees outclassed everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He was called the Yankee Clipper and was acclaimed at baseball's
centennial in 1969 as ``the greatest living ballplayer,'' the man
who in 1,736 games with the Yankees had a career batting average of
.325 and hit 361 home runs while striking out only 369 times, one
of baseball's most amazing statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's game was so complete and elegant that it
transcended statistics; as The New York Times said in an editorial
when he retired, ``The combination of proficiency and exquisite
grace which Joe DiMaggio brought to the art of playing center field
was something no baseball averages can measure and that must be
seen to be believed and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   At his peak, he was serenaded as ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio'' and
summoned as ``the great DiMaggio'' by Ernest Hemingway in ``The Old
Man and the Sea.'' He was mentioned in dozens of films and Broadway
shows; the sailors in ``South Pacific'' sing that Bloody Mary's
skin is ``tender as DiMaggio's glove.'' Years later he was
remembered by Paul Simon, who wondered with everybody else, ``Where
have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? Our nation turns its lonely eyes to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   When injuries eroded his skills and he could no longer perform
to his own standard, he turned his back on his $100,000 salary _ he
and his rival Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox then drew the
largest paychecks in sports _ and retired in 1951 with the dignity
that remained his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio joined the Yankees in 1936, missed three years while he
served in the Army Air Forces in World War II, then returned and
played through the 1951 season, when Mickey Mantle arrived to open
yet another era in the remarkable run of Yankee success. In his 13
seasons, DiMaggio went to bat 6,821 times in 1,736 regular-season
games, got 2,214 hits for a .325 average, hit 361 home runs,
knocked in 1,537 runs, amassed 3,948 total bases and reached base
just under 40 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Three times DiMaggio was voted his league's most valuable
player: in 1939, 1941 and 1947. In 1941, the magical season of his
56-game hitting streak, he won the award even though Williams hit
.406.
</P>
<P>
   In each of his first four seasons with the Yankees, DiMaggio
played in the World Series, and the Yankees won all four. He
appeared in the Series 10 times in 13 seasons over all, and nine
times the Yankees won. And although he failed to get enough votes
to make the baseball Hall of Fame when he became eligible in 1953,
perhaps because his aloofness had alienated some of the writers who
did the voting, he sailed into Cooperstown two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Dimaggio married an actress, Dorothy Arnold. In October
1941, his only child, Joe Jr., was born. He is survived by his son;
his brother, Dominic; two granddaughters and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1942, DiMaggio enlisted in the Army Air Forces and
spent the next three years teaching baseball in the service. Along
with other baseball stars like Bob Feller and Williams, he resumed
his career as soon as the war ended, returning to the Yankees for
the 1946 season and a year later leading them back into the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   His legend took a storybook turn in 1952, the year after he
retired from the Yankees, when DiMaggio, whose marriage to Dorothy
Arnold had ended in divorce in 1944, arranged a dinner date with
Marilyn Monroe in California. They were married in San Francisco on
Jan. 14, 1954, and spent nine months trying to reconcile their
differences before they divorced in October. DiMaggio always seemed
tortured by Monroe's sex goddess image. He protested loudly during
the making of Billy Wilder's ``The Seven Year Itch'' when the
script called for her to cool herself over a subway grate while a
sudden wind blew her skirts up high.
</P>
<P>
   But when the actress seemed on the verge of an emotional
collapse in 1961, DiMaggio brought her to the Yankees' training
camp in Florida for rest and support. And when she died of an
overdose of barbiturates at the age of 36 on Aug. 4, 1962, he took
charge of her funeral and for the next 20 years sent roses three
times a week to her crypt in the Westwood section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For some years he lived in San Francisco with his widowed sister
Marie in a house in the Marina District that he had bought for his
parents in 1939 and that he and his sister had both shared with
Marilyn Monroe. When the damp San Francisco climate troubled the
arthritis in his back, he began to spend most of his time in
Florida, where he established his home. He played golf and made
selected excursions to Europe and the Far East, where the demand
for his appearance and his autograph returned high dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to take the most pleasure in establishing a
children's wing, called the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, at
Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. And he seemed to
relish the invitations back to Yankee Stadium, where he frequently
threw out the first ball on Opening Day, tall but slightly stooped,
dressed elegantly, as always, in a dark business suit, walking to
the mound and lobbing one to the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was there on the day the season ended last year, as the
Yankees set a team record with their 114th victory, that he was
acclaimed on yet another Joe DiMaggio Day, the timeless hero and
the symbol of Yankee excellence, acknowledging the cheers of Yankee
players and fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of cheering that accompanied him through life
and that he had quietly come to expect. It recalled the time when
he and Marilyn Monroe, soon after their wedding, took a trip to
Tokyo. She continued on to entertain American troops in Korea, and
said with fascination when she returned, ``Joe, you've never heard
such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   And DiMaggio replied softly, ``Yes, I have.''

 &HT;    Latest search for Haitian survivors unsuccessful
 &HT;    By Mary Lou Pickel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The pleas of Haitian community leaders
in Miami prompted the U.S Coast Guard to launch a final search
Monday for 38 Haitian immigrants feared drowned in a weekend
smuggling disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But by 9 p.m. rescuers scanning the Atlantic Ocean as far north
as Cape Canaveral found no sign of survivors or bodies, and the
Coast Guard called off the search, Petty Officer Chet Darvy said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Moise, a major in the U.S. Air Force Reserve who is of
Haitian descent, accompanied the Coast Guard jet on its search.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers fear as many as 40 immigrants drowned Saturday as two
boats carrying 43 people sank 26 miles east of West Palm Beach in
what could be the worst smuggling catastrophe in Florida history.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members on a passing freighter reported hearing screams
from the water around 2 a.m. Saturday. The Coast Guard rescued
three men clinging to wreckage between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. Saturday.
They also recovered two bodies, Darvy said, and saw two more but
were unable to retrieve them.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators at the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's office
are waiting for documents found on the two dead bodies to dry
before they try to identify them, a receptionist said.
</P>
<P>
   Fremiaud Basse, a bulldozer operator from Lake Worth, fears his
21-year-old girlfriend, Guerline Joseph, is among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Basse, 44, who has a green card, planned to apply for American
citizenship and bring Joseph to the United States as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He last saw Joseph on a visit to Haiti three months ago, he
said. ``Wait for me,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Haiti and somebody (told) me my girlfriend is on the
boat,'' Basse said Monday, while waiting with others for news at
the Haitian-American Community Council in Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Joseph, 35, of Pompano Beach and no relation to Guerline,
sought information on his nephew, Joel Estiverne, 21. A cousin
called Joseph Saturday night from Haiti to tell him Estiverne was
on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph was angry that the Coast Guard had discontinued its
search Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they'd do that to these people,'' he said. ``I
would like to bury him.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Bullock, head of the West Palm Beach Border Patrol Office,
defended the Coast Guard's decision to call off the earlier,
2,600-square-mile search. No one on board the two boats had a life
jacket, Bullock said, and it is unlikely anyone would have survived
past Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bodies, the swift Gulf Stream would have moved them
far away. ``They're up in Charleston, South Carolina, by now,''
Bullock said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard used night vision equipment to find the
survivors, Bullock said. One survivor waved a flashlight at
rescuers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only reason they saw him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the survivors are at Krome Detention Center south of
Miami and a third, Yvon Pierre-Louis, remained hospitalized in good
condition Monday at Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm
Beach. Border Patrol agents spoke to him once and planned to
interview him again today.
</P>
<P>
   The boats left from St. Marc, Haiti, for the Bahamas a week ago
and stopped in the Bahamas to rest on Thursday. They were expected
to reach the United States Friday night, according to a relative of
someone believed to be on board.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe smugglers were involved, but the survivors
would not say who set up the operation, investigator Kevin Douglas
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financing (of smuggling) takes place here with
relatives,'' Bullock said. ``Hopefully, relatives will come forward
and give us information on who the arrangers are.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniella Henry, director of the Haitian-American Community
Council, said the smuggling won't stop until political and economic
conditions in Haiti improve.
</P>
<P>
   Guerline Joseph, for one, was anxious to come to the United
States, Basse said.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw her the last time in Port Au Prince, she asked him,
``Hey, Basse, what are you going to do for me?'' Basse said.
</P>
<P>
   The two wrote many letters in their two-year courtship, he said,
and she sent him a photograph of herself, which he held in his hand
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the back she wrote, ``If you read this, you will think of
me.''
</P>

U.S. FIRES NUCLEAR SCIENTIST SUSPECTED OF SPYING FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to rewrite top eight graphs and expand with 8 grafs at

 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Taiwan-born scientist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory was fired Monday for security breaches after the FBI
questioned him about China's theft of American nuclear secrets,
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was questioned for three days by the
FBI, starting last Friday, but ``stonewalled'' during the
questioning, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a computer scientist who had been working in the nuclear
weapons design area at Los Alamos, has not been charged with any
crime, but he has been identified by federal officials as the prime
suspect in the spying.
</P>
<P>
   China has denied any such theft took place. But administration
officials said China, working with stolen data, has made a leap in
developing nuclear weapons with much smaller warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The handling of the espionage matter brought sharp criticism
from Capitol Hill. Sen. Fred Thompson, an influential Republican,
representing Tennessee, attacked the Clinton administration Monday
for failing to notify Congress in late 1997 that China had stolen
nuclear secrets when the administration certified that Beijing was
no longer helping other nations build nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   That certification lifted a 12-year ban on the sale of American
nuclear technology to China, an action long sought by American
companies eager to bid on the estimated $60 billion Chinese market
for civilian nuclear plants.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The FBI began to question Lee on Friday in an attempt to
determine whether he had passed American secrets to the Chinese.
The questioning continued through late Sunday, but Lee failed to
fully cooperate, said Richardson, who dismissed Lee on Monday,
after receiving permission from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials acknowledged last week that they did not have
enough to arrest Lee then, but hoped their questioning would lead
to a break. While he agreed to talk with investigators and nuclear
experts, his failure to fully cooperate has apparently still left
the investigators without enough evidence to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson believed he had sufficient evidence to dismiss
Lee. He was dismissed for ``failure to properly notify Energy
Department and laboratory officials about contacts with people from
a sensitive country, specific instances of failing to properly
safeguard classified material, and apparently attempting to deceive
lab officials about security matters,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at their home in Los Alamos, N.M., on Monday afternoon,
Lee's wife, Sylvia, a former secretary at the lab, refused to give
his whereabouts or comment on the matter. Lee, who officials said
is in his late 50s and has been working at Los Alamos for more than
a decade, did not hire an attorney to represent him during his
interviews with the FBI, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been the prime suspect in a nearly three-year FBI
investigation, code-named ``Kindred Spirit,'' into Beijing's theft
of U.S. nuclear technology from Los Alamos, senior officials from
the bureau and the Energy Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, China's nuclear weapons designs were a
generation behind those of the United States, largely because
Beijing had been unable to produce small warheads that could be
launched from a single missile at multiple targets.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, China had built and tested such small
bombs, a breakthrough officials say was accelerated by the Los
Alamos theft.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage is believed to have occurred in the 1980s,
officials said, but was not detected until 1995, when American
experts from Los Alamos analyzing Chinese nuclear test results
found similarities to America's most advanced miniature warhead,
the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   By February 1996, investigators from the Energy Department and
the FBI, searching travel records and other data at Los Alamos and
other U.S. weapons labs, had identified five possible suspects,
officials said. Lee quickly emerged as the prime suspect, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now believe that Lee gave the Chinese sensitive
nuclear detonation information during a 1988 seminar, senior
administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But after opening a formal criminal investigation in June 1996,
the FBI did not at first aggressively pursue the espionage case,
according to several senior U.S. officials familiar with the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last several weeks, after prodding from Congress and
the Energy secretary, did government officials administer lie
detector tests to Lee. After a first test was administered in
December, the FBI, unsatisfied with those results, gave Lee a
second test in February, and on that test he was found to be
deceptive, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI decided to interview Lee last Friday after he failed the
polygraph, or lie detector test, in February, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism over their handling of the case, FBI
officials say that Chinese spy activities are far more difficult to
investigate than the more traditional espionage operations of the
former Soviet Union. The Chinese often take advantage of scientific
exchanges and many other forms of informal contacts, gathering
sensitive information from such a wide range of sources that it is
often difficult to pinpoint exactly how American secrets leaked
out.

 WASHINGTON: leaked out.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have concluded that Beijing is
continuing to steal secrets from the Government's major nuclear
weapons laboratories, which had been increasingly opened to foreign
visitors after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, since the theft of the W-88 design information
apparently occurred so far in the past, the Justice Department at
first lacked the grounds to obtain a secret wiretap on the suspect,
making it difficult initially to build a strong criminal case,
according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Energy Department failed to move Lee out of his
sensitive position, or remove his security clearances, for more
than a year after FBI Director Louis J. Freeh told Energy officials
in September, 1997 that there was no longer any investigative
reason to keep him in place. In espionage cases, the FBI often
wants suspects left alone by their employers for fear of tipping
them off to their investigations. He was finally moved out of a
sensitive area several weeks ago, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's wife, Sylvia, quit her secretarial job at the lab sometime
in the last year or two, Energy Department officials said. FBI and
Energy Department officials said that Lee's wife's activities had
raised questions while she worked at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, she was invited to China to give an academic
paper on parallel processing _ even though she was only a secretary
at Los Alamos. Her husband, who was the true expert, accompanied
her, according to a U.S. official. In addition, Energy Department
officials said co-workers at Los Alamos questioned the fact that
she frequently ``inserted herself'' into gatherings at the lab with
visiting Chinese delegations.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI officials said that she was not a target of their
investigation. FBI officials have said it is possible that others
were involved in the theft of nuclear secrets from Los Alamos, but
they have not yet identified other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in response to criticism of the lax security at Los
Alamos and other national weapons labs owned by the Department of
Energy, Richardson said Monday he is ordering that about 700 Energy
Department and laboratory employees be required to take periodic
polygraph examinations. The order does not cover all Energy and lab
employees with so-called ``Q'' security clearances giving them
access to nuclear secrets, Richardson said, but does cover those
who work in the most sensitive areas. Currently, only employees of
the CIA are required to submit to polygraph exams on a regular
basis.

 &HT;    FDA announces voluntary recall of products linked to typhoid
patients
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General News and (l)
Lifestyle/Science-Medicine categories.)
 &HT;    By Peter Donald
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Citing evidence linking a frozen
tropical fruit to a typhoid fever outbreak in Florida, the Food and
Drug Administration on Monday announced a ``voluntary nationwide
recall'' of frozen mamey products distributed under two brand
names.
</P>
<P>
   Distributors agreed to recall the El Sembrador and La Fe brands
after those brands were found in the refrigerators of 13 people
with confirmed typhoid fever or in restaurants where they ate, the
FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency warns consumers not to eat the recalled frozen mamey,
typically used to make shakes popular in the Hispanic community.
And officials urged consumers who have bought the recalled brands
to return them for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   The state agriculture department had already stopped the brands'
sale in Florida, but the FDA said they were still available in 13
other states until it announced the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Typhoid fever, a bacterial disease that can be treated with
antibiotics, can cause sustained fever, headache, constipation and
loss of appetite. Fifteen suspected or confirmed cases have been
reported in Florida since late December _three of them among Palm
Beach County residents.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen in the frozen mamey industry said that the FDA's
conclusions were unscientific and that the recall unfairly targeted
just two of the brands on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Several hypothesized that the frozen mamey could have been
contaminated when it was processed and packaged in Guatemala. They
said that when Hurricane Mitch flooded Central America last year,
water used for crop irrigation became tainted.So other brands
supplied by Guatemala could also be affected, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the source is the problem, then anyone who was in any way
related to the source should be affected by the recall,'' said Luis
Hernandez, president of Miami-based El Sembrador, which distributes
more than 350 Hispanic food products.
</P>
<P>
   He also complained that the FDA had declined to give out test
results unless he filed a written request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they so secretive?'' he asked in frustration. ``I
can't get any information from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and others also questioned whether singling out the
two brands is warranted when tests have failed to isolate
Salmonella typhi _ the bacteria that causes typhoid fever _ in any
of the confiscated product samples.
</P>
<P>
   State agricultural officials have yet to find any typhoid fever
germs on the products. But they said the germs may have been
difficult to pinpoint because some samples were so infested with E.
coli bacteria _ a sign of fecal contamination. One official
described the frozen mamey products as ``filthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Leal of Jagua Trading in Miami, which is also affected by
the recall, said the contamination probably stemmed from unsanitary
water in the wake of last year's storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in this business for 25 years and this is the
first time this has happened,'' Leal said.
</P>
<P>
   Jagua Trading sells frozen mamey produced by Agrodex of
Guatemala to El Sembrador, La Fe, other firms and retailers. The
recall affects the 5-pound, clear plastic bags that Jagua markets
to retailers without a brand name: Its label reads ``Mamey, Mammea
americana, Product of Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a voluntary recall on their (the FDA's) word,''
Leal said. ``The last thing I want to do is hurt the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Leal said his company has already lost half a million dollars
because of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA official said the agency zeroed in on the products after
they were connected to the typhoid fever outbreak in an
investigation by the Miami-Dade County Health Department. The
investigation found that people who got sick were far more likely
to have eaten frozen mamey than healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   The government and the companies had a responsibility to protect
the public from any further outbreak by pursuing a recall, the FDA
official said.

 &HT;    Florida stone circle may be 'culturally, archaeologically
significant'
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Charcoal at the Miami Circle dates to the
Mayan era _ approximately 2,000 years ago _ according to
carbon-dating results to be presented to Gov. Jeb Bush and the
Florida Cabinet today.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the Cabinet are scheduled to vote today on whether to
approve $2 million or more in state money to help preserve the
stone circle found at a Dade County development site. The results
make eventual approval more likely, Cabinet aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the circle is related to Mayan culture, attorney
and archeologist Harvey Oyer in West Palm Beach said a date that
old means the site may well prove to be ``the most culturally and
archaeologically significant pre-Colombian site in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Testing firm Beta Analytic Inc. of Miami put the age of two
charcoal samples from the site at between 365 B.C. and 415 A.D.,
according to a letter written by lab director Darden G. Hood and
shown Monday to state officials. The dates are consistent with the
time Mayan culture existed in Mexico, Belize and Guatemala, keeping
alive the possibility that the circle is somehow linked to Mayan
civilization, Oyer said. Artifacts of volcanic rock found at the
site raised the Mayan possibility earlier. A number of scholars say
it's unlikely Mayans lived in Florida and explain it by trade
between Mayans and Tequesta Indians or other native populations
capable of travel.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the circle may shed light on how people lived in
Florida at the time of Jesus. Bones and other objects show humans
existed for more than 20,000 years in Florida, yet there are few
clues about the culture of peoples in the state before the Spanish
came in the 1500s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was on that site 2,000 years ago burning something,
whether it was a campfire, or tanning leather, or something else,
and that is significant,'' Oyer said. ``If the stones were there at
the same time the charcoal was produced, and not added later,
that's even more significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The stones may suggest some kind of religious or trading center
near the mouth of the Miami River.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Ron Silver, D-Miami, said he opposes the state's
spending any money until more is known. At issue is whether
government _ state, local or federal _ should be allowed to stop a
developer who stands to lose money on his investment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be briefed on the issue this morning and has not
indicated a position on the issue, a spokesman said. Aides believe
the Cabinet is leaning toward approving the money, but with plenty
of strings attached _ such as requiring more information and
research _ so that nothing is likely to happen quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner Tom Gallagher said he will support the
plan as long as the state is not taking on the financial burden by
itself, but is a partner with Miami-Dade County and others.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the flawless center fielder for the New York
Yankees who, along with Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, symbolized the
team's dynastic greatness across the 20th century and whose 56-game
hitting streak in 1941 made him an instant and indelible American
folk hero, died early Monday at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio died shortly after midnight, nearly five months after
undergoing surgery for cancer of the lungs. He had spent 99 days in
the hospital while battling lung infections and pneumonia. He went
home on Jan. 19, alert but weak and with little hope of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's body was flown to Northern California for a funeral
Thursday and for burial in San Francisco, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has idolized and immortalized its 20th-century
heroes, from Charles Lindbergh to Elvis Presley, no one embodied
the American dream of fame and fortune or created a more enduring
legend than Joe DiMaggio. He became a figure of unequaled romance
and integrity in the national mind because of his consistent
professionalism on the baseball field, his marriage to the
Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, his devotion to her after her death,
and the pride and courtliness with which he carried himself
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio burst onto the baseball scene from San Francisco in the
1930s and grew into the game's most gallant and graceful center
fielder. He wore No. 5 and became the successor to Babe Ruth (No.
3) and Lou Gehrig (No. 4) in the team's pantheon. DiMaggio was the
team's superstar for 13 seasons, beginning in 1936 and ending in
1951, and appeared in 11 All-Star Games and 10 World Series. He
was, as Roy Blount Jr. once observed, ``the class of the Yankees in
times when the Yankees outclassed everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He was called the Yankee Clipper and was acclaimed at baseball's
centennial in 1969 as ``the greatest living ballplayer,'' the man
who in 1,736 games with the Yankees had a career batting average of
.325 and hit 361 home runs while striking out only 369 times, one
of baseball's most amazing statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's game was so complete and elegant that it
transcended statistics; as The New York Times said in an editorial
when he retired, ``The combination of proficiency and exquisite
grace which Joe DiMaggio brought to the art of playing center field
was something no baseball averages can measure and that must be
seen to be believed and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   At his peak, he was serenaded as ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio'' and
summoned as ``the great DiMaggio'' by Ernest Hemingway in ``The Old
Man and the Sea.'' He was mentioned in dozens of films and Broadway
shows; the sailors in ``South Pacific'' sing that Bloody Mary's
skin is ``tender as DiMaggio's glove.'' Years later he was
remembered by Paul Simon, who wondered with everybody else, ``Where
have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? Our nation turns its lonely eyes to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   When injuries eroded his skills and he could no longer perform
to his own standard, he turned his back on his $100,000 salary _ he
and his rival Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox then drew the
largest paychecks in sports _ and retired in 1951 with the dignity
that remained his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio joined the Yankees in 1936, missed three years while he
served in the Army Air Forces in World War II, then returned and
played through the 1951 season, when Mickey Mantle arrived to open
yet another era in the remarkable run of Yankee success. In his 13
seasons, DiMaggio went to bat 6,821 times in 1,736 regular-season
games, got 2,214 hits for a .325 average, hit 361 home runs,
knocked in 1,537 runs, amassed 3,948 total bases and reached base
just under 40 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Three times DiMaggio was voted his league's most valuable
player: in 1939, 1941 and 1947. In 1941, the magical season of his
56-game hitting streak, he won the award even though Williams hit
.406.
</P>
<P>
   In each of his first four seasons with the Yankees, DiMaggio
played in the World Series, and the Yankees won all four. He
appeared in the Series 10 times in 13 seasons over all, and nine
times the Yankees won. And although he failed to get enough votes
to make the baseball Hall of Fame when he became eligible in 1953,
perhaps because his aloofness had alienated some of the writers who
did the voting, he sailed into Cooperstown two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Dimaggio married an actress, Dorothy Arnold. In October
1941, his only child, Joe Jr., was born. He is survived by his son;
his brother, Dominic; two granddaughters and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1942, DiMaggio enlisted in the Army Air Forces and
spent the next three years teaching baseball in the service. Along
with other baseball stars like Bob Feller and Williams, he resumed
his career as soon as the war ended, returning to the Yankees for
the 1946 season and a year later leading them back into the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   His legend took a storybook turn in 1952, the year after he
retired from the Yankees, when DiMaggio, whose marriage to Dorothy
Arnold had ended in divorce in 1944, arranged a dinner date with
Marilyn Monroe in California. They were married in San Francisco on
Jan. 14, 1954, and spent nine months trying to reconcile their
differences before they divorced in October. DiMaggio always seemed
tortured by Monroe's sex goddess image. He protested loudly during
the making of Billy Wilder's ``The Seven Year Itch'' when the
script called for her to cool herself over a subway grate while a
sudden wind blew her skirts up high.
</P>
<P>
   But when the actress seemed on the verge of an emotional
collapse in 1961, DiMaggio brought her to the Yankees' training
camp in Florida for rest and support. And when she died of an
overdose of barbiturates at the age of 36 on Aug. 4, 1962, he took
charge of her funeral and for the next 20 years sent roses three
times a week to her crypt in the Westwood section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For some years he lived in San Francisco with his widowed sister
Marie in a house in the Marina District that he had bought for his
parents in 1939 and that he and his sister had both shared with
Marilyn Monroe. When the damp San Francisco climate troubled the
arthritis in his back, he began to spend most of his time in
Florida, where he established his home. He played golf and made
selected excursions to Europe and the Far East, where the demand
for his appearance and his autograph returned high dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to take the most pleasure in establishing a
children's wing, called the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, at
Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. And he seemed to
relish the invitations back to Yankee Stadium, where he frequently
threw out the first ball on Opening Day, tall but slightly stooped,
dressed elegantly, as always, in a dark business suit, walking to
the mound and lobbing one to the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was there on the day the season ended last year, as the
Yankees set a team record with their 114th victory, that he was
acclaimed on yet another Joe DiMaggio Day, the timeless hero and
the symbol of Yankee excellence, acknowledging the cheers of Yankee
players and fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of cheering that accompanied him through life
and that he had quietly come to expect. It recalled the time when
he and Marilyn Monroe, soon after their wedding, took a trip to
Tokyo. She continued on to entertain American troops in Korea, and
said with fascination when she returned, ``Joe, you've never heard
such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   And DiMaggio replied softly, ``Yes, I have.''

<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the flawless center fielder for the New York
Yankees who, along with Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, symbolized the
team's dynastic greatness across the 20th century and whose 56-game
hitting streak in 1941 made him an instant and indelible American
folk hero, died early Monday at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio died shortly after midnight, nearly five months after
undergoing surgery for cancer of the lungs. He had spent 99 days in
the hospital while battling lung infections and pneumonia, and his
illness generated a national vigil as he was reported near death
several times. He went home on Jan. 19, alert but weak and with
little hope of surviving. Several family members and close friends
were at his bedside Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's body was flown to Northern California for a funeral
Thursday and for burial in San Francisco, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has idolized and immortalized its 20th-century
heroes, from Charles Lindbergh to Elvis Presley, no one embodied
the American dream of fame and fortune or created a more enduring
legend than Joe DiMaggio. He became a figure of unequaled romance
and integrity in the national mind because of his consistent
professionalism on the baseball field, his marriage to the
Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, his devotion to her after her death,
and the pride and courtliness with which he carried himself
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio burst onto the baseball scene from San Francisco in the
1930s and grew into the game's most gallant and graceful center
fielder. He wore No. 5 and became the successor to Babe Ruth (No.
3) and Lou Gehrig (No. 4) in the team's pantheon. DiMaggio was the
team's superstar for 13 seasons, beginning in 1936 and ending in
1951, and appeared in 11 All-Star Games and 10 World Series. He
was, as Roy Blount Jr. once observed, ``the class of the Yankees in
times when the Yankees outclassed everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He was called the Yankee Clipper and was acclaimed at baseball's
centennial in 1969 as ``the greatest living ballplayer,'' the man
who in 1,736 games with the Yankees had a career batting average of
.325 and hit 361 home runs while striking out only 369 times, one
of baseball's most amazing statistics. (By way of comparison,
Mickey Mantle had 536 homers and struck out 1,710 times; Reggie
Jackson slugged 563 homers and struck out 2,597 times.)
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's game was so complete and elegant that it
transcended statistics; as The New York Times said in an editorial
when he retired, ``The combination of proficiency and exquisite
grace which Joe DiMaggio brought to the art of playing center field
was something no baseball averages can measure and that must be
seen to be believed and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio glided across the vast expanse of center field at
Yankee Stadium with such incomparable grace that long after he
stopped playing, the memory of him in full stride remains
evergreen. He disdained theatrical flourishes and exaggerated
moves, never climbing walls to make catches and rarely diving
headlong. He got to the ball just as it fell into his glove, making
the catch seem inevitable, almost preordained. The writer Wilfred
Sheed wrote, ``In dreams I can still see him gliding after fly
balls as if he were skimming the surface of the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   His batting stance was as graceful as his outfield stride. He
stood flat-footed at the plate with his feet spread well apart, his
bat held still just off his right shoulder. When he swung, his
left, or front, foot moved only slightly foward. His swing was pure
and flowing with an incredible follow-through; Casey Stengel said,
``He made the rest of them look like plumbers.''
</P>
<P>
   At his peak, he was serenaded as ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio'' by Les
Brown and saluted as ``the great DiMaggio'' by Ernest Hemingway in
``The Old Man and the Sea.'' He was mentioned in dozens of films
and Broadway shows; the sailors in ``South Pacific'' sing that
Bloody Mary's skin is ``tender as DiMaggio's glove.'' Years later
he was remembered by Paul Simon, who wondered with everybody else,
``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? Our nation turns its lonely
eyes to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to anything written, spoken or sung about him, he
confessed that he was puzzled by Simon's lyrics and sought an
answer when he met Simon in a restaurant in New York. ``I asked
Paul what the song meant, whether it was derogatory,'' DiMaggio
recalled. ``He explained it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When injuries eroded his skills and he could no longer perform
to his own standard, he turned his back on his $100,000 salary _ he
and his rival Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox then drew the
largest paychecks in sports _ and retired in 1951 with the dignity
that remained his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   His stormy marriage to Marilyn Monroe lasted less than a year,
but they remained one of America's ultimate romantic fantasies: the
tall, dark and handsome baseball hero wooing and winning the woman
who epitomized Hollywood beauty, glamour and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   He was private and remote. Even Monroe, at their divorce
proceedings, said he was given to black moods and would tell her,
``Leave me alone.'' He once said, with disdain, that he kept track
of all the books written about his storied life without his
consent, and by the late 1990s knew that the count had passed 33.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he could be proud, reclusive and vain in such a composed,
almost studied way that his reclusiveness contributed to his
mystique. In the book ``Summer of '49,'' David Halberstam wrote
that DiMaggio ``guards his special status carefully, wary of doing
anything that might tarnish his special reputation. He tends to
avoid all those who might define him in some way other than the way
he defined himself on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio joined the Yankees in 1936, missed three years while he
served in the Army Air Forces in World War II, then returned and
played through the 1951 season, when Mickey Mantle arrived to open
yet another era in the remarkable run of Yankee success. In his 13
seasons, DiMaggio went to bat 6,821 times, got 2,214 hits, knocked
in 1,537 runs, amassed 3,948 total bases and reached base just
under 40 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, baseball fans argued over who was the better pure
hitter, DiMaggio or Williams. Long after they had both retired,
Williams said: ``In my heart, I always felt I was a better hitter
than Joe. But I have to say, he was the greatest baseball player of
our time. He could do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did it all with a sureness and coolness that seemed to
imply an utter lack of emotion. DiMaggio was once asked why he did
not vent his frustrations on the field by kicking a bag or tossing
a bat. The outfielder, who chain-smoked cigarettes and had suffered
from ulcers, replied: ``I can't. It wouldn't look right.''
</P>
<P>
   But he betrayed his sensitivity in a memorable gesture of
annoyance in the sixth game of the 1947 World Series after his long
drive was run down and caught in front of the 415-foot sign in
left-center field at Yankee Stadium by Al Gionfriddo of the
Brooklyn Dodgers. As DiMaggio rounded first base, he saw Gionfriddo
make the catch and, with his head down, kicked the dirt. The angry
gesture was so shocking that it made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In the field, DiMaggio ran down long drives with a gliding
stride and deep range. In 1947, he tied what was then the American
League fielding record for outfielders by making only one error in
141 games. He also had one of the most powerful and precise
throwing arms in the business and was credited with 153 assists in
his 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime manager, Joe McCarthy, once touched on another
DiMaggio skill. ``He was the best base runner I ever saw,''
McCarthy said. ``He could have stolen 50, 60 bases a year if I let
him. He wasn't the fastest man alive. He just knew how to run bases
better than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Three times DiMaggio was voted his league's most valuable
player: in 1939, 1941 and 1947. In 1941, the magical season of his
56-game hitting streak, he won the award even though Williams hit
.406.
</P>
<P>
   In each of his first four seasons with the Yankees, DiMaggio
played in the World Series, and the Yankees won all four. He
appeared in the Series 10 times in 13 seasons over all, and nine
times the Yankees won. And although he failed to get enough votes
to make the baseball Hall of Fame when he became eligible in 1953,
perhaps because his aloofness had alienated some of the writers who
did the voting, he sailed into Cooperstown two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Whitey Ford was a rookie pitcher in 1950 when he first saw Joe
DiMaggio, and he later remembered: ``I just stared at the man for
about a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Paul DiMaggio was born on Nov. 25, 1914, in Martinez,
Calif., a small fishing village 25 miles northeast of the Golden
Gate. He was the fourth son and the eighth of nine children born to
Giuseppe Paolo and Rosalie DiMaggio, who had immigrated to America
in 1898 from Sicily. His father was a fisherman who moved his
family to North Beach, the heavily Italian section near the San
Francisco waterfront, the year Joe was born.
</P>
<P>
   The two oldest sons, Tom and Michael, joined their father as
fishermen; Michael later fell off his boat and drowned. But the
three other sons became major league outfielders by way of the
sandlots of San Francisco. Vince, four years older than Joe, played
11 seasons with five teams and led the National League in
strikeouts six times. Dominic, three years younger than Joe, was
known as the Little Professor because he wore eyeglasses when he
played 10 seasons with the Boston Red Sox, hitting .298 for his
career. Of the three, Joe was the natural.
</P>
<P>
   He started as a shortstop in the Boys Club League when he was
14, dropped out of Galileo High School after one year and joined
Vince on the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, the
highest level of minor-league baseball. It was late in 1932, and
Joe was still 17 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, in his first full season with the Seals, he hit
.340 with 28 home runs and knocked in 169 runs in 187 games. He
also hit safely in 61 games in a row, eight years before he made
history in the big leagues by hitting in 56. He tore up the league
during the next two seasons, hitting .341 and .398. But he injured
his left knee stepping out of a cab while hurrying to dinner at his
sister's house after a Sunday doubleheader and was considered
damaged goods by most of the teams in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   He got his chance at the majors because two scouts, Joe Devine
and Bill Essick, persisted in recommending him to the Yankees. The
general manager, Ed Barrow, talked it over with his colleagues. And
for $25,000 plus five players, the Yankees bought him from the
Seals.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was left in San Francisco for the 1935 season to heal
his knee and put the finishing touches on his game, then was
brought up to New York in 1936 to join a talented team that
included Lou Gehrig, Bill Dickey, Tony Lazzeri, Red Rolfe, Red
Ruffing and Lefty Gomez. It was two years after Babe Ruth had left,
and an era of success had ended.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the rookie from California was arriving with a contract
for $8,500, and a new era was beginning. It was delayed because of
a foot injury, but DiMaggio made his debut on May 3 against the St.
Louis Browns. He went on to play 138 games, got 206 hits with 29
home runs, batted .325 and drove in 125 runs. In the fall, the
Yankees made the first of four straight trips to the World Series _
they would go on to play in 23 out of 29 Series through 1964 _ and
the rookie hit .346 against the Giants and made a spectacular catch
in deepest center field in the Polo Grounds before a marveling
crowd of 43,543, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's luster was sometimes dimmed by salary disputes. In
1937 he hit .346 with 46 home runs and 167 RBI and the following
year he held out for $40,000, but was forced to sign for $25,000.
DiMaggio's holdout lasted a couple of weeks into the season; when
he returned, he was booed. When he began the 1941 season, he had
missed four of his first five openers because of injury or salary
fights, and many fans resented it. ``He got hurt early in his
career, more than he ever let on,'' Phil Rizzuto once said.
</P>
<P>
   He also had to endure the casual bigotry that existed when he
first came up. Many of his teammates called him the Big Dago, and
Life magazine, in a 1939 article intending to compliment him, said:
``Although he learned Italian first, Joe, now 24, speaks English
without an accent, and is otherwise well adapted to most U.S.
mores. Instead of olive oil or smelly bear grease he keeps his hair
slick with water. He never reeks of garlic and prefers chicken chow
mein to spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   But he energized the fans by leading the league in hitting in
1939 (at .381) and again in 1940 (with .352). Then in 1941, he put
together what has since been known simply as The Streak, and
fashioned perhaps the most enduring record in sports. Streaks were
nothing new to DiMaggio. He had hit in those 61 straight games for
the Seals, in 18 straight as a rookie with the Yankees, in 22
straight the next year and in 23 straight the year after that. In
fact, in 1941, he hit safely in the last 19 games in spring
training, and he kept hitting for eight more games after the
regular season opened.
</P>
<P>
   The Streak began on May 15, 1941, with a single in four times at
bat against the Chicago White Sox. The next day, he hit a triple
and a home run. Two weeks later, he had a swollen neck but still
hit three singles and a home run in Washington. The next week
against the St. Louis Browns, he went 3 for 5 in one game, then 4
for 8 in a doubleheader the next day with a double and three home
runs. His streak stood at 24.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, he broke the Yankees' club record of 29 games. On
June 26, he was hitless with two out in the eighth inning against
the Browns, but he doubled, and his streak reached 38. On June 29,
a doubleheader against Washington, DiMaggio lined a double in the
first game to tie George Sisler's modern major league record of
hitting in 41 straight games and then broke Sisler's record in the
second game by lining a single. On July 1, with a clean single
against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, he matched Willie Keeler's
major league record of 44 games, set in 1897 when foul balls didn't
count as strikes. The next day he broke it with a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   As DiMaggio kept hitting safely, radio announcers kept an
excited America informed, Bojangles Robinson danced on the Yankee
dugout roof at the Stadium for good luck and Les Brown recorded
``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio ... we want you on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Streak finally ended on the steamy night of July 17 in
Cleveland's Municipal Stadium before 67,468 fans. The pitchers were
Al Smith and Jim Bagby Jr., but the stopper was the Indians' third
baseman, Ken Keltner, who made two dazzling backhand plays deep
behind third base to rob DiMaggio of hits. It is sometimes
overlooked that DiMaggio was intentionally walked in the fourth
inning of that game, and that he promptly started a 16-game streak
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In 56 games, DiMaggio had gone to bat 223 times and delivered 91
hits for a .408 average, including 15 home runs. He drew 21 walks,
twice was hit by pitched balls, scored 56 runs and knocked in 55.
He hit in every game for two months, and struck out just seven
times.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, fourth in the American League when the streak
began, were six games in front when it ended, and won the pennant
by 17.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was passing milestones in his personal life, too. In
1939, he had married an actress, Dorothy Arnold. In October 1941,
his only child, Josephe Jr., was born. He is survived by his son;
his brother, Dominic; two granddaughters and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1942, DiMaggio enlisted in the Army Air Forces and
spent the next three years teaching baseball in the service. Along
with other baseball stars like Bob Feller and Williams, he resumed
his career as soon as the war ended, returning to the Yankees for
the 1946 season and a year later leading them back into the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   His most dramatic moments came in the season of 1949, after he
was sidelined by bone spurs on his right heel and did not play
until June 26. Then he flew to Boston to join the team in Fenway
Park, hit a single and home run the first two times he went to bat,
hit two more home runs the next day and another the day after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees entered the final two days of that season trailing
the Red Sox by one game. They had to sweep two games in Yankee
Stadium to win the pennant, and they did. There were poignant
moments before the first game when 69,551 fans rocked the stadium
and cheered their hero, who was being honored with a Joe DiMaggio
Day. He was almost too weak to play because of a severe viral
infection, but he did, and he hit a single and double before
removing himself from center field on wobbly legs.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees won yet another World Series in 1951, he
retired and eased into a second career as Joe DiMaggio, legend. It
included cameo roles as a broadcaster, a spring training instructor
with the Yankees and a coach with the Oakland Athletics,
appearances at old timers' games, where he was invariably the last
player introduced, and a larger role, with surprising impact, as a
mellow and credible pitchman on television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   He had long since created an image of a loner both on and off
the playing field, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s when he
lived in hotels in Manhattan and was considered something of a man
about town. He once was characterized by a teammate as the man
``who led the league in room service.'' But he spent many evenings
at Toots Shor's restaurant in Manhattan, where he hid out at a
private table far in the back while Shor protected him from his
public.
</P>
<P>
   But his legend took a storybook turn in 1952, the year after he
retired from the Yankees, when DiMaggio, whose marriage to Dorothy
Arnold had ended in divorce in 1944, arranged a dinner date with
Marilyn Monroe in California. They were married in San Francisco on
Jan. 14, 1954, and spent nine months trying to reconcile their
differences before they divorced in October. DiMaggio always seemed
tortured by Monroe's sex goddess image. He protested loudly during
the making of Billy Wilder's ``The Seven Year Itch'' when the
script called for her to cool herself over a subway grate while a
sudden wind blew her skirts up high.
</P>
<P>
   But when the actress seemed on the verge of an emotional
collapse in 1961, DiMaggio brought her to the Yankees' training
camp in Florida for rest and support. And when she died of an
overdose of barbiturates at the age of 36 on Aug. 4, 1962, he took
charge of her funeral and for the next 20 years sent roses three
times a week to her crypt in the Westwood section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When DiMaggio made an unexpected and dramatic return to the
public scene in the 1970s as a dignified television spokesman for
the Bowery Savings Bank of New York and for Mr. Coffee, a
manufacturer of coffee makers, he did it with remarkable ease for a
man who had been obsessed with privacy, who had once confided that
he always had ``a knot'' in his stomach because he was so shy and
tense.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the stage fright that had rattled him during earlier
sorties into broadcasting. Instead, he was the epitome of
credibility, the graying and trustworthy hero who had hit his home
runs and was now returning to extol the virtues of saving money and
brewing coffee. He promptly became a familiar and comforting
presence for a generation of baseball fans who never saw him play.
</P>
<P>
   For some years he lived in San Francisco with his widowed sister
Marie in a house in the Marina District that he had bought for his
parents in 1939 and that he and his sister had both shared with
Marilyn Monroe. When the damp San Francisco climate troubled the
arthritis in his back, he began to spend most of his time in
Florida, where he established his home. He played golf and made
selected excursions to Europe and the Far East, where the demand
for his appearance and his autograph returned high dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to take the most pleasure in establishing a
children's wing, called the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, at
Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. And he seemed to
relish the invitations back to Yankee Stadium, where he frequently
threw out the first ball on Opening Day, tall but slightly stooped,
dressed elegantly, as always, in a dark business suit, walking to
the mound and lobbing one to the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was there on the day the season ended last year, as the
Yankees set a team record with their 114th victory, that he was
acclaimed on yet another Joe DiMaggio Day, the timeless hero and
the symbol of Yankee excellence, acknowledging the cheers of Yankee
players and fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of cheering that accompanied him through life
and that he had quietly come to expect. It recalled the time when
he and Marilyn Monroe, soon after their wedding, took a trip to
Tokyo. She continued on to entertain American troops in Korea, and
said with fascination when she returned, ``Joe, you've never heard
such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   And Joe DiMaggio replied softly, ``Yes, I have.''

FORTIS TO BUY AMERICAN BANKERS FOR $2.6 BILLION PLUS DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga.)  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fortis, one of the biggest insurance and banking companies in
Europe, said Monday that it would buy American Bankers Insurance
Group, a Miami insurer that was the object of a bidding war by two
big American companies last year, for $2.6 billion plus the
assumption of nearly $200 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Fortis plans to combine American Bankers with its American
Security Group in Atlanta, giving the new entity an overwhelmingly
dominant market share of 30 percent in the business of selling
insurance that pays off credit-card balances and loans on such
things as furniture and major appliances when customers die, lose
their jobs or are disabled.
</P>
<P>
   This credit-related insurance is enormously profitable, but
Consumers Union and other critics say that instead of buying
coverage on specific kinds of debt, consumers should buy broader
coverage, like life or disability insurance, which is
proportionately less expensive and provides greater benefits.
Fortis executives say that many customers for credit-related
insurance cannot afford broader coverages and that the insurance on
their car loan or credit-card balance may be the only insurance
they think they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition by Fortis, which has headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium, and Utrecht, Netherlands, was the second by a big European
insurer in a little more than two weeks. In mid-February, Aegon NV
said it was buying TransAmerica Corp. of San Francisco for $9.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Europe and the United States say more purchases are
expected as Europeans seek to expand in the world's largest
insurance market. Europeans have been able to strike better deals
in the United States than at home, said Stephen Dias, an analyst
for Goldman, Sachs in London. They are ``very optimistic'' about
growth prospects for variable annuities and other products aimed at
Americans who are approaching retirement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Henjo Hielkema, the Fortis executive in charge of its insurance
operations, said the deal with American Bankers, which had revenue
of $2.5 billion last year, would nearly double Fortis' insurance
revenue in the United States, to about $5.7 billion. Fortis bought
the holding company of American Security and a sister company in
1980 as its second acquisition in the United States after buying a
small group health insurers two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It now has half a dozen units in the United States selling
coverage for such things as health care, funeral expenses and
protection for providers of small mortgages. The parent company,
which bought Generale Bank, Belgium's largest bank, last June, had
revenue of $37 billion last year, about 66 percent from banking.
</P>
<P>
   Fortis' offer, which must be approved by shareholders, works out
to $55 a share in cash. That is a nearly 19 percent premium over
American Bankers closing price on Friday. But it is $12 less than
Cendant Corp., a franchiser and direct marketer, agreed to pay
after edging out American International Group, the big
international insurer based in New York. Cendant made an
unsolicited offer of $58 a share after American International
Group, often referred to as AIG, announced an agreement with
American Bankers at $47 a share. AIG matched the $58 offer but
would go no higher.
</P>
<P>
   But Cendant was forced to back out of the deal last fall because
of an accounting scandal that sent its shares plummeting, and
American Bankers went back on the market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts in Europe and the United States said Fortis was paying
a top price _2.4 times the book value of American Bankers. But a
consistent return on equity of about 15 percent and annual growth
of about 20 percent make the Miami company ``quite attractive,''
said Michael Lindsay, an insurance analyst at Lehman Brothers in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies with high returns and high growth don't come along
very often,'' he said, ``and when they are for sale they do tend to
command substantial multiples.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to approve of the deal. Shares of American
Bankers rose $5.625 Monday, to $52. Fortis is owned 50-50 by Fortis
of Belgium, whose shares rose 0.51 euro, to 34.01, and Fortis NV of
the Netherlands, whose shares increased 0.40 euro, to 35.05.
</P>
<P>
   Fortis said it expected to cut $100 million out of operating
expenses as it combines American Bankers and American Security
Group. Some of that savings, said Lewis Phillips, an insurance
analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton in London, is expected to come through
job cuts. American Bankers has 2,950 employees, and American
Security has 1,450.
</P>
<P>
   J. Kerry Clayton, an executive vice president at Fortis
headquarters in the United States, said, ``We think this will be a
very profitable acquisition for us.'' He said about half of the
savings would come from ``combining the infrastructure'' of the two
companies. He also said that ``significant operations'' would
continue in both Miami and Atlanta and that many of the job cuts
would come through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a cost-driven deal,'' he said. ``This is really
about putting together two high-growth, high-return companies so
they can achieve a greater leadership position.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, American Bankers agreed, without admitting
wrongdoing, to pay regulators in 39 states up to $15 million to
settle a range of accusations, including using unapproved marketing
materials and failing to make sure that all agents selling its
products were properly licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said Fortis spent more time on the regulatory questions
than on any other aspect of its review of American Bankers. ``We
have a good history with the regulators,'' he said, ``and we wanted
to make sure they had taken proper action so these things wouldn't
recur. And they have done that.''

CIT TO ACQUIRE NEWCOURT IN STOCK SWAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIT Group Inc., the commercial finance concern based in
Livingston, N.J., said Monday that it would acquire Newcourt Credit
Group Inc., a Toronto concern, in a stock swap valued at about $4.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will create one of the largest commercial finance
companies in the country. CIT has specialized in lending primarily
to smaller and midsized companies, but the merger will give it
access to such well-known Newcourt clients as Dell Computer Corp.
and Lucent Technologies Inc. and also expand its operations in
Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said no layoffs are currently planned, although a
hiring freeze is in place and attrition is expected to reduce the
size of the combined companies' work force, which currently numbers
about 8,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Shares of CIT fell
56.25 cents, to $30.1875, while Newcourt's shares rose 81.25 cents,
to $26.625. According to the terms of the transaction, which had
already been unanimously approved by each company's board of
directors, each Newcourt share will be exchanged for 0.92 CIT
share. The acquisition valued Newcourt at $28.29 a share, a 9.6
percent premium to Friday's closing price of $25.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Albert R. Gamper, CIT's president and chief executive, will
become chairman and chief executive of the new company, which will
retain the CIT name. Steven K. Hudson, Newcourt's president and
chief executive, will be president of the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   CIT is regarded by analysts as a conservative, risk-averse
lender. It became a public company just last year after a large
Japanese bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., sold a big portion of a
stake it held in CIT.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is expected to be completed in the third quarter,
after which Dai-Ichi will own about 24 percent of the merged
company. Nomura Securities and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
Newcourt's biggest shareholders, will respectively own 6 percent
and 5 percent of the new company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will have more than $50 billion in assets, $2.2
billion in annual revenue and after-tax profits of more than $500
million. Eleven of the new company's 20-member board will come from
CIT, with the remainder from Newcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Newcourt's shares have been pounded over the last year as
investors dumped the stock of companies like Newcourt that were
considered to be overly aggressive lenders. But recent merger
speculation fueled a rise in Newcourt's shares, although recent
market rumors had identified Germany's Deutsche Bank AG as
Newcourt's most likely suitor.
</P>
<P>
   CIT had been looking for a merger partner over the last year and
began seriously discussing the possibility of a deal with Newcourt
a little more than a month ago, according to analysts who were
briefed on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan advised CIT in the merger, while Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. and Canadian Imperial Bank advised Newcourt.

SIEMENS BUYS 2 COMPANIES TO ENTER DATA NETWORKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Siemens AG of Germany became the latest European maker of
traditional telephone equipment to push into the market for data
communications gear when it announced Monday that it had acquired
two private U.S. companies and invested in a third.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens said it would fold the two acquisitions and parts of its
existing U.S. operations into a new subsidiary called Unisphere
Solutions Inc., based in Burlington, Mass. Siemens said it would
initially commit $1 billion to the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of traditional telephone systems are rushing to meet the
fast-growing demand for data-networking equipment, which is being
fueled largely by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Alcatel of France, one of Siemens' traditional
European rivals, said it had agreed to buy two U.S. data
communications companies, Xylan Corp. and Assured Access Technology
Inc., for more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Senior data-networking executives said Monday that Ericsson of
Sweden could be the next to attempt a big data-networking splash,
potentially within a week. Ericsson declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Siemens said it had acquired Castle Networks Inc.,
a private data-networking company based in Westford, Mass., and
Argon Networks Inc., a private data-networking company based in
Littleton, Mass., and that it had made an equity investment in
Accelerated Networks Inc., a private company based in Moorpark,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens did not disclose the terms of the deals. When asked
about the terms at a news conference in New York Monday, Anthony T.
Maher, a director of Siemens' information and communication
networks group, said, ``the best source is The New York Times,''
referring to an article published last week. Last week's article
cited executives close to Siemens' planning as saying that the
company had agreed to pay about $300 million for Castle, about $240
million for Argon and had agreed to invest $30 million in
Accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   The executives also said in the article that Siemens was in
preliminary discussions with the 3Com Corp. about paying $1.2
billion for the 3Com unit that sells advanced networking equipment
to telephone companies. Maher said at the news conference that that
contention ``wasn't entirely accurate.'' 3Com declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In forming Unisphere, Siemens is trying to combine its strengths
as one of Europe's largest manufacturers with the agility of a
small independent company. To run the unit, Siemens hired Martin C.
Clague, formerly general manager for global network computing
solutions at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to potential criticism that, as a 33-year IBM
veteran, he may not be well suited to running a small, nimble
operation, Clague said: ``There is nothing like experience in
managing a matrix and in managing an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the evolution of data communications, he added:
``I've been in this Internet space for three years, and it was
network computers before that and client-server before that. So I
know this space.''
</P>
<P>
   Clague and Maher said Unisphere would consider additional
acquisitions. Jeff Matros, a former senior Siemens executive, said
that even if Siemens' new strategy did not pan out, at least
someone would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was very positive,'' said Matros, who until June
was vice president for marketing and business development for
Siemens' data communications group and who is now a general partner
at Walden International Investment Group, a venture capital firm,
``certainly for the entrepreneurs in Massachusetts, having another
large traditional telecom company with lots of cash to burn on the
prowl in the Boston area.''

VOTE AT GOLDMAN APPROVES LATEST PLAN TO OFFER SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The partners of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. reaffirmed their
decision to take their firm public Monday but learned that the man
behind the plan, Jon S. Corzine, would leave as soon as the firm
sold shares.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who had tirelessly nudged fellow partners to abandon
their longstanding opposition to issuing shares since he became
head of the firm in 1994, said he would give up his remaining
duties ``as of the close of the offering.'' Henry M. Paulson Jr.
will remain as the sole chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, 52, was forced to relinquish his executive
responsibilities at a meeting of the firm's executive committee in
early January, a rare mutiny at a firm known for management
stability. Corzine remained as nonexecutive chairman, nominally to
oversee Goldman's transition from a private partnership to a public
company.
</P>
<P>
   Though some people at the firm said that Corzine had continued
to help shape the share offering, others said that his role since
January had been mostly ceremonial.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's public offering is primarily about money, and when it
comes to money, people often do not have long memories. But the
paradox of Corzine's departure is still fresh. Goldman partners had
rejected the idea of going public half a dozen times over the last
two decades until Corzine, regarded by some at the firm as a
skillful communicator, quietly shepherded the issue to a favorable
vote last June.
</P>
<P>
   But he paid a price. To assuage some early qualms among senior
partners, Corzine promoted his No. 2, Paulson, to be his co-equal,
a move that backfired when the two did not work well together.
Other executives also soured on Corzine when the firm postponed its
public offering in September, a decision attributed in part to
heavy losses in bond trading last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of using all your chips to try to fashion a pact,
and then you don't have any chips left,'' said Samuel Hayes, a
Harvard Business School professor.
</P>
<P>
   Like some other past leaders of Goldman, including Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, Corzine rose to the executive suite from
the bond-trading floor, and he may turn out to be the last of a
breed. As a trader, Corzine was long seen as more comfortable than
some other officers with taking risks in the capital markets, a
business that has generated more than 40 percent of Goldman's
pretax profits in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But stock market investors frown on companies that have
unpredictable profits, and trading, while at times hugely
profitable, is by nature volatile. Paulson, in contrast, comes from
the investment banking side of the business, which generates
steadier fee revenue from clients and does not require the firm to
take as many risks with its own money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading is really anathema to a public investor; they pummel
any company that hands them a surprise,'' Hayes said. ``So it seems
unlikely that we will see another leader of Corzine's profile.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Corzine will still benefit from the two- to threefold increase
in the value of his shares that is expected when the firm goes
public because his equity stake will be converted into new Goldman
shares with the same premium other partners receive, said one
person close to the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the firm's most senior partners, Corzine is thought to
hold shares that would be valued in the neighborhood of $150
million. Like other partners, however, he will have to wait several
years before he is eligible to sell the bulk of his restricted
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The completion of the public offering will mark a logical and
appropriate point for me to move on in my career and life,''
Corzine said in a statement. He declined to comment beyond that
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The partners voted overwhelmingly Monday for a revised plan to
take the firm public, Goldman officials said. The firm hopes to
sell 10 percent to 15 percent of its shares at a price that would
value the firm at $21 billion to $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The firm announced the appointment of David Viniar as chief
financial officer and Barry Zubrow as chief administrative officer.
Goldman also said that its first board would comprise four
insiders, one alumnus and three outsiders. The insiders are
Paulson, Robert J. Hurst, John A. Thain and John L. Thornton. The
alumnus, a limited partner who led the firm in the 1980s, is John
L. Weinberg. The outside directors were not named.

MARKET PLACE: SOLID-WASTE GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Texas)  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA AND LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Allied Waste Industries announced Monday that it would
acquire Browning-Ferris Industries, a much bigger rival in the
trash hauling business, Allied's message was simple: We can better
manage those huge assets.
</P>
<P>
   With its $7.3 billion leveraged takeover of Browning-Ferris _
plus the assumption of $1.8 billion of Browning-Ferris debt _
Allied Waste will be the No. 2 player in the industry behind Waste
Management Inc., and it is betting that its more integrated and
focused approach to handling solid waste can create a fleet-footed
giant that produces profit growth in the high double digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, we're teaming our management with their
assets,'' Thomas Van Weelden, the chief executive at Allied Waste,
said in an interview Monday. ``The story here is not consolidation;
the story here is focusing on growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Although shares of Allied, which was the No. 3 trash hauler,
fell sharply on Friday on speculation about a possible stock deal,
the share price recovered some of that ground Monday, climbing
$1.9375, to $16.9375. Shares of Browning-Ferris, which traded just
above $30 a month ago, soared for the second day, up $4.125, to
$38.875.
</P>
<P>
   With the deal, the trash hauling industry, once run by small,
private operators, is further concentrating into a business
dominated by a handful of national companies with huge fleets of
trucks and enormous landfills. The big players, however, are under
growing pressure to become leaner and more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   So when the boards of Allied and Browning-Ferris voted on Sunday
night to create a company with about $6.6 billion in revenue, just
over half the $12 billion 1998 revenue of Waste Management,
executives at Allied also decided that significant cost savings and
layoffs would be necessary to generate profit growth in the high
double digits. They project a 30 percent profit gain in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said the deal was good for shareholders of
Browning-Ferris, which had recently begun to turn around a slumping
business. But if Allied shareholders are to benefit, Allied
executives must now find a way to work their magic on a much larger
company while paying off the sizable debt load from the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my concern,'' said James Kelleher, an analyst at Argus
Research in New York. ``They're assuming the best of all possible
worlds to service the debt. There's a lot that could happen between
now and the $45-deal date in the third quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such a leveraged takeover is unusual, this is the
second time in less than a year that a giant trash hauler has been
taken over by a smaller rival. (A year ago, USA Waste acquired
Waste Management in a $13 billion deal.) Wall Street analysts say
that industry executives now realize that a focused strategy is
just as important as size in the waste management business.
</P>
<P>
   At Browning-Ferris, after years of aggressive acquisitions and
expansion into everything from recycling to hazardous waste
removal, shareholders had been pressing the company to focus more
closely on its North American business, and on Monday, Allied
executives said the newly formed company would do just that.
</P>
<P>
   The deal began last spring when Allied Waste and Browning-Ferris
discussed a stock merger. At the time, people close to the deal
said, Browning-Ferris executives were not eager to sell, hoping
instead to improve the company's profitability on their own. But
over time they became more open to the idea, in part, because a
handful of Browning-Ferris' board members supported it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Negotiations heated up at the end of February. Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. was hired by Browning-Ferris to advise on the transaction,
while Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, among others, advised Allied's
management. Browning-Ferris initially wanted cash, a person close
to the talks said, up to $49 a share. The companies agreed on $45.
Then Allied, along with its two majority shareholders, Apollo
Management and Blackstone Capital Partners, both of which supported
a deal, began arranging financing.
</P>
<P>
   Several banks were asked to commit funds for the deal at the end
of February and to agree to put up the money for the buyout
regardless of whether other investors could be enlisted. By March
3, one person close to the talks said, three institutions _ Chase
Manhattan, Citibank and DLJ Capital Funding _ had committed
themselves to provide the $9.5 billion that Allied needed to buy
Browning-Ferris.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to that, several investors said they would buy a total of
$1 billion in convertible preferred stock, including Apollo
Management, Blackstone Capital Partners, DLJ Merchant Banking
Partners and Greenwich Street Capital Partners. By Thursday, the
two companies had agreed in concept to a deal and to continue
talking over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Allied's stock plunged about $5 a share, or 25
percent. The company was asked by the New York Stock Exchange to
make a statement, but did not. Several bankers, along with Apollo
and Blackstone, double-checked their numbers to make sure the deal
was sound. After their analysis was finished, the two companies
hammered out the final details of the acquisition, meeting well
past midnight on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Van Weelden, the chief executive at Allied, which is based in
Scottsdale, Ariz., said he expected some layoffs, particularly in
Houston, where Browning-Ferris has headquarters, but that the key
to driving profits at the new company would be combining a
decentralized management style with a vertically integrated
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to own all the pieces,'' Van Weelden said. ``We
believe in vertical integration.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to those who worry about the leverage in the buyout,
Van Weelden cited his company's acquisition of Laidlaw Co., a trash
hauler about three times the size of Allied.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kind of repeat; this is exactly what we did with
Laidlaw,'' he said. ``We know how to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts, however, say that even after all
the cost savings, Allied may have to cope with a large debt load
and the possibility of an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to run into a recession, the deal could be
breached,'' said Melville Cody, an analyst at Sanders Morris Mundy,
a brokerage firm in Houston. ``But right now we're in a good
environment for waste management.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts, recalling the problems of Browning-Ferris and
the old Waste Management Co., before it was acquired by USA Waste,
wonder whether Allied could become too large and unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allied has a better management team and a better track record
than Browning-Ferris,'' said Charles Moody, publisher of American
Waste Digest in Pottstown, Pa. ``But any time you triple your size,
you're going to have new problems.''

NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNERS NAMED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We Wish To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our
Families,'' Philip Gourevitch's account of the 1994 massacres in
Rwanda, on Monday was named the best nonfiction book of last year
by the National Book Critics Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Wole Soyinka, the
Nigerian playwright, described it as a ``grim book this and a
burden on world conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand what happened in Rwanda, Soyinka wrote, one must
imagine not only the Nazis' Final Solution but also that ``nearly
the entirety of the German population participated in the
liquidation of the Jews.'' The book was published by Farrar, Straus
&AMP; Giroux.
</P>
<P>
   The winner in fiction was Alice Munro's ``The Love of a Good
Woman,'' a collection of eight short stories published by Alfred A.
Knopf. In a review in The Times, Michael Gorra, who teaches English
at Smith College, wrote that ``Munro's feel for her own characters
is ... as pure as Chekhov's.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection's long title story, Gorra wrote, was typical of
Ms. Munro's artistry. On a Saturday morning in 1951, three boys
discover the body of the local optometrist, who has drowned, but
instead of notifying police, they first return home to eat lunch.
``In presenting the complicated reasons for their delay,'' Gorra
wrote, ``Munro manages to articulate the entire social structure
and moral history of the town in which they live.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner in biography was ``A Beautiful Mind,'' published by
Simon &AMP; Schuster. Written by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for
The Times, it is a biography of John Forbes Nash Jr., a
mathematical genius who laid the foundations for modern game theory
that influenced mathematics, economics and eventually Cold War
strategic thinking about nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an account of Nash's descent into schizophrenia for
three decades and his puzzling recovery in the 1980s, culminating
in his winning the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics. Reviewing the
book for The Times, Simon Singh, the author of ``Fermat's Enigma:
The Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem,''
called the biography ``a touching account of a man caught between
genius and madness.''
</P>
<P>
   The award for poetry was given to Marie Ponsot's ``The Bird
Catcher,'' published by Knopf. For criticism, the award went to
Gary Giddins' ``Visions of Jazz: The First Century,'' published by
Oxford University Press. The winner of the Nona Balakian Citation
for Excellence in Reviewing was Albert Mobilio, a New York-based
critic and poet.

INJURY CLOUDS TRADE TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Would the Lakers really trade Eddie Jones to
Charlotte for damaged goods? That's the question Lakers officials
themselves will be pondering between now and the NBA's 3 p.m.
Thursday trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   It's been reported that Jones and Elden Campbell would be
swapped for Glen Rice, J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong. It's even been
called a done deal by several media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice himself raised serious doubts about the deal this
weekend, when he said he can't fully extend his right (shooting)
arm, seven weeks after surgery on his elbow. In an interview with
the Charlotte Observer, published Monday, a frustrated Rice said he
doesn't know when he'll be able to play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a week? Is it a month? I don't know,'' he said. ``I
don't think it's anything like a month, though. Just do something
and put me out of my misery if it's a month.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Observer, the teams are still discussing the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, 31, one of the league's top pure shooters, had
arthroscopic surgery Jan. 22 to remove loose particles in his
elbow. He is rehabilitating at his Miami home and continues to feel
intermittent pain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have won seven straight games, including Sunday's
impressive victory over the Jazz in Utah, but management believes
the addition of a 3-point shooting ace would solidify their bid for
an NBA championship. Rice has averaged 44.4 percent from beyond the
arc the past three seasons, including a league-leading 47 percent
in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also have been eager to unload Campbell's $7
million-a-year contract, which runs through 2003. If they make the
trade, the Lakers will have turned over four-fifths of the starting
lineup that finished the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal would be the only holdover. Travis Knight has
replaced Robert Horry (power forward), Derek Harper has replaced
Derek Fisher (point guard) and Kobe Bryant has replaced Rick Fox
(small forward). Rice would become the new small forward, with
Bryant shifting to Jones' vacated shooting guard slot.
</P>
<P>
   __ Jones watch: Jones, who last week was joking with reporters
about the trade, saying mock good-byes, has been noticeably quiet
the past few days and appears more bothered than ever about it. He
scored just five points in Sunday's win.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson came to Monday's practice and offered Jones some
encouraging words. Johnson also spent 30 minutes working with
Bryant on his post-up game, and afterward said he would be more
involved in the post-Del Harris era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an unwritten rule that I couldn't be around,''
Johnson said. ``I'm back now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Worm watch: Dennis Rodman skipped Monday's practice at
Southwest College, but his absence was prearranged and excused,
according to the team. Rodman was said to be taking care of
``personal business.''

JOLTING JOE WAS MAN OF MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We will never know the real Joe DiMaggio because he guarded his
privacy all the way to the grave. But to appreciate him and
understand why countless others admired him, all you have to
understand is the times in which he played.
</P>
<P>
   If DiMaggio, who passed away Monday at the age of 84, had played
in this era, he'd have been Don Mattingly.
</P>
<P>
   Skillful and sophisticated, dignified but hardly deified. The
quiet carriage that passed for class and dignity in DiMaggio's day
wouldn't have passed muster in today's image-is-everything world.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's personality, like his natty suits, was perfectly
tailored for the times. He was the unapologetic product of a
country in the throes of a depression, in the grips of a war, in
the embrace of immigrants, in the clasp of industrialization and
urbanization.
</P>
<P>
   From 1936 to 1951 _ minus the three years he served in the Army
during World War II _ he patrolled center field for the preeminent
team in the preeminent city in the preeminent sport in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees of DiMaggio's day were the Denver Broncos, Chicago
Bulls, Detroit Red Wings, Tiger Woods, Pete Sampras and Jeff Gordon
all rolled into one. Those Bronx Bombers were the first
uber-athletes of the urban age. And there in the center of it all,
literally, was DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   He was an Italian-American immigrant's son, a Californian by
birth and a loner by nature. It wasn't just his unfathomable
56-game hitting streak in 1941 that made DiMaggio larger than the
city in which he played, larger even than the sport he loved.
DiMaggio's stoicism played well in the pre-television era, before
athletes started adjusting their personalities to make them as
colorful as the pictures being beamed by satellite all over the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   How quaint it all seems now, the idea of affection being
showered on those who were self-made, not self-promoted.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's hitting streak in 1941 captured the imagination of
the nation, much like Mark McGwire's home run derby did this past
season. A New York disc jockey penned the lyrics to a song that was
set to music by Les Brown and his band of renown. A sampling:
</P>
<P>
   ``Who started baseball's streak that's got us all aglow?
</P>
<P>
   He's just a man and not a freak, Jolting Joe DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this about sports celebrity: It certainly pulses to a
different beat these days. Listened to any of Shaquille O'Neal's
albums lately?
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing DiMaggio defended more fastidiously than
center field was his privacy. His first marriage was to an actress,
Dorothy Arnold; his most famous, to Marilyn Monroe, and yet we
already know more about Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra than
DiMaggio ever revealed about either of his loves.
</P>
<P>
   His discretion would be called something different today: dull.
</P>
<P>
   As a prodigy in the Pacific Coast League _ he put together a
61-game hitting streak with the San Francisco Seals in 1933 _
DiMaggio developed a keen eye for more than pitches. He could spot
sycophants from five paces and he kept them at an arm's length,
along with just about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   He'd sit in the clubhouse for hours so as not to have to face
the crowds waiting for him outside. What was tolerated then might
today cost him a few All-Star votes from disgruntled fans, to say
nothing of the reporters left cooling their heels on deadline.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio wasn't a recluse; he often was spotted at nightclubs,
in the company of esteemed figures such as Ernest Hemingway (thus
explaining Hemingway's reference to DiMaggio in the novel, ``The
Old Man and the Sea.'')
</P>
<P>
   If DiMaggio wasn't exactly a wallflower, neither was he a
pushover. He was one of the first players to hold out for more
money (he did so initially in 1938, sitting out for $45,000 before
settling for $25,000). He also was among the first to charge for an
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for DiMaggio's signature remained keen to the end and
therein lies a lesson for today's high-profile athletes. Never mind
full disclosure, there's nothing like a little mystery to sustain a
market.

   MILAN, Italy _ The bigger names in Italian fashion may lead
impeccably civilized lives up in their art-filled palazzi, but give
one of these titans of chic a rich, feel-good dish like risotto and
suddenly the napkin is under the chin and he's hogging the whole
platter of congealed rice for himself. Such a scene was recounted
last week after a lunch for a small group of magazine editors, and
while the witnesses said they didn't go hungry (the designer's cook
fed them pasta), the risotto story hints at the self-centered
isolation of Milan's Old Guard, who for too long have held onto the
pot.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the art on the walls, the fabulous homes, the ``poetry''
of the latest collection. Do any of these fashion biggies ever do
anything as normal as going out to the movies? They ought to. They
might learn something new.
</P>
<P>
   That thought lingered over the last days of the Italian fall
collections, which ended Friday night. Once-innovative figures like
Gianfranco Ferre seemed hopelessly mired in old glamour formulas _
hellions in black leather, in Ferre's case, throwing down their
chinchilla parkas and demanding star treatment, with Louis Prima in
the background. It was heavy weather: fattening mohair dresses with
feathery tufts sprouting along one sleeve; long split skirts in
overlapping panels of leather and tweed; chunky fur ponchos and
blazers lined in sheared mink, and a skintight black dress with a
wide elliptical collar fitted, if you can imagine, with a metal
plate.
</P>
<P>
   A final passage of broadtail and leather corsets with
gathered-up tartan skirts sprayed partly black were intriguing
enough, but Ferre treats glamour _ and fabric _ as something to be
wrestled into submission. Or as he said in his show notes, the tone
of his collection was ``as if a wild beast, suddenly turned docile,
were held on a belt-leash.'' Don't think we'll go there.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Donatella Versace, with her ironed hair and
wrist full of diamonds, grasps the point of being out in the world,
even if there's a limited market for her kind of outrageousness.
``You don't like green python boots?'' she said before her show as
models sipped Champagne through straws. ``OK. Then go somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Versace presented a fast-paced collection of disco velvet
dresses, rhinestone-studded white mink and turquoise-beaded gowns,
all played out in a mood-room atmosphere of dark draperies and a
glassy catwalk raised over a make-believe coral reef.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Versace thrives in the unambiguous world of high-strung
sexual glamour. On Friday night, as Juliette Lewis, the actress,
bobbed her well-shod foot to the thumping music, the upshot was
fairly devastating: sleek Prince of Wales tunics with girlish
Swiss-dot cuffs, pinstriped leather trousers and white mink jackets
salted with mother-of-pearl paillettes. Yet some of the clothes
looked poorly made, and although Ms. Versace has plenty of
attitude, one can't help wishing she had more of her late brother
Gianni's historical references. History was no burden to him, least
of all his own.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce are also constantly on the
move _ nothing old-clothesy about their collection. The design team
sent out a dazzling montage of daisy-appliqued stilettos, tie-dyed
fur in electric cocktail lounge hues, winking hologram skirts in
``Fantasia'' blues and yellows, and cowhide jackets and buffalo
fleece pants recalling the delicious days of spaghetti westerns and
Sergio Leone.
</P>
<P>
   And so are Jil Sander and Miuccia Prada, who put their
individual spin on minimalism, with Ms. Prada doing in her Miu Miu
line what she had failed to do in her main collection earlier:
charming her audience with opal satin dresses with chiffon hems,
trousers with rib-knitted cuffs spreading out over the shoes like
pureed peas, and hilarious duck boots with heels and fat tongues _
nothing like L.L. Bean's at all.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prada based the collection on a passage from a Tim Burton
short story about Stick Boy and Match Girl, whose gist is that each
thinks the other is hot. ``I think young guys are so charming,''
she explained. ``I like the way young people are different and so
sweet with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   That came through, as young men and women trooped out in
sweaters and hooded jerseys in woodsy greens, pumpkins and browns.
Bootleg trousers were tied at the ankles with cords so they spread
over the tops of shoes _ a new look. There were drizzles of
folkloric ruffles, fanny packs integrated into wool coats and many
coming-and-going clothes (which, for those not yet in the know, are
clothes with the front in one fabric and the back in another).
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a Rifat Ozbek show signaled something new.
Ozbek still has his camp followers, but his current asymmetrical
hemlines, fuzzy coats, leggings and silver-glazed chiffon merely
endorse what's already out there. As for the idea of giving utility
clothes futuristic glamour, that might have been all right if his
message hadn't been delivered to the soggy timpani of the ``Star
Wars'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   Other collections rounding out the week were those by Marni and
Victor Alfaro, who competently ticked off the season's trends _
boiled wool skirts, minimalist separates with a crust of beaded
trim, high heels, forest hues _ but without bravura. Marni went
chaotically rustic, with charming variations on the Arts and Crafts
theme, including boiled wool blanket skirts, folkloric prints and
ruffles and quilted wraps of the bed jacket genre. The clothes had
a sweet, literate mayhem, as if Red Riding Hood had gone skipping
over to Grandma's and found frumpy old Virginia Woolf instead.
</P>
<P>
   But to the high points of the week. What Ms. Prada has in common
with Ms. Versace and Karl Lagerfeld for Fendi _ and, for that
matter, Tom Ford, whose Gucci show was a Xanadu of inspired flash _
is a restlessness with what's old and familiar. Collectively, they
have the attention span of a gnat, which isn't so bad in a business
where at least half the audience seems perpetually to be looking up
at the ceiling as if to say, ``Next.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Sander, whose clothes can sometimes seem caught in a
cerebral straitjacket, comes down from her ivory tower to push
fashion forward _ and play with periwinkle coats blocked out in a
grid of seams, asymmetrically pleated skirts in copper papery satin
silk, spongy new synthetics and an interlocking chain of seams that
resemble a genetic code, but is, in fact, just candy for the
ravenous eye.
</P>
<P>
   The Fendi show held nothing arty or serious. In fact, the
pressing question as the guests took their seats was whether
Carlyne Cerf's Jack Russell terrier, Jack, should have a Fendi fur
of his own. Ms. Cerf, a Marie Claire editor, had outfitted him with
an Hermes collar and leash; and on rainy days in Milan, Jack wore a
Burberry town coat. But she looked doubtful when Andre Leon Talley
of Vogue suggested a Fendi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he might eat it,'' Ms. Cerf said.
</P>
<P>
   Talley laughed. ``But so what?''
</P>
<P>
   That remark would probably thrill Lagerfeld, Fendi's designer.
After all, he had taken out the linings in most of his coats,
except some in silver sable, so what more could a dog do to a look
that was, in effect, destroyed? Lagerfeld showed furs _ mink,
squirrel, summer ermine _ sheared so close to the skin, and then
dyed in sorbet hues of lemon, melon, pistachio, coffee and palest
blue, that they looked as indefinably glamorous as a woman running
out in the rain in a silk wrapper to fetch her paper. ``The idea
was to treat fur no different than fabric,'' Lagerfeld explained.
``Treat it like nothing, and it looks modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld has been in this deconstructivist territory before,
but rarely with more confidence. The results were beautiful. There
was Stella Tennant swooping out in a patchwork coat of sheared
mink. Mimsy-looking bed jackets with belled sleeves snuggled over
knit separates. Some coats were covered in a gauze cobweb, while a
birch-colored coat in sheared squirrel was trimmed at its raw edges
in gauzy filigree. The show was a testament to Lagerfeld's
far-flung brilliance, as well as to the Fendi workrooms, and
devotees of the ``baguette'' handbag can look forward to new
versions _ in beaded patchwork, sheared mink and a perfectly corny
fisherman knit.

SELES CLOBBERED BY NAGYOVA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She remembered her racquet, but Monica Seles picked the wrong
day to forget her thinking cap when she headed to the stadium court
Monday for her third-round Evert Cup encounter with Slovakia's
Henrieta Nagyova. It was not the best tactic in a sport that prides
itself on being a mind game, and a dazed Seles paid for her
negligence: She found herself clobbered, 6-2, 6-4, in just over an
hour in Indian Wells, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For Seles, it was a painfully long hour, as she became the
eighth seeded player to depart the women's half of this coed desert
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind definitely wasn't there from the start till the end,''
said the third-seeded Seles, who reached the semifinals of her
previous two events in 1999, the Australian Open and Pan Pacific
Open in Tokyo, and was then hobbled by an ankle sprain for a month.
But on Monday her shortcomings were mental, not physical. ``My head
wasn't there; my game wasn't there,'' Seles said, sighing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she nudged the ball across the net as if she wasn't
quite sure she wanted to part with it. ``I really was just pushing
the ball back today,'' said Seles, better known for pulverizing
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Seles performed like a runner whose sneakers inexplicably stuck
to the starting block. By the time Seles realized that something
significant was missing from her arsenal, the 27th-ranked Nagyova,
a ponytailed 20-year-old who had never beaten a top 10 player, had
sprinted to a 5-0 lead in a scant 18 minutes. Seles, whose 27
unforced errors included seven double faults, never came close to
catching up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the first set went by in a blitz,'' she said of the
pinpoint playmaking by Nagyova, who next plays 12th-seeded Sandrine
Testud of France.
</P>
<P>
   Seles had not played in this event since she won it seven years
ago. She had hoped that after a depressed and distracted 1998, in
which she suffered through the decline and death of her father and
coach, this season would permit a revival of the on-court focus and
ferocity that once took her to No. 1. Seles drew a blank when asked
why those qualities were nowhere in evidence Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's for me to ponder why,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The men's event, the Newsweek Champions Cup, began Monday with
less than a bang: The two-time finalist Andre Agassi, who defaulted
his semifinal at the Templeton Classic in Scottsdale, Ariz., on
Saturday due to a strained hamstring, withdrew from this
tournament. The event also lost 13th-seeded Thomas Enqvist of
Sweden. The 1999 Australian Open runner-up was upset by Russia's
Marat Safin, 6-4, 6-4.

MOTHER REGAINS CHILD IN RACIAL CUSTODY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a tug-of-war over a toddler that embodied issues of
race, class and power in Chicago, a judge ruled Monday that Edward
M. Burke, a powerful alderman, and his wife, Anne Burke, a state
appellate judge, must return the child to the birth mother, who has
overcome an addiction to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Tina Olison, who has been fighting to win back the
3-year-old child since he was taken into foster care after being
born with cocaine in his system, claimed that because of the
Burkes' positions, state child welfare authorities were improperly
siding with them in their effort to adopt the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Judith M. Brawka of state Juvenile Court, had earlier
ruled that Ms. Olison was now a fit mother. Ms. Brawka said Monday
that in her ruling she must take into account the racial heritage
of the child, who is black. The child has lived since he was 8 days
old with the Burkes, who are white.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brawka said of the state Department of Children and Family
Services, ``Unless the position of the department is that there is
no such thing as African-American culture, this issue deserves more
attention than to check a box that says not applicable.''
</P>
<P>
   As an alderman, Burke became very unpopular among blacks in the
1980s, when he vigorously opposed the city's first black mayor,
Harold Washington. As a legacy of that bitterness, a black minister
once led a protest vigil outside the alderman's office, saying that
there were ``enough Irish-Catholic children'' for Burke to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Ms. Brawka did not order the
boy turned over to Ms. Olison immediately, setting up a 12-month
transition instead. There will be visits with the mother supervised
by a counselor, and then unsupervised visits.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered that Ms. Olison be monitored by a child
welfare inspector in the coming months, and that the child could be
removed again if the mother returned to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a stern warning to the mother to cooperate with the child
welfare monitor, the judge said: ``You may not like them. You may
not trust them. But ma'am, that is life.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to the Burkes and Ms. Olison were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Children and Family Services Department, which selected
the Burkes as foster parents, can appeal. The agency has 30 days to
do so and has not yet made a decision, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Rivkin Carothers, a lawyer for Ms. Olison, said her client
was considering filing a civil rights suit against the state
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were bound to carry out the wishes of the Burkes,'' Ms.
Carothers said, ``because the Burkes are who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Maudlyne Ihejirika, a spokeswoman for the department, said there
was no favoritism shown to the Burkes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department has managed this case as it has all others,''
said Ms. Ihejirika, noting that some experts had testified that the
child should stay with the Burkes. ``All that we have ever been
interested in is the best interests of this child.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Illinois Supreme Court, citing the political and legal
prominence of the Burkes, appointed Ms. Brawka, who sits in Kane
County, to preside over the case in Cook County, which includes
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The case dates from February 1996, when Alderman Burke, who has
been on the City Council for 30 years, and Judge Burke, an Illinois
appellate judge, took custody of the foster child who has come to
be known as Baby T.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olison, 37, had a history of drug abuse. Two other children
had been taken by child welfare authorities, and placed in the
custody of Ms. Olison's mother, Cecile. When Baby T was born with
drugs in his system, Ms. Olison's mother decided not to take the
child, thinking that if her daughter were separated from him, she
would stop taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That is apparently what happened. Ms. Olison spent 18 months in
drug rehabilitation programs. State drug tests, administered to
monitor her progress, have shown no trace of drugs. She also went
to school and became a certified nursing assistant. She works for
an agency that cares for elderly patients.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, the Department of Children and Family
Services had intended to reunite Baby T with his mother. But in
August 1997, the agency changed its position and recommended that
the boy be placed for adoption. Ms. Olison's legal case helped
preclude that.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Murphy, the Cook County public guardian, whose office
served as legal counsel for Baby T, had initially argued that the
child should remain with the Burkes. About a year ago, the office
switched its position, saying the mother had taken the necessary
steps to win back her child.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the child had bonded to the Burkes, who were, by all
accounts, good parents, and that the child would suffer as a result
of being taken from them. But he said the child, who would grow up
knowing the identity of his mother and grandmother, would also
suffer from the separation from his biological family.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the case should have been resolved much earlier, and
that the time spent in the legal battle had only hurt the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no winners in this case,'' he said. &QL;

 &HT;    DiMaggio: 'Persona extended beyond playing field'
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects that relatives and friends were not at DiMaggio's
bedside when he died; they visited the day before.)
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fisherman's son who came to define not just baseball but all
American sport for mid-century America, Joe DiMaggio once said
about his life's work, ``There's no skill involved. Just go up
there and swing at the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   At once modest and aloof, the words described how DiMaggio lived
his life as well, a rich and full existence that ended early Monday
morning, when the Yankee Clipper succumbed after a fight with lung
cancer. He was 84 when he died shortly after midnight at his home
in exclusive Harbour Island, Fla.; his brother Dom, two
grandchildren and family friends had visited him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His persona extended beyond the playing field and touched all
our hearts,'' baseball commissioner Bud Selig said. ``In many
respects, as an immigrant's son, he represented the hopes and
ideals of our great country.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio came close to death late last year and twice was
administered last rites while at a local hospital. He had been home
since Jan. 19, recovering from surgery and lived long enough to
suffer the indignity of seeing his death reported prematurely on
television several weeks ago. It had been hoped that he could throw
out the first pitch for the New York Yankees' home-opener April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner visited DiMaggio last Tuesday
and said, ``He was weak but spirited and alert. I told him, 'Joe,
you have a date with the Yankees (on) opening day. We are counting
on you to throw out the first ball.' He just smiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Until his hospitalization, DiMaggio had remained vibrant and
made regular ceremonial visits to Yankee Stadium, where he was last
honored Sept. 26 on Joe DiMaggio day and presented replicas of the
10 World Series rings the Yankees won during his 13-year career.
</P>
<P>
   But he was unable to accept the club's invitation to throw out
the first pitch of the 1998 World Series and already had been
hospitalized five days when the Yankees-San Diego series began. He
was the last link to the first Yankees dynasty, having broken in
with the team in 1939, the same year Lou Gehrig was forced into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looked up to back then, since he and (Ted) Williams
were the best of their time,'' said Riverdale, Ga.'s Cecil Travis,
85, who for 11 seasons faced DiMaggio regularly as a shortstop, and
a career .314 hitter, for the Washington Senators. ``He could do
most everything. Yeah, he was a pretty good fellah to look up to. I
mean, you don't get too many bad things about him, the way you do
some of them these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Although linked forever to the 56-game hitting streak that
endures 57 years later, DiMaggio's grace in center field left a
stronger imprint on New York, which watched him rise as the first
Italian-descended sports hero the nation had produced. The fly ball
never seemed to fall until DiMaggio arrived beneath it, prompting
his detractors to gripe that he'd never had a tough chance out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't compare him to anyone,'' Travis said. ``He just
glided. He didn't stand on his head or dive or things like that.
The plays looked easy to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No outfielder is a real workman unless he can turn his back on
the ball, run his legs off and take the catch over his shoulder,''
DiMaggio once said. ``Back-pedaling outfielders get nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He had come up a shortstop, one of three baseball playing sons
of Joseph DiMaggio, an Italian-born fisherman who settled in San
Francisco. He was 17 when he signed with the Pacific Coast League's
Oakland Seals, and the following year, DiMaggio put together a
61-game hitting streak for the Seals. He finally made it to the
Bronx to stay in 1939 at age 24. Except for three years of military
service, he was the Yankees' constant presence into the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one Ted Williams admired, respected and envied
more than Joe DiMaggio,'' Williams said in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was a career .325 hitter, but batting average hardly
defined his exactitude at the plate. He went the entire 1941 season
with just 13 strikeouts in 541 at-bats. He finished his career with
369 strikeouts and 361 career homers. A three-time American League
MVP, some of his offensive statistics suffered from playing in
spacious Yankee Stadium. But DiMaggio's game was far more than
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball isn't statistics,'' New York writer Jimmy Breslin
once said. ``It's Joe DiMaggio rounding second base.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 14, 1941, DiMaggio singled off Chicago's Eddie Smith,
beginning a run that might never be equaled. Nearly a month later,
another single against the White Sox gave him a 29-game hitting
streak, breaking the Yankees' club record. Rogers Hornsby's NL
record of 33 fell, as did George Sisler's AL mark of 41. And when
historians insisted that Wee Willie Keeler had recorded a 44-game
streak in 1887, DiMaggio broke it, too, before three ground-outs
July 17 in Cleveland ended the run at 56 games.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, DiMaggio had 56 singles, 16 doubles, seven
triples and 15 home runs. The following day, he began a 16-game
streak that did not include a hit recorded in Detroit in the 1941
All-Star game. Pete Rose summoned a 44-game streak in 1978, but no
one else has come close.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, DiMaggio's shadow was diminished purposely. He
often dined alone, was polite but distant with teammates and,
partly as a result of public criticism he received in a contract
hold-out, was wary of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he said hello to you,'' Detroit's Hank Greenberg said,
``that was a long conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 37, slowed by back and foot injuries, DiMaggio turned
down a new $100,000 contract and announced his retirement in 1951
by saying simply, ``I no longer have it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last World Series that fall, he shared the Yankees
outfield with a strong kid from Oklahoma, at least until he waved
Mickey Mantle off a fly ball in Game 2. Mickey Mantle slipped and
hurt his knee on the play, opening a new chapter in Yankees lore.
</P>
<P>
   A failed marriage to Marilyn Monroe broke his heart but only
increased his public persona in retirement. Celebrated in music and
literature _ Simon and Garfunkel's ``Mrs. Robinson'' and Ernest
Hemingway's ``The Old Man and the Sea'' _ DiMaggio's name came to
represent new things to each new generation, even as he was hawking
a coffee maker.
</P>
<P>
   He sold a lot of them too, which fit a larger pattern. When
asked once how DiMaggio excelled, New York teammate Tommy Heinrich
replied, ``He does everything better than anyone else.''

SELLARS' `PEONY PAVILION' OVERLOADS THE SENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ It was midway through the second part of
``The Peony Pavilion'' _ director Peter Sellars' overstuffed,
overbearing music-theatrical extravaganza, which had its U.S.
premiere over the weekend _ that my neural circuitry began to feel
the effects of sensory overload.
</P>
<P>
   At that point the audience at Zellerbach Hall had witnessed
great swatches of traditional Chinese kun opera (delivered more or
less straight), a parallel ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' spoken version
of the same story, episodes of silent interpretive dance, banks of
video screens that relayed the proceedings in simultaneous
close-up, Western opera singing, a Gothic visit to the underworld,
some thunking rock 'n' roll drum explosions with prerecorded chorus
and pipa obbligato, and an indecipherable figure prancing about
with a velvet scourge like some white-clad dominatrix sprite.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come before Saturday's three-hour-plus performance ran
its course were lots more quasi-operatic recitative by composer Tan
Dun, a handful of ear-piercing amplified outbursts (the sure sign
of a composer fresh out of ideas), some vigorous but oddly unerotic
sexual couplings, stretches of bilingual spoken dialogue and a
stylized onstage drowning.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time there was no way to keep processing the
onslaught of theatrical effects _ and no very compelling motivation
to try.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there was no reason ``The Peony Pavilion'' should not
have emerged as the invigorating multicultural blockbuster billed
by the presenters, Cal Performances. Sellars, brimming with ideas
as ever, might have been just the person to produce a 20th century
pan-Pacific take on the ancient traditions of Chinese opera.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the frenzied activity spilled across the Zellerbach
stage on Saturday (the second of three performances) the result was
strangely empty at the core. This grab bag of ancient and
post-modern tricks turned out to be considerably less than the sum
of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   The source for this production is a 1598 verse drama by the Ming
Dynasty poet Tang Xianzu, which is the basis for one of the
mainstays of Chinese opera (a traditional version of ``The Peony
Pavilion'' was to be performed in New York last summer by a
Shanghai troupe, but the visit was scotched by the Chinese
government after the failure of some high-level diplomatic
negotiations).
</P>
<P>
   The plot has to do with a pair of star-crossed lovers _ an
impoverished student, Liu Mengmei, and a well-born young girl, Du
Liniang _ who meet in dreams and death before (I think) living
happily ever after once he has successfully exhumed her corpse.
</P>
<P>
   During the first part, Sellars intercuts two renditions of the
story. One consists of scenes from the Chinese tradition, sung with
extraordinary flair by Hua Wenyi and Shi Jiehua, two stars of the
Shanghai operatic world, and accompanied by a sparse, evocative
trio of Chinese instruments. Hua, as Du Liniang, also engages in
some silent episodes with dancer Michael Schumacher, including an
extended seduction scene that comes as close to erotic power as the
evening ever does.
</P>
<P>
   The other, much flatter, strain features actors Lauren Tom and
Joel de la Fuente speaking Cyril Birch's English translation of the
text, while handheld cameras relay their faces to an array of video
monitors scattered around George Tsypin's spare, Plexiglas-laden
set.
</P>
<P>
   Things get even more dense, and less compelling, in the long
second half, with the addition of soprano Ying Huang and tenor Lin
Qiang Xu singing their hearts out in Tan's pretentious
East-meets-West score. For most of the second half, the story is
danced, sung and spoken in triplicate, like some bureaucratic
application form.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, by piling on the redundancies and the echoes,
Sellars doesn't amplify the story so much as bury it. There is
always a lot going on, but no way to focus on any of it (``The
Peony Pavilion,'' in fact, owes as much to the American tradition
of the three-ring circus as to Chinese opera). The dominant floral
image is not so much the peony as the gilded lily.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's best moments come from some of the individual
performers. As singer, dancer and purely regal stage presence, Hua
Wenyi is a knockout, an artist whose star power easily transcends
cultural boundaries. Ying Huang's pure lyric soprano outclasses the
uninteresting vocal lines Tan has given her, and the virtuosic
contributions of Min-Xiao Fen on the pipa (a sort of Chinese lute)
stood out amid the noise of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, ``The Peony Pavilion'' felt like a huge
opportunity missed _ an attempt to fuse disparate artistic
traditions that ended up drowning under the weight of unculled
excess.

EDITORIAL: CHINESE NUCLEAR ESPIONAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, March 9:
</P>
<P>
   It is alarming to discover that lax security at the Los Alamos
nuclear weapons laboratory in the mid-1980s may have let China
steal secret designs for one of America's most compact nuclear
warheads. It is also troubling to learn that the Clinton
administration did not react vigorously enough when it first heard
of this possible breach of national security nearly four years ago.
Some administration officials suggest that the White House may have
minimized the case to insulate its goal of improving relations with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Careless security procedures have been a longstanding problem at
America's nuclear laboratories under Democratic and Republican
administrations. But a report by The Times' James Risen and Jeff
Gerth makes clear that after the 1995 discovery of possible
espionage at Los Alamos the administration moved too slowly to
investigate and to weigh the implications of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's initial inquiry lacked concentration and resources.
The Energy Department made multiple mistakes, including withholding
information about the case from Congress to avoid criticism of the
administration's China policy and initially failing to take
recommended steps to tighten security at the labs. These failures
are clear and can be directly traced to the indifferent leadership
of the department before Bill Richardson took it over late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House role is more difficult to reconstruct and
evaluate. White House aides insist that they moved quickly to
tighten lab security once they learned of the seriousness of the
case in 1997 and did not try to diminish its importance. But the
national security adviser, Samuel Berger, and his aides may have
underestimated the significance of the affair and failed to
recognize that it warranted a reassessment of relations with China.
After the case was laid out for Berger in July 1997, the White
House should have examined whether its China policy was
desensitizing Washington to Chinese efforts to acquire military
technology through espionage and trade. The White House should have
been especially vigilant because its handling of China was already
under scrutiny by Congress after allegations of illegal Chinese
campaign contributions in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration cannot have it both ways on China. It
says it is safeguarding national security. But it has unwisely
relaxed export controls and encouraged sales of advanced technology
that could compromise American defense secrets. Congress must now
carefully reconstruct the administration's handling of this episode
to determine whether wishful policy goals of engaging China took
precedence over shielding America's most important military
secrets.

CSUN GUARD REFUSES TO FAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANEL LAJ  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tina Greer's philosophy is simple: failure is not
an option.
</P>
<P>
   That's why growing up in a tough neighborhood never concerned
Greer, a sophomore guard at Cal State Northridge. The gang
activity, drugs and apathy so prevalent around her Washington High
neighborhood were never an issue. Nothing would deprive her of
becoming a success, and none of this surprises her coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very much in control of her business off the court,''
said Cal State Northridge coach Frozena Jerro, whose team makes its
first Div. I NCAA Tournament appearance Thursday at Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to be successful and works hard at it,'' Jerro said.
``I like her ambition. She knows what she wants and goes out to get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer's collegiate career began at Xavier University, where she
experienced too many losses and too much apathy. She'd been on
winning teams throughout high school, and transferred to CSUN even
though that required her to redshirt last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that she was just homesick at Xavier and it
wasn't just the losing; I think it was more than that,'' said her
Washington High basketball coach, Julie Rousseau. ``I think she
lost a little when she went to Xavier. . . . I think she kind of
doubted herself and that hurt her a bit. She lost that tiger
instinct, but she worked really hard to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who collected 84 assists and 43 steals in her 17 games
with the Musketeers, said she didn't fit into Xavier's program or
the role they wanted her to play. It was too structured for her
free-style and fast-paced game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (redshirting) allowed her to reflect on what was going
on,'' Rousseau said. ``She's not a quitter or the the kind of
person that retreats. She never lost sight of her goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer admits she was initially skeptical about the Matadors
program. Could a team that won only four games the entire 1996-97
season win a championship? But she's found success where no one
else thought to look.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who leads the team in steals with 70 and is third in
scoring with 224 points, is known for her quickness and tenacious
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's our number one defender,'' said teammate Lynda Amari.
``When I see her, she makes me want to play defense. She's gotten a
lot better. . . . She listens very well when you try and tell her
things on the court. She likes to learn and I respect her because
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy at CSUN. Before she played her first game
for the Matadors, the head coach was arrested and controversy
swelled around a program that had received little publicity before.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the (coach) Michael Abraham situation happened, she was
probably the first player to say, `Look, things like this happen,
and we just have to get through it,' '' Jerro said. ``Giving up and
the option to fail was never there. It didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer prides herself on this growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've grown a lot and matured not only as a player but
as a person,'' Greer said. ``Xavier just completely turned me
around. . . . I had to act more mature and I had to step my ways up
and stop acting so wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to look at myself as being self-striving. I don't need
to depend on anybody else. . . . If a difficult situation comes
along, you have to know how to approach it, deal with it and then
go on.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this type of attitude that helped Greer cope with one of
her biggest challenges: going to school and becoming independent.
She had to separate herself from a close-knit family.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's daddy's girl,'' said Dianna Greer. ``And when she went
away she had to learn to fend for herself and learn to do
everything. She learned to budget her money and deal with what
little she had. She has matured a lot. She's a very strong person
and we're really proud of her.''

ARIZONA TRASH HAULER ACQUIRES TEXAS-BASED BFI 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NELSON ANTOSH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Browning-Ferris Industries, the company whose garbage
trucks have been a fixture on Houston streets for decades, is being
acquired by Allied Waste Industries, which plans to move BFI's
headquarters to Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The $9.1 billion deal, which includes assuming some debt, will
be the largest cash transaction ever in the trash-hauling industry.
Currently, Allied is the nation's third-largest hauler while BFI is
the nation's second-largest.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of BFI and Allied will be run by Allied's senior
management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be job losses in Houston,'' said Thomas Van
Weelden, Allied's chairman, president and chief executive during a
news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say how many jobs will be lost here, he said.
However, operations such as accounting will likely to be moved to
Scottsdale. It will probably take a year after the deal closes to
sort out everything, Allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston BFI offices will probably function as a satellite for
the corporate offices in Scottsdale, a Phoenix suburb. As a highly
decentralized company, there are no trucks with Allied Waste
painted on their doors.
</P>
<P>
   BFI employs about 26,000 people in North America, including
2,500 in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition, Allied will have revenues of about $6.6
billion and own a national network of landfills, collection and
transfer operations.
</P>
<P>
   The younger, leaner and faster-growing Allied operates in 28
states, has 7,500 employees and generated annualized revenues of
about $1.7 billion. BFI has annualized revenues of $4.2 billion. It
operates in about 45 states and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar BFI trucks will continue to roll down the city's
streets ``for years to come,'' Van Weelden said.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce its substantial debt load, Allied plans to sell about
$900 million in nonstrategic businesses. Based on recent mergers in
the waste industry, Van Weelden expects the Justice Department to
request that it divest some assets in certain markets.
</P>
<P>
   There is some overlap in 20 to 25 markets, Van Weelden said. BFI
operates in about 125 markets.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Waste, which started here in 1987 and in 1993 moved to
Scottsdale, said it will offer $45 a share for BFI's stock. In
addition, it will assume about $1.8 billion of BFI's debt.
</P>
<P>
   This is a hefty premium for stock that recently has been trading
for about $31 per share. BFI's stock started moving last week on
speculation of a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has already been approved by the boards of directors of
both companies. Closing is expected during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   BFI was surprised by the offer, said Bruce Ranck, president and
chief executive. At $45 per share, in cash, it was ``simply too
good for use to ignore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied has doubled its size in the past year, mostly through
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, during fiscal 1998, BFI, which got its start in
Houston 30 years ago, spent $25.5 million acquiring 30 businesses.
Its strategy has been to earn customers rather than buy them.
</P>
<P>
   But during a period from about 1970 to 1987, said Van Weelden,
BFI's growth was spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   When that growth slowed, the Wall Street investors turned their
attention to younger competitors. Recently, BFI has been buying its
own stock to strengthen the price.
</P>
<P>
   Trash hauling is particularly well suited for consolidation
because there are so many duplicate costs that can be eliminated,
said Mel Cody, financial analyst for Sanders Morris Mundy in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   If you have two companies running routes in the same
neighborhood, he said, a merger can eliminate one of those trucks
and still produce the same tonnage.
</P>
<P>
   A misadventure in the recycling business was a factor in a
reorganization of BFI in 1996 and a shift in its focus to internal
growth. The company is one of the nation's largest recyclers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the recycling business was at an all-time high,
BFI enjoyed its best year ever. But prices for recovered
commodities such as waste paper collapsed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company has recovered during the past three years with
earnings increasing by double digits each year, Ranck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very optimistic about our future,'' he said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BFI has been under more pressure to sell since last year when
there was talk of an approach by Allied, Cody said. But there never
was a formal offer by Allied for BFI.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, USA Waste Services, then Houston's other major trash
hauler, gobbled up Waste Management of Oak Brook, Ill., which with
BFI were pioneers in putting together big companies by acquiring
small trash haulers by the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   The Waste Management name was retained, making Houston the home
of a $13 billion per year giant that is the largest
garbage-collecting, landfill and recycling company in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   People were impressed when Waste Management cut costs by $800
million after the acquisition, Cody said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board had to sit up and take notice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And since that time BFI has had trouble implementing a new
software program that would have tied its operations together.
Plus, some feel that BFI is still ``a little cost-heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied is predicting $290 million in cost savings during the
first 12 months after the acquisition is closed. Ultimately, it
expects savings of $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   Competitor Rod Proto, president and chief operating officer of
Waste Management, said Van Weelden understands that the garbage
business should be locally managed and that he would steer the new
company away from BFI's more centralized style of management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, the big companies have moved people around too
much, so they are not perceived as local anymore. If you are going
to compete locally, you've got to manage locally,'' Proto said.

NYC SCHOOLS CHIEF DROPS THREAT TO QUIT OVER VOUCHER ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Mayor Rudolph Giuliani standing at his side, New
York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew Monday withdrew his threat
to resign _ at least for now _ as the two men said they would try
to work out their differences over using city money to send
public-school students to private and religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Crew had threatened to resign last week because Giuliani had
launched a feverish campaign to lobby members of the Board of
Education to approve a $12 million plan for the school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The two men emerged smiling and joking Monday from a
face-to-face meeting at City Hall, but some strain showed beneath
the surface, and it was clear that their differences were far from
resolved. It was also clear that Crew had withdrawn his threat to
resign because the mayor had said that for now, he would not try to
bring the issue to a vote of the Board of Education, although he
reserved the right to do so later.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Giuliani in the ornate City Hall rotunda, Crew
said his threat to resign was ``held in abeyance.'' He added:
``Let's assume I don't want to resign, which I don't. But let's
assume that this is an issue that needs further discussion, which
it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani quickly interjected: ``He's not going to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew's promise to try to resolve the issue defused a six-day
standoff that threatened to destabilize New York City's
often-beleaguered school system, which has seen chancellors come
and go every few years.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Giuliani and Crew broke into public view
last Wednesday evening, when aides to Crew said that he had told
the mayor he would resign if the board passed a vouchers program.
Crew has said that he sees vouchers as an assault on public
education. Giuliani sees his proposal as an attempt to provide
children in poor neighborhoods a choice beyond often troubled
public schools.

CITING RACIAL IMPACT, JUDGE DISCARDS NCAA TEST-SCORE RULE

<P>
   A U.S. District Court in Philadelphia on Monday discarded the
National Collegiate Athletic Association's minimum test score
requirement for athletic scholarships, throwing into disarray a
long-accepted criterion for establishing eligibility for
student-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   In a 54-page decision, the judge, Ronald I. Buckwalter, held
that the NCAA's SAT and ACT minimum test score requirement, as
outlined in Proposition 16, ``has an unjustified disparate impact
against African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge cited the NCAA's own research showing that the
practice harmed black students' chances of being declared
academically eligible and that the organization's goal of improving
graduation rates _ the reason it instituted Proposition 16 in the
first place _ could be achieved by other available methods.
</P>
<P>
   Elsa Kircher Cole, general counsel for the NCAA, said the
organization would seek a stay of the judge's ruling, perhaps as
early as Tuesday, so it could continue an ongoing review of
Proposition 16 in an ``orderly'' fashion. She acknowledged,
however, that the ruling takes control of athletic eligibility out
of the NCAA's hands and may create chaos for hundreds of schools
across the nation that routinely grant athletic scholarships based
on NCAA standards for test scores, grade-point average and core
curriculum. If the ruling stands, individual colleges and
institutions can make their own decision on the eligibility
requirements for athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five hundred schools will go out and try to create their own
rule in an area they relied on us for expertise, and we don't think
that that benefits the student athlete,'' Cole said. ``The chaos
we're in is that there's no direction or consistency about who
qualifies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, an
advocacy group that was representing the plaintiffs in the
class-action suit, charged in its case that the minimum test
requirement was a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In his
ruling Monday, Buckwalter agreed, saying that the NCAA could be
sued under that act, which prohibits race discrimination by
educational institutions that receive federal funds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The court's finding that the NCAA is covered by Title VI is
critical to ending discrimination in intercollegiate athletics,''
said the staff attorney for the Trial Lawyers for Public Justice,
Adele P. Kimmel. ``This effectively means that the NCAA can be held
accountable if it discriminates on the basis of race, sex,
disability or other impermissible factors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the current suit, the NCAA has denied it receives any such
funds, but the plaintiffs developed evidence that they say shows
that the association is the indirect recipient of millions of
dollars targeted for a National Youth Sports Program fund. The NCAA
contends that it is just a pass-through mechanism to distribute the
money to schools throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 16 was instituted beginning with the April 1995 SAT
exam. It required students to achieve a minimum score of 820 out of
a possible 1,600. But the debate over the appropriateness of using
test scores to determine college eligibility extends beyond sports,
with many advocacy groups asserting that the tests are not free of
cultural bias.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was originally brought by two African-American
students, Tai Kwan Cureton and Leatrice Shaw. Cureton graduated
from Simon Gratz High School in Philadelphia in June 1996 and
ranked 27th in a class of 305. According to the lawsuit, he earned
academic honors and athletic honors in his sport, track. But he did
not do well on the SAT, and when he fell below the cutoff point, he
was not admitted to or offered athletic financial aid by any
Division I schools.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw also graduated from Simon Gratz in June 1996 and ranked
fifth in the class. She was, said the complaint, a member of the
National Honor Society who earned academic honors and also excelled
in track. But she, like Cureton, failed to meet the minimum score
required by Proposition 16. In the end, only one school offered her
financial aid, the University of Miami, which she now attends. She
was not permitted to compete on the track team during her freshman
year.
</P>
<P>
   A trial had been scheduled to begin this spring, but Cureton's
lawyers moved for summary judgment, contending that on the law
alone, the requirement could not be justified. On Monday the judge
agreed.

COMMISSIONER SAYS POLICE DID NOT SEEK TO TAINT CHARACTER OF SLAIN
MAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir acknowledged Monday
that police investigators entered the home of Amadou Diallo and
questioned his roommates in the hours after officers fatally shot
the unarmed man. But the commissioner strongly denied any
suggestions that they were trying to taint Diallo's character to
justify the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief news conference at City Hall, Safir rejected
accusations made over the weekend by lawyers for the Diallo family:
that soon after Diallo was killed on Feb. 4 in the vestibule of his
apartment building in the Bronx, investigators ransacked his
apartment and questioned his roommates at a police station house
for hours about Diallo's habits and character without telling them
that he had been killed by the police.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers, Peter J. Neufeld, accused the police of
trying to find a piece of damaging evidence to ``dirty up'' Diallo
and help justify the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir took issue with such assertions. He said that the
detectives who handled the inquiry ``followed the normal procedures
they would follow in any shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that in going to Diallo's apartment, the officers
were searching only for identification and information that would
help them locate his relatives to notify them about the killing. He
said that Diallo's roommates went voluntarily to the station house
and were free to leave any time they wanted, and that they were
told that Diallo had been shot by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives, from a special Night Watch unit that handles
major investigations that break overnight, entered Diallo's
apartment only after they asked for permission, Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That permission was granted,'' Safir said. ``They did not
ransack anything. They were looking for identification of Diallo
and that was the extent of it. These charges _ of them intimidating
and ransacking an apartment _ are just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of Diallo's roommates, Abdou Rahman Diallo, a cousin by
marriage, said in a telephone interview Monday that he never gave
the police permission to enter the apartment. ``I tried to close
the door, but they came in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Abdou Diallo said that although he was questioned for six
hours at the local station house, he did not learn that Amadou
Diallo had been shot by the police until he went home around 7 a.m.
and found out from a reporter's telephone call. He said that when
he got home, two wardrobes had been emptied of clothing, the
mattresses on the beds had been disturbed and the curtains had been
removed from a window.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld questioned why the police would conduct such a thorough
search for a piece of identification.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suggestion that they were searching for identification is
ridiculous,'' Neufeld said. ``One, his wallet was found next to
him. Two, the roommates could identify him. And three, you don't
have to ransack people's wardrobes and pull their curtains from the
window in the hopes of finding an ID card.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior police official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that while Diallo's wallet was found next to his
body, it was possible that the detectives were looking for more
complete identification to help them find Diallo's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo's other roommate, Momodu Kujabi, could not be
reached for comment by telephone Monday.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, March 9:
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost half a century since Joe DiMaggio turned his
center-field kingdom in Yankee Stadium over to a strapping
youngster named Mickey Mantle, but even now, in death, DiMaggio
still owns that green acreage. He roamed the great open spaces
there with a grace and grandeur that redefined the art of fielding.
Even more than the prolific hitting that earned him enduring fame,
his silky, seemingly effortless motion across the outfield grass
was the signature of his game.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was one of those rare sports stars, like Babe Ruth,
Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan, who not only set new standards of
athletic excellence but also became a distinctive part of American
culture. As stylish off the field as on, DiMaggio was an icon of
elegance and success, a name as recognizable on Broadway and in
Hollywood as at the ball park. Millions of baby boomers who never
saw DiMaggio play instantly understood the reference in the Paul
Simon song of the 1960s _ ``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A
nation turns its lonely eyes to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Other men have hit the ball farther and run the bases faster,
but few have excelled at so many elements of the sport. DiMaggio's
56-game hitting streak in 1941 remains untouched, one of the great
benchmarks of consistency and productivity in all of sports. In 13
seasons with the Yankees, DiMaggio produced a career batting
average of .325, hit 361 home runs and knocked in more than 100
runs in a season nine times. He played in 10 World Series, 9 of
which the Yankees won. He possessed one of the sweetest swings
baseball has ever seen, a hitting stroke of such precision that he
struck out only 369 times in his major league career.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers alone do not explain the DiMaggio mystique. Part
of it was his brief, turbulent marriage to Marilyn Monroe and his
taste for nightclubs and tony hotels. Part of it was his
$100,000-a-year salary, a small fortune in his days as a Yankee.
For younger fans, there was also an almost mystical link to the
past _ DiMaggio joined the Yankees in 1936, just two years after
Babe Ruth left and before Lou Gehrig retired. His appearance on
ceremonial occasions at Yankee Stadium in recent years was
thrilling for fans of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   His fame also flowed from the aura of quiet dignity that
DiMaggio carefully preserved throughout his career and retirement.
With the notable exception of his service as a pitchman for the
Bowery Savings Bank and coffee brewing appliances, he dodged the
celebrity limelight. The mystery only added to his allure.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, who was 84, died with opening day a month away. Though
he will no longer return to Yankee Stadium to deliver the
ceremonial first pitch, his singular record of athletic achievement
and classy conduct will be long revered.

BASEBALL HERO JOE DIMAGGIO DIES AT AGE 84 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, the fisherman's son from San Francisco who set one
of baseball's most heroic records and became an almost mythic
figure in American culture, died Monday morning at his Hollywood,
Fla., home at age 84 after months of ebbing health.
</P>
<P>
   In October, DiMaggio underwent surgery for lung cancer in
Florida and rallied at least twice from serious infections during a
99-day hospital stay. He was released Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   A ballplayer of uncommon grace, DiMaggio was an almost painfully
private man who resisted celebrity. Yet several events gave him an
aura of mystery and romance. He loved and lost actress Marilyn
Monroe, sex goddess of the 1950s. He was celebrated in a hugely
popular hit song of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   And his 56-game hitting streak, achieved in 1941 against a
backdrop of a nation on the brink of war, survives today, 58 years
later. In 1969, it was voted the greatest individual accomplishment
in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   His wedding to Monroe in 1954 was a union of Hollywood and
sports royalty. When the marriage failed a year later, humorist
Oscar Levant observed, ``It simply proves that no man can be great
at two national pastimes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his greatness on the diamond that defined DiMaggio. He
was the link among three New York Yankees eras that fused into a
continuing dynasty. Joining the Yankees as a rookie in 1936,
DiMaggio followed Babe Ruth and preceded Mickey Mantle. He retired
after appearing in his 10th World Series in 1951, Mantle's first
season.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was one of nine children of a father born in Sicily.
His brothers, Vince and Dominic, also played in the big leagues,
Dom becoming his rival as a center fielder with the Boston Red Sox.
The boys grew up around fishing boats and played minor-league ball
for San Francisco in the Pacific Coast League. Joe D. was an
introvert, but he never doubted his ability. He had trouble talking
about it, however, suppressing his emotions to such a point that it
caused him no small amount of suffering.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of his streak May 15, 1941, to its finish July
17, the Yankee Clipper developed stomach miseries that led to an
ulcer. He once confided he smoked up to three packs of cigarettes a
day, ducking into the dugout runway between innings. He would have
lit one in center field if baseball had let him.
</P>
<P>
   If he suffered, his performance did not, because DiMaggio was
beyond question one of the greatest players ever. Then he became
something more when Paul Simon wrote a song for the 1967 movie
``The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Robinson'' contained a haunting line that sent the
country on a mass identity search:
</P>
<P>
   ``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
</P>
<P>
   ``A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?
</P>
<P>
   ``Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.''
</P>
<P>
   That one lyric became a lasting commentary on sports and its
role in our society and our fantasy lives. Was it a plaintive wail
for a more innocent time, or an ode to our youth, when heroes made
worshippers of all of us and baseball was boss?
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio wasn't sure. He thought it might be a putdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard the lines,'' he said, ``I didn't like it. I
didn't know what to make of it. Then the kids who wrote the song
called and said they meant it to be a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means,'' said Simon, who with Art Garfunkel took the song
to No. 1, ``whatever you wanted it to mean.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he added, ``It has something to do with heroes, people
who are all good, with no bad in them. That was the way I always
saw Joe DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was tall, darkly handsome, custom tailored, always
reserved. In his later years, he was still lean and distinguished
in looks, and free of the tension that gripped him during most of
his existence. Once repulsed by cocktail parties and promotions of
any kind, he learned to cope, turning up at old-timers games and
celebrity golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation discovered him on television plugging Mr.
Coffee, but he turned down countless other offers. He was never
comfortable on TV, giving infrequent interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I be uncomfortable,'' he said, ``just for the
money?''
</P>
<P>
   In the worldly scheme of things, he felt it mattered little
whether anyone broke his 56-game hitting record. But in this age of
super youth and super science, it hasn't been done, and he politely
rejected the usual excuses.
</P>
<P>
   He did not believe modern travel to be more hectic and,
therefore, more draining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that at all,'' he once said on a visit to Houston.
``Train travel wasn't easy. We would leave New York after a game
and ride 24 hours to St. Louis and sometimes go right from the
station to the park for a night game. Sleeping on trains never has
been easy. Air conditioning was poor. And if you raised a window,
you got soot and cinders in your face.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will convince me that guys flying in jets are not more
rested than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's hitters also benefit from artificial turf, weight
training and special diets. In DiMaggio's time, any player who
avoided boze and fatty foods was considered a health nut.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio had a lifetime batting average of .325 and was an
artist in center field, turning long fly balls into easy outs. He
hit 361 homers (while striking out only 369 times), playing half
his games in Yankee Stadium, a ballpark built for the lefthanded
Ruth. His teammates boasted that DiMaggio, a righthanded hitter
with a classic stride, would have hit 400 more home runs if he had
played in Boston's Fenway Park, with its short left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no enduring record in baseball carries the weight and aura
of DiMaggio's streak. He was 26 that summer, and he belonged to the
whole country. He kept the fans sitting by their radios until the
war news _ from places like Stalingrad and Singapore _ had ended.
Then the announcer would advise them that, yes, Joltin' Joe had got
his hit today to keep the string alive.
</P>
<P>
   He would serve three years in the Army, but for one captivating
summer he provided a distraction from the outbreak of global
temper. On July 17, he got into a cab with his roommate, pitcher
Lefty Gomez, for the ride to Cleveland's stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver recognized me,'' DiMaggio recalled. ``He said,
`Joe, I think it will end tonight.' When he said that, Lefty jumped
all over him and really chewed him out. But he was right. Ken
Keltner made two great plays (at third base), and Lou Boudreau (the
shortstop) made the last one on a ball that jumped up and almost
hit him on the shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The streak was over at 56 games, well beyond the previous record
of 44, set by Wee Willie Keeler in 1897.
</P>
<P>
   The record was no fluke. After the Indians stopped him, DiMaggio
hit safely in his next 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   His image is fixed in memory, gliding under long fly balls and
ripping another base hit. He was voted into the Hall of Fame in
1955, the year of his divorce from Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   His friends said he never stopped loving her, but their natures
and lifestyles were at odds. Gay Talese, writing in Esquire
magazine, described the movie star's return from Korea, where she
had entertained U.S. troops, drawing crowds of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so wonderful, Joe,'' she said, breathlessly. ``You've
never heard such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have,'' he said softly.
</P>
<P>
   When Monroe died in 1962 at the age of 36, DiMaggio ordered
fresh flowers placed on her grave weekly. When the florist asked
for how long, he took out a pen and wrote one word across the
invoice: ``Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   At DiMaggio's bedside when he died Monday were his brother,
Dominic; two grandchildren, Paula and Cathy; Morris Engelberg, his
neighbor and longtime attorney; and Joe Nacchio, his friend of 59
years.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio will be buried in San Francisco.

   A roundup of styling trends seen so far on the runways in New
York and Milan, Italy:
</P>
<P>
   It may be just a straw in the wind, or else the first sign of a
change of direction for hair, but curls are back. They appeared on
several runways for fall, including that of Versace, which
abandoned last season's '70s-straight dos for flyaway curls on
models.
</P>
<P>
   Belts, too. They might be leather thongs tied at the waist or
under the bosom, or wide bands of leather or fabric slung around
the hips. For fall, low-riding skirts and pants have been the rule,
but even slinky dresses are often shown with hip belts.
</P>
<P>
   With skirts from micro-mini to floor-sweeping, boots are making
a strong showing, especially midcalf high with flat or chunky high
heels.
</P>
<P>
   And the trendy color is orange, in shades from pale to strong.
But it's not to be worn with black, except on Halloween. It goes
with browns and earth tones.

LAWSUIT ACCUSES POLICE OF RACIALLY BIASED SEARCHES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By   BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A civil rights advocacy group asked a federal judge
in Manhattan on Monday to halt the operations of the New York City
Police Department's elite Street Crimes Unit, which it said had
illegally stopped and searched tens of thousands of people because
they were members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation that the police were searching people because of
their race, a practice known as profiling, drew immediate denials
from police and city officials. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he
``would not dignify'' the charges with a response.
</P>
<P>
   The city's top lawyer, Michael D. Hess, said that the police did
not search people on the basis of race, and that ``the
stop-and-frisks were carried out in a constitutional fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``it would not be surprising if the majority
of those stop-and-frisks'' took place in neighborhoods heavily
populated by members of minority groups, because of higher crime
rates in those neighborhoods and because the Street Crimes Unit
concentrates on drugs, guns and crimes of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder statistics that involve dead bodies don't lie and
cannot be fudged,'' he said. ``If minority communities are going to
be properly protected, the stop-and-frisks must take place in those
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by the National Congress for Puerto Rican
Rights, asked Judge Michael B. Mukasey of federal District Court in
Manhattan to authorize a class action suit on behalf of all people
who had been subjected to the stop-and-frisk practices. Two people
were also named as plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Using police statistics, the suit estimated that the Street
Crimes Unit had stopped and searched 35,000 people and then
released them without further action during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which seeks unspecified damages against the city, also
accuses the unit of requiring officers to meet monthly quotas for
arrests and seizures of illegal guns. The policy intensifies the
pressure on officers to search, or ``toss,'' people
indiscriminately, the suit says, in hopes of finding a firearm,
without regard to whether the search was justified. The suit also
asks that the department be ordered to improve screening, training
and supervision of the unit's approximately 380 officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Daniels, executive director of the Center for Constitutional
Rights, whose lawyers filed the lawsuit, said the group had found
``a sweeping pattern of aggressive policing that is out of control
and, at the heart of it, we believe, unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed as calls have increased for greater
federal intervention in the investigation of the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo, who was killed by four officers from the Bronx
Street Crimes unit. Last Friday, the Civil Rights Commission in
Washington said it would open an investigation into the city's
police practices, at which Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir are expected to be asked to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Giuliani, Safir and other city officials seemed anxious
to squelch any suggestion that the officers were involved in
selecting members of minority groups, an accusation that has
surfaced less formally during previous criticism of the mayor's
quality of life efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street Crimes does not engage in any racial profiling,'' Safir
said, ``nor do we anywhere else in the NYPD.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the lawsuit was the first time he had heard
charges of racial profiling. ``I would not dignify it with a
comment,'' he added, ``because this could be somebody trying to
create a story when one doesn't have a right to exist at this
point.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The racial profiling issue has come under legal scrutiny in
other places, such as New Jersey, where the Justice Department is
conducting a civil rights investigation into whether state troopers
have been illegally singling out black drivers on state highways.
</P>
<P>
   In asking for an end to racial profiling, the suit against the
New York police contends that race and national origin have been
``an integral part'' of the Street Crime Unit's policy, and that in
many cases its searches have not been based on reasonable suspicion
that criminal activity is taking place, which is the standard set
by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Perez, national coordinator of the National Congress for
Puerto Rican Rights, said the unit's practices have ``amounted to a
suspension of the Constitution in Puerto Rican and black
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to be done about it,'' he said. ``If we don't
have constitutional protections, to whom does the Constitution
apply? Not us? Is the Constitution only applicable in white
communities?''

SONY TO CUT 17,000 JOBS AND REORGANIZE 3 UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Use of ``Tuesday'' is CQ.) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Sony Corp. announced a sweeping corporate overhaul
Tuesday aimed at decisively changing the company's identity from a
manufacturer of consumer electronics to a provider of digital
network services similar to Cisco Systems or Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a change in our organization but in the whole
Sony group,'' Norio Ohga, Sony's chairman, said at a hastily called
news conference Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sony plans to eliminate 10 percent of its work force, or about
17,000 jobs, through attrition and a hiring freeze, and to close 15
manufacturing plants around the world by the end of March 2003 as
part of its reorganization. Sony will also reabsorb three publicly
traded companies _ Sony Music Entertainment Inc., Sony Chemicals
Corp. and Sony Precision Technology Inc. _ in which it holds
majority stakes, and reduce the number of internal group companies
to three, from 10.
</P>
<P>
   Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's president, said these steps would help to
restore the company's profitability, which has been battered by the
global economic slump, but that a change in focus was also needed.
Idei said Sony's new focus would be the network business _
essentially the business of linking consumers to a variety of
services either through their computers or their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make it possible for Sony's customers to directly
link themselves with our products and services and for Sony to
distribute its movies, music, games and personal finance tools and
services directly to its customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the company intends to supply not only the
computers and television sets through which people will gain access
to its movies and music but also the pipeline. Idei said Sony would
invest aggressively over the next three years in research and
development, equipment, plants, and building the infrastructure
necessary to provide services for what he called a
``network-centric'' world.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors have been expecting Sony to take off in a
new direction as its bread-and-butter consumer electronics business
has slipped into the red, as the business has become more and more
competitive. The company's shares jumped 7.5 percent Tuesday
morning as news of the change in direction seeped out of the room
where Sony was holding its news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The company whetted appetites last week when it unveiled the
next generation of its immensely popular Play Station game console
and the cutting edge central processor that is its heart. The
processor was developed jointly with Toshiba Corp. ``Apparently,
the technology has applications beyond mere game machines, not only
in bringing digital consumer electronics to the home but also in
telecommunication and other areas,'' said Scott Foster, a high-tech
analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Kutaragi, the president of Sony Computer Entertainment, the
subsidiary responsible for Play Station, described the new chip as
a ``technology driver'' for Sony.

STOP! EXPERTS CRITICAL OF STUDY ON AGGRESSIVE DRIVING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAN FELDSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A national group reported Monday that people are more
likely to be killed by aggressive, stressed-out driving in cities
like Houston that have few alternatives to the automobile.
</P>
<P>
   But several experts who reviewed the methodology said the report
showed very little _ except that when more people drive, more
people die driving.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has heard from the Surface Transportation Policy Project
before. Based in Washington, D.C., it monitors transportation
legislation and advocates alternatives to pavement, including bike
paths, sidewalks and public transit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it released a report on vehicle-pedestrian deaths and
serious injuries, saying that sprawling cities like Houston were
more dangerous for walkers than compact cities in the Northeast
like New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Now it says that sprawling Southern and Western cities like
Houston also have higher rates of aggressive driving deaths. It
rated Houston 14th worst out of 37 major metropolitan areas and
rated Texas 15th out of the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   In both the walking and driving studies, the solution is
providing more alternatives to the car, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many Houston residents would say ``amen'' to that.
The Texas Department of Transportation and city of Houston seem
unable to start building a promised 360-mile bike network through
the city. And it is probable that residents will be voting on
construction of a light rail system this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But a comparison of the methodologies for the walking report and
the driving report seems to show that the fix is in against Houston
from the folks back east.
</P>
<P>
   In the walking study, the project took each major city in the
country and divided the number of pedestrian fatalities by the
amount of walking activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the driving study, however, it took the number of aggressive
driving deaths and divided by the total population _ not by the
amount of driving.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, one study showed the relative danger of
performing the activity (walking), while the other simply showed
the overall likelihood of getting killed by the activity (driving)
in a given city.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem obvious that cities with more driving _ or, as the
new report put it, fewer alternatives to driving _ would have more
aggressive driving deaths and more driving deaths overall, said
several experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if people in Boston and Houston have equally mean
drivers, people in Houston will die more because they drive more,''
said Charles Peters, associate professor of mathematics at the
University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the walking study, a city like New York was found to have
nearly three times as much pedestrian activity as Houston, meaning
New York was excused for three times as many deaths per 100,000
population.
</P>
<P>
   If the Surface Transportation Policy Project were a pro-driving,
anti-walking group, it could have reversed the methods of its two
reports. Perhaps it would have found that pedestrians in the
Northeast need to jump into a car before they get run over.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's alternative forms of presenting data, people
choose the ones that support their theory,'' said Stephen
Klineberg, Rice professor of sociology and author of an annual poll
surveying attitudes in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation project's reports are self-published and
handed out to the press corps. That contrasts with studies in
academic journals that require peer review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of thumb is that the writer believes the theory more
than the data. So the reviewer looks at the data to see if it
justifies the theory,'' Klineberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Garland, a co-author of the driving report, said the
walking and driving reports were not meant to be compared.
</P>
<P>
   If a variable like vehicle-miles traveled in each city were used
in the comparison, ``it wouldn't demonstrate what we're trying to
say,'' Garland said.

   Peters, Klineberg and James Bradley of Calvin College in
Michigan, author of ``The Uses and Misuses of Data and Models,''
also had other concerns about the project's reports. The amount of
walking activity in each city was calculated using a U.S. Census
survey on the percentage of people who walk to work.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston it was 2.3 percent, and in the New York region it was
6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those may be the best walking statistics available, but they
don't represent recreational walking and jogging. The differences
in those numbers, if they existed, might be enough to change the
results, Bradley said.

   Defining ``aggressive driving'' raised a host of other problems.
The transportation project used federal fatality data, searching
for accident causes like improper lane changes, speeding over 80
mph, high-speed chases and failure to obey traffic signals. It did
not include deaths caused by drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   On police reports, failure to obey traffic signals is a huge
factor in fatalities, but that doesn't necessarily equate to
aggressive driving. Much of it is inattention, police say.
</P>
<P>
   The five worst metropolitan areas for aggressive driving deaths
were found to be Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif.; Tampa-St.
Petersburg; Phoenix; Orlando and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The five best were Boston, the New York area, Minneapolis-St.
Paul, Pittsburgh and the Norfolk, Va., area.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Faul, spokeswoman for the AAA Foundation for Traffic
Safety, said she was surprised that the report found Boston drivers
to be the least likely to kill each other by aggressive driving.
</P>
<P>
   In federally funded surveys of motorists, she said, New England
drivers were judged to exhibit double the rate of aggressive
driving habits when compared to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this study proves what they say it proves,'' she
said.
