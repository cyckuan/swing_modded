U.S. LOSES STEAM IN SOCCER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Clive Charles pounced on his opportunity.
Which was more than you could say for his team Tuesday night. The
U.S. men's soccer coach was asked how far Americans have come in
closing the ``talent gap'' with the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for someone to ask that question,'' Charles
said. ``I'm not going to talk about gaps. The gap is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   One wouldn't have known it from the 3-1 drubbing Spain inflicted
on the U.S. before 39,800 spectators on a cool, rainy evening at
Sydney Football Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., so resilient in advancing to the semifinals, dissolved
before the talented Spaniards and now plays for the bronze medal
against Chile on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Spain plays Cameroon for the gold on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Charles conceded his team was ``a yard behind'' throughout the
lopsided game but attributed much of it to fatigue from a punishing
schedule that included a 120-minute game Saturday night. ``The gas
tank was empty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' players were more inclined to concede they ran into a
better team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of guys on that team who are going to be
making a lot of money soon,'' U.S. defender Jeff Agoos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran out of legs, then we ran out of ideas,'' forward Josh
Wolff said. ``They scored on two of the first three chances. That
tells you what kind of stage we're on.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain was quicker, more cohesive and sure on the ball. The
Americans had trouble stringing together passes or even holding the
ball for more than a touch or two. A display of the sort that
brought back decade-old memories for followers of U.S.
international soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That final ball was never really there,'' Charles conceded.
``That first touch was never really there, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain and its collection of first-rate talent had much to do
with that. Most impressive was AC Milan striker Jose Mari, who
scored a goal and set up the other two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went from a minus to a plus-plus,'' Spain coach Inaki Saez
said of Mari.
</P>
<P>
   Spain took control quickly. Jose Mari stripped U.S. defender
Danny Califf at midfield, brought the ball to the right side of the
box and crossed it to forward Tamudo, who needed only to extend his
leg to redirect the ball into the goal in the 16th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Spain went up 2-0 in the 25th minute. Califf fell while
defending Jose Mari at the top of the box and the Spaniard rolled
the ball through Frankie Hejduk's legs and into the path of Angulo,
who beat goalkeeper Brad Friedel from close range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is an easy game when you score early,'' U.S. midfielder
Peter Vagenas said.
</P>
<P>
   Agoos said Califf shouldn't bear too much blame. ``You're
talking about a guy making $30,000 in the MLS, trying to mark a
couple of guys who are going to make hundreds of thousands,'' Agoos
said. ``Spain has world-class strikers.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. closed to 2-1 in the 42nd minute when Angulo knocked
over Hejduk in the box, and Vagenas converted the penalty _ his
third in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks appeared to be back in it, but they never generated a
serious scoring threat in the second half as Spain dropped nine
players into the defense. The modestly talented U.S. midfielders
couldn't negotiate the thicket of Spaniards down the middle of the
field, and Wolff, the top U.S. scoring threat, was marked into
invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   Spain clinched in the 87th minute when Jose Mari put in a
deflection off the hands of Friedel, who had blocked a shot by
Tamudo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. played without midfielder Ben Olsen, who has a bad
ankle. Charles also made two quick substitutions, bringing on
Landon Donovan and Sasha Victorine in the 39th minute for Ramiro
Morales and Chris Albright, after it was 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Donovan nor Victorine was a factor in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Charles spoke of the necessity of getting over the defeat and
focusing on the bronze-medal game. Winning a medal of any sort
would be a tremendous achievement for U.S. men's soccer, even if
this is, essentially, the nation's under-23 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even talking about this game,'' he said of Tuesday's
defeat. ``Now we have to try to win the bronze medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vagenas: ``If we can win the bronze, I'll hang the gold
medals around the Spanish guys' necks and not feel bad about it at
all.''

BRUINS TO FACE ASU WITHOUT ANDERSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ UCLA will be without strong safety Marques
Anderson against Arizona State while he recovers from an
undisclosed medical procedure he will undergo later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the outpatient surgery, which is planned for
Thursday, is neither life-threatening nor serious and is not
related to football. He said he didn't want to disclose the ailment
because of privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who had been the star of the defense in the first
three games, had a poor game against Oregon. He missed four
tackles, was called for a face-mask penalty and beaten for a key
fourth-down reception on the Ducks' go-ahead scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said his ailment had no effect on his performance
against Oregon. UCLA coach Bob Toledo disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hurt and it was affecting his performance,'' Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he saw doctors Monday and they advised him to have
the surgery done immediately rather than wait until next week when
the Bruins have a bye.
</P>
<P>
   Either Audie Attar or Jason Stephens will replace Anderson in
the lineup. Attar was auditioned at the spot on Tuesday and
Stephens will get his turn today.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coleman recovering: If you don't have any expectations, then
you can't be let down. That's the view defensive end Kenyon Coleman
is trying to take while he recovers from last week's arthroscopic
surgery to remove torn cartilage from his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I have a chance to return,'' said Coleman, who was
injured against Michigan, underwent surgery last Tuesday and was
expected to be out four to six weeks. ``I don't want to be
disappointed. I'm not a doctor. I don't want to diagnose it. I know
(redshirting) is an option, but it's too early to think about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, one of two senior captains along with guard Oscar
Cabrera, has stitches in his left knee. But he seemed happy to be
wearing his practice jersey and walking gingerly around Spaulding
Field on Monday for the first time since he was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bummed out,'' said Coleman, who has been invited to play
in the Senior Bowl, a postseason all-star game that NFL teams use
to evaluate talent. ``I'm glad I can be out here (instead of)
sitting in my room taking painkillers.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Gloger arrives: Basketball player Spencer Gloger, who left
Princeton 10 days ago and returned home to Mission Viejo with the
intention of transferring to UCLA, signed a grant-in-aid on
Tuesday, two days before classes begin.
</P>
<P>
   Gloger, who will redshirt this season, has three years of
eligibility remaining. A 6-foot-7 guard, he started 28 games for
Princeton last season and averaged 12 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Game wanted: UCLA has officially agreed to play at Kansas the
second week of next season, filling a date left open this summer
when Missouri backed out of a home-and-away series with the Bruins.
UCLA is still looking for a season-opening game in 2002.

BRAVES CLINCH DIVISION IN 7-1 WIN OVER METS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stands were speckled by the eighth inning, more
empty than filled. There was no reason to stay on a raw night when
the Mets played dead and their rival, the Atlanta Braves, buried
their hopes for a division championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves clinched the National League East title Wednesday
night with a 7-1 victory over the Mets, who still could clinch the
wild card with losses by Arizona and Los Angeles. It would be the
second season in a row in which the Mets captured the wild card,
but the Braves, as usual, can do better: they have now won nine
consecutive division crowns.
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves (94-63) lose the rest of their games and the Mets
(89-68) win theirs, the teams would be tied for first place. The
Braves would be awarded the division championship because they won
the tie breaker Wednesday night with their seventh victory against
the Mets this year, ensuring them of a victory in the season
series.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Braves and the Mets end the season with the same
record, there would be no playoff for the division title because
both teams would have already qualified for postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have overcome substantial deficits to beat the Braves;
they trailed, 8-1, in the eighth inning on June 30 before mounting
a 10-run rally to win. But John Rocker was unavailable for that
game, and the controversial left-hander confounds the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, whose presence again necessitated several hundred police
officers, relieved Kerry Ligtenberg with two outs and two runners
on in the eighth. As he reached the mound, a beer bottle landed a
few feet behind the mound; Gary Cederstrom, the first-base umpire,
pointed out the fan who threw it, and the fan was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's first pitch was high, well out of the strike zone. But
he recovered and got Robin Ventura to fly to center, ending the
inning. In the ninth, the Mets singled twice off Rocker, bringing
life to the bundled-up fans who remained.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Bordick lined out to left, Jorge Toca struck out and
Todd Pratt grounded to third, where Chipper Jones tagged out Bubba
Trammell. Rocker pumped his fist, but there was no pile-on
celebration: the Braves are used to this.
</P>
<P>
   The winning pitcher for Atlanta was John Burkett (10-6), who
allowed three hits and one run in six innings to beat the Mets for
the third time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett's bat brought in the first Braves runof the game, after
Leiter appeared to have escaped trouble in the fifth. With one out,
Reggie Sanders doubled down the left-field line for his second hit
of the game. Leiter fanned Walt Weiss for the second out. But he
left a fastball up to Burkett, who punched it into right field for
a single. Sanders scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Furcal followed with a grounder between third and short,
reaching base on a single when Bordick's throw to second
short-hopped Edgardo Alfonzo. There were runners on first and
second with the middle of the order soon to bat, but Leiter got
Andruw Jones to ground out. Leiter would get only one more out.
Chipper Jones ripped a slider over the wall in left center to lead
off the sixth, increasing the Braves' lead to 2-0, and Andres
Galarraga followed with a hard-hit groundout to Alfonzo, who ranged
close to second base to field it.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez doubled to left past a diving Robin Ventura, and
Leiter walked Brian Jordan. Dave Wallace, the pitching coach,
visited the mound, but Leiter, after getting ahead of Sanders,
issued another walk to load the bases. Weiss chopped a ball softly,
between third and short, a troublesome area.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura charged it on an angle and threw home as he turned his
body toward the plate. It was a hurried, awkward throw, rare from a
Gold Glove winner like Ventura, and it was so wild that a diving
Mike Piazza could not get a glove on it.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez and Jordan scored, Sanders and Weiss took extra bases, and
Leiter left the game trailing, 4-0.

STUDIOS PROPOSE LIMITS ON ADS
</HEADLINE>

By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Hollywood's eight largest studios unveiled a
12-point plan Tuesday aimed at limiting the marketing of violent
movies to children, but critics panned the plan as toothless.
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives were expected to present the plan before the
Senate Commerce Committee today during hearings investigating
whether they intentionally advertised adult-rated films to
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a fresh look at the way we market our films and
we're working hard and quickly to correct some of the sins of the
past,'' Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association
of America, said during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Alert, a group founded by activist Ralph Nader that
has long called for reforms of all advertising aimed at kids,
called the studios' plan a step too short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still self-regulation, which has always been a dismal
failure. We need government intervention to protect our kids,''
said Gary Ruskin, director of Commercial Alert.
</P>
<P>
   The studio plan, designed to ward off limits set by Congress,
would:
</P>
<P>
   Ban attaching trailers for violent, R-rated films to G-rated
videos and DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Request that theater operators not show previews of R-rated
movies in conjunction with their G-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   Ban persons under 17 from attending screenings or promotional
activities for R-rated films, unless they are accompanied by an
adult.
</P>
<P>
   Appoint senior executives to review all programs for compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is expected to get a lukewarm reception today
from the Senate Commerce Committee, which will take testimony from
executives of the eight studios.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the panel, declined
comment, saying he would respond to Hollywood's plan at today's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to McCain said the proposal falls far short of the
senator's previously stated demand that the entertainment industry
shield all persons under 17 from marketing for R-rated fare.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's marketing practices have been under fire since Sept.
11, when the Federal Trade Commission issued a study that charged
the film, music and video game industries with violating their own
ratings systems by marketing violent titles to children as young as
8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement covers the eight movie studios
represented by Valenti and the MPAA. They are The Walt Disney Co.,
DreamWorks SKG, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Sony
Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Universal
Studios and Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said he expected other entertainment companies would
follow their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Critics noted that banning trailers for R-rated movies from
playing with G-rated features would impact only a fraction of
Hollywood's output.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 613 films rated so far this year and listed on the MPAA's
Web site, only 28 movies, or 4.6 percent of the total, were rated
G. The 440 R-rated titles accounted for 73 percent of the total,
followed by 106 films rated PG-13 (17 percent) and 39 rated PG (6.4
percent). The list includes movies for theatrical release and
direct-to-video titles.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal focuses on R-rated films because the FTC did not
address movies rated PG (parental guidance suggested) and PG-13
(parents of children under 13 strongly cautioned), Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can get into a PG or a PG-13 picture and that's where
parental control comes in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said the proposal does not include provisions for TV
advertising for R-rated films. The studios' plan, however, calls
for film Web sites, video packaging, print ads and movie lobby
cards to prominently display R-ratings, as well as specific reasons
why the film was given the rating.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said that controlling TV advertising ``is just not
doable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got too many variables and outlets. Obviously, we
wouldn't advertise a violent movie during Saturday morning
cartoons. But we might during the Super Bowl, and a lot of kids
watch the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti called the 12-point plan ``a rostrum on which all eight
of the companies will stand'' and indicated that individual studios
would soon be announcing additional marketing reforms. Disney has
already announced that it will not show ads for R-rated films
before 9 p.m. on its ABC TV network.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said they hope Congress enacts stricter limits than the
studios have proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too little, too late and a Band-Aid for a flawed rating
system that's been around too long,'' said Daphne White, director
of the Lion and Lamb Project, a Maryland-based group that lobbies
against violence in media directed at children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Hollywood understands the basic problem when
they say that parents have the main responsibility. We know that
responsibility. We just don't like to have R-rated movies shoved in
our 6-year-olds' faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Directors Guild of America looked with favor on the MPAA
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DGA is encouraged by the MPAA and the studios' willingness
to address the issues raised in the Federal Trade Commission report
regarding the inappropriate marketing of certain movies to
children,'' the group said in a statement issued Tuesday. ``We look
forward to sitting down with the MPAA to help make the ratings
system more meaningful to parents and consumers, as well as
filmmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the DGA called for an overhaul of the current
ratings system and a ``zero tolerance'' policy toward underage
admissions by theater owners.

JERRY CLAIBORNE, 72, COACH OF ALL-STAR SCHOLARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Va., Md., Ky., Texas, Mo., Ala.)   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Claiborne, who turned out good teams but even better
classroom stars in 28 years as the head football coach at Virginia
Tech, Maryland and Kentucky, died Sept. 24 at a hospital in
Nashville. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack after complications from two
abdominal operations last week, his son Jonathan said.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame on
Aug. 11 but was too ill to attend the dinner in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was the head coach for 10 years at Virginia Tech
(1961-70), 10 years at Maryland (1972-81) and 8 years at Kentucky
(1982-89). When he retired with a record of 179-122-8, he ranked
fourth in victories among active major college coaches, trailing
only Bo Schembechler of Michigan (234), Joe Paterno of Penn State
(219) and Bobby Bowden of Florida State (193). He took 11 teams to
postseason bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   Four of his players were Academic All-Americans and 87 made the
Southeastern Conference all-academic team. In his last season,
Kentucky won the College Football Association's Academic
Achievement Award as the major team with the highest graduation
rate, 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As John Clay wrote in The Lexington Herald-Leader: ``He was just
an old-fashioned coach with old-fashioned values who had the one
thing a lot of coaches and administrators preach, but too few
actually have. He had integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Prince, who played for Claiborne at Maryland from 1983 to
1986, said: ``He had his morals and his goals set in stone, and he
never bent for them. He had a strong faith. He didn't drink. He
didn't cuss.''
</P>
<P>
   When Claiborne retired, William F. Reed wrote in Sports
Illustrated: ``He wasn't glib like Lou Holtz or slick like Barry
Switzer or a constant contender for the national championship like
his mentor, Bear Bryant, but he loved football with all his heart.
He loved the contact on the field and the challenge of beating the
other guy both physically and mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry David Claiborne was born Aug. 26, 1928, in Hopkinsville,
Ky., the eighth of nine children. He earned high school letters in
football, basketball, tennis and track, then went on to Kentucky,
where he played end, blocking back and defensive back under the
legendary Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he earned a degree in mathematics and physical
education with high distinction. Then he coached football for two
years at a military school and nine years (eight under Bryant) as
an assistant at Kentucky, Texas A&AMP;M, Missouri and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   His prowess, especially on defense, earned him head-coaching
jobs, but conditions were never ideal. Virginia Tech was then a
small college playing big teams. He recalled that at Maryland, ``We
didn't even have a room big enough for a team meeting, and we had
to lift weights outside because there wasn't enough room inside
anywhere.'' At Kentucky, where he inherited a program in turmoil,
basketball was king.
</P>
<P>
   Several football players had been arrested on various charges.
The team was under National Collegiate Athletic Association
probation for recruiting violations. Discipline and academic
concerns were paltry. And the team had gone through four
consecutive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His first Kentucky team did not win a game, losing 10 and tying
one. His next went 6-4-1 and played in the Hall of Fame Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be remembered as a guy who did the best he could
with what he had, and that we tried to run a program that was
within the rules,'' Claiborne once said. ``Our rules were that if
that rule didn't make the kid a better person, a better student and
a better athlete, then we'd throw out the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1989 season, at age 61, he retired, saying his heart
was no longer in the game. His wife, the former Faye Hooks, whom he
married in 1951, said later that she thought Alzheimer's disease
was the reason.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; two sons, David of San Francisco and
Jonathan of Baltimore; two daughters, Katie Newell of Landenberg,
Pa., and Eileen Claiborne of Portland, Ore.; four grandchildren;
two step-grandchildren; and five siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tough, but he was fair,'' his wife said, ``and his
players loved him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   And his son Jonathan once said: ``He's somebody who really
practices the American ethic, that if you work hard, good things
will come to you. He did that, and he did it his way.''

Brazil's greatest guitarists, died Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro. He
was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia and multiple organ failure, said
Alexandre Raine, his publicist. Known professionally simply as
Baden Powell, Powell had been hospitalized for the last month at
the Clinica Sorocaba in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Named after Robert Steven Smyth Baden-Powell, the 19th-century
British founder of the Boy Scouts, Powell was born on Aug. 6, 1937,
in Varre-e-Sai, a small town in the interior of the state of Rio de
Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, the abolitionist Vicente Thomas de Aquino,
formed an orchestra of black slave musicians before Brazil's
abolition of slavery in 1888, and his father, Lilo de Aquino,
supplemented his modest income as a shoemaker by playing the tuba
and the violin at local dances.
</P>
<P>
   When Powell was a small boy his family moved to Rio, then
Brazil's capital, where his father enrolled him in private classes
with Jaime Florence, a guitar professor who introduced him to the
work of Spanish masters like Francisco Tarrega and Andres Segovia.
</P>
<P>
   Powell proved to be a prodigious student, and by the time he was
a teen-ager, he was playing the guitar on national radio programs
and at dances and parties in the lower-middle-class suburbs of Rio.
He went on to play at at the Bar Plaza in the late 1950s in
Copacabana, where he was noticed by the composer Antonio Carlos
Jobim.
</P>
<P>
   Through Jobim, Powell met the composer Marcus Vinicius de Melo
Moraes and soon became immersed in bossa nova, the stylistic
reworking of traditional Brazilian samba rhythms in the late 1950s
and early '60s. In perhaps the most fruitful part of his career,
Powell collaborated with Moraes on nearly 50 songs in the 1960s,
like ``Berimbau,'' released in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Berimbau,'' for which Powell composed the music and Moraes
the lyrics, the sound of the musical bow used in the ritual of
capoeira, the martial art brought to Brazil by slaves from what is
now Angola, is subtly recreated on the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baden Powell is to the guitar what Joao Gilberto is to style
and Tom Jobim is to composition,'' said Charles Perrone, a
professor of Brazilian culture at the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Shy and wiry, Powell went to live abroad in the late 1960s along
with many other prominent Brazilian musicians after a military coup
toppled the civilian government in 1964. He established himself in
Paris, where he worked with musicians like Thelonious Monk and Stan
Getz, who helped introduce him to audiences in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Powell moved to the German city of Baden-Baden in 1983, which he
used as a base for playing at jazz clubs and festivals in Europe,
Japan and the United States, according to Powell's biographer, the
French writer Dominique Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Powell's recognition grew while he lived in Europe,
his heavy drinking sometimes complicated his personal life and
threatened his financial security. ``What messed him up were his
personal life and a friend named Johnnie Walker,'' Ruy Castro, a
Brazilian writer, said in reference to Powell's longtime fondness
for whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Powell saved enough money to return to Brazil in 1988. In
Rio de Janeiro he began to play at clubs again. By then, however,
he was perhaps better known abroad than in Brazil, where popular
music had undergone enormous innovation because of musicians like
Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although his career spanned continents and decades, in the
popular imagination Baden Powell belongs to that very special time
for Brazilian music in the 1960s, when things were still somewhat
innocent,'' said Christopher Dunn, a professor of Brazilian
literary and cultural studies at Tulane University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Powell became an evangelical Christian in a religious
conversion that led him to tone down his public performances of
Afro-sambas like ``Samba da Bencao,'' the song he composed that
became well known in the 1966 film ``A Man and a Woman,'' by the
French director Claude Lelouch. He also became more reflective
about Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get sad because our country has such beautiful places but
it's all falling down,'' Powell wrote in a Brazilian newspaper
earlier this year. ``We must, I think, give greater importance to
our natural wonders.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell is survived by two sons, Philippe and Louis-Marcel Baden
Powell de Aquino, both of Rio de Janeiro.

2000 A BANNER YEAR FOR BIRTHS IN L.A. COUNTY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hospitals across Los Angeles report a baby boom
of millennial proportions: Births have risen by nearly 10,000
across the county during Y2K and up to 25 percent at some area
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Births for the year rose from 82,718 in the first eight months
of 1999 to 92,244 through August this year, the county Department
of Health said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But why is not exactly clear.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it may be the millennial madness couples who wanted to
have babies in the year 2000 while others speculate that a strong
economy may make now the perfect family planning time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something special that I wanted to have my last baby in
the year 2000,'' said 29-year-old Manuel Valencia, whose wife
Evangelina Castillo, 27, had a son on Monday at Northridge Hospital
Medical Center's Sherman Way campus.
</P>
<P>
   Other San Fernando Valley hospitals have reported up to 25
percent increase in births in September alone.
</P>
<P>
   Officials agree September is already the busiest month for
births, but many are still amazed by the numbers being reported
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eldridge H. Pearsall, who works at a Prenatal Woman's Center
at Northridge Hospital, said he has noticed the boom of babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was one of those demographic things that happen
every few years,'' he said. ``As the economy gets better, people
have more babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Eusebio, a licensed vocational nurse who works at the
hospital's maternity ward, said the month of September has been
especially hectic on the maternity ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost closed the department one day because we didn't have
room,'' she said. ``These are the babies made over the holiday
season,'' she said, adding that the upsurge could also be
attributed to some parents wanting to have millennium babies.
</P>
<P>
   For 40-year-old Patricia Arguelles of Lake View Terrace, giving
birth to a son on Monday in the year 2000 was a surprise gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pregnancy was totally unexpected,'' she said. ``I thought I
was done 10 years ago, and it happened he was born on the year
2000. That's incredible!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God blessed us with him on this year,'' she said of
her newborn son, Francisco Nathaniel Arguelles.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge's Sherman Way campus has delivered 170 births in
September, up from the average of 125 to 150 per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're opening up another area of the hospital to handle the
overflow of births,'' said Lori Solomon, a spokeswoman for
Northridge Hospital. ``It was a very happy millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   At Providence Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills, the hospital
is predicting a 25 percent increase in births in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of today, we've delivered 125 babies,'' said Tiffany
DeVall, a hospital spokeswoman. ``Over the past five years we've
delivered between 95 and 125 babies in September. So, this has been
a busy month for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley Presbyterian has seen only a small increase in births
this month, said spokeswoman Kelly Tarelka, but overall, births are
up 20 percent for the year 3,500 so far in 2000, versus 3,000 total
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cedars-Sinai Medical Center one of the city's largest hospitals
has also recorded increased births, about 10 percent this year,
according to spokeswoman Tasha Johnson. Cedars has delivered 4,259
babies so far in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``August and September always seem to be the biggest times
anyway think about it, holidays, celebrations,'' she said. ``But
why there are more this year in general? We don't know that.''

ADVERTISING: NEW CAMPAIGN ASKS GUN OWNERS TO LOCK UP THEIR
WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The commercial opens on crayon drawings and the tiny voice of a
child talking lovingly about her little sister. Then the camera
zooms in on a stick figure lying on the ground, part of its body
covered in red marker. The next frame shows the speaker's
self-portrait, her face violently scribbled out in black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a gun in the drawer; it went off,'' the small voice
says, cracking. ``I made Kalie go away. I hate me.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, which ends on the line, ``An unlocked gun could
be the death of your family. Please lock up your gun,'' is part of
a public service advertising campaign advocating safe gun storage
that is being distributed this week by the Advertising Council and
the National Crime Prevention Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in any way, shape or form pro- or anti-guns _ we
didn't approach it as an issue about guns,'' said Hal Fass, senior
vice president and group management director at the New York office
of FCB Worldwide, the True North Communications unit that created
the campaign. ``We made it all about safety and a health issue for
protecting American kids. We're not making any judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly simple commercials, devoid of sound effects, music
or actors, belie the intensive creative process FCB New York
undertook to develop the campaign, which it did for no fee.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate strategy to use children as the common denominator
to tell the gun safety story was a result of a year's worth of
research and interviews to get behind the wall of controversy and
politics that is erected at the mere mention of gun ownership, said
the campaign's creative directors, Sandy Greenberg and Terri Meyer,
who are executive vice presidents at FCB.
</P>
<P>
   The agency met with dozens of officials from a range of groups
that touch on the gun issue, including sheriffs' associations and
manufacturers of trigger locks, and it did extensive research about
the attitudes of gun owners. The FCB team also met with gun owners
in their homes to learn how to design their message for maximum
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The research turned up some insights that surprised the team.
They realized first that the primary motivation of gun owners is to
protect the family. The team also learned that gun ownership cuts
across racial and socioeconomic barriers, but gun owners share a
psychology of defensiveness about their guns and a feeling of being
persecuted for their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Gun owners also do not trust statistics, which tend to become
pawns in the national gun controversy, Greenberg said. She said the
team developed advertising using some strong statistics, but dumped
it after deciding it would not be convincing to gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Most gun owners also say that their children are more likely to
accidentally swallow a drain cleaner than to get hold of their gun,
according to the research. The creative team, however, had read
dozens of news accounts over five years about children shooting
other children accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the great gun debate, what we realized is that we never
heard from the children,'' Meyer said. ``And we realized we had to
come from that point of view of irrefutable logic, that it's wrong
and it's child abuse to not lock up your gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The team chose not to use actors because gun owners might not be
able to relate to the people or might view it as too commercial,
Greenberg said. Instead, they chose the crayon drawings for their
universal appeal, representing the kind of pictures everyone has
hung on their refrigerator by their child or niece or grandchild,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create a commercial where anyone could put
themselves in that place,'' Greenberg said. ``We wanted to
personalize it so much that we put it in your home on your
refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which will also have ads for print, radio and
outdoor media, deliberately avoids excessive information on how to
lock up guns, said Adam Gargani, FCB New York's senior vice
president for account planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``People buy guns to protect their family and they don't believe
they could be irresponsible,'` Gargani said. ``If we can get people
to successfully rethink this, then the specific action of safe
storage is rather straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime prevention council said the campaign was prompted by
recent school shootings, paired with new research showing that 66
percent to 75 percent of gun owners view safe storage as an
important issue, but almost half store their weapons improperly.
</P>
<P>
   The council said 34 percent of American households with children
have firearms, and an estimated 300 accidental child deaths and
another 900 injuries involving guns occur each year. And 300,000 to
500,000 guns are stolen each year _ the weapons presumably were not
properly locked up _ and are then often used to commit crimes, said
Jack Calhoun, the crime prevention council's president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said he did not expect a controversy over the ads, but
to be certain, the council showed the ads to a sample of its target
audience of gun owners who have children. He said none felt
threatened or felt that the ads were anti-gun.
</P>
<P>
   The Ad Council relies on the good will of the media, and it
anticipates more than $30 million in free publicity to support the
campaign over the next year, said Peggy Conlon, president of the Ad
Council. Conlon said the typical Ad Council campaign gets about $28
million annually, but this effort might get more because it is
topical.

YANKS LOSE TO HEAD TO THE PLAYOFFS WITH QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The New York Yankees have fielded a
slumping player here or there since they resumed their postseason
greatness four years ago, and sometimes their pitching staff has
been a little thin. But they have never had a hole as big as the
one they are expected to haul into the playoffs next week.
</P>
<P>
   No one will ever know about it if the Yankees are fortunate. If
they are lucky, their starting pitchers will pitch deep into games
and hand a big lead to three veteran relievers. But if patient
opponents wear down the Yankees' starters or a game lingers into
extra innings, then Manager Joe Torre will have to reach deep into
his bullpen, and even if he professes confidence in it, he cannot
have any idea of what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Torre has been reluctant to discuss his postseason plans as the
Yankees stagger toward the playoffs. Orlando Hernandez allowed two
hits over eight innings Wednesday night, but after the Yankees'
Jorge Posada tied the score at 1-1 with a homer leading off the
ninth, Fred McGriff hit a game-winning single off Mike Stanton with
two out in the bottom of the ninth and Tampa Bay beat the Yankees,
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The loss prevented the Yankees from wrapping up the American
League East title, but they clinched at least a tie when the
Orioles defeated the second-place Toronto Blue Jays, 2-1, in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees trailed, 1-0, when Paul O'Neill led off the eighth
with a single and Bernie Williams ripped a double, putting the
potential tying and leading runs in scoring position with nobody
out. David Justice rocked a liner to right field, where the
strong-armed Jose Guillen set himself and threw home, on several
bounces, and catcher John Flaherty tagged out O'Neill as he tried
to score standing up.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Hernandez relieved the Devil Rays' Albie Lopez to start
the Yankee ninth and Posada hit his 28th homer to tie the game. But
after Jeff Nelson walked Randy Winn to lead off the bottom of the
ninth, Winn advanced to second on a sacrifice and scored the
winning run when McGriff singled.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have six solid pitchers, including the starters
Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Hernandez, and the relievers
Mariano Rivera, Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   The other four pitchers _ the starter Denny Neagle and three
relievers _ are as mysterious as the meat served in college
cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   One week from now, Torre might have to turn to his bullpen in
the middle innings and choose among Jason Grimsley, Dwight Gooden,
Randy Choate or David Cone, without any real sense of what he's
going to get. ``They don't have anywhere near the kind of depth
they had the last few years,'' one scout said.  &QL;

VOTE USING TOUCH-SCREEN PLACES
</HEADLINE>

By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It will be tough to come up with excuses for not
voting in the upcoming election now that Los Angeles County is
installing walk-in, computerized ``touch screen'' voting places
that will be open during the three weeks before the Nov. 7
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone registered to vote can do so at any of the nine special
voting places being set across the county,
Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Conny McCormack announced. They are
expected to open Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   She said the new voting places would essentially open the polls
for several weeks, allowing more time for voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope turnout increases by making the process more
voter-friendly,'' McCormack said. ``If this becomes popular, which
we expect it will, we can open more sites and expand.''
</P>
<P>
   To vote at the special sites, registered voters don't need
documentation - just their name and address, and then they can cast
their ballot on the touch-screen computers, said county spokeswoman
Marcia Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Opening walk-in voting places for several weeks before the
elections has proved successful in raising voter participation in
some other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, more than one-third of the voter turnout the last
presidential election was attributed to early walk-in voting, made
available two weeks before elections to all voters since 1987, said
Jane Dees, spokeswoman for the Texas Secretary of State's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Riverside County will be the first in California to replace
punch cards with touch-screen computers at every one of its 900
polling locations in November, spending some $14 million in the
process, McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that making the terminals available at all 5,000 Los
Angeles polling sites could cost roughly $90 million to $100
million. Whether Los Angeles decides to expand on the sites will
depend largely on how popular they become, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take things one step at a time,'' she said, adding
that the Secretary of State's Office will also be testing
experimental on-line voting in several counties, not including Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has contracted with Global Election Systems, which
has been certified by the state, to provide the computer services.
Other counties using the touch-screen computers at designated sites
include Marin, Monterrey, San Mateo, Trinity, and Tulare.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack said another potential touch-screen advantage is
cutting down on the manpower needed to count absentee ballots, and
speeding up the vote tally.
</P>
<P>
   Absentee voting in Los Angeles County has increased in recent
years. In the March 2000 primary, roughly one in six voters cast
their votes by mail, according to the Secretary of State's Office.
Statewide, absentee votes represented 23 percent of all votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of absentee voters shot up in the 1980s when the
requirement to show cause were eliminated,'' said Alfie Charles,
spokesman for Secretary of State Bill Jones. ``People like
convenience. They like the time flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said the county expects some 500,000 to submit absentee
votes in the November elections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO VOTE
</P>
<P>
   ``Touch screen'' voting places at the following locations will
be open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Monday through Friday from

SPEEDY MORGAN COMMITS TO PLAY AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC received an oral commitment Tuesday from wide
receiver Chris Morgan of Taft High in Woodland Hills, the latest in
a line of football players for the Trojans who also run track.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan (6-foot, 170-pounds) is the defending state champion in
the 110-meter high hurdles, and his top mark of 13.94 seconds last
season was 13th-best in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He has 15 receptions this season for 247 yards and three
touchdowns and he had 24 catches for 409 yards and two touchdowns
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is the second wide receiver to commit to the Trojans this
week. William Buchanon of Oceanside decided to attend USC on
Monday. USC has eight commitments.
</P>
<P>
   __ Problem areas: Special teams were a primary focus of
Tuesday's practice and Hackett said USC would spend more time on it
every practice this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we may be able to make PATs,'' he joked. ``And maybe
block the punt rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Norm Katnik and Zeke Moreno both continued to work on punt
snaps. Against San Jose State, Katnik debuted as USC's punt-snapper
to give Moreno a break. One of the goals this week is to snap the
ball faster to punter Mike MacGillivray, who had a punt blocked
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball comes back pretty slow from what he's used to,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Team captains: USC players selected team captains for the
remainder of the season. Center Eric Denmon and tailback Petros
Papadakis are the offensive captains and tackle Ennis Davis and
linebacker Moreno are the defensive captains.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who suffered leg
cramps at the end of the San Jose State game, missed most of
Tuesday's practice because he had tightness in his calf muscle. He
is expected back today.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Trevor Roberts (sprained foot), who has not
played all season, practiced and said he will see his first action
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kris Richard, who played with a sprained knee last
week, said he expects to start against Oregon State, although he
might have to wear the knee brace he wore against San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Easy schedule: Oregon State coach Dennis Erickson hasn't been
too impressed with the Beavers' 3-0 start.

   __ Redshirt issues: Hackett said the Trojans intend to play only
two freshmen _ tight end Alex Holmes and wide receiver Keary
Colbert _ this season. One player who will not officially redshirt
until after the season is No. 3 quarterback Matt Cassel of
Chatsworth. He will make every road trip, in case of an injury at
quarterback.

<P>
   Several other freshmen expected to play, notably offensive
lineman Joe McGuire (back) and strong safety Matt Grootegoed
(mononucleosis), are redshirting because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   __ Last word: San Jose State nearly defeated the Trojans, but at
least one player _ Moreno _ refused to give the Spartans his full
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that some of the San Jose State players
were talking trash,'' Moreno said. ``But that's why they are there.
I'm humble enough to say that they played a great game.''

VOTE USING TOUCH-SCREEN PLACES

   LOS ANGELES -- It will be tough to come up with excuses for not
voting in the upcoming election now that Los Angeles County is
installing walk-in, computerized ``touch screen'' voting places
that will be open during the three weeks before the Nov. 7
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone registered to vote can do so at any of the nine special
voting places being set across the county,
Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Conny McCormack announced. They are
expected to open Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   She said the new voting places would essentially open the polls
for several weeks, allowing more time for voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope turnout increases by making the process more
voter-friendly,'' McCormack said. ``If this becomes popular, which
we expect it will, we can open more sites and expand.''
</P>
<P>
   To vote at the special sites, registered voters don't need
documentation - just their name and address, and then they can cast
their ballot on the touch-screen computers, said county spokeswoman
Marcia Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Opening walk-in voting places for several weeks before the
elections has proved successful in raising voter participation in
some other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, more than one-third of the voter turnout the last
presidential election was attributed to early walk-in voting, made
available two weeks before elections to all voters since 1987, said
Jane Dees, spokeswoman for the Texas Secretary of State's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Riverside County will be the first in California to replace
punch cards with touch-screen computers at every one of its 900
polling locations in November, spending some $14 million in the
process, McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that making the terminals available at all 5,000 Los
Angeles polling sites could cost roughly $90 million to $100
million. Whether Los Angeles decides to expand on the sites will
depend largely on how popular they become, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take things one step at a time,'' she said, adding
that the Secretary of State's Office will also be testing
experimental on-line voting in several counties, not including Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has contracted with Global Election Systems, which
has been certified by the state, to provide the computer services.
Other counties using the touch-screen computers at designated sites
include Marin, Monterrey, San Mateo, Trinity, and Tulare.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack said another potential touch-screen advantage is
cutting down on the manpower needed to count absentee ballots, and
speeding up the vote tally.
</P>
<P>
   Absentee voting in Los Angeles County has increased in recent
years. In the March 2000 primary, roughly one in six voters cast
their votes by mail, according to the Secretary of State's Office.
Statewide, absentee votes represented 23 percent of all votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of absentee voters shot up in the 1980s when the
requirement to show cause were eliminated,'' said Alfie Charles,
spokesman for Secretary of State Bill Jones. ``People like
convenience. They like the time flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said the county expects some 500,000 to submit absentee
votes in the November elections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO VOTE

   ``Touch screen'' voting places at the following locations will

HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERS BACK DRUG RE-IMPORT BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs 1st graf for clarification; inserts, after 7th graf, new
material on different proposal approved earlier and on Bush-Gore
positions)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A proposal to allow imports of low-priced
prescription drugs won support from House Republican leaders on
Tuesday, making it all but certain that Congress and President
Clinton could eventually agree on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pharmaceutical industry has lobbied furiously
against the measure, the House Republican leaders announced that
they would approve the Senate-passed version of the bill, which
Clinton also supports. Their decision to make the bill a priority,
just six weeks before the elections, suggests how potent the cost
of prescription drugs has become as a political issue on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are comfortable with the Senate bill,'' Rep. Dick Armey of
Texas, the majority leader, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, said the bill ``may well
emerge from the rubble,'' and added, ``If they want to do the
Senate bill, it's fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, draftd by Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., addresses
the disparities that force American consumers to pay two or three
times as much for some American-made drugs as do people in Canada,
Mexico and some other countries. Canada, for example, regulates the
price of drugs and does not allow retailers to charge more than set
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would allow pharmacies and wholesale distributors to
buy prescription drugs abroad at discount prices, re-import them
and then sell them to consumers at a lower cost. Although the
measure is designed to reduce drug prices in a roundabout way, it
is not likely to do so for about two years. That is how long it is
expected to take for the FDA to write new regulations that would
govern this new business. Experts say it it is too early to know
with any accuracy what volume of sales might flow through such a
route.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, which was approved on July 19 by a vote of
74-21, also includes safeguards to protect consumers, something the
Food and Drug Administration said was necessary. It would require
the importer to provide large amounts of data to the FDA to ensure
that the drugs were authentic and complied with federal standards.
Tests would be conducted by the pharmacist, the wholesaler or the
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat different proposals to relax restrictions on the import
of prescription drugs were approved by the House with overwhelming
support on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore supports the bill and Gov. George W. Bush
has not taken a position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is something that should be done there,'' said
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader. ``We do want
to make sure about the safety aspects, and that's one of the things
that concerned the industry. The potential for fraud is very
strong, and you want to make sure that our people are not being
duped.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Congress may want to tighten up the safety provisions
``a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Tuesday praised the Republican leadership for
agreeing ``in the face of the drug companies' opposition, to give
Americans access to prescription drugs that are cheaper in other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Tuesday morning at an event celebrating the economic
expansion, the president continued, ``I think it's wrong when drug
companies sell the same drugs for a much higher price at home than
they do overseas, even when those drugs are manufactured right here
in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's accord, the bill's path to the president's
desk remains somewhat rocky. The measure is now attached to an
agriculture spending bill, which is tangled up in a dispute over
legislation to weaken the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba. That
conflict must be resolved before the bill can be voted on in the
House or the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at some point, Congress must pass a bill to finance the
Department of Agriculture, and if all goes as expected, the measure
would be tucked inside. ``If it's not done, it's as close to done
as anything can be,'' said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., a
co-sponsor of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
said the Senate language may be ``tweaked'' a bit, but should not
pose an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   By pushing the prescription drug reimportation bill, over
protests of the pharmaceutical industry, Republicans hope to
inoculate themselves against Democratic charges that they have done
nothing to make prescription drugs more affordable for senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers have lobbied vigorously to kill the drug
reimportation measure in recent weeks, running expensive television
advertisements to get their message out.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hastert and Lott sent a letter to Clinton indicating
their desire to act on the drug reimportation bill, among other
things. They said time was running out for action on broader
legislation to establish prescription drug benefits for the eldely
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats said they were pleased with Tuesday's
developments, they made it clear they would not back down from the
goal of securing drug coverage through Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are feeling the heat,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt, the
Democratic leader, said of the Republicans. ``They feel they have
got to move on something, and I'm glad they are finally moving on
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The provisions of the Senate bill would take effect only if the
secretary of health and human services certified to Congress that
the measure would ``pose no risk to the public's health and
safety,'' and that it would produce ``a significant reduction in
the cost'' of prescription drugs to American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald J. Streck, president of the National Wholesale Druggists'
Association, said, ``The demand for imported prescription drugs
could be quite high because importers will advertise low-price
imported medicines in newspapers and magazines, on television and
over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the FDA would need $23 million to develop a
new system of regulating imported drugs. House Republicans said
they were willing to provide that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate bill, importers would have to provide large
amounts of data to the Food and Drug Administration to show, for
example, that a statistically valid sample of all drug shipments
had been tested to ensure compliance with federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Imported drugs would have to have the same color, formulation,
labeling and dosage as products approved for sale in the United
States. Importers would have to maintain records showing the
``chain of custody'' of the drugs. They would have to inform the
FDA of the ``points of origin and destination'' for imported drugs;
the wholesale and retail prices, and ``the manufacturer's lot or
control number'' for each shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing law, a prescription drug made in the United
States and exported to another country may not be reimported, in
large quantities, except by the manufacturer. The law, adopted in
1988 as a consumer protection measure, sought to choke off a ``gray
market'' for drugs that were counterfeit, adulterated or too old to
be used safely.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators had documented many cases in which
counterfeit drugs, including birth control pills, had been
imported. Drug companies say counterfeit drugs are still a major
problem in Mexico and many other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wholesale Druggists' Association opposed the
legislation. Streck, the president of the association, said
``wholesalers do not have the experience, equipment or personnel''
to sample, test, re-label and track imported drugs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wholesalers also expressed concern that they could incur costly
new legal liability for the imported drugs, and they said they
would have to pass on such costs to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether drug companies would cooperate in
efforts to import low-price versions of their products. ``Why would
manufacturers produce additional product in Canada, or export
additional product from the United States to Canada, so it could be
sold at a lower price in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   Streck said he feared that low-price counterfeit drugs would
flow into the United States to meet the demand not met by
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for AARP, formerly known as the
American Association of Retired Persons, said: ``This legislation
should not be viewed as a substitute for insurance coverage. We
still need Medicare drug benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, said drug companies opposed the
legislation because ``it would put American patients at risk by
making it easier for counterfeit, adulterated or subpotent
medicines to enter the country.''

OLYMPIC GOLD IS A FITTING END TO THE SUMMER OF VENUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Just after tucking away a nervous match
point, Venus Williams was trotting around the tennis court with a
racket in one hand and an American flag in the other. An
ambidextrous celebration for the ubiquitous Williams.
</P>
<P>
   For an entire summer, she has been everywhere, equally dominant
on different continents and under any circumstance. Upon her 32nd
victory in a row on Wednesday, Williams added a gold medal to the
Summer of Venus collection while undoing the Russian Elena
Dementieva, 6-2, 6-4, at the Olympic tennis center.
</P>
<P>
   It was typical Williams. In the fifth game of the second set,
Dementieva actually had fate going her way as she smacked a
backhand into the tape and watched it flop into Venus Williams's
side.
</P>
<P>
   A cheap point, any point, and it would have lifted Dementieva's
dragging spirits. But appearing out of nowhere, there was Williams,
darting from the baseline to within two feet of the net, slipping
her racket under the ball like a flapjack cook and flicking a get
right back to her opponent. Stunned by the development, unsure of
just what angle to take, Dementieva whacked the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has become the tour's dream squisher. One after one,
opponents have come at Williams with optimism only to leave
devastated. In a couple of weeks, Williams will gather her
back-to-school pencils and notebooks and plop down in a fashion
design class. And if a teacher or classmate should ask, ``So, what
did you do last summer?'' she can present the show-and-tell of all
time.
</P>
<P>
   Her run of trophies began in July, back when she ended her
fortnight at Wimbledon by joyously spinning around the Center Court
lawn in victory while her father flashed a sign in the players' box
that read: This is Venus' party, no one else is invited.
</P>
<P>
   The private party continued through the summer, spilling over
into the U.S. Open, and then crashing in on Sydney. On Wednesday,
Williams was in position to create an opportunity only one other
player in tennis history has achieved: play for a gold medal in the
singles and in doubles. In 1924, Helen Wills won both. On Thursday,
Williams will join her sister, Serena, to play the Dutch pair of
Miriam Oremans and Kristie Boogert in the gold medal doubles match.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the team was supposed to perform. With the exception
of Lindsay Davenport _ who had to withdraw from the Olympics after
a foot injury _ the Americans have been as dominant as advertised.
On Wednesday, Venus Williams stood with the gold, and Monica Seles
was draped with the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, doubles player Lisa Raymond might be unimpressed. She
was the one left off the blueprint in Billie Jean King's design for
the Dream Team of tennis. The Americans were constructed to win.
Davenport's injury might have prevented the sweep of their
fantasies, but everything else has fallen into place for the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The only one in Venus Williams's way of a big finish to her
summer was the unassuming Russian. Dementieva is equally blonde and
sleek, but she's the un-Kournikova. At the end of August, She
arrived at the U.S. Open without sponsors, clothing deals or
million-dollar endorsement deals.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, she separated herself from Kournikova in another way.
Before anyone realized it, she had plowed her way through to a
Grand Slam semifinal, and gave Davenport a handful before exiting
the scene. Unlike Kournikova, her talent had turned heads. Unlike
Kournikova, she chose to play for her country in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   So, her arrival in the gold-medal game was not all that
surprising. With slashing ground strokes and a solid serve,
Dementieva was at least equipped to give Williams a difficult run
for her gold.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as she pummel the side pockets of the court with her
inside-out forehands, as much as she pumped backhands down the
line, Williams was unfazed. When on the run, able to uncoil her
body for maximum power, Williams is at her best.
</P>
<P>
   The proof was in the first set. Despite a couple of hiccups in
her serve, Williams turned her opponent's best shots into winners
for herself, gradually wore down Dementieva's confidence and came
away with a 6-2 first-set certification of her dominance. One day,
Dementieva might develop a strategy. But on this day, she was just
another bystander during the Summer of Venus.

THE MYSTERIOUS TALE OF A TAPE THAT WAS STOLEN GETS STRANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The campaign of Gov. George W. Bush asserted on
Tuesday that leaked information about a federal investigation into
stolen debate materials had raised questions about whether the
probe was proceeding in an fair manner.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign issued its complaint on Tuesday in response to a
story by the Dallas Morning News in its online editions saying that
the FBI was focusing its investigation on an employee of an
Austin-based media firm that is producing Bush's campaign
commercials, Maverick Media.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications
director, said the campaign was convinced the employee, Yvette
Lozano, was innocent. And she asserted that the release of
confidential information about the investigation had raised
questions about political tampering by the Clinton administration
to help Vice President Al Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises questions about whether the investigators are
being allowed to conduct an objective investigation,'' Hughes said.
She added that the campaign manager, Joe Allbaugh, had raised
similar concerns in a telephone conversation on Tuesday afternoon
with the FBI director, Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, an FBI spokesman refused to say whether or
not agents had interviewed Lozano. ``All I can say is we have
initiated a preliminary investigation,'' said the spokesman, Paul
Bresson. ``At this point, we can't even determine if any federal
laws have been violated.''
</P>
<P>
   Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign said on Tuesday
night, ``We have a great deal of faith in the FBI investigators who
are on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``For Karen Hughes to suggest otherwise is not just
an attack on the Gore campaign. It's an attack on the FBI. And it
raises question about why the Bush campaign doesn't want the FBI to
get to the bottom of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI opened its investigation after former Rep. Thomas
Downey, who has assisted Gore in debate preparations, turned over a
package he had received on Sept. 13 containing a video of a mock
debate between Bush and Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., as well as some
briefing books. The package carried an Austin postmark.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Gore campaign suspended a 28-year-old campaign
worker who had bragged to a friend that the Democrats might have a
``mole'' inside the Bush campaign. Gore's aides said that the
suspended worker, Michael Doyne, had made the story up.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hughes complained that the FBI did not seem to be
taking Doyne's case seriously enough. ``I hope the FBI and the
federal law enforcement agencies would follow up on that boast by
looking at computer hard drives to determine whether in fact there
is any substance to those comments,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   She also rejected out of hand assertions by Molly Beth Malcolm,
chairwoman of the Texas Democratic Party, that the pilfered debate
materials were actually sent to Downey by Karl Rove, Bush's chief
political consultant. Democrats contend Rove bugged his own
campaign office during the 1986 gubernatorial campaign in order to
cast aspersions on the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Morning News reported that Lozano could be seen on a
Postal Service surveillance videotape mailing a package on Sept.
11. Lozano told the paper on Tuesday that she was returning a pair
of $19.99 Gap khaki pants for her boss. To back her story up,
McKinnon produced the pants Gap had sent him in exchange for the
returned pair.

SPORTS COLUMN: METS WON'T CELEBRATE WILD CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Sports of The Times)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets had a Hamlet dilemma Tuesday night: to be or
not to be celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets can win Wednesday night's game with the division
champion Atlanta Braves after Tuesday night's 7-1 loss, they would
clinch the wild-card berth in the National League playoffs for the
second straight season. But don't expect them to rush to the mound
in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not celebrating,'' Steve Phillips, the Mets' general
manager, said. ``Our goal is to win the division. The wild card is
a fallback.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets would be allowed to smile. ``And they can hug each
other,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they would be in the playoffs, looking forward to
opposing either the San Francisco Giants or the St. Louis Cardinals
in a National League divisional series next week.
</P>
<P>
   And if both the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Los Angeles Dodgers
also lost later Tuesday night, the Mets clinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow,'' Phillips said with a sarcastic smile, ``we'll show
up before the game and have tea and crumpets.''
</P>
<P>
   But champagne sprays in the clubhouse, no matter what. Not for
clinching the wild card. And that's as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   If you're on a wild-card team, it would be embarrassing to even
wave two fingers, as if to say, ``We're No. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all a wild card is: the second-place team with the best
record. It's even incorrect to say that any team has ``won'' the
wild card because the team hasn't really won anything. All it has
done is ``earn'' the wild card. Even a divisional champion hasn't
really won anything to celebrate. The Braves understand that. When
they clinched their ninth consecutive divisional title Tuesday
night, they hardly whooped.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card is baseball's consolation prize. You don't
celebrate a consolation prize. You just accept it. Say ``thank
you'' and try to win the big prize, the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of a wild-card celebration remember how the Mets
celebrated their wild card a year ago, but that was a different
scenario. More emotional. More unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Entering that final weekend, the Mets thought they had no
chance. But when they won their last three regular-season games
against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Shea and the Reds collapsed in
Milwaukee, the Mets were suddenly in Cincinnati for a one-game
playoff that Al Leiter won with a two-hit shutout.
</P>
<P>
   That sudden success deserved to be celebrated, but still with
some restraint because those Mets hadn't really won anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   Although those Mets ambushed the Arizona Diamondbacks in the
divisional series, they still hadn't really won anything. And when
they lost the NLCS to the Braves in six games, they definitely had
not won anything.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the wild card is just a steppingstone across the
raging river that is baseball's postseason.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the Florida Marlins used that steppingstone, then
knocked the first-place Braves out of the NL playoffs and went on
to win the World Series, the only wild-card team to get to the
other side of that raging river.
</P>
<P>
   So these Mets know it can be done because it has been done.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card, as popular as it is these days in the American
League's five-team dogfight (Seattle or Oakland, Cleveland, Toronto
and Boston), also has a weakness: the lack of urgency for a team to
try to finish in first place if it is comfortably ahead in the
wild-card race, as the Mets were even before their three-game
series in Atlanta a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing they were virtually certain to retain the wild card, the
Mets seemed to shrug off losing the first two games in Atlanta a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a baseball team had to finish first in its
league or in its division to qualify for the postseason. The wild
card was introduced in 1994, although a wild-card team was never
determined that year when the final two months of the regular
season and the entire postseason, even the World Series, were
canceled by a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball purists still wish the wild card did not exist. Major
League Baseball has postponed serious discussion of a proposal to
split 32 teams into eight divisions of four teams each, with only
the eight first-place teams qualifying for the playoffs. Maybe
someday that proposal will be adopted. If it is, there won't be a
wild card.
</P>
<P>
   And there won't be a reason to wonder if a team should celebrate
or not celebrate. &QL;

 OIL PRICE FEARS HAUNT OPEC MEETING  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS _ As an unusual collection of sheiks, emirs, presidents
and other potentates gathers Wednesday in Venezuela to talk about
oil, power and money, the rest of the world is looking on nervously
but also with a bit of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day summit in Caracas by the 11 member nations of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has consumers in the
United States and elsewhere wondering whether more bad news is
ahead for gasoline and heating-oil prices, which have risen to near
10-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC meeting marks a new phase in the growing international
struggle over oil. Western nations are increasingly jittery about
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's campaign to unify OPEC, sustain
oil prices _ which have more than tripled since he took office last
year _ and return the organization to its 1970s position of power
and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent price shocks, however, not all is gloomy for
the West.
</P>
<P>
   There have been signals recently of cooperation across the
formerly vast chasm between the world's petroleum producers and
consumers, and Chavez deserves much of the credit, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1999, he has helped bring a semblance of
unity to OPEC, which had been virtually paralyzed since the early
1980s. Venezuela, in fact, was known previously as the most
notorious ignorer of OPEC production quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's aggressive advocacy of price stability _ to the extent
that OPEC can influence it _ has opened the way for a dialogue on
how to minimize the violent price swings that have caused severe
economic damage among both producing and consuming nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a fair price _ one that is not too high or too low,
but is stable and convenient for both producers and consumers,''
said OPEC President Ali Rodriguez, who is Venezuela's oil minister
and was once a leftist guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that OPEC wants to bring oil prices from their
current average level of $31.87 per barrel down to the group's
stated goal of a dependable price ``band'' that floats between $22
and $28. Adoption of the band has been a prime achievement of
Chavez and Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Whether OPEC can _ or really wants to _ work with consumer
nations for the benefit of all may become clearer amid the summit's
pomp and ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Heads of state from Iran, Nigeria, Indonesia, Qatar and Algeria
arrived in Caracas Tuesday. Also taking part are royalty and other
top officials from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Iraq and Libya, as well as the oil ministers from nonmembers
Mexico, Russia, Norway and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez initially raised eyebrows by inviting Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein and Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy _ archenemies of
the West _ but they declined out of fear of assassination attempts
should they venture abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Despite complaints by some that the summit is a publicity stunt
aimed at raising Chavez's global profile, the mood in the
Venezuelan capital is triumphal, with art festivals dotting the
city and fireworks crackling in the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and common citizens alike say the summit
culminates what they see as their nation's long-deserved ascent to
world prominence. Public support for Chavez, who won re-election in
May, appears to have received a big boost.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is the first since 1975 for heads of state from
OPEC, which produces up to 40 percent of the world's petroleum and
holds 75 percent of proven reserves. Although OPEC oil ministers
have met regularly to discuss prices, their nations' bitter
disputes _ for example, the bloody 10-year war between Iran and
Iraq, and Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait _ have prevented the
organization from effectively controlling prices or assuming any
larger diplomatic importance.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that Chavez and Rodriguez have been working hard
behind the scenes to keep these rivalries from boiling over into
outright conflict at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can keep the leaders from each other's throats and
have them come out with a bland declaration that everybody signs,
the summit will have been a great success and OPEC will be
strengthened,'' said one Caracas-based diplomat who requested
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC member nations come to the conference with their own
priorities. For example:
</P>
<P>
   --Iran, Iraq and Libya head up the contingent opposed to any
lowering of prices that might benefit the West; all three also &LR; 
 &LR; suffer from serious economic problems that are partially mitigated
by the current high prices.
</P>
<P>
   --Saudi Arabia, with by far the largest proven reserves, is
usually accommodating to Western requests to step up production, in
large part because it relies on the U.S. military for protection.
</P>
<P>
   --Nigeria, desperately poor and riven by ethnic and religious
unrest, is already producing at maximum capacity, so it cannot take
advantage of any increases OPEC agrees to.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting Washington's uneasiness about the turbulent politics
surrounding oil, American diplomats have kept mum about the summit
except to repeat their frequent calls for stepped-up production. In
fact, it has been U.S. policy to have no direct diplomatic contact
with OPEC, calling it an anti-competitive, anti-free-market
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But that stance weakened last week, when Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson called Rodriguez to give him advance notice of President
Clinton's decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture worked. Rodriguez publicly thanked Richardson for
the courtesy and expressed support for Clinton's move _ quickly
undercutting a groundswell of opposition from other OPEC members,
including normally pro-U.S. Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for cooperation are aided by the fact that current tension
between oil-consuming nations and OPEC ``is different from the
conflict in the 1970s,'' said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge
Energy Research Associates and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author on
oil politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North-South confrontation is mostly history. OPEC nations
don't want to be left out of the new economy,'' he said. ``Most
producers are well aware of their interdependence with consuming
nations. Some have a considerable part of their national wealth
invested in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Yergin and other analysts say that despite OPEC's newfound
pragmatism, its members have little room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Oil producing nations _ OPEC members and nonmembers alike _ have
less extra production capacity than at any time since the
mid-1970s. So when speculators drive up prices, as they have
feverishly in the past several months, price bubbles result, and
OPEC is helpless to pump more crude to drive the levels down.
</P>
<P>
   It also leaves oil producers vulnerable. Price crashes after
speculative run-ups in the early 1980s, the early 1990s and again
in 1998 devastated producing nations _ as well as U.S. domestic oil
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, for whom oil revenues make up 60 percent of gross
domestic product, was thrown into a deep recession by each price
drop. The ragged slums stretching all  &LR; around Caracas and other
cities are still full of jobless workers who were driven into
poverty as a result. The official unemployment rate is 15 percent,
and somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of Venezuela's 23 million
people live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the price crashes forced domestic oil
producers to abandon much-needed investment programs, leaving them
unable to raise production when prices soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil market is strong, volatile and illogical,'' said Alan
Viergutz, an oil analyst in Caracas. ``Speculation needs to be
brought under control.''
</P>
<P>
   This, however, would seem to be possible only when excess
capacity becomes available. The effect since Clinton ordered the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve release _ prices have fallen nearly $6
from last week's high of $37.80 _ may be an example.
</P>
<P>
   As for the increased cooperation between consumers and producers
that OPEC talks about, Viergutz observed: ``The big question in the
long term is whether that will occur. In the short term, it's where
prices are going to wind up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although OPEC leaders have frequently reaffirmed their desire to
hold oil prices within the $22-28 band, they often complain of
being ignored when they press their argument that the high fuel
prices in consuming nations are caused largely by taxes and complex
environmental regulations on fuel quality.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez points out that while crude oil prices have dropped 41
percent in real terms since 1991, European Union nations have
raised oil taxes by an astronomical 350 percent. OPEC leaders note
bitterly that the $30 to $35 they receive for a barrel of oil is
far less than what the British government earns through its gas tax
_ the equivalent of about $140 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez told a nationwide radio audience Sunday: ``How nice it
would be if (Western nations) also lowered prices for the things
they sell us, lowered the prices of computers, of medicines, of
cars _ and the interest rates on foreign debts.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria insisted the
same day: ``We are not going to allow ourselves to be pushed into
(releasing) more oil than the market needs. The last time we did
that, the prices went down to $10 a barrel _ and nobody was sorry
for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done our part. We hope they cooperate by lowering
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Compromise on these issues may be harder to reach than simply
agreeing on strategic oil releases that could keep prices stable.
At a meeting last weekend in Prague, the world's wealthiest nations
ruled out lowering oil taxes and insisted that more oil be pumped.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez made clear in a televised address Monday night that
the time for taking orders has passed: ``OPEC is rising up again
from its fallen position on the ground, and Venezuela has played a
fundamental role. The balance of the universe is at stake here.''

 BUSH, GORE PUT EDUCATION PROPOSALS TO TEST  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Presidential candidates Al Gore and George Bush
sound remarkably alike as they crisscross the country, talking
about their education policies.
</P>
<P>
   Education is at the center of their campaigns, and they use the
same buzzwords: accountability, basic skills, parental choice,
class-size reduction.
</P>
<P>
   At Sequoia High School in Redwood City Tuesday, Bush said the
nation must ensure every child in every public school is challenged
by high standards and has the opportunity to pursue their
educational dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore wants ``revolutionary improvements'' in
schools to be America's ``No. 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   But beneath generalities are some major differences in how the
Democratic vice president and the Republican governor of Texas
would change the nation's more than 90,000 elementary and secondary
schools _ about $120 billion in differences.
</P>
<P>
   That is the amount separating the $47 billion Bush wants to give
schools over the next 10 years and the $170 billion Gore wants to
spend on programs and tax incentives, an amount that would increase
federal education spending by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pouring that kind of money into public schools would be a major
change for the federal government _ its financial involvement in
the nation's school systems is fairly small.
</P>
<P>
   In California, federal money represents just 9 percent of the
nearly $50 billion spent on kindergarten through Grade 12 public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a role for the federal government,'' said Marian
Bergeson, former education cabinet secretary for GOP Gov. Pete
Wilson. ``It should facilitate efforts at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throwing federal money after federal programs that are
operated out of Washington has traditionally shown no improvement
in student performance,'' Bergeson said in defense of Bush's
education policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spending priorities are $8.2 billion to increase grants
to low-income students and $5 billion to help poor children in
kindergarten through Grade 2 learn to read.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $2 billion would help low-income parents pay for
after-school programs for their children.
</P>
<P>
   He would also require students in Grade 3 through Grade 8 to
take standardized math and reading tests annually much as
California already requires of its second-graders through high
school juniors.
</P>
<P>
   Students in low-performing schools could receive vouchers for
private schools or tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's two biggest-ticket items are $20 billion more for special
education and $50 billion to offer preschool to every 4-year-old, a
major new federal entitlement program.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to increase access to computers, rehabilitate
dilapidated schools, hire more teachers and pay them more money,
including $5,000 bonuses to teachers at schools who meet academic
performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gives states more control over education policy. States
would set their teacher certification standards. They would set the
performance standards for their schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would take some 60 federal programs and lump them into five
broad categories to give states more spending flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   But, in his quest to woo the middle-of-the-road voter Bush
breaks with the more conservative elements of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Bob Dole ran on a GOP platform that called for
the elimination of the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year's Republican National Convention, Bush
intervened to make sure that was not in this year's platform.
</P>
<P>
   He even calls for an expansion of the department's authority by
giving it control of Head Start, the preschool program for
low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush favors vouchers but their use would be limited to
low-income students in schools that do not improve after three
years. The money, $1,500, could be used to pay for tutoring or
cover some of the costs of a private school.
</P>
<P>
   Gore opposes vouchers. But like Bush, he champions some
traditional GOP ideas, such as rewarding schools that show academic
improvement and punishing those that do not.
</P>
<P>
   He also trumps Bush on charter schools _ public schools
independently run by parents or community groups.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to double the number of charter schools at a cost of
$300 million. Gore would triple them for $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin, a
Gore backer, chides Bush for his tax cut, which reduces how much
can be invested in schools.
</P>
<P>
   She praises Gore for investment in preschool programs and his
commitment of $8 billion in tax incentives to encourage repair of
aging schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is a better vote for children,'' Eastin said. ``Having a
massive tax cut before you pay off the deficit is pushing off the
debt to our children. It's immoral for us not to pay down the
debt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The suggestion we ought to really worry about these old
schools whether in San Francisco or Hayfork seems to me something
the Gore people have acknowledged and the Bush people haven't,''
Eastin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeson counters that much of the recent changes in
California's education system are modeled on changes instituted by
Bush in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is very consistent with the direction we've taken,'' she
said.

U.S. SUPREME COURT REJECTS GOVERNMENT REQUEST OF QUICK REVIEW
OF  MICROSOFT CASE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS and CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp., facing a possible breakup of the
company by antitrust authorities, scored an important tactical
victory Tuesday as the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a government
request that it take up the landmark case against the software
giant.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the case will go to a federal appeals court, which is
widely seen as a friendlier venue for Microsoft's claims that it is
nothing more than an aggressive competitor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, by prolonging the judicial process, Microsoft
will be able to argue that circumstances have changed and that it
is no longer the dominant player it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big win for Microsoft,'' said Hillard Sterling, a
Chicago antitrust lawyer. ``Time is clearly on Microsoft's side as
competitive forces evolve in these markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust case is viewed in Silicon Valley as a litmus test
for the frequently cutthroat business practices that characterize
the high-tech industry _ practices that some say stifle competition
and limit consumers' choices.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said it wants
both sides to propose schedules for future hearings by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal experts expect the case to eventually make its way to
the Supreme Court, perhaps a couple of years from now.
</P>
<P>
   But by having the Court of Appeals take a crack at it first,
Microsoft is hoping to get some of the complex legal matters out of
the way so the high court can address loftier questions concerning
the role government should play in ensuring a competitive
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This favors Microsoft because it's what Microsoft wanted,''
said Allan Van Fleet, a Houston antitrust lawyer. ``Every day that
there's not a final judgment is another day Microsoft is not
exposed to a breakup order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today is the day that divestiture died as a
solution,'' said William Kovacic, a law professor at George
Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; New Developments
</P>
<P>
   Although the appeals court will continue to examine issues that
were at the core of the government's case when the antitrust
proceedings began in 1998, legal experts said the court's judges
will not be able to overlook subsequent developments.
</P>
<P>
   These developments, including America Online's acquisition of
Netscape and pending takeover of Time Warner, and the growing
popularity of the Linux operating system, could affect their
perception of the case, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, for one, is counting on just such a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has completely changed since the case was first
filed,'' said Jim Cullinan, a spokesman for the company. ``I mean,
no one talks about browsers anymore, and that was the heart of the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Microsoft remains ``very confident'' that it will
prevail in the court of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Department of Justice, which had argued that
the case is too important to the U.S. economy to wend its way
through the appellate process, put on a brave face Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to presenting our case to the court of appeals
as expeditiously as possible,'' said Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman
for the department.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is appealing a ruling earlier this year by U.S.
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that the company
illegally protected its Windows operating system and Internet
Explorer browser by bullying technology firms into excluding rival
software.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ordered that Microsoft be split into two different
companies, one centered on Windows and the other on all its other
products, including the Office suite of applications.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup order was subsequently placed on hold pending the
outcome of the appellate process.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court voted 8 to 1 to prevent having the case
hop-scotch over the appeals court, as the government and 19 states
had sought. Only Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, saying ``the
case significantly affects an important sector of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, Chief Justice William Rehnquist said he
saw no reason to disqualify himself even though his son is a
partner at a Boston law firm that works for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates will be cheered by
the high court's decision is that the court of appeals issued an
earlier ruling in Microsoft's favor.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the court ruled that Judge Jackson had misstepped
in ordering Microsoft to detach its Web browser from the Windows
operating system. The appeals court said Microsoft had not violated
antitrust regulations by bundling the two products together.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling, the Chicago lawyer, said the appeals court will react
with ``great skepticism'' to Jackson's final ruling, which all but
ignored the earlier appellate decision.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; A Favorable Forum
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ``has every indication of being a more
favorable forum to Microsoft,'' agreed Daniel Wall, a San Francisco
antitrust lawyer and a former clerk for the appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the seven appellate judges' political leanings
and past decisions, he said, ``It is fairly predictable that four
of them will be philosophically inclined toward Microsoft's
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this means that they're going to win,'' Wall
emphasized. ``It's just a pretty good forum in which they can feel
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Sims, a Washington antitrust lawyer, said that ``it's
hard to say anything other than that this a reasonably technically
competent court'' and that ``it's hard to find it strongly biased
one way or the other in favor or against government actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling said Microsoft will undoubtedly draw the appellate
court's attention to an often-cited quotation from Learned Hand, an
influential federal judge who passed away almost four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hand wrote that ``the successful competitor, having been urged
to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the crux of Microsoft's argument,'' Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Justice Department also can exploit Hand's wisdom by
noting his belief that ``great industrial consolidations are
inherently undesirable, regardless of their economic results.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Sterling said Microsoft probably will be victorious
in both the court of appeals and the Supreme Court. ``Judge
Jackson's decision just doesn't hold water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Fleet, the Houston lawyer, said an ultimate high court
ruling will depend heavily on how much sway Justice Breyer has over
the proceedings. Breyer, he said, ``is a believer in antitrust laws
being enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a potential wild card looms in November's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Economides, an economics professor at New York
University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business, said he thinks
that whoever wins the election may choose to weigh in on the
Microsoft case and seek an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either Bush or Gore may find a way to compromise,'' he said.
``They both know that the markets move much faster than the legal
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, at least, was quick to express its pleasure with
Tuesday's ruling. Microsoft's stock rose $1.44 to close at $62.69.

 CALIFORNIA SCORES HIGH MARKS FOR TEACHING EVOLUTION  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   California is among just six states that received high marks for
their teaching of evolution, while 19 states faired poorly and
Kansas flunked out, &LR;  with a curriculum deemed ``disgraceful,''
according to a new report that promises to fuel the ongoing debate
between science and religion.
</P>
<P>
   The report commissioned by the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and
released Tuesday by the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, considers how well evolution is included in the state
science education standards of 49 states and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The states were each given a letter grade, with California and
five other states, Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina
and Rhode Island, receiving a perfect 100 percent. They ranked high
for introducing at least some of the basic processes of biological
evolution early on, building on them later, making evolution the
centerpiece of the life sciences and maintaining the continuity of
historical sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five other states received grades between an A and C,
from very good to satisfactory. But six states _ Arkansas,
Kentucky, Wisconsin, Virginia, Alaska and Illinois _ rate an
unsatisfactory D, and 13 others an F or worse, which the report
says indicates their ``standards are quite useless for purposes of
teaching evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The states with a failing grade were: Wyoming, Maine, Ohio,
Oklahoma, New Hampshire, Florida, Alabama, North Dakota, Georgia,
Mississippi, West Virginia and Tennessee. Kansas's grade was
F-minus.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa was not included in the report because it allows local
districts to set education standards.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Johnson, a professor of law at UC Berkeley and an author
of books about evolution, was critical of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a pile of nonsense and the enlistment of the
cultural and financial power of the scientific enterprise in a
program of indoctrination and not education,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He called it part of an ``anti-religious movement'' that forces
students to trust science.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taught an ideology. They are told to believe and not
to ask any questions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the report, Lawrence S. Lerner, a professor
emeritus at the California State University at Long Beach produced
the report for the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, calls ``creation
science,'' a ``pseudoscientific rival to evolution that the courts
have repeatedly held to be thinly veiled religion.'' He said that
objections to the teaching of evolution are expressed in elementary
and secondary education in various ways. In some states, the
fundamental concepts and facts are covered only briefly but the
word ``evolution'' is carefully avoided in favor of ``change over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In others, the ``subject is avoided altogether or barely
mentioned, reducing the sciences _ especially the biological
sciences _ to disjointed lists of facts,'' he says in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching of evolution in schools evokes bitter controversy,
Lerner says, and indeed the issue has galvanized states in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Board of Education made national headlines last year
when it dropped the big-bang theory of the origin of the universe
and revised science teaching standards to emphasize creationism
over evolution.
</P>
<P>
   In giving Kansas the lowest grade of all the states, Lerner
calls the state's science education standards a ``disgraceful paean
to antiscience.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway, former chairman of the Kansas State Board of
Education, said the report was deceptive and ``very unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly they have an ax to grind about evolution,'' she told
the Associated Press in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's D-rated science standards earn a comment from Lerner
that ``It appears that young Kentuckians are to be sheltered from
any exposure to evolution and other dangerous words and theories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a problem for science literacy in this country,'' said
Molleen Matsunura,(cq) &LR;  of the National Center for Science
Education in Berkeley. ``It is not new, but it is something to
worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that college science professors are reporting students
coming in unprepared, having never heard of evolution, and that
students who do not learn evolution will not pass the science
subject section of the SAT or the Advanced Placement test.
</P>
<P>
   Her organization, the National Center for Science Education,
which defends evolution in public science education, has gotten
involved in an average of 56 local or state debates over
creationism versus evolution every year. The issue has heated up so
much that by July 31 this year the organization had recorded 55
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   They have opposed a public school teacher who insisted on
telling students about his summer search for Noah's Arc, a school
board candidate who wanted creationism to be taught in county-run
education programs, and a teacher who invited a minister to teach
creation science in his public school class.
</P>
<P>
   Matsunura said California ranked high in the new study because
the State Board of Education has adopted a curriculum framework and
science standards that include the teaching of evolution. It also
approved a policy in 1989 stating that ``discussions of any
scientific fact, hypothesis, or theory related to the origins of
the universe, the earth, and of life'' are appropriate to the
science curriculum, while discussions of ``divine creation,
ultimate purposes, or ultimate causes'' are appropriate to the
history, social science and English curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Matsunura said it is important that teachers have their school
boards behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California and other states there are teachers who are
given a hard time by parents who do not want evolution taught. The
teachers can say, `I have to teach it because it is in the
standards,''' she said.

HYDRAULIC GOLD MINING BLAMED FOR MERCURY-POISONED FISH IN SIERRA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JIM DOYLE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a century after the end of the Gold Rush, scientists
have found new evidence of its toxic legacy: high levels of
poisonous mercury in bass and catfish in two northern Sierra Nevada
watersheds.
</P>
<P>
   The finding by the U.S. Geological Survey, contained in a report
released Tuesday, prompted California officials to warn people
about eating fish from the Bear and Yuba Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The levels of mercury were high enough that we felt we should
recommend that people monitor and limit the number of fish they eat
from this part of the Sierra,'' said Allan Hirsch, a spokesman for
the California Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The study is based on 141 samples of fish, including catfish,
bass, trout, and sunfish, collected last year from reservoirs and
streams in Nevada, Placer and Yuba counties. The reservoirs
included Englebright Lake, Scotts Flat Reservoir, Rollins Lake,
Lake Combie and Camp Far West Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous studies have assessed the environmental effects of
mining operations in the Sierra, but most have focused on acidic
water and heavy metals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fish survey is part of the first comprehensive
investigation in the Sierra Nevada region of mercury distribution
in water, sediment, and biota, and the potential risks to human
health and ecosystems,'' said Charlie Alpers, a USGS chemist and
the study's chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found high concentrations of liquid elemental
mercury, or quicksilver, in the Bear River and Yuba River
watersheds, where it was used extensively from the early gold
mining days until the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Hydraulic mining, which was invented in the 1850s in the Bear
River watershed, is believed to be the culprit. Mercury was used to
separate gold from ore and to create an amalgam that could later be
separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy of the Gold Rush is finally being more
appreciated,'' Alpers said. ``It's another little gift from our
ancestors that we haven't quite unwrapped yet. I'm sure the gold
miners who poured mercury by the flask into sluice boxes didn't
want to hurt anyone. They just wanted to find more gold.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that between 3 million to 8 million pounds of
mercury was dumped into the Sierra environment through hydraulic
mining.
</P>
<P>
   The levels are high enough to merit concern, scientists said,
but for the most part were below the level where the federal
government must take action.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury levels in bass ranged from 0.20 to 1.5 parts per million
(ppm). Channel catfish had mercury levels from 0.16 to 0.75 ppm.
Brown trout had levels from 0.02 to 0.43 ppm. Sunfish had levels
ranging from less than 0.10 to 0.41 ppm.
</P>
<P>
   California regulations consider mercury levels above 0.3 ppm
high enough to warrant further study. The Food and Drug
Administration action level for commercial fish is 1.0 ppm.
Ingesting mercury can cause nerve damage and developmental
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elemental mercury, the kind you can see, is only one part of
the problem,'' said Jason May, a USGS biologist. ``It is the
presence of methylmercury, the organic form of mercury that
accumulates in organisms, that will be of most concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Methylmercury is known to increase in concentration as it moves
up the food chain. Concentrations tend to be highest in predatory
fish like bass and brown trout.
</P>
<P>
   Federal scientists have submitted their data to the California
Environmental Protection Agency and county health officials, who
will determine whether to formally notify the public about the
potential risks from consuming fish in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve bodies of water in California, including San Francisco
Bay, Clear Lake and Lake Berryessa, have health advisories related
to high levels of mercury in fish. But there are currently no such
advisories in California's historic gold mining areas.
</P>
<P>
   Children and fetuses are the most susceptible to mercury
poisoning because their nervous systems are still growing. Eating
fish contaminated with mercury can affect a child's behavior,
causing deficiencies in motor skills, language, and attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch, of Cal EPA, said that the mercury levels found in the
Sierra are comparable to the levels previously found in San
Francisco Bay, the Sacramento Delta, reservoirs in Santa Clara
County and lakes in the Coast Mountain Ranges, where mercury was
mined before being brought to the Sierra for gold mining.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the time being, we are recommending that people eat no
more than one meal a month of bass and one meal a week of other
fish species there,'' he said. ``We are strongly recommending that
pregnant women and children pay particular attention to the fish
they eat.''

BUSH DELIVERS HIS EDUCATION MESSAGE IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush came to the
Bay Area to send an education message Tuesday, but he repeatedly
downplayed the role of the federal government _ at one point
telling a questioner to ``write your governor'' with concerns about
teacher salaries.
<P>
   Bush's campaign touted his trip as an swing aimed at criticizing
what he has called the ``education recession'' under the
Clinton-Gore Administration. But it was also a junket to scoop up
campaign cash, with the governor scheduling three fund-raisers in
Silicon Valley and Bel Air which swept up $1.4 million for the
state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   With 41 days until the election, Bush -- though down double
digits in the polls here -- continued to insist he will campaign
and fight hard in California, and his campaign confirmed his plans
to return here in October.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas Governor's message in campaign events also
underscored the challenges of focusing on education as the lead
issue in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared at Sequoia High School in Redwood City flanked by
nearly two dozen high school students sitting at bright purple
I-Mac computers. But the teenagers mostly provided a backdrop. Only
one asked a question of Bush, who focused on answering questions
from an audience of local supporters and educators.
</P>
<P>
   Later, two students complained that Bush campaign volunteers
confiscated their Gore-Lieberman placards during the presidential
candidate's visit, and Principal Morgan Marchbanks said two
students appeared ``genuinely upset'' that Bush volunteers had
taken signs out of their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting his outlook to that of Vice President Gore, Bush
told the crowd of about 200 there that the nation seeks ``a
president who is willing to talk about the hope and promise of
education, and mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for ``high standards, local control of schools,'' and
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the old tired argument that measurement is too
intrusive, that measurement is racist,'' he said.``Let me tell you
what's racist: racist is moving children through the system without
understanding whether they can read or write, add and subtract.
That's racist. That's discrimination as far as I am concerned,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But in taking questions from the audience, Bush appeared to step
on his own education message.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do to raise teacher salaries, Bush agreed
teachers should be well paid. Then, he said: ``I would be wary of
some people running for federal office saying vote for me, ``I'm
going to make sure your teachers are well taken care of. There's
just not enough money of the federal level .... Therefore, I would
suggest you write your governor and make sure he makes education
the number one priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his support for school vouchers on a day in which
Gore announced his opposition to Proposition 38, the controversial
initiative on school vouchers, Bush did not take a position.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 38 would provide a $4,000 voucher to every family
sending children to private schools, regardless of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state of California wants to do that, it's up to the
state of California,'' Bush said. ``I believe in local control of
schools. I don't believe the federal government ought to be telling
...California or the state of Texas how to run your business.''
</P>
<P>
   Another questioner wanted to know what he would do to reduce
class sizes, and Bush repeated his theme that was not the
president's job. ``Again, class size is really going to be up to
funding at the state level,'' he said. `(That's) really a function
of the public school budget...that's going to be up to the state of
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also made some flubs which appeared to mar his message.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on troubles in America's classrooms, he said, ``If you
don't diagnose an issue, you can't solve it.``
</P>
<P>
   On his approach to Israel, Bush said, ``I will have a
foreign-handed foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush appeared extremely upbeat about his prospects in the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   To one questioner, he said, ``Now's your chance. You could be
talking to the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, the Texas Governor referred to `Vice President
Cheney and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was even more upbeat about his prospects in both a drop-by
at a Redwood City campaign headquarters and before a crowd of high
tech leaders at the home of Autodesk CEO Carol Bartz in Atherton.
``I'm here because I believe I can win the great state of
California,` he told the $1,000 a plate donors. `I like a good
competitive race. I think it brings out the best in all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, a Bel Air fund-raiser at the home of entrepreneur David
Sapperstein, included meeting with local rabbis. The Bush campaign,
which had lately criticized Gore for dining with entertainment
bigwigs -- carefully noted that it included ``people from all
different sectors, from all over the city,'' and no major
entertainment figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Governor later appeared on the Larry King show in Los
Angeles, Bush was asked if he were worried about the debates, Bush
said, ``Not yet....I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said the reports of a campaign ``mole`' inside the Bush
campaign -- including a tape of Bush's debate practice session,
were disturbing. ``It's not one of my supporters. Somebody who's
for me is not going to be sending tapes to the Gore campaign,'' he
said. `We're gong to get o the bottom of it..and I look forward to
finding out who it is.''

JONES TAKES 200 HEAT; DRUG USE CONTINUES TO TAINT GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ As yet another drug scandal struck the
Olympic track and field competition on Wednesday, Marion Jones
sprinted for the first time since the public announcement that her
husband had tested positive for steroids, easily winning her
opening heat in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before Jones's heat, the gold medal favorite in the
women's hammer throw was told while on the track that she was
ineligible to compete because she had failed a drug test for the
steroid nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   Mihaela Melinte of Romania, a two-time world champion in the
hammer throw, became the seventh person suspended at the Sydney
Games for failed drug tests. She tested positive June 7 at a meet
in Milan, track and field's world governing body said.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third drug scandal involving Romanians in Sydney.
Tuesday, the 16-year-old gymnastics all-around champion, Adreea
Raducan, was stripped of her gold medal after testing positive for
the stimulant ephedrine. Earlier, the entire Romanian
weight-lifting team was expelled after two athletes had tested
positive for nandrolone before the Games. The lifters who had not
tested positive were allowed back in after Romanian Olympic
officials paid a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 athletes have either withdrawn before the Games or
been caught during the Sydney Olympics in drug-related offenses,
confirming the belief by many that the use of performance-enhancing
drugs is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   This morning Melinte was preparing to warm up for the hammer
throw qualifying round when ``she was informed of the reason why
she could not compete,'' said Giorgio Reineri, a spokesman for
track and field's world governing body, known as the IAAF ``She
said she didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone is the steroid for which the shot-putter C. &UR;  &LR; J.
Hunter, Jones's husband, tested positive for four times this
summer, the IAAF said. Hunter has said that he believed he ingested
the substance from taking improperly labeled and contaminated
nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Jones did not refer to her husband's troubles after she won her
heat of the women's 200 meters in 22.75 seconds. She spoke only of
her race, saying she was simply trying to conserve energy in the
first heat because she had another round of the 200 scheduled for
Wednesday night, as well as qualifying for the long jump. Her
awkward form in that event figures to be her biggest impediment to
becoming the first female track and field athlete to win five gold
medals in one Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stated all along that this day was going to be the most
difficult for me because I had two heats of the 200 and the long
jump,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing from the 200 was Inger Miller, the 1999 world
champion and the only real threat to Jones in the event. Miller
earlier withdrew from the 100 meters, which Jones won last
Saturday, after suffering a strained hamstring in training before
the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is still hoping she can run on the American 4x100-meter
relay, which is scheduled for Saturday, her agent, Emanuel Hudson,
said this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the U.S. track and
field federation, said specifically that Miller did not fail a drug
test and was eligible to compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Favor Hamilton had the fastest time in the preliminary
heats of the women's 1,500 meters in 4 minutes 8.08 seconds and is
an inviting position now to win the gold medal. The American
champion, Regina Jacobs, withdrew before the Games with a
respiratory viral infection. And on Wednesday, the defending
Olympic champion at 800 and 1,500 meters, Svetlana Masterkova of
Russia, did not complete her heat of the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Masterkova has had surgery on both Achilles' tendons in the past
year, and her return to form has been uncertain. She had dropped
any intention of defending her 800-meter title and she had avoided
the European racing circuit as she tried to regain her fitness. She
pulled up during on Wednesday's heat and burst into tears as she
hobbled off the track.
</P>
<P>
   The other American entrant in the women's 1,500, Marla Runyan,
struggled through the first round but qualified for the semifinals
in 4:10.83. Runyan is the first legally blind athlete to make the
American team in any sport.  &QL;

SHEFFIELD BACK BUT NOT PLEASED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Sheffield was told by back specialist Jae
Chon that he wouldn't further irritate his back by playing, so he
was in the lineup for the first time in six games and back chasing
Duke Snider's single-season Los Angeles Dodgers home run record.
</P>
<P>
   And while Sheffield said his back felt much better and he was
glad to finish the season on the field rather than the trainer's
table, he also looked back on the Dodgers' disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a better season (than 1999),'' said
Sheffield, whose fifth-inning homer was his 42nd, one shy of
Snider's mar ``I know expectations were higher, which they should
have been. We're playing better than we did last year, but we just
didn't play better at the right times. Everything is about doing it
right when it counts and that's the way it's always been.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do it in the first half. You have to do it in the
second half. It seemed like we picked up our play at the end, but
it seems like it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Dodgers are playing their best baseball of the
season. Their starting pitching has been spectacular: a combined
1.73 past 14 games. That helped catapult them to a season-high 10
games over .500 entering Tuesday's game against San Francisco, the
first time in three seasons they've reached that level.
</P>
<P>
   Dreadful at home most of the season, the Dodgers were 8-2 with
three games remaining on the homestand. They also had won eight of
their last nine.
</P>
<P>
   How important is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I throw it out,'' Sheffield said. ``That's how it's always
been since I've been here. For three years, we've played this way
at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield needed five walks to ensure him of his second straight
season of at least a .300 batting average with 30 homers, 100 runs,
100 RBI and 100 walks.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Today's start by rookie right-hander Luke
Prokopec will be his last scheduled one of the season. Rookie
right-hander Eric Gagne, who left his last start after getting hit
on the right wrist, is slated to start Saturday in San Diego. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The tentative 2001 schedule, which must be OK'd by the players
association, has the Dodgers opening the season with a seven-game
homestand. It begins with a single game against Milwaukee on April
7, followed by three-game series against Arizona and San Francisco.
Originally, the Dodgers were going to open with one game at
Milwaukee, but the commissioner's office changed it upon request. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Tests on right-hander Ismael Valdes' right pinkie, in which he
experienced numbness that forced him to miss his start two weeks
ago, were negative. . . . Right-hander Carlos Garcia and shortstop
Joe Thurston were named the organization's minor-league pitcher and
player of the year, respectively. Both played at Class A San
Bernardino of the California League. Garcia was 17-7 with a 2.48
ERA and Thurston batted .303 with 70 RBI and 43 stolen bases.

EDITORIAL: THE COURT OF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 26:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's influence in American life was underscored
in June with a burst of term-ending decisions on contentious social
and political issues like abortion, school prayer, public aid to
parochial schools, the rights of criminal suspects and the civil
rights of gay people. The narrow margins in some of these cases
reflected the continuing turmoil over certain fundamental questions
of constitutional law that defines the Rehnquist court. It also
served as a reminder that the coming presidential election could
have a profound impact on the court's future direction.
</P>
<P>
   The advanced age of several justices _ Justice John Paul Stevens
is 80; Chief Justice William Rehnquist is nearly 76; and Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor is 70 _ means that the next president may well
find himself in a position to name two or more replacements. Even
one new face might be enough to alter the court's present course on
abortion and gay rights, church-state separation, racial justice,
federal power over state governments and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the string of 5-to-4 decisions in which a
determined conservative majority has begun to weaken Congress'
power to protect basic civil rights. In the name of states' rights,
it has struck down portions of one law barring age discrimination
in employment and another allowing rape victims to sue their
attackers. In June, the court correctly overturned bans on
so-called partial birth abortion worded to water down abortion
rights generally, but the one-vote margin did not bode well for
future cases. Similarly, just one vote made the difference when the
court, departing from its traditional analysis in discrimination
cases, ruled in favor of the Boy Scouts' right to exclude gay
members.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the presidential candidates have given the court little
attention on the campaign trail in comparison with issues like
taxes and prescription drugs. Nevertheless, many voters regard the
court as the campaign's central issue, and there are few issues on
which the differences between the two candidates are so clear.
Moreover, even though justices cannot always be counted on to side
with the presidents who pick them, chief executives determined to
change the court's ideological direction generally succeed. For
that reason, voters should ask themselves which candidate's broad
vision for the court and its role in protecting constitutional
freedoms most closely matches their own.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to identify his favorite justices, George W. Bush names
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, the court's strongest
conservatives. Scalia and Thomas were the only dissenters last term
when the court, in a decision written by their usual ally, Chief
Justice Rehnquist, upheld the longstanding Miranda rule requiring
that suspects be read their rights before a formal interrogation.
They were also the only justices to dissent when the court, by a
surprisingly wide 7-to-2 margin, voted last January to preserve the
ability of citizens to bring lawsuits to enforce anti-pollution
laws, a valuable tool for protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   By citing Scalia and Thomas as his favorites, Bush suggests that
he would fill vacancies with conservative nominees who could be
expected to support organized school prayer, tuition vouchers and
further curbs on the reach of the federal government in the spheres
of civil rights, criminal justice and environmental regulation.
Bush would be under fearsome pressure from interest groups within
his party to follow through on that implicit pledge. As to
abortion, he insists that a potential justice's views on the issue
will not be a ``litmus test,'' but he continues to support his
party's platform plank calling for the appointment of anti-abortion
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore says he will make it a point to name
justices who respect women's reproductive freedom. Though he names
two liberal jurists from an earlier era, Thurgood Marshall and
William Brennan, as the justices he most admires, his nominees are
likely to be judicial moderates in the mold of President Clinton's
two appointees, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer.
They are generally supportive of civil rights and civil liberties,
and offended by the Rehnquist court's troubling trend of elevating
states' rights over federal authority, in the process substituting
the court's own judgment of what national laws are needed for that
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from whatever Supreme Court vacancies may arise, the next
president will have the chance to fill numerous vacancies in the
lower federal courts. These appointments, especially to the federal
courts of appeals, will also have a profound influence on the
course of justice. That is another good reason that both candidates
should be asked to explain more fully their thinking about judicial
nominations whose impact will far outlast the winner's tenure as
president.

CASE ON USE OF GOLF CARTS GOES TO HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking up its first case on the relationship
between disability law and professional sports, the Supreme Court
announced Tuesday that it would decide whether the golfer Casey
Martin has a legal right to use a cart rather than walk the course
during PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was a setback for the 27-year-old Martin, who
has a circulatory disorder in his right leg that makes it painful
and difficult to walk any appreciable distance. After the Tour
barred him in 1997 from riding a cart, saying it would give him an
unfair advantage in competition, Martin sued under the Americans
With Disabilities Act and won his case before two lower federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour filed a Supreme Court appeal in July, arguing that
the lower courts had invoked the federal law in a context where it
did not belong. ``It is essential to the nature of high-level Tour
events that all competitors, without exception, play by the same
rules,'' the PGA Tour said in its appeal to the justices. The court
will hear the case in January and decide it by early next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans With Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on
the basis of disability in ``any place of public accommodation.''
</P>
<P>
   The statute defines discrimination as ``a failure to make
reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures''
unless those modifications ``would fundamentally alter the nature''
of the activity.
</P>
<P>
   Given those phrases, the Martin case presents two basic
questions to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   First, is a golf course a ``place of public accommodation'' for
professional golfers during a tournament? The law itself lists golf
courses as examples of places of public accommodation, but the PGA
Tour is arguing that the definition applies only to the spectators'
areas, not to the competitors' area behind the ropes that the
public has no right to enter.
</P>
<P>
   The second question is whether, assuming the law does apply
behind the ropes, use of a cart represents such a fundamental
change in the nature of the competition that it cannot be
considered a ``reasonable modification.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour argues that walking a course four times during the
four days of a tournament _ a total distance of 25 miles or more _
is itself a test of stamina and endurance that is an inherent part
of the sport. The Tour told the justices that it was
``unprecedented for a federal court to order that a professional
athlete be allowed to compete without adhering to the full set of
substantive rules applicable to other competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's lawyers, not surprisingly, framed the issue quite
differently. Competition in golf is shot-making, not ``a race
against the clock or against human endurance,'' they told the court
in their unsuccessful effort to persuade the justices not to hear
the PGA Tour's appeal. ``If no rule of competition, regardless of
its purpose, can be modified to permit participation by people with
disabilities, then _ ironically _ sport would become the only
industry in America permitted to construct barriers to access that
are unrelated to performance,'' Martin's lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling for Martin last March, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the 9th Circuit, in San Francisco, noted that even with a cart, he
had to walk about 25 percent of the course, because the cart often
cannot be driven directly to the ball. The pain of walking that
distance, as well as constantly getting in and out of the cart,
meant that Martin was hardly spared the fatigue shared by golfers
without his disability, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, it would have been surprising for the Supreme Court
to take up a case involving at most a handful of competitors in a
single sport. But almost simultaneously with the 9th Circuit's
ruling in Martin's favor, the federal appeals court in Chicago came
out the other way in a case involving Ford Olinger, a club pro from
Indiana who has a degenerative hip condition. The disagreement
between the two courts on the same issue probably persuaded the
justices of the need to issue a ruling. &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman has only a month to end his safety-net
campaign in Connecticut, where he is running for a third term in
the Senate as well as for vice president on Al Gore's ticket. His
Democratic colleagues in the Senate are pressing him to drop the
Senate re-election bid lest his seat be lost if the national ticket
wins. Even his own constituents oppose his dual candidacy by a
narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman should take the hints and resign quickly from the
Senate race. That would give state party leaders a chance to put
another candidate or candidates on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   With a line that sounds more self-protective than
public-spirited, Lieberman has maintained that if he drops out of
his Senate race this late, voters will be deprived of a primary
before the Nov. 7 election. But if he wins the vice presidency,
Connecticut voters are deprived of any choice at all for as much as
two years under the state's flawed election law. One person _
Connecticut's Republican governor _ would choose the new senator
from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has mistakenly refused to budge from his position,
saying that he and the people of Connecticut have ``agreed to
disagree'' on this issue. This situation may suit Lieberman's job
security needs, but it does not serve democracy or his Connecticut
constituents well.

EDITORIAL: DEBATE TIME FOR THE NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 27:
</P>
<P>
   The tightening presidential race makes it all the more important
for Americans to take a close look at Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore at their first debate next Tuesday night. For the
NBC and Fox networks, however, baseball and commercial interests
appear to be more important than the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has decided not to run the debate the first night and to go
instead with a baseball playoff game _ and a league championship
game, if there is one, on the night of the last debate on Oct. 17.
Fox plans to snub the debate in favor of a new science-fiction
adventure series produced by James Cameron of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC notes that it has a contract with Major League Baseball to
show the game. But this is the same network that was negotiating
with the Bush campaign a few weeks ago to pass over the
presidential debate commission and broadcast a debate session
exclusively, so surely it can be inventive about finding a way to
fulfill its civic obligation. For both NBC and Fox, that means
carrying the debates live, facilitating programming that produces
the largest possible national audiences. In the past such debates,
simultaneously broadcast on all major networks, have drawn as many
as 90 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The networks' duty is to serve that wide spectrum of the
American public rather than their own commercial interests for just
a few nights every four years. &QL;

BAKERS HAS WHAT DODGERS CAN'T OFFER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I can think of, oh, a baker's dozen reasons the
Los Angeles Dodgers and their fans might dream of having Dusty
Baker as their next manager, assuming it's true that Davey Johnson
is about to be mercifully relieved of his duties.
</P>
<P>
   Baker is the best manager in the National League, proving it
again this season, rallying the San Francisco Giants from a
nine-game deficit to the West Division title. He's a popular
ex-Dodgers player, a Southern California native. He might be
available, since his Giants contract is up. And so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention he's the best manager in the National League?
</P>
<P>
   What I can't think of is a single reason Dusty Baker would want
to come here.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a smart guy like this ever leave the greatest managing
job there ever was?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, speaking about his future before Tuesday night's
Giants-Dodgers game, Baker didn't rule anything out and didn't rule
anything in. Leaving all bargaining chips on the table is smart
business for anyone who's about to enter contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess other people are thinking about it. I'm not thinking
about it,'' he insisted in the visiting manager's office at Dodger
Stadium. ``I'm just doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   But I'll say it: Baker-to-the-Dodgers simply isn't going to
happen. He knows it. And they know it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the difference between managing the Giants and managing
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 1995 and 1996, Baker managed the Giants to consecutive
sub-.500 seasons. They finished last in 1995 and 1996. He says he
didn't worry about getting fired, and he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Johnson is managing the Dodgers to a record that stands
11 games over .500 after Tuesday's 4-0 victory. He could wind up
with 89 wins _ the way they're playing now that it doesn't matter.
They have a shot to finish second. It's considered a foregone
conclusion that Johnson will be fired.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Baker survived those losing seasons is that he was
coming off a 103-victory performance as a rookie manager in 1993.
One reason Johnson probably won't survive this winning season is
that he was coming off an 85-loss season in his first try with the
Dodgers in 1999. Beyond that, though, it's a matter of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodgers manager is expected to win, and ever since the
O'Malley family sold out, it's or-else. A Giants manager is
expected to do his best with an underpaid roster of cast-off
players and yearn silently for a job with a richer club.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the low expectations have persisted, along with the
Giants' ``overachiever'' image, even though they've won more games
than anybody else in the NL West in the nearly eight seasons since
Baker was promoted from batting coach to manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on both sides. I played on the largest-market team
there is,'' Baker said of his eight seasons as a Dodgers
outfielder. ``We went to spring training expecting to win _
everybody expected us to win. I remember, playing here in L.A., one
year we lost to the Yankees in the World Series, and we were afraid
to go outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations are now the problem of an old friend of
Baker's _ Johnson, who dressed next to him and batted behind him
with the Atlanta Braves in the early 1970s, and who became a friend
and offseason fishing partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were high expectations and when things don't work out,
somebody has to take the blame,'' Baker said, referring to the
Dodgers of 2000. ``When the team wins, everybody gets credit, and
when the team loses, you (the manager) get the blame. . . . When
you lose, (people think) it's like you've lost your desire or
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down to what kind of players you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he is not flattered by the speculation that he'll
replace Davey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me,'' Baker said. ``I've got a job. I'm happy where
I am. It bothers me (because) they've already got a manager who's a
friend of mine. That's not fair to him and it wouldn't be fair if
it happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the point is that in San Francisco, it isn't going to happen
to Baker anytime soon. Why would he want to go anywhere and why
above all would he want to come here? &QL;

DREIFORT THROWS AS IF IT MATTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Just when it turned too late, when everything
turned hopeless, the Los Angeles Dodgers turned it on.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by another superb start from right-hander Darren Dreifort
in what's become a three-week stretch of awesome pitching, the
Dodgers pounded NL West champ San Francisco 9-0 Tuesday at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Gary Sheffield returned from his back injury and
bolstered the offense with a homer and three RBI. His 42nd homer,
and second since Aug. 19, leaves him one shy of equaling Duke
Snider's single-season franchise mark. The homer was Sheffield's
23rd at home, breaking the club record. Mike Piazza previously held
the record of 22, which he set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster added a pinch-hit homer, the 208th of the season.
That tied the club's single-season record set by Brooklyn in 1953.
Elster's homer also tied a major league record as the Dodgers' 12th
pinch-hit homer. Cincinnati (1957) and the Mets (1953) also did it.
</P>
<P>
   The win moved the Dodgers (84-73) to a season-high mark above
.500 and kept them mathematically alive in the wild-card race. The
next Mets win or Dodgers loss will eliminate Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (12-8) became the third straight Dodgers starter to
allow two hits in a start, following the leads of Kevin Brown and
Chan Ho Park. Dreifort struck out four in seven shutout innings,
continuing the dominance of the Dodgers starters. In their last 15
games, Dodgers starters have allowed 19 runs and have a 1.62 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dreifort has experienced more growing pains this season,
his third as a starter, his development surely will pay off this
offseason. Dreifort is eligible for free agency, but re-signing him
is the Dodgers' top priority in the offseason. However, there will
be many suitors, as each of his last few starts have drawn plenty
of scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers management said the key to the second half of the season
was Dreifort's performance, but that didn't exactly come to
fruition. Dreifort is 8-1 with a 3.25 ERA since the All-Star break,
but the Dodgers as a whole have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, 28, has also proven his durability. He's established
career highs for starts (31) and innings pitched (185) and he also
secured his first winning season as a starter. Dreifort's final
outing will be the Dodgers' season finale Sunday in San Diego.

JONES ADVANCES IN 200 HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ If Marion Jones was burdened by the scandal
enveloping her husband C.J.Hunter, she showed no signs of it today.
</P>
<P>
   In her first appearance on the track since public confirmation
came that Hunter had tested positive for the banned steroid
nandrolone, Jones won her heat in the 200-meter dash to advance to
the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The former Thousand Oaks High standout was greeted warmly by the
Olympic Stadium crowd when her preliminary heat was introduced. So
sustained was the applause, it was as though the Australians wanted
Jones to know they are not going to cast stones at her for the sins
of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 24, broke well from the blocks and built a comfortable
lead before shutting down a few meters from the finish, the better
to conserve her energy for the long jump preliminaries that awaited
her later today.
</P>
<P>
   She was timed in 22.75, just ahead of Cydonie Mothersill, whose
strong finish brought her to within .03 seconds of the coasting
heat leader.
</P>
<P>
   Running in a later heat, Beverly McDonald of Jamaica posted the
fastest time of the morning with a 22.50. She was .03 seconds
faster than Susanthika Jayasinghe, who is from Sri Lanka but lives
and trains in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Jones qualified sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stated all along I think this is going to be the most
difficult day for me,'' said Jones, who already has won a gold
medal in the 100 meters. ``I tried to conserve a bit of energy in
that first round of the 200 (to save herself for the long jump).''
</P>
<P>
   Van Nuys resident Inger Miller, who was expected to offer the
stiffest challenge to Jones, pulled out of the 200 because her
strained hamstring isn't healed. So strong are the ill winds now
swirling around these Games, Miller reportedly is feeling pressure
to compete in the 400 relay relay no matter her fitness level lest
she be painted as a possible drug cheat.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six athletes here have been outed for
performance-enhancing drug use (19 more than in the past three
Summer Games combined). The latest to fail a doping test was
Mihaela Melinte, the world-record-holder and reigning world
champion in the hammer throw.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanian was apparently the last to know. She was on the
track today, preparing for her qualifying throws when a track
official escorted her away. An IAAF spokesperson said the Romanian
Federation had been informed of the result and that it was the
responsibility of the Romanians to pass the information on to
Melinte.
</P>
<P>
   The number of failed drug tests is a serious matter, which makes
some of the offenders' excuses downright farcical. A Uzbekistan
track coach claimed the vials of human growth hormone he was trying
to smuggle through the airport here were to treat his baldness; a
German runner swore someone must have spiked his toothpaste with
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Jones offered a public statement of support for Hunter Tuesday,
holding his hand at a press conference and saying stoically, ``I
have total and complete respect in him and believe that the legal
system will do what is needed to clear his name.''
</P>
<P>
   She was gracious with reporters today, but begged off after
answering two questions so she could cool down and prepare for the
long jump.
</P>
<P>
   In other events today, Camarillo High graduate Marla Runyan
advanced to the semifinals of the 1500 but just barely. She failed
to finish in the top six in her heat and was the next-to-last
runner to advance on the basis of time (4:10.83).
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two laps were very, very slow,'' she said. ``Maybe I
shouldn't have let that happen. I was really running within myself.
My goal was to finish in the top six (in the heat) and get into the
semifinal. As long as I make it in. That's all I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Favor-Hamilton led all 1,500 qualifiers with a time of
4:08.08. The top U.S. finisher from the U.S. Trials, L.A. native
Regina Jacobs, pulled out of the competition before the start
because of a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   Deena Drossin, a former Agoura High standout, ran 36th in the
10,000 meters and failed to advance. Drossin, who has had an
Achilles injury, had a time of 34 minutes, 40 seconds, nearly three
minutes slower than her winning time at the Trials.

   Egged on by the two talk-show hosts, swimmer Ian Thorpe carried

BLAKE RESUMES CAPTAINCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rob Blake returned to the ice Tuesday night with
the captain's ``C'' back on his Los Angeles Kings jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who recently resigned the position in a contract dispute,
approached coach Andy Murray an hour before the start of the Kings'
2-0 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes with a request Murray had been
hoping to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the captain here and I want to remain the captain as long
as I am a King,'' Blake said. ``This will not change the
negotiations. This is a business. But I think I took it way to
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Murray: ``That `C' always will be Rob's whether he is
wearing it or not. I hoped he would reconsider and I wanted him to
know that he didn't do something that couldn't be undone. Now he
has and we are very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, 30, reclaimed the captaincy he has held the past four
seasons even though there has not been movement on a new contract.
He will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season and
resigned as captain after the Kings made a ``take it or leave it''
offer at the beginning of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Although the three-year $22.5 million offer wasn't far from the
$24 million Blake is seeking, he was angered the by the ultimatum.
The club left open the possibility of his return to captain and
decided not to name his replacement until the Kings' first game,
Oct. 6 at Washington. Left-winger Luc Robitaille, an alternate
captain last season, was expected to get the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice to see him make this decision, but it does not affect the
negotiations,'' said general manager Dave Taylor, who added he has
not spoken to Blake's agent Ron Salcer since talks broke down two
weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake's decision comes on the same day NHL MVP and top
defenseman Chris Pronger of St. Louis decided to end his attempts
to get a new contract. Pronger, not eligible for unrestricted free
agency until the 2006, was looking for a six-year deal for $10
million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who finished third in the voting for top defenseman, has
been a fixture in Los Angeles since he joined the Kings at the end
of the 1989-90 season after a college career at Bowling Green. He
lives year round in Manhattan Beach and replaced Wayne Gretzky as
captain to begin the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hot rookie: With the off-season losses of Garry Galley (free
agency) and Sean O'Donnell (expansion), retooling the defense has a
been a priority in the Kings training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Lubomir Visnovsky, drafted in the fourth round last June, has
been the most impressive newcomer. He scored the Kings' first goal
Tuesday night. Visnovsky, who scored 21 goals in 52 games last
season in his native Slovakia, picked up a loose puck inside the
Coyotes blue line and beat goaltender Sean Burke low to the stick
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speed and energy have really stood out in camp,'' Murray
said. ``This is his first year in the NHL but he really has shown a
lot of people that he belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick Whistles: Craig Johnson, who missed the first two camps
of camp with a staph infection in his left ankle, scored the Kings'
second goal. Goaltender Jamie Storr went the distance and stopped
20 shots to record the shutout. . . . Unlike Saturday night, when
Ziggy Palffy and Marko Tuomainen were knocked out of the game as
the result of uncalled slashes, officials cracked down Tuesday.
Three slashing penalties were called on Phoenix in the first two
periods. Glen Murray and Bob Corkum were whistled for slashing
midway through the second period, giving the Coyotes a
five-on-three advantage for 30 seconds. . . . Ian Laperriere,
sidelined throughout training camp while rehabbing from
reconstructive surgery on his right knee, skated in uniform before
Tuesday's game. He will not be activated until Friday's game in San
Jose.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brad Otton was pretty much done with football.
</P>
<P>
   The former USC quarterback, who led the Trojans to a 17-3
victory over Northwestern in the 1995 Rose Bowl, figured his
football career was over after a knee injury forced him to give up
his dream of playing in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   However, CSUN coach Jeff Kearin gave him an opportunity to get
back into the game and he took it: He has agreed to work with the
Matador quarterbacks after turning Kearin down last year.
</P>
<P>
   A couple weeks ago, Otton showed up on campus to visit former
USC assistant coaches Kearin and Dave Robinson and ended up at a
practice. He liked what he saw and on Tuesday joined the staff as
an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wanted to see if I enjoyed the coaching thing and so
far I do,'' Otton said. ``Being with Jeff and Dave, with the way
they run the team, I wanted to be around that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin is the head coach but also the offensive coordinator.
Otton's assistance will free Kearin to focus on other things for
which he normally doesn't have time.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, who played one year as a quarterback at the University
of San Diego, said Otton understands the nuances of the game well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings, obviously, hands-on gamesmanship on a level that we
don't have with me,'' Kearin said. ``He can really teach the
younger guys the game and can really refine (Marcus Brady's)
abilities. Brad Otton was a fierce competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Idaho State escapes with win:! Idaho State, CSUN's opponent
on Saturday, survived a scare from Sacramento State last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Sacramento State drove to Idaho State's
1-yard line when senior running back Charles Roberts fumbled,
preserving Idaho State's 41-39 victory.
</P>
<P>
   __ Amerson's condition improves: Wide receiver Drew Amerson's
status was upgraded to day-to-day, and there's a chance he could
play against Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   Amerson, who hyperextended his right knee against Southwest
Texas State and didn't play against Northern Arizona, has been
cleared by doctors to play this week. At first, he was told he'd be
out three-eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran him around a little (Tuesday) and we'll see how he
feels (today),'' Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   Amerson, who ran some routes, said he's not experiencing much
pain. He wants to play in Saturday's game at North Campus Stadium
but he doesn't want to come back too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' Amerson said. ``Hopefully, I'll play but I don't
want to push it and hurt it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Extra running Several players had to run more than they
would've liked on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them repeatedly failed to start behind a designated line
during wind sprints and Kearin made them run until they got it
right. Afterward, he lectured the team about paying attention to
detail.

DODGERS POUND GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just when it turned too late, when everything
turned hopeless, the Los Angeles Dodgers turned it on.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by another superb start from right-hander Darren Dreifort
in what has become a three-week stretch of awesome pitching, the
Dodgers pounded NL West champ San Francisco 9-0 Tuesday at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Gary Sheffield returned from his back injury and
bolstered the offense with a homer and three RBI. His 42nd homer,
and second since Aug. 19, leaves him one shy of equaling Duke
Snider's single-season franchise mark. The homer was Sheffield's
23rd at home, breaking the club record. Mike Piazza held the record
of 22, which he set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster added a pinch-hit homer, the 208th of the season.
That tied the club's single-season record set in 1953. Elster's
homer also tied a major-league record as the Dodgers' 12th
pinch-hit homer. Cincinnati (1957) and the Mets (1953) also did it.
</P>
<P>
   How much it matters is debatable since the next loss by the
Dodgers (84-73) or the next win by the Mets will end the Dodgers'
playoff dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's frustrating to everybody because everybody
realizes we have the pieces to get the job done here, but we all
know we haven't gotten it done,'' said Dreifort, 28, who has
established career highs for starts (31) and innings pitched (185).
``You also have to realize what this team has gone through this
season, with injuries and suspensions and illnesses. We've done a
fantastic job of keeping it together mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (12-8) allowed two hits and struck out four in seven
shutout innings. In their last 15 games, Dodgers starters have
allowed 19 runs and have a 1.62 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers management said earlier the key to the second half of
the season was Dreifort's performance, though it didn't work out
that way. Dreifort is 8-1 with a 3.25 ERA since the All-Star break,
but the Dodgers collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dreifort's) living up to his potential, that's what he's
doing,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He has outstanding
potential and he's staying within himself. He made a lot of quality
pitches and didn't have any control lapses.''

   ``CHERRY''
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Karr
</P>
<P>
   (Viking, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not very successful as a little girl,'' Karr wrote in her
diary when she was 11. ``When I grow up, I will probably be a
mess.'' But look at the stories she has to tell. This sequel to her
acclaimed 1995 memoir, (beginitalic)The Liars' Club(enditalic),
takes her from a scrappy adolescent to a bored and rebellious
teenager about to leave for California with a truck full of boys,
her ticket out of the dreary Texas refinery town that had held her
captive for so long. Though she tries to make us think otherwise,
Karr's life in this book has an air of stability. Both parents are
finally under one roof for good (Karr's mother was married seven
times, twice to Mary's father), and her adolescent longings are not
so different from those of a thousand other girls. But if it's less
harrowing than (beginitalic)The Liars' Club(enditalic), its appeal
is the same: Karr is a born storyteller. Mary's voice is funny,
irreverent, profane, defiant and irresistible. And just think.
She's in her 40s. There might be more memoirs to come.

   ``I LOVE YOU RONNIE''
</P>
<P>
   By Nancy Reagan
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   He called her things like ``Nancy Pants'' and ``Nancy Poo'' and
``First Mommie'' in his letters, and they are so guileless and
unabashedly adoring that it seems almost voyeuristic to read them.
Over the years she kept them in a shopping bag, of all things, and
when Alzheimer's disease began to destroy his memory and his
ability to write anything at all, she took the letters out and
found solace in them. Now Nancy Reagan has written a biography of
her marriage and sprinkled it with her husband's letters. Many are
reproduced as he wrote them, some on White House stationary. The
book ends with a photograph of the couple on his birthday in
February, and with her thoughts on seeing her husband through this
last, difficult chapter of his life. Alzheimer's is truly a long
goodbye, she writes, ``but it's the living out of love.'' Royalties
will go to the Alzheimer's Foundation and to the Ronald Reagan
Library and Museum. To read a letter from the book, log on to azcen

   ``THE NEW YORKER BOOK OF LITERARY CARTOONS''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Bob Mankoff
</P>
<P>
   (Pocket, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a title yet, or even a subject,'' a young man
tells his publisher. ``All I have is the price: twenty-three
ninety-five in hardcover.'' An agent gives his happy client the
news that ``Oprah is definite, Barnes and Noble is giving you front
windows, and Norman Mailer has agreed to a feud.'' A wife reminds
her husband that ``you may very well be from Mars, but the children
and I are from Westchester.'' And Charles Dickens squirms as an
editor waves the first page of his manuscript and says, ``I wish
you would make up your mind, Mr. Dickens. Was it the best of times
or was it the worst of times? It could scarcely have been both.''
We are cursed with the task of describing this book without benefit
of the drawings, so we'll cut to the chase: It's great fun. Our
favorite is the ``To Do'' list on James Joyce's refrigerator: 1.
Call bank. 2. Dry cleaner. 3. Forge in the smithy of my soul the
uncreated conscience of my race. 4. Call mom.

   ``KANGAROO DREAMING''
</P>
<P>
   By Edward Kanze
</P>
<P>
   (Sierra Club, $25)
</P>
<P>
   This was their plan: They would have no plan. Inspired by the
writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson (''The health of the eye seems to
demand a horizon.'') to dump their dreary office jobs and travel
unfettered, and drawn to Australia by Kanze's recurrent dream about
kangaroos, they pulled up stakes and followed their noses. Kanze
and his wife were naturalists. Setting out to make the acquaintance
of Australia's wildlife, they met up with monitor lizards, snakes,
crocodiles and quicksand, as well as some friendlier natural
wonders. They spent nine months driving around the country. That's
a lot of Australia for readers to absorb, but our appetite for it
is big right now. And Kanze? He overplays his role as a latter-day
Odysseus, but there's something engaging about a man who deplanes
in Melbourne and says to his wife, ``We're not in Kansas anymore.''
And what do you know, he's still dreaming about kangaroos.

   Some awfully big stuff - comets, meteors, asteroids - has
slammed into our Spaceship Earth during the past billion years or
so, wreaking all sorts of havoc with the environment and, maybe,
even finishing off our favorite monsters, the dinosaurs. Well, this
nifty Web site lets you see, continent by continent, where the
blows landed. You can zero in on the impact crater of your choice
and get the stats {ndash} age, size, longitude and latitude - and
often photos of the craters taken from space. Our crater near
Winslow is just a pinprick: Check out the monster hole at
Manicouagan in Quebec or the alleged dino slayer in Mexico's
Yucatan. It's humbling to know that something like the cosmic
bullets that blasted out those basins could hit anywhere, anytime.
So be good, and watch the skies, watch the skies.

   This issue is the first of a ``relaunch'' of
(beginitalic)Details(enditalic), and it has been redesigned to send
it zinging with precision into the hands of men in their 20s and
30s with sophisticated tastes, or hopes of acquiring them. Robert
Downey Jr. poses bare-chested on the cover. Downey was sprung early
from a substance-abuse treatment center/prison, where he had been
an inmate since August 1999. Downey has led a wild life in recent
years and was busted for everything from packing handguns to doing
heroin and cocaine. Now, he's reformed, off drugs, got his GED (you
can be a movie star without a GED?), and is ``Mr. Clean.'' Hope he
stays that way. Other stories deal with Asia's burgeoning sex trade

   This issue introduces the first annual (beginitalic)George
(enditalic)Awards to honor seven Americans who have harnessed their
energies to push causes bigger than themselves. A Citizen of the
Year Award goes to Michael J. Fox who, stricken with Parkinson's
disease, is waging an all-out war against the affliction through
his own foundation, pouring his energies and talents into a drive
to find a cure within 10 years. The other winners include a
newspaper publisher who is fighting racism in the Ozarks; an
education-reform advocate; a medical missionary to impoverished
nations; a veteran civil-rights crusader; actress Sharon Stone's
sister, who helps homeless kids; and Fred Rogers - TV's Mr. Rogers
- for helping kids realize they are our future. How can you argue
with any of those? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``LATINA'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This mag targets, well, Latinas, a subset of a group that is
moving at warp speed into the mainstream of American society. This
issue celebrates the big impact Latin styles are making on the
world fashion scene. Latin influences have been felt before, of
course (think bolero jackets and gaucho pants), but the difference
this time is that Latino designers are making the splash, rather
than Europeans appropriating bits and pieces of Latin styles.
Another article identifies 10 Latina ``mujeres'' (women) who
achieved outstanding success in their fields. Among them:
Grammy-winning Christina Aguilera in music, Tina Ramirez in dance,
Julia Alvarez in literature and Jennifer Gutierrez in sports. Watch
these women - you'll be hearing more about them. Some articles in
(beginitalic)Latina(enditalic), by the way, are in English and
Spanish.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``VANITY FAIR''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you get through the fragrance wafting from the perfume ads,
you'll find a lot of good reading in this hefty hunk of a mag. The
cover piece is a love letter to Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn's golden
girl, who is featured in Cameron Crowe's (beginitalic)Almost
Famous(enditalic) and Robert Altman's (beginitalic)Dr. T and the
Women. (enditalic)Annie Leibowitz provides the photos. The most
interesting article, though, is Gail Sheehy's bold stab at
analyzing George W. Bush's personality and his motives in running
for president. Her findings: Bush has shown a pattern in life of
exploding into ambition-fueled action when he has felt himself
teetering on the brink of failure. His personality has been molded
by trying to compensate for dyslexia and associated verbal
clunkiness, and short attention span ( but if so, how did the guy
manage to fly jet fighters in the Texas Air National Guard?). His
most heartfelt ambition may be to become baseball commissioner. Say
it ain't so, George.

<P>
   (Phoenix) - Dear Letter Writer,
</P>
<P>
   It's not the same since you purchased a computer. We must all
move forward, of course. Technology is a grand thing. But I can't
help but long for the days when correspondence required paper and
pen, and letter-writing was an art form. Life was simpler then.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   I recall a note received from a Mr. A.A.H. of Sun City, for
example. He included in the envelope an advertisement he'd clipped
from the morning paper. It was a promotional ad featuring a
photograph of the local columnist under the headline, ``Montini
will move you.'' Beneath it, in bold handwritten script, Mr. H.
added, ``So will a good enema {hellip}and it's not such a big
pain!!''
</P>
<P>
   Computer mail doesn't allow for such creativity. No clipped
photographs from magazines or imaginative pencil drawing (including
more than one of me and a barnyard animal, though I've never lived
on a farm.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I get sideways happy faces made with a colon and a
parenthesis mark.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing sent to me via computer to match the four-page
manifesto printed in capital letters on school stationery from Mr.
J.H. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He took the time to attach a page
from his local newspaper, which occasionally reprints columns from
(beginitalic)The Arizona Republic.(enditalic) He began:
</P>
<P>
   ``Montini, I thought it was you when the stench of putrid dog
vomit arose from today's paper.''
</P>
<P>
   On and on it went. I read it with admiration and appreciation
because it took time, unlike the few seconds of clicking on the
keyboard that creates an electronic letter.
</P>
<P>
   Gone as well are variations in stationery, from thin pages with
lacy borders to rough-edged parchment, slightly stained, torn from
the roll at a butcher's shop. And there are no more note cards
embossed with flags, hot air balloons, kittens or clowns. No finely
designed letterhead, except from purveyors of junk mail, like law
offices or politicians. And no postcards, some depicting exotic
lands, still others depicting exotic behavior. Or even simple white
rectangles like the one from Mr. R.G.E. of Scottsdale, which is
taped to the computer on which I type these words. It reads: ``I'm
78 and I enjoy 95percent of your columns - try to work on the other
5percent!''
</P>
<P>
   There is no rush to an actual letter. It's made slowly and
travels slowly. Not computer mail. A letter that is shipped in an
instant and received in an instant carries with it the expectation
of instantaneous response.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't possible for someone like me, whose mind clops along
the information superhighway like an Amish horse and buggy.
</P>
<P>
   These days, mail arriving in envelopes tends to come from two
groups: Those who are retired and those who are in prison. In each
case, they always include their addresses and they always sign
their names. On the other hand, cowards find plenty of cover in the
bushes of cyberspace, which makes them easy to ignore. Unlike Mr.
G.S. of Phoenix, who printed his name above his signature ``to make
sure you can read it, because as long as you keep signing your name
to the (expletive) you write, I'll keep signing me. Deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely, &QR;
</P>

BIOTRANSPLANT, NOVARTIS TEAM UP ON TRANSPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BioTransplant Inc. and Novartis Pharmaceuticals are forming a
Boston company that will seek to commercialize the transplantation
of organs from pigs to people.
</P>
<P>
   Under their agreement, announced Tuesday, Novartis will provide
$30 million in research funding over the next three years, along
with its proprietary technology in human organ rejection and
breeding pigs for organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, a Swiss firm, will own 67 percent of the
yet-to-be-named company and retain all commercial rights.
</P>
<P>
   BioTransplant, which has bred miniature swine for organ
transplants and has a proprietary technology for ``reeducating''
the body's immune response to allow it to tolerate foreign cells,
will own 33 percent of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   BioTransplant, which will receive royalty payments from Novartis
sales, will also provide office space at its Charlestown
headquarters to incubate the new company until it finds its own
offices and laboratories in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will begin operating Jan. 1. Its goal is to
start testing pig organs in humans in 2004. Such testing, and later
commercial transplants, would require approval from the Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The venture will face some major competition. Nextran, of
Princeton, N.J., a subsidiary of Baxter Healthcare, is also working
on transplanting pig organs to humans. Another rival is Alexiion
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the new Boston company will be Julia
Greenstein, currently BioTransplant's chief scientific officer. The
research director will be Henk Schuurman, the key scientist at
Imutran Ltd., a Novartis subsidiary in England that has developed
animal organ models for transplants. Schuurman plans to move to
Boston. Greenstein said she did not know how many other Imutran
employees will be asked to relocate to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, researchers have looked to using animal
organs _ hearts, kidneys, lungs, and livers _ to replace failing
organs in humans, a process known as xenotransplantation.
Nationwide, more than 50,000 people are on waiting lists for organ
transplants. Many die while waiting for an organ.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues with which researchers have grappled are
preventing human rejection of animal tissue and ensuring that
animal organs don't transmit diseases to humans.
</P>
<P>
   By using their complementary technologies to create a single
business _ and sharing the financial risk _ BioTransplant and
Novartis hope to commercialize the transplanting of animal organs
to humans more quickly than if they were working separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``By joining the two approaches together, we hope to bring
forward the day when xenotransplanation will become a clinical
reality,'' said Paul Herrling, head of global research for
Novartis, based in Basel, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's announcement, Imutran and BioTransplant had
joint development projects in xenotransplantion, but there were
organizational impediments to working more closely, said Elliot
Lebowitz, BioTransplant's chief executive. Lebowitz will serve as a
corporate director of the new venture, as will Corinne Savill,
Imutran's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Lebowitz, who formed BioTransplant nine years ago, said
scientific advances and high costs forced the company to find a
partner. He the new company will be able to launch clinical trials
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Organs for transplants, he explained, might come from
BioTransplant's miniature swine _ 250-pound pigs with human-size
organs that do not produce a porcine virus that can infect human
cells. The smaller pigs were bred from swine that weigh about 1,000
pounds.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a story that keeps repeating itself.
</P>
<P>
   A company spends years and many millions of dollars to develop a
drug to treat a serious medical condition, a drug that saves lives
or dramatically improves them. Then, athletes take the drugs and
use them to boost performance.
</P>
<P>
   California's Genentech Inc. toiled for nearly a decade to
pioneer Protropin, the first recombinant human growth hormone to
help children with hormone deficiencies reach normal adult heights.
It became a wildly popular performance enhancer _ Uzbekistan coach
Sergei Voynov was caught trying to smuggle 15 vials of the hormone
into Sydney for the Olympics, claiming he used it to help reverse
his baldness.
</P>
<P>
   Another California biotech Amgen Inc. devoted nine years to
Epogen, a product that has allowed thousands of kidney patients
with chronic anemia to lead normal lives. It became one of the most
abused sports-performance drugs in history.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure Corp. poured 16 years into Hemopure, a product that
could drastically reduce the need for blood transfusions. It hasn't
even reached the market, and rumors are already flying that it is
the next big performance booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies in general are trying to create better public
health and better quality of life,'' said Carl Rausch, Biopure's
president and chief executive. ``We're dealing with people who are
sick, not people who are well. We all frown on the use of these
products by healthy athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   But as reports and rumors circulate, the companies find
themselves in the spotlight, defending their public images,
fielding complaints about a lack of controls, and balancing social
and corporate responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Both Genentech and Amgen have faced criticism over the years for
refusing to develop tests or alter their drugs in ways that would
make their use easy to detect. Because the products are similar to
hormones produced naturally in the body, they are difficult to
identify in drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   New tests checking for the presence of Epogen in blood and urine
are being used at the Olympics for the first time this year. There
are still no tests to detect human growth hormone products made by
Genentech and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But companies say it is unreasonable to ask that they divert
money and resources from their legitimate drug development efforts
to help organizations like the International Olympic Committee
police abuse by elite athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not Genentech's focus,'' said company spokeswoman
Betsy Rosenberg. ``Our focus is developing and marketing our
products for their intended medical purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech has worked with organizations such as the American
Association of Endocrinologists on efforts to educate people about
the risks of misusing human growth hormones. But aside from
endorsing such efforts, the company stays out of the fray, simply
reinforcing the intended medical uses for its products.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen spokesman David Kaye said the company did not condone
Epogen's use as a sports-performance drug. Beyond that, he said,
the company had no comment about the abuse of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Los Angeles Times article, however, Kaye said he was
aware of calls for the company to add a chemical marker to Epogen
to make it easily identifiable in tests. Amgen rejected the idea,
he said, because it would be costly and could require new
regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing the drug would change what is put into the human
body,'' Kaye told the newspaper. ``We're not in the drug-testing
business. We develop human therapeutics for sick people.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen has made efforts to educate athletes and the public about
the appropriate use of Epogen, including hosting programs timed to
coincide with major sporting events on the risks of abusing the
drug as a performance enhancer.
</P>
<P>
   Biopure made a test available to detect the presence of its
products in the blood in response to recent media reports and
requests from IOC-accredited labs. The test detects both Hemopure
and Oxyglobin, a similar product approved to treat anemia in dogs.
But unlike the other companies, Rausch said, Biopure had already
developed the test to evaluate the efficacy of its products in
clinical studies.
</P>
<P>
   If the company didn't have a test, Rausch said, he isn't sure it
would develop one for the purpose of policing athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the nature of our product, we realize that this
issue is going to continue to be a problem so we wanted to make the
test available,'' Rausch said. ``But companies shouldn't bear the
burden of controling the misuse of these products. It should be
shared.''
</P>
<P>
   Rausch bristles at the suggestion by certain sports officials
that the companies aren't closely monitoring their products. An IOC
executive board member was once quoted in The New York Times
saying: ``If they're not careful and don't apply more stringent
controls, and the public perceives that drugs are bringing down the
character of sports, their reputation is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Hemopure is still in testing, Rausch said, the company
tracks every unit of the product it sends out. He said it is highly
unlikely that any athlete could have gotten the product. And the
only way the product could have gotten to the black market is if
someone had diverted it illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Even with products like Oxyglobin that are already on the
market, he said, government regulations require strict monitoring.
Companies like Biopure, Genentech, and Amgen only sell prescription
products to approved institutions such as hospitals and veterinary
and physicians' offices. And those institutions are required to
monitor their inventories and dispense them only to licensed
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controls, Rausch realizes prescription drugs
sometimes wind up in the wrong hands for the wrong purposes. But,
he said, companies are doing what they can to prevent the misuse of
their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly isn't how we intended the product to be used,''
he said. ``We certainly don't condone it. There are risks to almost
any medical treatment. A healthy person doesn't need to take those
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hoberman, a sports historian and professor at the
University of Texas at Austin, said companies should be expected to
cooperate in efforts to curb abuse of their products _ within
reason. It's reasonable, he said, to ask companies to participate
in educational efforts, make available existing tests, or aid
outside efforts to develop a test. It's not reasonable, however, to
ask that they develop tests, alter products, or make costly
adjustments to their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the rights of the elite sports community to ask the
rest of society to help police itself?'' Hoberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Yesalis, an epidemiologist at Pennsylvania State
University who has studied and written about athletic doping,
argues that sports organizations like the IOC should take
responsibility for policing their own athletes. The IOC, he said,
has spent only token sums of money on research to develop effective
drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the abuse of performance-enhancing drugs by
elite athletes has reached epidemic proportions. With the help of
an underground network of so-called medical advisers, athletes are
constantly scanning the horizon for new drugs that will help them
beat competitors and drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a highly competitive society, and when there's a
lot at stake, people cross over the line,'' Yesalis said. ``I
really beat up on drug companies about steroids. But these drugs
aren't going to kids on the street. Why should drug companies pay
the tab for the misdeeds of elite athletes?''

SAVINGS UNLIKELY TO SUPPLY $60,000 A YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I hope to retire by age 60 and draw $60,000 annually for my
retirement income. Do you think my goal is achievable? Should I be
doing anything different? What about a Roth IRA?
</P>
<P>
   S.T., Pontiac, Mich. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you are going to require $60,000 a year, my guess is that
retiring at 60 is probably not realistic. You did not specify your
earnings, so I can't calculate a likely accumulation. But I made a
guess, based on the fact that most people feel they can get along
on a little less in retirement than they require before then. I
made a calculation based on an $80,000 salary, which would work out
to total contributions of $1,600 a month, 18 percent of which would
come from you and 6 percent from your employer. If you average 10
percent investment returns over the next 8 years, you would
accumulate $548,433.
</P>
<P>
   But to be able to withdraw $60,000 a year _ and leave a little
bit of money in growth instruments to protect yourself against
later inflation _ you should have about $1 million saved. To get
from your current $141,785 to $1 million in eight years, you'd have
to save $4,688 a month.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that the first calculation is probably closer to the
mark. If you are indeed saving $1,600 a month, you would cross that
$1 million line about two months before age 65. At age 65, the pool
would be $1,028,192.
</P>
<P>
   You can work out a projection yourself, using the various
figures I have supplied as benchmarks. If you are going to be
eligible for Social Security, you can also plug that income into
the calculation, using either the figures for age 62 or 65.
</P>
<P>
   You don't specify which of the three Dodge and Cox funds you are
using. If the Income fund is in the portfolio, you would do well to
move to Dodge and Cox Balanced fund or Dodge and Cox Stock fund. If
you think you can amass the required savings pool by age 60, the
Balanced fund would be my choice. However, if you believe you will
retire closer to age 65, Dodge and Cox Stock fund would be my
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of which of those three funds you are using, your
portfolio relies too much on domestic large-cap stock funds. I
suggest you go over the menu provided in your retirement account.
If you have options in the small- and midcap arenas, I would move
about 25 percent of the portfolio to these sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a Roth IRA would be nice, particularly if you can
afford to forgo the tax deferral by moving $2,000 a year from your
retirement plan to the Roth. This would increase your taxable
income by $2,000 a year but give you a pool of tax-free savings to
draw upon in retirement. Since the Roth allows for no taxes on the
investment growth in the account, you want to make your most
aggressive investment in that account.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a social worker and have not contributed to any of my
funds for six years, due to unemployment. I recently obtained a
job. I am able to save only $100 a month. Should I change to funds
that will enable me to build more savings?
</P>
<P>
   V.M., Salem, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I have to say that I hope this will be your wake-up call.
There is nothing wrong with your selection of funds; in fact, your
portfolio is better balanced than most. But you should look hard at
your budget and your priorities and decide whether you can save
more. At the current pace, after 20 years you would have $190,838 _
with the buying power of a little less than $96,000 in today's
money (provided that inflation averages 3.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have a small pension and Social Security benefits,
that's a sum which will not provide you with much in the way of
financial security.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mention how the funds you hold have been saved.
Certainly, in the future, your savings should be in the form of
contributions to a traditional IRA. This will not only shelter the
growth in the accounts from current taxation, but allow you an
income tax deduction of up to $2,000, provided your earnings exceed
the amount deposited.
</P>
<P>
   If you really can save no more than $1,200 a year _ and if your
existing retirement savings are in taxable accounts _ you could
move $800 a year from your taxable accounts into the IRA, thus
increasing your tax deduction and getting them into a tax-deferred
status.
</P>
<P>
   As a hint about what might be a good course, if you can manage
to fully fund your IRA with new savings each year, it would require
monthly contributions of $166. If your monthly contributions were
$166 instead of $100, the 20-year growth projection for your
savings would be $241,466.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, I suggest that you calculate your savings level as
a percentage of earnings. That way, every time you get a raise (no
matter how small) you increase your savings _ and of course if you
could bump the percentage a bit higher, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We get $219 a month from our CD, which we use. We pay $1,000
a month, plus interest, against our home equity loan. Would it be
better to pay off the loan and save all the interest we are paying?
</P>
<P>
   W.J., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. On paper, you'd be better off cashing in the CD and paying
off the loan. The current prime rate is 9.5 percent, which means
there is a spread of 3.13 percentage points between what you get
from your CD and what you pay on your loan. But there are two other
factors to consider.
</P>
<P>
   One is whether you would face a penalty upon cashing in the CD.
If so, consider what effect it would have on the arithmetic. It
probably would be small. But if it's only a matter of months before
you could cash it in without penalty, it would probably be worth
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The second factor is squishier. It amounts to whether you feel
you have the discipline to replace the CD account, just as if you
had been making extra payments against the principal of the home
equity loan.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that you are paying about $1,316 a month for principal
and interest on the loan. You are getting $219 a month from the CD,
giving you a net outflow of $1,097. If you were to pay off the loan
and then contribute $1,097 a month to a CD account, you would
accumulate $51,394 over the 40 months which you would need to pay
off the loan, following your current schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The example is a bit skewed, because if you follow your current
practice, the amount of interest would be lower each month, falling
by about $8 a month. Nonetheless, even if I went through 40 months
of calculations, you would end up better off by prepaying the loan
than by going with your current schedule.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you lack the discipline to replace the CD
capital and simply allow yourself a more lavish lifestyle over
those 40 months, you would end that period in worse shape than if
you followed your current practice.
</P>
<P>
   The final factor is whether you might need that $40,000 pool to
protect yourself against emergencies. If you have no other assets
that you might draw upon, you might consider a midway strategy,
prepaying a good deal of the loan in a lump sum and retaining some
funds in the CD account for emergencies. You could then continue
the payment schedule as you have been doing, and then set to work
to rebuild the CD account once the home equity loan is paid back.

RAYTHEON STRUGGLES WITH NEW-ECONOMY WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. says no forward-looking business today could accept
the demands Raytheon faces from 2,700 blue-collar employees who
went out on strike last month.
</P>
<P>
   From their picket lines outside the Lexington, Mass. defense
contractor, the strikers are mainly seeking job-security
guarantees. But such guarantees are a feature of the old economy.
These days, the company says, security comes only from pleasing
customers like the Pentagon by delivering quality high-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon is busy cutting costs, meanwhile, by sending more of
its manufacturing work to plants in Arizona or to non-union
subcontractors. Striking union members fear they are getting the
cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Raytheon appears much more concerned with hiring
software engineers these days than with appeasing its blue-collar
work force, no matter how skilled. On its Web site, the company
lists openings for 1,718 jobs, many of which carry techie titles
such as software configuration analyst or physics engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Also, though executives insist privately they are committed to
keeping manufacturing work in Massachusetts, Raytheon canceled
talks with the union last week for reasons it didn't specify.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the strike may show how reinventing the
78-year-old company for the new economy is proving difficult. Two
years into his tenure, Raytheon's chief executive, Daniel Burnham,
still faces a host of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously, Raytheon's stock has yet to recover from the
shocks of a year ago, when it disclosed major problems absorbing
acquisitions. From a high of nearly $75 in July 1999, Raytheon's
widely traded Class B shares closed Friday at $26.25.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated investors say Raytheon has yet to clarify why it
deserves their confidence. Foreign missile sales aren't providing
the revenue they once did. In July, the company unloaded its
heavy-construction unit in Cambridge, Mass. at a fire-sale price,
despite Burnham's onetime promise to rebuild the division.
</P>
<P>
   Even the national defense establishment it once leaned on for
support can't deliver. In May, despite heavy lobbying by President
Clinton, the British military ordered a missile designed by a group
of Raytheon's European competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon has announced initiatives relating to
security-software, an online-parts exchange with other aerospace
companies, and a Web site for boaters. But it says these projects
aren't expected to have a major impact on its overall financial
performance in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying issues are still operational, regaining control
of these large and complex government contracts,'' said William
Fiala, analyst for Edward Jones. Raytheon's efforts in sofware
might be laudable, but won't by themselves make a dent in the
problems it faces in its bigger product areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the software initiatives, Fiala said: ``All that's fine and
dandy. But until they get their operations firmed up, it's all for
naught.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still an old-fashioned metal-bender.''
</P>
<P>
   At Raytheon, Burnham and others say comeback plans are in place.
Speaking to investors in New York last week, Burnham outlined ways
Raytheon plans to become more nimble. Already, he said,
quality-improvement projects generated up to $30 million in
operating income in the first half of the year. And he stressed the
company's backlog grew 20 percent to $25.6 billion at the end of
June compared to the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among major project wins, it counts orders for the Army's
Javelin anti-tank weapon and various classfied projects for the
National Security Agency and other government offices. Altogether,
Raytheon is ``holding to our year 2000 plan,'' Burnham told
analysts, though a spokesman said this doesn't necessarily mean the
company will meet analyst expectations in the closely-watched third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also notes it has a role in nine of the Pentagon's top
10 programs, from integration work on the Air Force's F-22 fighter
(worth up to $4 billion by 2005) to linking electronic systems on
Navy surface ships (worth up to $2 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Raytheon has said its work on the proposed National
Missile Defense program could be worth $5 billion by 2005. And even
if the controversial program isn't undertaken, Raytheon notes it
just won a $1.4 billion contract for another, the Theater High
Altitute Area Defense. ``We're all over missile defense,'' said
communications vice president Phyllis Piano.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also has been scouting for operations where defense
technologies might be transferred to civilian markets. These
include its infra-red sensors division, its optical components
unit, and a division that specializes in wireless communications.
Burnham has told investors that ``we're exploring all options'' for
the units, including joint ventures, spinoffs, or licensing deals.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the company says it is meeting its hiring goals for
engineers and software specialists, an area in which it had
difficulties in previous quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of these initiatives are pushing up Raytheon's
shares. And last week, more acute problems in its aviation unit
emerged. For one thing, Raytheon announced it expects its Premier I
business jet to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration
during the fourth quarter, a quarter later than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the stream of aircraft orders it once received from
commuter airlines now seems to be at risk. Last week, Mesa Air
Group of Phoenix said it would return 20 planes to Raytheon's
Aircraft Division and refinance as many as 36 more. Raytheon has
been shopping the entire aircraft division, based in Wichita, Kan.,
which could bring in cash to pay down its debt.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say they are still waiting to see more successes to
offset the memory of the company's disappointing earnings last
year. ``They're in recovery mode,'' said Joe Nadol, analyst for
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``It's not over yet.''

ONLINE, A SUCKER'S JUST A CLICK AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission first
confronted 15-year-old Jonathan Lebed last spring with evidence he
had used Internet chat rooms to manipulate penny stocks. Lebed's
response?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the big deal?'' he reportedly asked officials.
``Everybody does this.''
</P>
<P>
   The scary thing, regulators say, is that Lebed wasn't too far
off the mark. As many as half of the people who post messages in
some investment chat rooms are, in fact, passing along bogus
information.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Nestor, director of the Massachusetts Securities Division,
said the case of the New Jersey teen stands out among hundreds of
similar Web-based fraud cases only because of the perpetrator's
youth. And even that's becoming less notable all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a ton of people saying misleading things in chat
rooms any time you log on,'' Nestor said. ``On Yahoo, on Raging
Bull, on any of the others, it's safest to assume the information
isn't true and that people want you to do things out of their own
self-
</P>
<P>
   interest, not yours.''
</P>
<P>
   This month Lebed made headlines when he became the youngest
person ever singled out by federal regulators for allegedly
breaking securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's Philadelphia office spotlighted 27 dubious trades the
high school sophomore made (in custodial accounts opened by his
father) between August 1999 and February 2000. Witout admitting
guilt, Lebed agreed to repay $285,000 he made from 11 of the trades
and to stop the behavior in question.
</P>
<P>
   The nine companies whose stock was involved were forced to deal
with unexplained run-ups and unpleasant fall-offs in rapid
succession, but none suffered permanent damage. The same couldn't
be said for investors who bought during those run-ups.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, Lebed would typically use a computer
in his bedroom to buy hundreds or even thousands of shares in a
thinly traded, over-the-counter stock. He then allegedly used a
variety of screen names to hide his identity and post fictitious
messages in chat rooms, talking up the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he would place a ``limit order'' with his broker,
setting a higher price at which he wanted to unload the investment.
Investors who reacted to Lebed's hot tips would invariably push the
stock price up until it reached the limit order, at which time he
would sell his large block of shares, pocket the profits, and send
the price plummeting again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who buys during the run-up gets mauled,'' said Joe
Borg, director of the Alabama Securities Division. ``There are real
people on the other side of these scams, real victims who lose
quite a bit of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebed was hardly original. People have been running ``pump and
dump'' schemes, as they're often called, for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that stock manipulation is now migrating from
street corners and boiler-room brokerages to the Internet. And the
people behind them are increasingly young and tech-savvy, with
little or no experience in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 31, for example, 23-year-old college dropout Mark Jakob
of El Segundo, Calif., was arrested on wire and securities fraud
charges after creating a fake press release about fiber-optics
company Emulex Corp. and posting it online.
</P>
<P>
   When the firm's share price fell like a rock, Jakob allegedly
made $241,000 in quick profits. (Emulex shares since have recovered
to trade about where they started.)
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks earlier, 23-year-old Arash Aziz-Golshani and
24-year-old Hootan Melamed pleaded guilty to charges that they used
computer labs at UCLA in a scheme similar to Lebed's. The pair
bought thousands of shares in commercial printer NEI Webworld Inc.,
boosted its stock price through hundreds of phony Web postings,
then sold their shares for a $350,000 profit.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Georgetown University law student Douglas Colt, 24,
his mother, Joanne, and three of Colt's Georgetown classmates were
charged with stock manipulation in another pump and dump case
brought by the SEC. The group settled the charges and agreed not to
commit future violations.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the SEC's evidence in the case was a how-to posting Colt
left on a Web site: ``Buy a bunch of the garbage stock. Tell your
idiot subscribers about how great the stock is, and like sheep they
will run out and buy it. Dump the shares you bought a few hours ago
to all these suckers . . . Laugh all the way to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing that allows the new breed of manipulators to prosper,
and that most concerns regulators, is the seemingly vast pool of
neophyte investors who comb the Web in search of hot tips. They're
the sheep, in Colt's terminology, who get sheared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job would be a lot easier if people were more skeptical,
or at least more willing to do their homework before investing,''
said SEC spokeswoman Joanne Cronrath Bamberger. ``There is only so
much we can do to protect people as long as they're willing to
believe everything they read online.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say regulators aren't stepping up their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of its counterparts in other states, the Massachusetts
Securities Division has an Internet Fraud Unit that spends time
scouting investment chat rooms, bulletin boards, and Web sites in
search of fraudsters.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, for its part, created the 14-person Office of Internet
Enforcement in 1998 to train regulators and law enforcement
personnel to track down bad guys online. The agency also has a
240-person ``Cyberforce,'' accountants and securities lawyers who
spend at least a few hours a week scanning for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read about something, call the company or your broker
or your financial planner to verify it,'' Borg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather miss an opportunity than find out I just dumped
$20,000 into something that doesn't exist.''

<P>
   In spite of all the progress that's been made in pain management
over the years, narcotic painkillers are still the best drugs for
severe pain. But many doctors _ fearing patient addiction or action
from government regulators _ are reluctant to prescribe narcotics.
So some patients suffer needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas researchers surveyed medical students to
find out which were most reluctant to order narcotics for pain
relief. Those most likely to have opiophobia _ fear of prescribing
narcotics _ had three common traits:
</P>
<P>
   -- They were most likely to rely on high tech equipment.
</P>
<P>
   -- They were most subject to outside control.

<P>
   So if you go to a doctor who doesn't like to take chances, you
may be left in pain. But does that mean you're better off with one
who doesn't mind taking risks? Maybe this matter requires a second

COVERAGE OF LEE CASE HAD FLAWS, TIMES SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a half-page note to readers that defended its coverage but
acknowledged some shortcomings, The New York Times Tuesday
published a highly unusual post-mortem of its controversial and
much-criticized reporting on the Wen Ho Lee espionage case.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist at the center
of the Chinese nuclear spying saga, pleaded guilty to one count of
wrongdoing earlier this month and was released by a judge who
apologized for the government's overzealous handling of the case.
Shortly thereafter, President Clinton expressed his regrets and a
White House aide directly criticized the Times's journalism.
</P>
<P>
   It was a front-page March 6, 1999, Times story by James Risen
and Jeff Gerth _ which sounded a loud alarm about Chinese theft of
nuclear secrets and pointedly compared it to the Rosenberg
espionage case at the dawn of the Cold War _ that triggered what
Committee of Concerned Journalists chairman Bill Kovach called
``the media chase of Wen Ho Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of the perception that Lee has been unfairly treated,
the Times, which, like The Boston Globe, is owned by the New York
Times Co., has generated vocal criticism that it had rushed to
judgment. Several days ago, for example, the Web magazine salon.com
published a story called ``How The New York Times helped railroad
Wen Ho Lee.'' And given the paper's traditional reluctance to air
its dirty linen in public, Tuesday's lengthy editors' note _
co-authored by executive editor Joseph Lelyveld and managing editor
Bill Keller _ had the media world buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an extraordinary thing that they did,'' said
Kovach, who sees it as an attempt to ``be more transparent with New
York Times readers about the choices they make.''
</P>
<P>
   The note sent mixed messages to those readers. On one hand, it
stated that ``we remain proud of work that brought into the open a
major national security problem of which officials had been aware
for months, even years. Our review found careful reporting that
included extensive cross-checking and vetting of multiple sources,
despite enormous obstacles of official secrecy and government's
efforts to identify The Times's sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the editors suggested that the coverage had failed
to ``give Dr. Lee the full benefit of the doubt,'' said the paper
``did not pay enough attention to the possibility that there had
been a major intelligence loss in which the Los Alamos scientist
was a minor player, or completely uninvolved,'' and lamented the
failure to create a tone of ``journalistic detachment from our
sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Times editors did not comment Tuesday and the paper's
spokeswoman Catherine Mathis said ``the assessment of our reporting
speaks for itself.'' But observers had differing reactions to that
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a mea culpa . . . The prevailing tone for me
was more of a defense and explanation of what they had done,'' said
David Anable, president of the Washington-based International
Center for Journalists. ``My feeling is they got (the spying story)
pretty much right and the balance between slamming a poor harmless
old man and accurately reporting a potentially large breach of
security is difficult when everybody is trying to keep it from
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly better, more declarative ways to say `we
screwed up,' '' said Steven Brill, the founder of Brill's Content
magazine, which ran a November 1999 story assailing the Times's
coverage of the spying case. The editors' note ``reads like it was
written and edited by 20 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovach said he thinks the explanation will enhance the Times's
credibility with readers, but said it might have been better
presented as an analysis piece ``so that whoever wrote it could be
a little less defensive about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anable said the lesson of the Lee story is the burden placed on
the Times by its own clout. ``What happens is everyone else latches
on to the Times, particularly the politicians,'' he said. ``And the
residue washes back over the Times.''

WHEN TILTING AT WINDMILLS PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alternative power ventures spent years tilting at windmills.
What they needed was a few investment bankers on their side.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of alternative power in vogue among investors these
days is more commonly known as distributed power, typically
involving fuel cells or solar power.
</P>
<P>
   And just when you thought investors had run out of things to
throw absurd amounts of money at, these companies are attracting
megamillions on scant actual business.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Evergreen Solar Inc. of Waltham, Mass., which is in
the process of raising $40 million in an inital public offering
that could value the company at $165 million to upward of $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Evergreen's revenues of $1.1 million through the first half of
this year were earned almost exclusively through research, not by
selling the solar products it is in business to make. A good chunk
of the IPO money is intended to fund a manufacturing facility in
Marlborough, Mass. that the company said will make it possible to
ramp up product sales.
</P>
<P>
   Beacon Power Corp. of Woburn, Mass. has been even more
ambitious, registering an IPO to sell as much as $115 million in
stock to fund its business of developing flywheel electric storage
systems. Beacon reported revenues of $269,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   What leads Beacon Power to believe it can raise that kind of
money? Perhaps it was the early August IPO of Active Power Inc.,
which also makes a flywheel energy storage system. That offering
was priced at $17 per share, and the stock finished Tuesday at
$64.375, giving the company a market value of $2.4 billion. The
company's revenues through the first half of this year: $861,000.
</P>
<P>
   As an investment trend, distributed power follows a familiar
pattern. The big-picture story is plausible and quite intriguing,
but the prices of individual stocks get bid up and out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like another new-economy plot line, there is good
reason. The popularity of distributed power companies is driven by
two factors: the deregulation of electric utilities and the
increasing demand for extremely reliable power to support a world
of wired computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very large-scale, structural transformations that
are occurring and stimulating development,'' said analyst Hugh
Holman of CIBC World Markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utilities in a monopoly have been very good at squashing the
development of distributed resources. We're now in the gradual and
somewhat stop-and-go process of prying the power business from
monopolies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holman compares electric deregulation to the process of
telephone deregulation started years earlier, predicting
far-reaching change to come.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative power is described as ``distributed'' because
relatively small or even tiny amounts of generating capacity will
pop up at many places across the old power grid, typically at the
sites of customers who need backup resources or simply want to
produce their own energy.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the alternative power of the old days, most
distributed electricity is environmentally friendly. Fuel cells
generate power by chemical reaction, and solar power converts
sunlight into electricity, using silicon.
</P>
<P>
   The investment pitch for many distributed power companies
emphasizes the increasing demand for electricity, compared with
other forms of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Evergreen Solar's stock offering documents site studies that
estimate electricity as one quarter of domestic energy use 25 years
ago and 37 percent last year _ and that forecast it will grow to
more than 50 percent early in this century.
</P>
<P>
   Computers in general and the Internet in paricular drive a piece
of that electric demand. The Internet often requires a kind of
power reliability that even traditional utilities can't promise.
``Five nines,'' or 99.99999 percent reliability, is often the
standard sought by companies that live on the Web and that requires
affordable backup systems that act as safety nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of demand that has to be met,'' said Mark Burns,
a stock anlayst at Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co. ``I think people really are
looking for different ways to provide backup power and
reliability.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the high-tech world, the distributed energy business
may find the stock market a place of steep mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those stocks, particularly shares of companies with
promising fuel cell businesses, boomed in the earliest months of
this year, only to plunge with the tech stock market in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of SatCon Technology Corp., based in Cambridge, Mass.,
soared from a low of just under $8.50 in late December to $40 by
March 10, only to give up about 67 percent of their value in the
next five weeks. SatCon stock has since climbed back to approach
its old highs; it closed at $37.25 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   SatCon has an advantage beyond the operations of its own
business divisions. It owns 32 percent of Beacon Power, which could
be the next hot IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Distributed power may generate plenty of business for new
companies in the years ahead. But there isn't going to be room for
an endless line of billion-dollar players.

BIOGEN'S AVONEX MAY SLOW, HALT PROGRESS OF MS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early treatment with large doses of Biogen Inc.'s Avonex may
slow or even halt the progression of multiple sclerosis in patients
at high risk for the disease, according to a study in this week's
New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Avonex is a beta interferon developed by the Cambridge, Mass.
company and approved in 1996 for the treatment of multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   This study is the first to show, however, that the drug might be
useful in delaying the onset of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The 383 patients examined in the 2 1/2-year study showed early
signs of MS but had not yet developed the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that patients given a weekly shot of Avonex were
44 percent less likely to develop the disease than those treated
with a placebo, or dummy drug.
</P>
<P>
   Brain scans also found patients on Avonex had smaller lesions
and were less likely to develop new ones, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen plans to seek approval to sell Avonex to patients at risk
of MS in the United States and Europe, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that
purpose, the market for the drug would increase greatly.
</P>
<P>
   The company estimates that about 100,000 of the 1 million people
worldwide who suffer from MS could benefit from early treatment
with Avonex.
</P>
<P>
   MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system that
causes symptoms including balance loss, numbness and paralysis.

   &UR; FIRM GRANTS WORLD MARKETING RIGHTS FOR GENE-SEQUENCE DATA
</P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme Molecular Oncology, a Framingham, Mass. biotechnology
company, said it has granted Celera Genomics coexclusive worldwide
rights to market the company's gene expression data, known as Sage.
</P>
<P>
   Celera will make the gene expression data available through its
Web-based biological information portal under an agreement that
allows users to combine Sage data with Celera's Genome Reference
Database.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the combination of the two databases will help
Celera's customers better understand how diseases work and allow
them to accelerate the drug discovery process by associating genes
with tissues and disease states.
</P>
<P>
   Sage includes information on more than 2.5 million gene
sequences from a wide range of normal human tissue to the most
prevalent types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme Molecular, a division of Cambridge's Genzyme Corp., said
it will provide Celera with additional gene sequences as it expands
the database.
</P>
<P>
   Celera, based in Maryland, announced earlier this year that it
had decoded the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Its database catalogs genes and proteins encoded in the human
genome as well as in the genomes of other organisms important to
understanding normal human physiology and the development of
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed,
Genzyme Molecular said it is licensing the Sage data to Celera on a
revenue-sharing basis.

   &UR; HYBRIDON SELLS DNA MANUFACTURING FOR $15 &LR;   &UR; MILLION
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hybridon Inc. has sold its DNA manufacturing business to a
British company.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million sale of its Milford, Mass. operation to Avecia
of Manchester, UK, will enable Hybridon to focus on Phase II
testing of its antisense cancer drug to treat solid tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most drugs on the market that are designed to interact
with proteins, which control the body's function, antisense drugs
intervene earlier by interrupting the process by which
disease-causing proteins are produced.
</P>
<P>
   Turning antisense technology into marketable medications has
proven more difficult than expected, not only for Hybridon but for
nearly half a dozen other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, only one antisense drug, a medication to
prevent eye damage from common infection in late-stage AIDS
patients, has gained US Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   It was developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Carlsbad,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With the Milford plant sale, Avecia will retain 17 of Hybridon's
37 employees. The remaining 20 will move to a new headquarters in
Cambridge, Mass.

WEALTH OF RESOURCES PUTS BAY STATE AT TOP OF BIOTECH

 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When it decided to build a new research site, Swedish
pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca went looking for a location that
offered a wealth of research and scientists. It wanted an area that
was full of energy and entrepreneurial spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts made the list of potential sites. So did other
biotech hubs such as San Francisco, San Diego and North Carolina's
Research Triangle as well as Japan, France and Australia. In the
end, however, the company chose Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons, simply put: MIT, Harvard, Brandeis, Tufts,
Worcester Polytechnic, Whitehead Research Institute, Longwood
Medical and Academic Area, UMass Medical Center, the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's basic science research going on in the universities,
clinical research going on in the hospitals,'' said Hans G.
Nilsson, vice president and site general manager for AstraZeneca.
``It's a fantastic, talented pool from which to draw people and
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   AstraZeneca is one of many companies in recent years to join the
state's growing biotech community. At last count, 143 biotech
companies had popped up inside the Route 128 belt, 68 more within
Interstate 495 and another 29 west of I-495. And the numbers are
constantly growing, said Stephen Mulloney, director of
communications and government relations at the Massachusetts
Biotechnology Council.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based pharmaceutical powerhouse Pfizer Inc. opened a
research center in January 1999 in Cambridge. California biotech
giant Amgen Inc. broke ground in November for a new Cambridge
research site. AstraZeneca moved into its Waltham campus in April.
And Merck, a top-tier New Jersey pharmaceutical company, also
decided recently to build a research site in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Established Massachusetts biotech companies like Genzyme Corp.,
Biogen Inc. and Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. are also expanding
in the area. Add to that the number of start-ups within the state's
borders _ more than 25 in just the past two months, Mulloney said _
and the growth is truly remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of qualities here that, over the years, have
coalesced to form a real center: the academic and research
institutions, the hospitals, the venture capital community and the
work force,'' Mulloney said.
</P>
<P>
   The state is the top recipient per capita of research grants
from the National Institutes of Health. Its population ranks among
the most highly educated in the nation. And of the nation's top 100
biotech companies, 20 are based in Massachusetts. That compares
with 16 in San Francisco's Bay Area and nine in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Going by the numbers of companies, Massachusetts has climbed in
the ranking of US biotech hubs to become number one, nudging past
San Francisco in the longstanding rivalry between the Bay State and
the Bay Area. Ernst &AMP; Young's 1999 report on the biotech industry
lists nearly 200 companies in Massachusetts compared to about 180
in the Bay Area. But industry professionals said the differences
are pretty small. Both are known worldwide as the heavyweight
contenders of biotech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close between Boston and San Francisco,'' said Dan
Eramian, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Biotechnology
Industry Organization. ``Both areas have what it takes to be
attractive for biotech.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mulloney said, state government has aided the
tremendous growth of the biotech industry in Massachusetts through
its support of education, tax credits for research spending, an
emerging technology fund to help small companies finance
investments in equipment and other fixed assets, and the
establishment of quasipublic agencies to support developing
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't always the case, said Michael Hogan, president and
chief executive of MassDevelopment, the largest of those agencies.
In the early 1990s, the state was complacent, assuming the science
generated by its universities would continue to foster and support
the growing biotech community.
</P>
<P>
   ``That complacency allowed some good science and some good
companies to leave the state,'' Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies looked to California, he said, most
considered relocating to less expensive areas with burgeoning
biotech communities such as Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey
and even Maine. One of the earliest residents of the Jackson
Technology Park at Devens Commerce Center, formerly Fort Devens
Army base, was a company that had been priced out of Lexington and
was considering a move to Maine, Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hogan heard about Pharma-Eco Laboratories Inc.'s plans to
relocate, he put together a proposal. The Devens site was developed
to offer technology companies a less expensive alternative to areas
in and around Boston, giving the state a chance to compete with
mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. Hogan said the park offers
lower tax rates, quicker permitting processes, substantial savings
on utilities and access to an experienced manufacturing work force.
</P>
<P>
   Pharm-Eco just completed building a $16 million,
160,000-square-foot campus to house research, development and
manufacturing. The park will also serve as a biotech ``incubator,''
offering 80,000 square feet of lab space for small start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Such lab space is invaluable to companies like Roxbury's IVREA
BioPharmaceuticals, a two-person operation that shares lab space,
equipment and office staff with other biotech start-ups, said
Maurizio Cattaneo, the company's chief executive. A nonprofit
agency, Massachusetts Biomedical Initiatives, helped the company
find the space to conduct its skin cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Cattaneo said he benefits from the sheer number of other
start-ups in the state. They share resources and learn from each
other. California might offer a similar environment, he said, but
less expensive areas _ even those with growing numbers of biotech
companies _ simply can't offer the wealth of expertise and
experience available here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to weigh the pros and cons,'' he said. ``For me,
there is no other place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Larger companies echo his sentiments. Massachusetts has a
network of professionals that know the biotech industry: venture
capitalists who understand a start-up's financial requirements,
patent lawyers, architects and construction crews that can
accommodate the intricate scientific and regulatory demands of
building a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a critical mass of companies in your field is extremely
helpful from a research point of view, a clinical point of view, a
labor point of view,'' said Mara Aspinall, president of Genzyme
Pharmaceuticals, a division of Cambridge's Genzyme Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and California probably offer similar advantages
in that regard and similar drawbacks in terms of traffic and living
costs. But some people are devoutly East Coast and others are
devoutly West Coast, said Kleanthis G. Xanthopolous, chief
executive of Anadys Pharmaceuticals, a company with offices in San
Diego and Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Pfizer, Amgen and Merck are opening offices on
both coasts. Amgen spokesman David Kaye said the company has long
seen Boston as one of the world's top centers for academic research
and commercial drug discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every scientist is going to want to relocate to
California,'' he said. ``To be an active player, we believe you
need to be in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the biotech industry grows, new issues arise. Chief among
them, said Genzyme's Aspinall, is the increasingly difficult
challenge of finding enough talent to fill all the job openings.
Genzyme is growing at about 10 percent a year. Although the company
is hiring all the time, she said, there area always openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a competitive environment, you need to continually evaluate
your strengths and weaknesses,'' she said. ``Because you can be
sure they will change over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulloney of the Massachusetts Biotech Council agreed, adding
that the state will also face increasing competition from smaller
biotech hubs such as North Carolina and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of people casting envious eyes to
Massachusetts,'' he said. ``Right now, people want to come here.
But other regions may begin offering incentives to draw those
companies away.''
</P>
<P>
   That is already starting to happen, although it is rare, said
Joe Donovan, director of the state's economic development efforts
for emerging technologies. One company was lured to another state
by a generous package of land and tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan and Mulloney said they don't think Massachusetts should
offer such deals. While the state offers certain research and
investment tax credits, they said, it does not hand out money to
attract companies. But the state can attract biotech companies in
other ways _ most importantly, by supporting science and technology
education to ensure an adequate work force for the growing
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Mulloney also suggested additional support for small start-ups
like IVREA. By allowing young companies that aren't yet profitable
to sell their research and development tax credits to larger
companies, he said, the state could help start-ups raise much
needed cash for their research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in corporate welfare,'' Mulloney said. ``The
big companies only ask for a level playing field. But I think the
state could target specific assistance to the small start-ups that
could be the next Amgen or Biogen. After all, our economy today is
fueled by the R&AMP;D done 20 years ago.''

   BIOTECH-DOPING (Undated) _ It's a story that keeps repeating
itself. A company spends years and many millions of dollars to
develop a drug to treat a serious medical condition. Then, athletes
use the drugs to boost performance. But as reports and rumors
circulate, the companies find themselves in the spotlight,
defending their public images, fielding complaints about a lack of
controls, and balancing social and corporate responsibilities. By

HELP FOR THE BATTERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can employers play a role in the lives of battered workers?
</P>
<P>
   Julie Foshay certainly thinks so. Two years ago, after being
beaten at home and ridiculed at work by a man who was both her
supervisor and live-in companion, the 40-year-old manager went to
see her employer: Richard Millman, president of Textron Systems, a
Wilmington, Mass. defense manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Fiercely private and fearful the abuse would escalate if she
revealed too much, Foshay didn't mention her abuser's name or the
nature of her problem. She simply said she was having personal
problems and needed time to work them out. But Millman seemed to
know she was being battered, and he threw her a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I was afraid of someone, if I'd been hurt,''
recalls Foshay, now 42, of Boston. ``He asked if the person who
hurt me worked there. He wanted to know if my children were at
risk. Then, he advised that I call the police and leave (with them)
immediately. . . . The next day he transferred me to a different
building, and gave me a special assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Foshay seems surprised by the company's reaction. ``I
still can't get over the response,'' she says. ``I fully expected
to be terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   At another company she might have been.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Textron's Millman was a founding member of
Employers Against Domestic Violence, a fledgling group that has
since grown to include 65 Massachusetts firms.
</P>
<P>
   Created by the law firm Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and
Popeo and Fleet Bank four years ago, the coalition is among a small
but growing number of employer initiatives that have cropped up
around the country. The reason is clear: domestic violence affects
a company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, companies lose between $3 billion and $5 billion
because of absenteeism, medical bills, and lost productivity due to
abuse, reports the Bureau of National Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Verizon Wireless, in conjunction with the Family
Violence Prevention Fund in San Francisco, is sponsoring a campaign
to familiarize workers and their employers with the resources
available to women or men who are being abused.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, large black-and-white photographs of
working women whose eyes are hidden by dark glasses or a lock of
hair will be placed on the walls of participating corporations.
Part of the campaign began on Friday, Sept. 15, when Foshay walked
up to a podium at the Omni Parker House Hotel and, in a voice
stripped of emotion, told her story to 200 women and men at the
``Corporate Citizenship Initiative on Domestic Violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Family Violence Prevention Fund, the event
marked the first time Foshay had spoken to a large group about the
violence that had controlled her life.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Foshay hid her feelings and the abuse by adopting a
dual life. By day, she was a Textron Systems manager who seemed to
have it all: a good job, a home in New Hampshire, and two
attractive children.
</P>
<P>
   By night, Foshay struggled to keep the peace, fearing there
would be repercussions at work if she, in any way, challenged her
batterer. The couple rarely left the house; he was jealous of her
friends and members of her family. She was too scared of
displeasing him to venture out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the office, he would assign me work that other people
hadn't completed,'' she said of her four-year ordeal. ``When I was
done, he'd give it back to them and they would get the credit. When
we were alone in his office, he yelled at me, pinched me, punched
me, and spat at me. Then, when I tried to transfer, he said he
could not let me go because I was critical to the department...He
knew where I was at all times of the day. He monitored who I talked
to and read my correspondence. Why didn't I get up and leave?
Because he had terrorized me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to remain in the relationship and keep the abuse a
secret doesn't surprise workplace experts or psychologists. Deborah
Swiss, a management consultant and author of the book, ``The Male
Mind at Work,'' calls battering a silent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women won't tell anyone,'' says Swiss. ``They worry they
will be viewed as troublemakers and that they will be putting their
jobs in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a desperate Foshay sought out her employer and asked
for help. The next day, a security guard was assigned to her new
section, and the locks to her office were changed. She was shown a
protected parking space, and handed a list of four coworkers who
had been asked to assist her. She also received information about
support services and counseling for battered women.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I talked to the company president, the people he had
assigned to me began to talk to me,'' Foshay recalled. ``Every day,
someone would come by. This was done unobstrusively. One woman, a
woman I grew to trust, told me I would not have to keep everything
to myself anymore. My head was spinning. I was invigorated by the
freedom I felt that day...I was still scared, but the
thoughtfulness with which my employer handled the situation gave me
the strength to go on and do what I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Julie Foshay an exception? Not at all, says Linda Cagle,
Textron's vice president of human resources. ``We've had other
women at work in similar circumstances. We do all we can to keep
them safe, including escorting them home and finding alternative
living arrangements. We have a process in place.''
</P>
<P>
   (Employers interested in obtaining anti-battering posters for
their workplaces should contact the Family Violence Prevention Fund
at www.fvpf.org. Workers seeking counseling or advice should call
1-800-799-7233).

 PREDICTIVE NETWORKS TAKES TRACKING OF NET SURFERS TO NEW HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 888-346-9867 or (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Devin Hosea, the 30-year-old founder and president of Predictive
Networks Inc., is the boyish face behind what some consider the
Internet's latest threat to consumer privacy.
</P>
<P>
   A digital wizard who learned how to crack software code by age
10, Hosea has been drawing fire from consumer advocates who say his
technology takes online surveillance to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   Hosea's start-up company in Cambridge, Mass. has developed
software that builds digital ``silhouettes,'' or profiles, of
Internet users, after tracking their clicks across the Web. For
example, if a Web surfer visits an airline site and then a Boston
museum site, Predictive's profile model might immediately send the
user a pop-up ad for a Massachusetts travel guide from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Predictive is being closely watched by privacy advocates
because, unlike many similar software companies, it has struck
deals with Internet service providers rather than individual Web
sites. As a result, Predictive's software can follow users of these
ISPs everywhere on the Web, gaining insights into their ages,
incomes, shopping preferences, and hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the whole menu,'' said Hosea, who maintains that his
company protects consumers while allowing advertisers to better
target their audience.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash against Predictive, which launched in May,
highlights the intense debate over privacy on the Web. On one side
are those who believe Internet users should be protected from
companies compiling extensive personal data. On the other are Web
firms that say they are no different from traditional companies in
their desire to research consumer habits.
</P>
<P>
   Hosea believes he is striking the proper balance. He said
Predictive tosses out the list of Web sites that users visit and
keeps only a set of ``scores'' that reveal a customer's implied
demographic information and preferences. No advertiser or ISP can
view the anonymous profiles. Rather, Predictive controls the
silhouettes and sends ads directly to users.
</P>
<P>
   But some privacy advocates remain skeptical of promises made by
Predictive and other Internet companies. They say Predictive does
not properly get ``opt-in'' consent from consumers and does not
have a strict privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates also point to DoubleClick Inc., which
outraged Internet users when it attempted to merge its database of
anonymous consumer information with another database that
identified consumers by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much worse,'' said Andrew Shen, a policy analyst with
the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. ``This is
tracking virtually every move of the Internet user.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts also fear Predictive's software will be widely
accepted by ISPs and, later, cable companies. In seven months, the
tiny firm has signed on six ISPs, including AT&AMP;T WorldNet, IDT
Corp., PSINet, and three others it declined to identify.
Advertisers also are lining up, impressed by Predictive's ability
to dramatically improve customer response to ads.
</P>
<P>
   Predictive plans to announce this week that it has received $45
million in a second round of funding led by venture capital firms
Battery Ventures and Advent International. Smaller investors
include Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., the world's largest
telecommunications company, as well as Internet telephony carrier
Net2Phone Inc. and Internet researcher Nielsen/NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 2001, Predictive projects that 10 million Internet
users will be on the receiving end of the company's profiling
software.
</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc. and Microsoft Corp., two giants in Internet
service, declined to comment on whether they might use Predictive's
software or any similar technology in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where both Hosea and privacy experts agree: Big ISPs
that have largely avoided tracking users will eventually adopt
profiling technology to increase their ad revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Hosea, the son of a nuclear physics scientist, had dabbled in
artificial intelligence at an early age. From a computer in his
father's laboratory at Princeton University, Hosea managed to crack
into a sensitive file. Rather than punishing him, the university
gave him a part-time job writing data-analysis software. Two years
ago, Hosea decided to leave his job as a vice president in GE
Capital's Equity Capital Group to build his own company.
</P>
<P>
   His company's software is downloaded when customers receive
their ISP service. Using artificial intelligence, Predictive does
its best to match Internet users with compatible advertisements. It
works by scoring consumers on 120 different demographical and
preference categories based on Web sites visited. Clicking on a
video-game site, for instance, could result in a low score for age.
But visiting Charles Schwab's site might translate into higher age
and income ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies argue that such digital profiling limits the
number of advertising misfires _ those banner ads that consumers
consider annoying and that advertisers find ineffective. Fewer than
1 percent of customers click on banner advertisements, according to
industry figures. But IDT, one of Predictive's partners, has seen
ads that have drawn 18 percent of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end users say it's a much more pleasurable experience,''
said Michael Packer, domestic operations director for IDT, based in
Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Hosea believes Web users will let Predictive, which shares ad
revenue with ISPs, watch their every move online in return for
lower Internet-service rates. IDT is now using Predictive's
software for a free service called freeatlast.com, while AT&AMP;T
WorldNet is using the technology in a $4.95-a-month package.
</P>
<P>
   Predictive's business model and approach to online privacy also
helped it win over service providers, ISP executives said.
Predictive allows customers to access their silhouettes. And it
does not send them ads for alcohol, tobacco, firearms, or
pornography. Medical self-help sites and hate-monger sites also are
banned.
</P>
<P>
   Although the software can collect keywords at a search engine
and other data typed on a Web page, the company has restrained
itself. Predictive's privacy board, led by Boston civil-liberties
attorney Harvey Silverglate, has expressed concerns about the
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Hosea also stepped to the side, allowing more seasoned
management to steer the company. Michael Skarzynski, 44, a former
executive at Lucent Technologies Inc., took over as CEO May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Predictive's efforts to reassure consumers, critics say
there are glaring problems with the company's techology.
</P>
<P>
   First, Internet users ``opt in,'' or agree to allow Predictive
to track them, by signing a contract with the ISP. That means that
people who choose not to participate simply do not get the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their threshold for opt-in is meaningless, ridiculous,
extremely unfair, and potentially actionable,'' said Ed
Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the US Public Interest
Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts also say Predictive's privacy statement, which
is displayed on its Web site, does not rule out the possibility
that an ISP user name and identification number could be linked to
the anonymous ID number attached to profiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure exactly what they mean when they say anonymous,''
said Jonathan Zittrain, an assistant professor at Harvard Law
School who noticed the clause in Predictive's privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   A Predictive spokesman said the company has not received
personally identifiable information from ISPs and does not intend
to do so. In response to criticism, the firm will rewrite the
clause. ``Predictive Networks is clarifying the privacy policy to
reiterate our operating policy,'' the company said Friday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of Predictive's ISP partners was concerned enough
to strike the clause from its agreement during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I specifically negotiated in our contract that I would not do
that,'' said Harry Lalor, a vice president at Ashburn, Va.-based
PSINet. ``I wanted to stay out of that whole discussion. There's no
way to win, especially for an ISP.''

perky; when that ran its course she went for sexy. In 1985, when
she won her second best-actress Oscar, she famously trilled, ``You
like me! You really like me!'' So it's interesting to hear her say
that what attracted her to ``Beautiful,'' the new comedy that Field
chose as her feature directing debut, was that the female lead
character isn't very likable. By ERIC HARRISON.

   FOLK-MEDICINE (San Antonio) _ Behind the counter at Casa
Mireles, rows of small white drawers used to store dried herbs are
neatly labeled in black marker with mysterious-sounding Spanish
names. For decades, customers have been going to the botanica
seeking the ingredients for herbal remedies that are part of the
traditional Mexican folk medicine called curanderismo. Why do these
treatments persist in the face of modern medicine. ``Well, because

 &HT;    EDS: THIS IS FILE 2 OF 2
 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Whose voice is it singing ``If you're happy and you know it .
. .'' on the Home Depot commercials for the Olympic Games?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, we struck out. The only information available is that
she's ``a young lady from the Midwest'' who wants to remain
anonymous, said Home Depot spokeswoman Mandy Holton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Georgia Farmers and Consumers Market Bulletin reports
that the National Park Service will open the Jimmy Carter boyhood
farm on Nov. 17. Did the government buy this farm from the Carter
family? If so, what was the price?
</P>
<P>
   A: The farm was sold by the Carter family in 1948, said Paul
Winegar of the National Park Service. The NPS bought it from the
heirs of the people who purchased it from the Carters, he added,
paying ``in the range of $65,000.''
</P>
<P>
   When it opens, visitors will be able to see the restored house
where President Carter lived as a child; his father's store; and
some of the barns and outbuildings, reconstructed to look exactly
as they did when Carter was a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Florida has stopped auto emission inspections. Why has the
EPA permitted this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Florida cleaned up its air, that's why. The emissions testing
program began in 1991 in Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, Duval,
Pinellas and Hillsborough counties after the Environmental
Protection Agency determined the air there violated the Clean Air
Act. For various reasons _ federal rules requiring cleaner fuels,
cars with more efficient engines, successful work on failing
vehicles to bring them up to standard _ the state's air quality
improved dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state and the EPA reached settlements with
Tampa Electric Co. to reduce nitrogen oxide discharges, eliminating
40 times more pollution than the vehicle testing program.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the EPA gave Florida preliminary approval to remove
the emissions testing program from its clean air plan. On July 1, a
new law mandating the end of the tests took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the focus on the Olympics, I was wondering: Are the
Aborigines of African descent?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. As explained by Encyclopedia Britannica, they originally
came from somewhere in Asia, and have been in Australia for at
least 40,000 years. The first settlement would have occurred during
an era of lowered sea levels, when there was an almost continuous
land bridge between Asia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that some extremely valuable items, including
artwork and possibly jewels and a great deal of cash, were aboard
the Swissair flight that crashed into the Atlantic off eastern
Canada several years ago. Do you have any information? Was any
effort made to retrieve those items?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the aftermath of the crash Sept. 2, 1998, off Peggy's
Cove, Nova Scotia, widely varying stories circulated about the
valuables said to be aboard the MD-11. One report said nearly 110
pounds of cash and 4 1/2 pounds of diamonds were sent to the ocean
floor; another said a stainless steel tube filled with diamonds
went down.
</P>
<P>
   Very little ever was confirmed, but Swissair officials did say a
Picasso work, ``Le Peintre'' was lost. Reports variously listed its
value at a minimum of $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the crash, an airline spokesman said no gold was
aboard the plane, adding that officials didn't know the value of
the money or jewels because the owners weren't required to declare
a total dollar figure.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, insurer Lloyds of London, which paid out an insurance
policy on the lost gems, announced that it would use a
minisubmarine to search for valuables.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, stung by criticism that it was engaging in
grave-robbing, Lloyds called off the plan and apologized to
victims' families. The crash claimed 229 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In baseball scoring, a K indicates a strikeout. What does the
backwards K mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the scorecard symbol for a strikeout on a called third
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't heard anything for several years now about Terry
Waite, the former Church of England envoy who negotiated for the
release of Western hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s, only to be
taken hostage himself. What is he doing these days?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's involved in several projects in Britain, which include
serving as president of Emmaus, a charity working with the
homeless; supporting a trust helping inmates in British prisons;
and serving as chairman of the YMCA group Y-Care, an organization
he founded to help street children. Most recently, in August,
Waite, 61, traveled with a small group from Northern Ireland to
Liberia to launch a project to bring electricity to a YMCA youth
and community center in the town of Ganta.
</P>
<P>
   Waite was held captive by Shiite Muslims in Lebanon from Jan.
20, 1987, until Nov. 18, 1991. While visiting a hospice in
Plymouth, England, earlier this summer, he told a reporter that he
has no mental scars. ``I don't get flashbacks,'' he said. ``None.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the distance in a straight line between Barrow,
Alaska, and Key West, Fla.?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's 4,290 miles as the crow flies. Straight-path distances
between many locations worldwide can be determined online at
www.indo.com/distance/ or found in the book ``Direct-Line
Distances,'' available at libraries and bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For years I've heard mentions of the ``wreck of the
Hesperus.'' What is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the name of a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
(1807-82), whose subject was the schooner Hesperus ``that sailed
the wintry sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the warning of an old sailor, its skipper tied his
daughter to the mast when a mighty storm struck. She and her father
died amid the wreckage. The poem ends: ``Such was the wreck of the
Hesperus,/ In the midnight and the snow!/ Christ save us all from a
death like this,/ On the reef of Norman's Woe!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wreck of the Hesperus'' also was the title of a 1948 film
with John Hoffman and Edgar Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know it's been printed before, but can you repeat when and
where the next Winter Olympics will be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Feb. 8-24, 2002, in Salt Lake City, Utah.

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com. Please include your name and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did we miss something? Isn`t the Miss America pageant always
held in September?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's normally a September fixture, but was postponed this
year because of the Olympics. It will air live from Atlantic City,
N.J., at 8 p.m. Oct. 14 on ABC. Donny and Marie Osmond will repeat
as hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported on July 12 that South Korea is awarding medals
to Americans who served there during the war. I was sent the
application form, which I completed and returned on July 25. I
haven't had a response. Anything further to report?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Air Force Awards and Decorations Section continues to get
``thousands of requests a day,'' a spokesman said, and it's sending
out about 1,000 medals a day. At present, there's a backlog of at
least two months.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 22, the section was evaluating applications received
on July 17. It will be December, at the earliest, before the
section catches up.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime the section is upgrading its telephone system
and, if plans are approved, should be able to tell applicants by
the middle of October the status of their application if they call
and provide their name, Social Security number or service number.
</P>
<P>
   For general information on the Korea medals program, contact the
Air Force Personnel Center, 1-800-558-1404; or online at
www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/awards; or write HQ AFPC/DPPPRA, 550 C St.
West, Suite 12, Randolph Air Force Base, TX 78150-4714. For the
status of medal applications after Oct. 15, call the Air Force
Awards and Decorations Section, 210-565-2432.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In hurricane-naming, what letter of the alphabet is the
farthest ever reached, and what was the name? In other words, has
there ever been a Hurricane Zeus? We can't recall ever going beyond
O for Opal.
</P>
<P>
   A: Under the modern naming scheme, which in 1978 began using
alternating male and female names, the farthest letter reached was
T for Tanya in 1995, said Frank Lepore of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami. There were 19 named storms that year, the second
most active year on record after 1933, when 21 storms occurred
(they were numbered back then, not named).
</P>
<P>
   In no case could there be a Hurricane Zeus, anyway, since the
letters Q, U, X, Y and Z aren't used for storm names.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons, Lepore explained. There aren't enough
names beginning with those letters to allow spares, in case the
name of a storm is retired because of the number of deaths or
amount of damage it produced. And the names must be understandable
in Spanish, French and Dutch. Weather officials wouldn't want the
misprounciation of a name to produce something incorrect or
offensive, for example when garbled in transmission.
</P>
<P>
   In the event that so many storms occur in a year that the World
Meteorological Organization runs through its list, it then would
use the Greek alphabet, Lepore added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Georgia's promotional literature now calls it the Empire
State of the South. I thought Georgia was the Peach State. Can you
clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is nothing new. For years Georgia has had several
unofficial nicknames, including Empire State of the South, because
of its large size and thriving industries. In fact, the Georgia
entry in World Book Encyclopedia has a headline with the name of
the state followed by the wordsThe Empire State of the South in
italics.
</P>
<P>
   Other Georgia nicknames over the years, in addition to Peach
State: Goober State, Cracker State and Yankee-Land of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Charlotte's problems related to big-time
sports mentioned that it had been voted the nation's most livable
city by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Is this survey available
online?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Conference of Mayors doesn't name the most livable
city in America, said its spokesman, Jubi Headley. However, it does
make City Livability Awards honoring outstanding programs in
cities. There's no list available, Headley added, but you can find
information about the awards online at
www.usmayors.org/uscm/home.asp.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans and Gadsden, Ala., were awarded top honors in the
2000 City Livability Awards Program, incidentally.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a lot of talk in my office about the accuracy of
presidential election polls. Do you have the final results of the
major polls just prior to the 1996 election, as well as the actual
election vote totals?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a USA Today/CNN/Gallup tracking poll conducted Oct. 20-21,
1996, and reported Oct. 23, 52 percent of registered voters said
they planned to vote for Bill Clinton, 33 percent for Bob Dole, and
8 percent for Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll one week before the election showed
Clinton at 51 percent, Dole 34 percent, and Perot 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Reuters daily tracking poll conducted by John Zogby Group
International, released Oct. 31, showed Clinton with 41.9 percent,
Dole 34.2 percent, and Perot 8.6 percent. ``Undecideds'' and the
margin of error accounted for the remaining percentages.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nov. 5 election, Clinton got about 49.2 percent of the
votes (45,628,667); Dole, about 40.8 percent (37,869,435); and
Perot, about 8.5 percent (7,874,283).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently mentioned the long bridge over the Atchafalaya
River in Louisiana. I was told by my fourth-grade teacher in the
1930s that the Atchafalaya was the deepest river in the world. Is
that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a widespread belief among Louisianians that the
Atchafalaya is the world's deepest river, but Marc Wellman of the
State Library of Louisiana in Baton Rouge said it's probably not
true. He traced this belief to the fact that engineers building the
U.S. 190 bridge over the Atchafalaya at Morgan City had to rest one
of the piers on a foundation 176 feet below the low-water stage.
</P>
<P>
   Basing his conclusion on several resources, including NASA,
Wellman said he thinks China's Yangtze is the world's deepest
river. As NASA reports, upstream of the Dongting Swamp, the Yangtze
flows through three gorges: Qutang, Wu and Xiling.
</P>
<P>
   The river narrows abruptly in these gorges. Because the great
discharge must be conveyed through narrow cross sections, the flow
depths become enormous, at one point reaching 150 meters (just over
492 feet).

   BLACK-JUDGES (San Francisco) _ When U.S. District Judge Thelton
Henderson entered law school in 1959, there was only one African
American federal court judge in the country. Today, there are about
150 black federal judges, and they will gather here on Thursday to
celebrate the strides that have been made and discuss further
progress they'd like to see. By VENISE WANGER.

   FOLK-MEDICINE (San Antonio) _ Behind the counter at Casa
Mireles, rows of small white drawers used to store dried herbs are
neatly labeled in black marker with mysterious-sounding Spanish
names. For decades, customers have been going to the botanica
seeking the ingredients for herbal remedies that are part of the
traditional Mexican folk medicine called curanderismo. Why do these
treatments persist in the face of modern medicine. ``Well, because
I think it works. That's why,'' says Ellen Riojas Clark, a
professor in the division of bicultural and bilingual studies at
the University of Texas at San Antonio. By ELDA SILVA.

   FASHION-NYWOMEN5 (New York) _ Showings of spring 2001 women's
wear came to a end in a swirl of girlishness. Even the usually
subtle Calvin Klein could not resist the pull of soft colors and
sheer fabrics. By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN.

   FILM-SALLY-FIELD (Undated) _ After 35 years in show business,
Sally Field knows all about the limitations and expectations placed
on women. For much of her career, Field traded on being cute and
perky; when that ran its course she went for sexy. In 1985, when
she won her second best-actress Oscar, she famously trilled, ``You
like me! You really like me!'' So it's interesting to hear her say
that what attracted her to ``Beautiful,'' the new comedy that Field
chose as her feature directing debut, was that the female lead
character isn't very likable. By ERIC HARRISON.

<P>
   Q: Whose voice is it singing ``If you're happy and you know it .
. .'' on the Home Depot commercials for the Olympic Games?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, we struck out. The only information available is that
she's ``a young lady from the Midwest'' who wants to remain
anonymous, said Home Depot spokeswoman Mandy Holton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Georgia Farmers and Consumers Market Bulletin reports
that the National Park Service will open the Jimmy Carter boyhood
farm on Nov. 17. Did the government buy this farm from the Carter
family? If so, what was the price?
</P>
<P>
   A: The farm was sold by the Carter family in 1948, said Paul
Winegar of the National Park Service. The NPS bought it from the
heirs of the people who purchased it from the Carters, he added,
paying ``in the range of $65,000.''
</P>
<P>
   When it opens, visitors will be able to see the restored house
where President Carter lived as a child; his father's store; and
some of the barns and outbuildings, reconstructed to look exactly
as they did when Carter was a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Florida has stopped auto emission inspections. Why has the
EPA permitted this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Florida cleaned up its air, that's why. The emissions testing
program began in 1991 in Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, Duval,
Pinellas and Hillsborough counties after the Environmental
Protection Agency determined the air there violated the Clean Air
Act. For various reasons _ federal rules requiring cleaner fuels,
cars with more efficient engines, successful work on failing
vehicles to bring them up to standard _ the state's air quality
improved dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state and the EPA reached settlements with
Tampa Electric Co. to reduce nitrogen oxide discharges, eliminating
40 times more pollution than the vehicle testing program.

   Q: In hurricane-naming, what letter of the alphabet is the
farthest ever reached, and what was the name? In other words, has
there ever been a Hurricane Zeus? We can't recall ever going beyond
O for Opal.
</P>
<P>
   A: Under the modern naming scheme, which in 1978 began using
alternating male and female names, the farthest letter reached was
T for Tanya in 1995, said Frank Lepore of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami. There were 19 named storms that year, the second
most active year on record after 1933, when 21 storms occurred
(they were numbered back then, not named).
</P>
<P>
   In no case could there be a Hurricane Zeus, anyway, since the
letters Q, U, X, Y and Z aren't used for storm names.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons, Lepore explained. There aren't enough
names beginning with those letters to allow spares, in case the
name of a storm is retired because of the number of deaths or
amount of damage it produced. And the names must be understandable
in Spanish, French and Dutch. Weather officials wouldn't want the
misprounciation of a name to produce something incorrect or
offensive, for example when garbled in transmission.
</P>
<P>
   In the event that so many storms occur in a year that the World
Meteorological Organization runs through its list, it then would
use the Greek alphabet, Lepore added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Georgia's promotional literature now calls it the Empire
State of the South. I thought Georgia was the Peach State. Can you
clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is nothing new. For years Georgia has had several
unofficial nicknames, including Empire State of the South, because
of its large size and thriving industries. In fact, the Georgia
entry in World Book Encyclopedia has a headline with the name of
the state followed by the wordsThe Empire State of the South in
italics.
</P>
<P>
   Other Georgia nicknames over the years, in addition to Peach
State: Goober State, Cracker State and Yankee-Land of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Charlotte's problems related to big-time
sports mentioned that it had been voted the nation's most livable
city by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Is this survey available
online?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Conference of Mayors doesn't name the most livable
city in America, said its spokesman, Jubi Headley. However, it does
make City Livability Awards honoring outstanding programs in
cities. There's no list available, Headley added, but you can find
information about the awards online at
www.usmayors.org/uscm/home.asp.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans and Gadsden, Ala., were awarded top honors in the
2000 City Livability Awards Program, incidentally.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a lot of talk in my office about the accuracy of
presidential election polls. Do you have the final results of the
major polls just prior to the 1996 election, as well as the actual
election vote totals?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a USA Today/CNN/Gallup tracking poll conducted Oct. 20-21,
1996, and reported Oct. 23, 52 percent of registered voters said
they planned to vote for Bill Clinton, 33 percent for Bob Dole, and
8 percent for Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll one week before the election showed
Clinton at 51 percent, Dole 34 percent, and Perot 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Reuters daily tracking poll conducted by John Zogby Group
International, released Oct. 31, showed Clinton with 41.9 percent,
Dole 34.2 percent, and Perot 8.6 percent. ``Undecideds'' and the
margin of error accounted for the remaining percentages.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nov. 5 election, Clinton got about 49.2 percent of the
votes (45,628,667); Dole, about 40.8 percent (37,869,435); and
Perot, about 8.5 percent (7,874,283).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently mentioned the long bridge over the Atchafalaya
River in Louisiana. I was told by my fourth-grade teacher in the
1930s that the Atchafalaya was the deepest river in the world. Is
that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a widespread belief among Louisianians that the
Atchafalaya is the world's deepest river, but Marc Wellman of the
State Library of Louisiana in Baton Rouge said it's probably not
true. He traced this belief to the fact that engineers building the
U.S. 190 bridge over the Atchafalaya at Morgan City had to rest one
of the piers on a foundation 176 feet below the low-water stage.
</P>
<P>
   Basing his conclusion on several resources, including NASA,
Wellman said he thinks China's Yangtze is the world's deepest
river. As NASA reports, upstream of the Dongting Swamp, the Yangtze
flows through three gorges: Qutang, Wu and Xiling.
</P>
<P>
   The river narrows abruptly in these gorges. Because the great
discharge must be conveyed through narrow cross sections, the flow
depths become enormous, at one point reaching 150 meters (just over
492 feet).

 &HT;    Hum this tune driving downtown
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I almost shot my oatmeal out my nose Sunday morning when I read
in the newspaper that Austin officials have noticed that the
traffic downtown has gotten really bad because of all the lane
closures for construction.
</P>
<P>
   That would be like going to the dump and saying, ``Boy, it sure
smells funny out here.''
</P>
<P>
   What did our leaders expect for Austin, which has progressed
from the Live Music Capital of the World to the Merge Right Capital
of the World?
</P>
<P>
   Because of state law, the 13 telecommunications companies
downtown can keep tearing up streets over and over again to lay
cable, so they can keep up with the competition. The city lobbied
these companies to move downtown. So the streets are constantly dug
up. This comes as a surprise? That's like getting a second dog and
being surprised by an increase in barking.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, driving downtown is a pain in the butt. You've heard
of the University of Texas football mantra, ``Come Early, Be Loud,
Stay Late,'' right? If you're driving in downtown Austin, it's
``Leave Early, Honk Loud, Arrive Late.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a conspiracy. A poll of 500 people done for
KVUE-TV shows 59 percent of likely voters favor light rail, which
Austin will vote on in November. What better way to make light rail
seem great than to make the cruise through the intersection of
Sixth and Lamar a half-hour ordeal?
</P>
<P>
   The traffic in downtown Austin is so bad it inspires me to
compose. This verse is to be sung to the tune of Petula Clark's
``Downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need a place to get in somebody's face,
</P>
<P>
   ``Just go drive downtown _ DOWNTOWN.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else quite like it when it comes to living
urban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to kill the yuppie who is driving that Suburban.
...''
</P>
<P>
   As usual I have solutions to the problem. Why not turn the area
between 11th Street, Cesar Chavez Street, Guadalupe Street and
Interstate 35 into a parking lot? That's what it has become, so why
not collect fees? Even more fun, why not just turn the whole
downtown area into a -- emolition -- erby? The driver of the last
car running gets to pie Mayor Watson. How about solving this mess
the way we handled lawn watering? Drivers who live at addresses
that end with the numbers 1 or 6 would be allowed to drive downtown
on Tuesdays, drivers who live at addresses that end in 2 or 8 could
drive downtown on Wednesdays, and drivers who cut people off when
they get tipped off, because the guy in front of them is using his
directionals would be shipped back to Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might complain that not being able to go downtown
every day is a hardship. That's like carping about not being
allowed to have a permanent rash.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing the city might consider is turning the catastrophe
into an arts project. I get sick of looking at the same old orange
traffic cones, barricades and warning signs. Why does all of this
road trash have to be orange? What with UT, we're lousy with orange
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't we get art classes at Austin's public schools to paint
the orange traffic cones relaxing earth tones, like maybe taupe,
pumpkin and puce? As in, ``The traffic is so bad it makes me want
to puce.''

 &HT;    Reflections on loss of innocence
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene at St. Peter's Church in Huber Heights last week was
eerily familiar.
</P>
<P>
   I had been here once before, it seemed: Hundreds of solemn-faced
Catholic school children, in their plaid uniforms, filing into a
cavernous church. All were solemn; the older ones wore crumpled
faces and visible chinks in their armor of adolescent
invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   All looked as if something had been taken away from them.
</P>
<P>
   They had lost a popular schoolmate, eighth-grader Jesica Young,
she of the ever-present smile and a demeanor that principal Feliza
Poling described as ``always up.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also had suffered a collective loss of innocence, a
belief that murder is something that happened somewhere else, to
someone they didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered what that felt like. On a bleak December day in
1968, I filed into Ascension Church in Kettering with hundreds of
my schoolmates for the funeral Mass of 12-year-old Regina
Duchnowski.
</P>
<P>
   During the agonizing days that the Ascension sixth-grader was
missing, we all prayed desperately for her safe return. Her body
was found in a woods two days later, raped and strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Regina had been a playmate of my younger sister Peggy. ``I
always felt that with Regina's death, I lost my innocence because I
knew then that bad things happened to people,'' Peggy recalled. ``I
always thought it was something our parents would protect us from,
and after it happened to her, things weren't the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the students at St. Peter's , as they clutched
Kleenexes and held onto each other for dear life, I couldn't help
wondering if they felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   School counselor Barbara Campbell has been meeting with anywhere
from 20 to 50 students every day since Tuesday, when Jesica died
from wounds suffered Monday morning in a bludgeoning attack that
also killed her mother, Martha Madewell, and her mother's
boyfriend, Nathan Marshall. ``The big fear that I've picked up on
is that this could happen to them, especially if there's any
parental strife at home,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've also talked about what good could come out of this _
how they can face issues such as their own mortality and the way
that they treat one another.'' The Rev. Earl Simone eulogized that
the tragedy teaches a difficult lesson, that we can't pretend we
are safe from violence and death.
</P>
<P>
   School officials know the funeral Mass is only the beginning of
the healing process, that they must work with the students in the
weeks and months ahead. They know that, at every eighth-grade
milestone, ``it will feel as if we're missing someone,'' Poling
said.
</P>
<P>
   With time and care, these students may recover their faith and
their bond with each other.
</P>
<P>
   But something else _ that intangible assurance that murder is
something that happens somewhere else, to someone you didn't know _
that, they have lost much too soon.

   Unless pornography, music downloads or Olympic coverage is more
destructive than nuclear war, there's little chance that
governments will ever control Internet content.
</P>
<P>
   Consider when Texas lawmakers didn't like an Internet Web site
that sold access to public information. The state sold the same
information on digital tapes to marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Outlawing this specific practice shut down the Texas Web site
only until it reappeared a few days later as a Caribbean island Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet technology has been freed from the bottle. There's
no putting it back.
</P>
<P>
   It can be viewed as an exciting new frontier in communication,
business, entertainment and education. The Internet also can be
regarded as destroyer of cultures, values and established commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the world will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can log onto the Internet and find how to build a bird
house or a car bomb. People can read racist rantings or the Bible
in seven translations.
</P>
<P>
   Dictators and tyrants who sustain absolute control through
propaganda and deceit now must keep their citizens away from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   China's communist leadership is trying to become a first-world
nation wired for the latest technology. At the same time, communist
leaders are trying to hold back the tide by screening out
unfavorable Internet content. Barring an improbable breakthrough,
China's leaders won't be able to do both.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's advancement of democracy is tempered with the
threat to destroy traditional institutions. This worldwide
communication source could level a lot of good along with the bad.
</P>
<P>
   The auction Web site eBay threatens antique businesses around
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Some car manufacturers are considering cutting out car dealers
and selling their products directly to customers on the Internet.
Lawmakers in some states, including Texas, are scrambling to
protect traditional car dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are upset that Wal-Mart and other super stores
have destroyed traditional community businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Customers switched from Mom and Pop businesses to Wal-Mart for
the large selection and discounts offered due to volume buying.
</P>
<P>
   Surely customers would just as quickly abandon Wal-Mart if an
international Internet company offered bigger discounts, greater
selection and convenient 24-hour doorstep delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers will protect traditional business interests up to the
point that dot.com lobbyists give bigger political donations. This
could be a good time for established special interest groups to
support campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee was able to fund the current
27th Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, in large measure by
selling television rights to the games for $1.3 billion. NBC bought
exclusive rights to broadcast the games in the United States for
$705 million. Viewership is down. People can get instant results on
the Internet Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The technology promises to make life even more difficult for
traditional information and entertainment providers in years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Since anyone in the world can become an instant publisher,
editor, reporter and opinion monger, people will have to learn to
distinguish between fact and fiction, if not outright fraud.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult enough for large daily newspapers to get
everything right when it is written, edited and fact-checked by
layers of trained professional journalists.
</P>
<P>
   For good or for evil, there's no turning back.

headlines of the New York Times, in part because Belgium is so in,
especially when it comes to food. The number of Belgian restaurants
in the big apple have jumped from 4 in the early 90s to nearly 20
now. The latest power lunch in Washington is a French/Belgian
bistoro. And Atlanta's first Belgian bistro hit the scene earlier
this year. There's more to the food than waffles and brussel
sprouts. Their twice-fried fries set the standard and mussels are
magnificent. Belgian beers are popping up in bars around, town,
too. w/recipes and sidebar on belgian beer by Bob Townsend.

&HT;     MEXICAN HEALERS FIND CURES IN `YERBAS' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELDA SILVA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Behind the counter at Casa Mireles, a botanica in
downtown San Antonio, rows of small white drawers used to store
dried herbs are neatly labeled in Spanish names, such as yerba en
cruz, golpe, capitana and chocolate del indio.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the drawers are empty, the curative properties of the
herbs once commonly used by curanderos, or folk healers, having
been forgotten over the years, said Yolanda Davila, who runs the
store, founded in 1916 by her grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modern curanderos, they don't know of those yerbas mas
antiguas,'' said Davila, who runs the store with her 90-year-old
mother, Estela Davila. She was referring to the ancient herbs.
</P>
<P>
   But many people, including customers in their 20s, still come to
the botanica seeking the ingredients for remedies they grew up
with, Davila said.
</P>
<P>
   Centuries-old, traditional Mexican folk medicine, or
curanderismo, persists despite modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Riojas Clark, a professor in the division of bicultural
and bilingual studies at the University of Texas at San Antonio,
said her students have done surveys about the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was astonishing to me to see the results that in the year
2000, young people 25 years old know about curanderismo and it's
still practiced,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, because I think it works. That's why,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe it works if you use discretion,'' said Eliseo
Torres, vice president of student affairs at the University of New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, the author of ``Green Medicine: Traditional
Mexican-American Herbal Remedies'' (Nieves Press), is working on
two self-help books tentatively titled ``Heal Yourself Using
Traditional Hispanic Plants'' and ``How to Heal Yourself Using
Ancient Hispanic Rituals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really need medical attention you have to go to see a
physician, but if you look at what other physicians and
practitioners of alternative medicine are saying, it's not any
different than what my grandmother was doing. They use different
language, but it's basically the same concept.''
</P>
<P>
   The basis of curanderismo is that a human being is made up of
three aspects _ the physical, the mental and the spiritual, said
Elizabeth de la Portilla, a lecturer in the division of bilingual
and bicultural studies at the University of Texas at San Antonio
and a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three things are entwined with one another, and in order
for the body to be healthy these three things have to be aligned
and in harmony,'' said de la Portilla, who is studying the work of
Jacinto Madrigal, a San Antonio yerbero, or herbalist, as well as
the work of a curandera known as La Golondrina. ``This belief has
been around since before the Spaniards.''
</P>
<P>
   When one of the three aspects is off kilter, the result can be
sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sick from one's nerves is to be emotionally or mentally
ill,'' de la Portilla said. ``But because curanderismo talks about
the body as a unit aligned spiritually and mentally, being sick
from a nervous condition is a physical ailment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the traditional treatments involve rubbing the body with
aromatic herbs while reciting prayers.
</P>
<P>
   For Jacinto Madrigal, help for ailments comes in the form of the
herbs and plants he cultivates in the back yard of his San Antonio
home. Born in Mexico, Madrigal grew up with the use of herbs for
healing. His grandmother's yard was full of medicinal herbs,
Madrigal said, speaking in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he has augmented his knowledge of herbal
medicine through study. After having a series of heart attacks in
1993, Madrigal began doing research to find out what herbs would be
beneficial for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to take so much medicine from doctors,'' Madrigal
said. ``They give out too many kinds of pills. For the most part,
doctors' medications are good, but the chemistry is so strong that
if they improve one illness, they cause another.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired from construction work, Madrigal sells the plants he
grows at a flea market. Of the plants he sells, the most sought
after are ruda (or rue), romero (or rosemary) and albacar (or
basil). To ward off bad energy, a person should plant all three in
their front yard, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Each person has an aura, or electrical field, surrounding the
body that can be damaged by bad energy, Madrigal said. Aromatic
plants can help restore the aura.
</P>
<P>
   The scent of the plant is important because the scent is the
``spirit that comes out of the plant, the energy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers also come seeking basil, believed to be good for
stomach aches, insomnia and calming the nerves when consumed as a
tea. Anise is also sought for its calming effect.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using plants in traditional ways, Madrigal
combines complementary herbs and plants to maximize their affect.
He has developed a tea using 14 different types of plants; he said
it is good for treating diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does `r and d' _ research and development _ in the
barrio,'' de la Portilla said of Madrigal's work. ``It's
innovative. It's smart, and it's creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnobotanists go looking in the rain forest for medicinal
plants, de la Portilla said, ``and we should be looking closer to
home.''

   Olympic stories from The New York Times News Service for
Thursday, Sept. 28:
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BASEBALL (Sydney, Australia) _ In a shocking upset, a U.S.
team made up of top prospects, lower-level minor-leaguers and a
former major-leaguer or two shut out Cuba, 4-0, to win the gold
medal. By William C. Rhoden.

   OLY-WRESTLING (Sydney, Australia) _ In perhaps the greatest
Olympic wrestling upset ever, Rulon Gardner of the United States, a

ending the Russian's string of three straight gold medals. By
Richard Sandomir.

</P>
<P>
   OLY-VECSEY-COLUMN (Sydney, Australia) _ Regarding that form of
drug known as ``performance-enhancing,'' there is only one claim
George Vecsey says he would definitely believe from any athlete:
``Personally, Chief, I slurp 'em up like Corn Flakes. I can't wait
to finish talking to you so I can go get me some more.'' That
person I would believe. Sports column. By George Vecsey.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BKO-RUSSIA (Sydney, Australia) _ To a former Russian
basketball coach who has seen it all, these are not good days. The
Americans, he says, are simply too skilled and strong for the
Russians to keep pace. By Mike Wise.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-AUSSIE-TOWN (Lithgow, Australia) _ Lithgow, population
15,000, lies at the end of the electrified railroad line from
Sydney, 90 miles to the west. It is not the sort of place the
writer Donald Horne was thinking of when he famously described
Australia as ``the lucky country.'' Remote, economically depressed,
and cursed with dreadful weather, Lithgow is worlds away from the
designer skyscrapers and sun-splashed beaches of Sydney. On a
recent weekday afternoon, a few cars rattled along Main Street,
barely outracing the fog that drifted down from the nearby
mountains. And yet, for all its hard-luck veneer, Lithgow is as
proud, as captivated, and as unabashedly excited about the Olympics
as Sydney. By Mark Landler.

   OLY-TEN-ARATON-COLUMN (Sydney, Australia) _ Sports column on the
Australian favorites in the men's doubles tennis final, the
Woodies, Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge, who ended a
distinguished doubles career together with a silver medal before
their home crowd. By Harvey Araton.

   OLY-RUN-TRACK (Sydney, Australia) _ As Marion Jones progresses
in her attempt for five medals, Gail Devers misses her chance for a

muscle. By Jere Longman.

   OLY-BOX (Sydney, Australia) _ They come from Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, the Ukraine and Russia, burly, hard-looking
men who fight with a relentless, intractable boxing style. On the
12th day of the 2000 Olympic boxing tournament, it was the fighters
from the countries formed by the breakup of the Soviet Union that
imposed a new pecking order on the competition. The once invincible
Cuban boxers lost four consecutive quarterfinal bouts and the
Americans got back in the medal hunt with three fighters _ Ricardo
Juarez, Ricardo Williams Jr., and Jermain Taylor _ advancing. By
Bill Pennington.

GERMAN TEAM PREVAILS IN CYCLING ROAD RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Everything went according to plan for Lance
Armstrong and his U.S. teammates in the Olympic cycling road race
Wednesday. The problem was that things went even better for the
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Ullrich won the race by nine seconds from Alexander
Vinokourov of Kazakhstan, with Andreas Kloeden of Germany three
seconds further back. Michele Bartoli of Italy led in a 10-man
chasing group 1 minute 26 seconds behind Ullrich. Two Americans,
George Hincapie and Armstrong, were in the group.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich completed the 239.4 kilometer (148.8 mile) race in 5
hours 29.08 for an average speed of 27 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The riders completed 14 laps of an undulating course that
stitched together the parklands, golf courses and race courses of
central Sydney before sweeping out through the city's eastern
suburbs and offering the riders a brief glimpse of the Pacific
Ocean at Bronte Beach. On a clear day, the roofless blue sky held
only four buzzing television helicopters and the heady scent of
eucalyptus.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators were sparse in the parks but crowded against the
barriers along the finish line and on the brief slopes at the
beach. The temperature reached 82 degrees Fahrenheit during the
closing laps, not ideal conditions for Armstrong, who often thrives
in the rain and chill _ conditions that bedeviled the women's race
the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   The three medalists were part of a much larger breakaway. Midway
through the 13th lap, Ullrich attacked because, he said, the big
group was not working ``in harmony.'' Only Vinokourov and Kloeden
went with him.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vinokourov had a different colored shirt on his back,
all three men wore identical white and pink helmets, the colors of
their professional team, Deutsche Telekom. Vinokourov completed his
Olympic training with the German team in Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   The three men worked in harmony, quickly pulling away from a
disjointed pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The American strategy, said Armstrong, had been to place a rider
in the leading bunch. Then Armstrong would try to jump across late
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go too hard or crash and hurt myself,''
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie caught the big break as the three Telekom riders
escaped and did not realize what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw George I asked him if there was anyone away,''
Armstrong said. ``He said no. I said: `Two guys in the gold medal
group. Sweet!' Then on the last lap I saw the giant video screen. I
saw three guys cycling. I said, `George, who's that?' He said,
`Shoot!'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ullrich won the Tour de France in 1997 at the age of 23. Since
then he has struggled with his weight, starting every season with
more tires round his waist than on his bike, and he has only run
into his best form late in the year. He raced at 154 pounds, almost
7 fewer pounds than at the start of this year's Tour when he
finished a distant second to Armstrong. On the final lap he was so
strong that several times he had to slow and wait for his two
partners. With about two miles to go he finally abandoned them,
powering away to a comfortable victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich's 1997 Tour victory was based on overpowering time
trialing. He finished last season by winning the time trial in the
world championships. His form Wednesday suggests that he will be a
serious threat to Armstrong, the dominant time trialer in this
year's Tour, in Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard to beat him,'' Armstrong said. ``I
really like Jan. There's a mix of anticipation for Saturday with
happiness for Jan. He's a great guy. He deserves to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the tricky time trial course, full of tight
corners, will favor Armstrong over the powerful Ullrich. The
American, who missed the 1997 Tour recovering from testicular
cancer and who cracked a vertebra when he was knocked off his bike
by a car when training near Nice, France, in August, said that he
felt good physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs felt good today, better than I expected,'' Armstrong
said. ``I didn't really train for this race.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was confident of winning a medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``First three definitely,'' Armstrong said. ``Gold will be very
difficult. It will be a real battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ullrich had worked hard for his victory, he was relaxed
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already got my gold medal,'' he said. ``Lance has to go
for his.'' &QL;

VENUS WILLIAMS EXTENDS DOMINANCE TO THE GOLD MEDAL STAND

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The way Venus Williams dominated Elena
Dementieva with her sling-blade strokes was expected, as was her
customary parade queen's wave to the crowd upon match point, as was
her giddy acceptance of the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   But when the national anthem hit a crescendo Wednesday
afternoon, the statuesque Williams stood at the top of the medal
stand and wiped a tear from her eye. Usually, Williams' rawest
emotions remain hidden beneath her veil of confidence. Wednesday,
she allowed the moment to overwhelm her and appeared humbled by the
Olympic experience.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good look for Williams. Upon her 32nd straight victory
Wednesday, she discarded the superior attitude that has often
marked her post-match personality. After receiving the gold medal,
she praised her Russian opponent's resilience and complimented her
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much more meaningful than I thought,'' said Williams
after wearing down Dementieva, 6-2, 6-4, in the gold-medal match at
the tennis center. ``I felt really emotional. I felt really
excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just really one moment in time, because you see it on
TV, how the competitor bows their head, and they put the medal on.
It was really great. It was me.''
</P>
<P>
   This moment is one reason why she ignored the exhaustion created
by her packed summer schedule. When she arrived in Sydney, she was
tired, but quickly bounced back. She embraced the spectacle of the
opening ceremony, met other athletes during Olympic pin exchanges
and found a little kick of adrenaline as her matches came along.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the only noticeable dip in her enthusiasm registered
when she discussed the injury to her teammate and former gold
medalist from the 1996 team, Lindsay Davenport. The animosity that
grew between the two at the U.S. Open has disappeared. As much as
anyone, Williams did not want to see Davenport go down during the
first week of the Games. If Davenport had been healthy, she might
have joined Williams and the bronze medalist Monica Seles in a U.S.
sweep on the medal stand Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potentially, we could have all been on the stand _ in any
order,'' said Williams, whose most difficult match along her route
to the final was her three-set victory against Seles. ``I was
fortunate enough to get the gold, but Monica could have won the
match she played against me the other day. She could have won the
gold. One of my only regrets is that Lindsay wasn't here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Venus was _ and then some. Everyone in the crowd received an
up-close look at the one player who has dominated as a solo act
this summer. Just after tucking away a shaky third try at a match
point, Williams took a detour to the players' box. From the U.S.
coaches Billie Jean King and Zina Garrison, she grabbed an American
flag in one hand and held her racket in the other. It was an
ambidextrous celebration for the ubiquitous Williams. For an entire
summer, she has been everywhere, equally dominant on different
continents and under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Venus and Serena Williams will play for the gold
medal in doubles. But soon, the summer will end for Venus Williams.
And fall classes will begin. Although she will play some select
tournaments, Williams will enroll in a fashion design class. And if
a teacher or classmate should ask, ``So, what did you do last
summer?'', she can present the show-and-tell of all time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She has a Wimbledon winner's plate and a U.S. Open trophy. The
only thing she didn't take was the No. 1 ranking. Injured for six
months of the season, Williams couldn't catch the consistent
Martina Hingis, who still owns the top ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Venus, she's the more stronger,'' said Dementieva.
``But Hingis plays much better than her.''
</P>
<P>
   That's up for debate. Next year, the intrigue will begin. Can
the clever Hingis finally decode Williams' strength. Will Serena
Williams become her sister's major test? This summer, Venus
Williams had only one opponent to fear: herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I can get a little crazy,'' Williams said. ``I can
make a lot of mistakes and play badly. So sometimes, I'm scared for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, her victory wasn't about herself. When she won,
humility joined her in the medal ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the Wimbledons and the Grand Slams, you have so
many opportunities,'' Williams said. ``But this gold is just every
four years. Who knows, in 2004, I might not be chosen. You never
know what is going to happen. So this is the one moment for me, for
my country, for my family, for the team.''  &QL;

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: FINAL CHAPTER FOR A PAIR OF WOODIES
</HEADLINE>
 By HARVEY ARATON   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ They have been known as the Woodies, the
Australian doubles of doubles, though they look nothing alike,
hardly play alike and have based themselves on opposite coasts of
the United States. They formed a partnership 10 years ago, when
Mark Woodforde was 25 and Todd Woodbridge was turning 20. Sixty-one
tournament titles, 11 of them Grand Slams, and one Olympic gold
medal later, they walked on the court here Wednesday afternoon to
thunderous applause, the final chapter to a storybook all but set
in print.
</P>
<P>
   Woodforde, the red-haired southpaw, had planned or fantasized it
this way, the gold medal match on Australian soil. He was tired of
the grind, the road, the raw-boned teenagers with the hunger in
their eyes. He and his American-born wife were expecting a baby
after New Year's. He had to tell Woodbridge, the brown-haired
right-hander, that he was coming to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it, he had said one night, as they picked at dinner,
as the red wine flowed. He, Woodbridge, had been around long enough
to have played championship doubles with Martina Navratilova, with
John McEnroe, who faded off the circuit as the 1980s closed and
left Woodforde looking for a second. He had preferred a
right-hander, a more natural complement, and an Australian, a more
desirable companion.
</P>
<P>
   Had they been best friends? Hard to say, they said. Difficult to
define the relationship because it wasn't as if they went on golf
holidays, or sightseeing tours. It was enough to spend years
jetting to distant outposts and urban centers, practicing on the
side courts, playing the matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stepped off the court,'' Woodforde said, ``you tended
to separate.''
</P>
<P>
   They had had a substandard year in 1999, and started to hear
people imply that their formula for success, whatever it was, no
longer worked. They were proud of their record, of being part of
the great Australian tennis history, of being the Woodies. They
rededicated themselves for one more run, one last emotional ride,
all the way to the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Woodforde broke down after they won the French Open, the one
elusive Grand Slam, last June. When they carried the momentum on to
London and won Wimbledon for a sixth time, he went back to the
hotel and sobbed some more. He said he was all cried out by the
time Wednesday's gold medal match against Canada's Daniel Nestor
and Sebastien Lareau came around because it just felt right, for
both players, when they really thought about how far they had gone,
how they now could finish at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told someone before we went on court that today was going to
be good or really great,'' Woodbridge said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, they both had pregnant wives watching from the
stands. They had a crowd of about 10,000, mostly Australians who
truly believed that Venus Williams' victory in the women's gold
medal match over Elena Dementieva was the junior varsity game. They
sang ``Waltzing Matilda'' and swayed to a mantra of ``Aus-sies ...
Aus-sies.'' They chanted ``Let's Go Woodies,'' and sang, ``If you
really love the Woodies clap your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone loved their chances for gold after they won the first
set, breaking Lareau's serve three times. But the late afternoon
clouds rolled in, and as the day turned gray, the crowd's energy
level took a precipitous drop. Three-of-five-set doubles does not
create the climactic surge of, say, Cathy Freeman start-to-finish
in the 400 meters. It didn't help when the underdog Canadians took
the second set and began to look like the snappier team.
</P>
<P>
   Lareau had raised his level after the first set while Nestor, a
lanky left-hander, was playing so well, better than the Woodies had
ever seen him, it occurred to Woodbridge that Nestor might be a
potential partner if his oral agreement doesn't work out with the
Swede, Jonas Bjorkman. The Canadians took the third set, forced a
fourth-set tiebreaker and didn't even have to strike a gold-medal
clinching shot. Woodbridge double-faulted on match point, putting
the punctuation on the 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6(2) defeat and one of the
best doubles teams in the history of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged in the service box, before going to the net.
Woodforde didn't cry this time. His wife, Erin, did, but that was
when her husband was stepping up to the medal stand to have the
silver slipped around his neck, and again when the Woodies walked
off to one last ovation, arms around each other's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   As they say here, they'd given it a go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't change what the results were, what our legacy
is,'' said Woodforde, the good Aussie, the gracious loser. ``Our
partnership will always be gold.''
</P>
<P>
   He is committed to play the Davis Cup final in Spain, without
Woodbridge, who was not selected for the team. Woodforde sighed and
said, ``I kind of wish today was my last match, with Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodbridge was the more emotional one this time, wiping away
tears and saying he was just happy that the Woodies had played
their last match together in Australia, at the Olympics, and not
``some small tournament in some remote corner of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was home, where the heart is, where Geoff Pollard of Tennis
Australia could appear at their news conference to thank them for a
decade of success, for their 1996 gold medal in Atlanta and for
silver this last time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have become icons in Australian sport and deservedly so,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, mate,'' a blushing Mark Woodforde said. ``Thanks.'' &QL;

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: News, notes from the wrestling industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big news this week is the World Wrestling Federation's move
to The Nashville Network.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's ``Raw is War'' made its debut on TNN and the
television ratings did not waver much.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's 5.9, this week's 5.4 is pretty strong for the
jump from USA Network, which had been the Monday night home for the
WWF for five years.
</P>
<P>
   World Championship Wrestling's ``Nitro'' show had slightly
higher (2.9 compared to 2.8) ratings as a result of the change and
a strong show. The return of Lex Luger and Ric Flair, along with a
Goldberg-Scott Steiner cage match were strong draws, but could not
keep the WCW rating from dipping nearly one whole ratings point
from the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. time slot.
</P>
<P>
   WWF's ``Raw'' debut was also strong with the major return of
``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin and a pay-per-view quality ladder match
between Edge and Christian and the Hardy Boyz.
</P>
<P>
   _ WCW star Kevin Nash will be taking a break from in-ring
wrestling for a few weeks to rehabilitate his injured knee. He was
scheduled to have surgery after ``Fall Brawl,'' but he will rest
for a few weeks and continue as the coach for the Natural Born
Thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   _ A return of the ECW Triple Threat of Tazz, Raven and Saturn
could be in the works for the WWF. Raven's move to the WWF allows
for the three ECW stars to finally get a foothold on the WWF turf.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exiled WWF star Mark Henry may return from a stint in the WWF
minors as soon as the ``Survivor Series.'' Henry has been working
on losing weight in an attempt to improve his in-ring movements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another WWF star who is working on the fat farm is the Big
Show. It was hoped he would return soon as the man who ran over
Austin, but it doesn't look like he can stay away from the dinner
table long enough to shed a few pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Billy Gunn was not backstage at either ``Unforgiven'' or
``Raw'' and his return may be delayed as he recovers from rotator
cuff surgery.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush is redrawing key elements of his
political strategy and is betting millions of dollars that he can
win a quintet of states that have popular Republican governors, who
in turn have been given a much larger role in deciding how to spend
campaign money, Bush associates said.
</P>
<P>
   One result of this strategy is that Bush is spending far less
money in California, New Jersey, and Illinois than he originally
planned and is diverting much of the cash to Florida, Ohio, and
Michigan. Bush originally had hoped to have a lock on Florida,
where his brother is governor, but Gore is running strong and also
spending heavily in that state, forcing a significant shift in
Bush's financial strategy.
</P>
<P>
   After days of deliberations _ much of it on how much to invest
in California _ the Bush campaign has tentatively determined that
the best chance of winning the presidency is to focus increasingly
on five battleground states with popular Republican governors. They
are Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan, Bush
associates said.
</P>
<P>
   The redrawn strategy is important not just because of a
reallocation of dollars, but also because it has given much more
influence to some of the governors who led the way in backing Bush
for president early last year. A number of Bush campaign and
Republican sources said some of the governors had felt they weren't
being given enough prominence in the campaign, especially as Bush's
poll numbers began to slide. Throughout this month, several of the
governors have called Bush or his aides and asked for a bigger say
and a larger chunk of advertising money _ and have gotten what they
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been coming in the last two weeks,'' Wisconsin
Governor Tommy Thompson said in an interview. ``We are now very
much at the forefront and we are going to be used more effectively.
We've always had a role, but we are just much more energized
because we know our states are on the bubble and we've got to carry
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that Bush's father, President Bush, won in 1988
when he relied on the governors, but lost in 1992, when ``he didn't
use us as effectively.'' Now, Thompson said, Governor Bush is
turning to the governors, too.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bob Taft of Ohio, while emphasizing that Bush has
always focused strongly on his state, said in an interview that he
became more assertive this month as Bush's poll numbers sagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the Bush campaign in Ohio has never faltered,''
Taft said. ``But there is a recognition that there was a lull in
the progress of the campaign. In response to that, they intensified
their efforts to communicate with folks on the ground and listen to
our issues and our concern and just consult with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Taft said, ``there is a closer coordination between those
of us on the ground, which we think is a positive development. They
were not neglecting us, but now it is more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to say this is a tight race and execution
matters,'' said Governor John Engler of Michigan, who is providing
the Bush campaign with specific suggestions on where to spend
advertising dollars in his state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials insist for the record that California is
still in play, and Bush himself visited the state Saturday. But
some aides said privately that they believe it is too risky to
spend the $10 million or more that is needed to run a competitive
race there, especially when that money could make a big difference
in states where Bush has a much better chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, meanwhile, is so confident that it will win
California that it has no plans to revisit the state in the next
two weeks and has made no commitments for the remainder of the
campaign, a spokesman said. Analysts said neither campaign is
spending a significant amount of money in California despite the
mother lode of 54 electoral votes, the largest of any state. The
second and third largest states are also widely considered out of
contention, with Bush expected to win his home state of Texas and
Gore expected to take New York. By many estimations, the campaign
could be decided in the fourth-largest state, Florida, where Bush's
brother, Jeb, is governor. The Bush campaign earlier this year
thought it had Florida wrapped up, but in the last month it has
become so concerned that it has poured $2.8 million in the state,
more than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Charles Cook said that the reversal of Bush's
fortunes in the polls since the Democratic convention has prompted
a dramatic reordering of financial priorities in the Republican
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a state-by-state budget on where Bush and Gore are
planning on spending their money a month ago compared to where they
will spend it in the next month, it is a very different list,''
Cook said. ``For example, Bush is lightening up on California and
going heavy in Florida. Gore is potentially lightening up on
Pennsylvania and Illinois and going heavy in Florida and Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Cook said, is that tables were turned on Bush
through much of September. Bush originally hoped to spend heavily
in California and force Gore to do the same. Instead, little
spending is occurring in California and Gore is forcing Bush to dig
deep in Florida, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   While the campaigns don't release state-by-state spending
figures, various sources who have analyzed Bush's spending said the
Bush campaign in the last month has spent about $2.8 million in
Florida, more than any other state. The next closest was $2.6
million in Pennsylvania, $2.1 million in Michigan, and $2 million
in Ohio. A Gore campaign official said the vice president has spent
slightly lower amounts in most of those states.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Bush associate, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the emergence of Florida as a hotly contested state has forced
the campaign to rethink its national strategy _ and plan for the
possibility that Bush could lose the Sunshine State. If Bush loses
Florida, the campaign believes it must win some smaller states that
initially were slated to receive little emphasis, including Maine,
New Hampshire, Vermont, New Mexico, Arkansas, West Virginia, and
Oregon, the Bush associate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the surprise state is
Florida, you have to be honest about that,'' the Bush associate
said. As a result, the Bush campaign has increased Bush's travel
and spending in those smaller states to make up for possible
Florida loss _ but also continue to spend heavily in Florida. Gore,
in turn, has increased his emphasis on Florida and the group of
smaller states.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the race is extraordinarily tight. In his widely
watched electoral college analysis, Cook reported that Gore is
ahead in states with 231 electoral votes, while Bush is ahead in
states with 179, with another 128 electoral votes in 11 tossup
states. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to become president.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's analysis also show that three states initially targeted
by Bush are now either leaning or clearly in Gore's favor: New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. Of the three, Bush is most
strongly contesting Pennyslvania, where the most recent statewide
poll is within the margin or error.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a new emphasis on the Republican governors is not
necessarily a sure-win strategy. During the primaries, Bush relied
heavily on Governor John Engler to run the Michigan campaign. But
Engler underestimated the amount of independent and Democratic
support that GOP candidate John McCain would get and Bush lost the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The general election will be different, Engler said. ``This
time, we have McCain working with us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is Bush's strategic emphasis more clear than in
Pennsylvania, a state that Bush's father lost in 1992. Governor
Bush is appearing there at least weekly and is likely to spend far
more money there any previous Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In previous races, the Republicans have pretty much looked the
other way from the Midwest to the Northeast,'' Pennsylvania
Governor Thomas Ridge said in an interview. ``I told Bush I believe
he can win here, but it will require a lot of time and money.'' So
far, Ridge noted, Bush has spent both in Pennsylvania, and the pace
continues to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, like the other governors interviewed for this story, said
that the campaign did not expect Gore's resurgence and has relied
on governors to help right the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a very cumbersome, difficult time,'' Ridge said of
Bush's slump earlier this month. ``But I think that at the end of
the day if you distill it down to key states, he has 30 Republican
governor friends. That is one of the things that is unique about
this campaign is that governors are given a lead role within their
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign believes its refocused strategy is paying off,
with Bush drawing even in the polls with Gore this week. But Bush
has spent heavily to make up that polling deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign has raised $177 million, including a recent $68
million check from the federal government for the general election
campaign. Gore, by comparison, has raised much less money, $126
million including the identical $68 million check from the federal
government. But while Gore lags far behind in fund-raising, he has
been spent his money much more frugally than Bush. As a result,
Gore actually has more cash on hand, $66 million compared to Bush's
$56 million.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why some Republican governors in crucial
Eastern and Midwestern states are reluctant to see Bush dump more
millions of dollars into states such as California, Illinois, and
New Jersey, where Bush faces uphill battles.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush can make up for his campaign shortfall because he will
benefit from the Republican Party's advantage over the Democratic
Party in fund-raising. Both parties are using unregulated ``soft
money'' _ raised in part by Bush and Gore _ to run
``party-building'' television ads that look remarkably similar to
campaign commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP says it has $63 million in cash on hand, although
Democratic officials say the Republican figure should be closer to
$40 million. The Democratic National Committee won't say how much
cash it has on hand, but one knowledgeable source put the figure at
around $20 million. The numbers are changing daily with so many
fund-raisers occuring, but the Republicans are expected to have
more substantially more cash on hand in the next two months than
the Democrats. In any case, the campaigns and parties will both
have tens of millions of dollars to spend on advertisements in key
states in the closing days.

REBEL RANSOM MONEY FLOATS PHILIPPINE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines _ In one of the poorest parts of the
southern Philippines, where incomes average just $200 a year,
expensive, high-powered guns and speedboats suddenly materialized
in subsistence fishing villages, and here in the closest big city,
demand surged for motorcycles, gold jewelry, name-brand athletic
wear, and designer sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   The local economy was so awash in American greenbacks recently
that the floundering Philippine peso actually strengthened against
the dollar in local banks.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden bonanza? It was payday for a band of Muslim
rebels called the Abu Sayyaf, who over several weeks raked in more
than $15 million in ransom for dozens of foreigners and Filipinos
they had taken hostage over the last five months. The kidnappings
created a chain of jobs, from ``spotters'' who scoped out victims
to ``couriers'' who snatched them, from villagers who guarded
hostages to local women who cooked for them _ with each group
awaiting its cut. Even the influx of journalists, diplomats, and
negotiators meant a bustling business for local translators,
drivers, hotels, and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how bad things are here in Mindanao, a region
where half the population lives in abject poverty and the average
person has six years of schooling, that kidnapping as a local
industry jump-started the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it was not the kind of public works program
the government had in mind. Fed up with months of negotiations and
under-the-table payments that emboldened the rebels to take new
hostages, the military attacked rebel bases on nearby Jolo Island
11 days ago. So far, however, the military has been unable to
rescue 17 remaining hostages or capture the rebel leaders, though
officials say the troops have killed more than 100 militants, out
of an estimated few thousand.
</P>
<P>
   But even if government troops manage to wipe out the Abu Sayyaf
entirely, it will almost be beside the point. A Muslim rebellion
has raged in the southern Philippines for 30 years, claiming
120,000 to 200,000 lives and stalling economic growth. Muslim
leaders say unless the underlying causes of the revolt are
addressed _ poverty, lack of education, and perceived
discrimination _ new militants will simply fill the shoes of the
Abu Sayyaf, and one of Asia's most persistent and bloody
insurgencies will drag on for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military campaign is a waste of time. It'll never solve
the problem,'' said Shariff Julabbi, a leader of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, the largest group of Muslim separatists. ``The
problem is lack of jobs, lack of development, injustice,
exploitation. . . . The government has to address the roots of the
problem, and that means restoring our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab traders and missionaries brought Islam to the islands that
are now the southern Philippines more than 600 years ago, and it
soon became the dominant religion. Ever since, the Muslim tribes of
Mindanao resisted would-be colonizers, fending off the Spaniards
and battling the Americans until the United States integrated the
region into an independent Philippines in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Muslims represent 5 to 8 percent of the Catholic-majority
country, and many still don't consider themselves Filipino. The
provinces in which they live _ including the two strongholds of the
Abu Sayyaf _ are among the nation's poorest. Mindanao supplies 43
percent of the country's food and is rich in minerals, but its
infrastructure and transport are among the worst in the country,
there is little industry, and even potable water is scarce in rural
areas. Community leaders complain that Manila has neglected the
south, focusing more on killing off the rebels than on boosting
living standards.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim politicians say that neglect extends to the halls of
power: there are no Muslim Cabinet members, only three Muslims
among the Filipino ambassadors to 54 Islamic nations, and just 9
Muslim members in the 230-member House of Representatives, said
Congressman Asani S. Tammang of Sulu province, the main stronghold
of the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims, he said, are regarded by most Christians as
untrustworthy and lazy, and anyone who lives in rebel areas is
branded a sympathizer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bias is subtle. ``If a Christian commits a crime,
only his name is identified in the paper. But if the offender is
Muslim, the report will specify he is a Muslim,'' he said. Even the
local jail here classifies detainees as Muslims and non-Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tammang says anti-bias statutes and aid programs alone
cannot improve life for Muslims here. Law and order must be
established before economic development can take hold, and that is
why he supports the military campaign to wipe out the Abu Sayyaf.
There is also a more insidious problem: a lawless gun culture, and
a practically non-existent criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Sulu has three regional trial courts, four municipal circuit
courts and one municipal trial court _ but no judges willing to
preside, complained Tammang, a former lawyer. Frustrated citizens
``take the law into their own hands. And without peace and order,
we can't introduce more livelihood programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Taluksangay, 11 miles east of Zamboanga, is one of the
better-off Muslim villages, but even here, says village secretary
Saleh Buhaini, the local seaweed farmers and subsistence fishermen
earn an average of $150 a month.
</P>
<P>
   A dirt road leads to the village square, past the oldest mosque
on the Zamboanga peninsula and a single basketball court, the only
recreational facility for young people. There is a bare-bones
clinic, a one-room daycare center, an elementary school, and a
two-story high school, putting Taluksangay's facilities light years
ahead of those on more remote islands.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even here, 70 percent of the population is illiterate, there
is no dentist or hospital, and a large proportion of villagers live
in single-room wooden shacks on stilts at the water's edge, without
electricity or furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Hajara Jailani, a 50-something unschooled widow who earns
between 25 and 50 cents a day fishing from a small wooden canoe,
laments the ``very big gap (in living standards) between Christians
and us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have land to grow produce. We have only the sea. They are
more educated, they have technical know-how, they are more
advanced,'' she said wistfully. But like many of her neighbors _
and unlike many rebel leaders and politicians who blame Manila for
the poor conditions _ she concludes that ``it's our own fault. We
have not strived very much or tried to educate our people.''
</P>
<P>
   The two village schools are less than 200 yards away from the
cluster of shacks where she lives among a tribe of Muslim sea
gypsies, but only about 10 of their 400 children attend school.
</P>
<P>
   Buhaini encourages villagers to send their kids to school, but
it is an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   There are some, however, for whom is already too late. Salihin
Mahamud, 31, is an elementary school drop-out who earns $33 a month
as a seaweed farmer _ not nearly enough for his wife and five
children. He not only understands why the Abu Sayyaf resorted to
kidnapping to bankroll their revolution, but confides he has
considered joining them himself, ``because I have no other
good-paying work.''

DUE PROCESS LOSES OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court rewarded Brandeis
University this week for having crafted a student disciplinary
procedure that is so vague that its commitment to basic fairness
cannot legally be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling that is certain to have repercussions in this
college-rich Commonwealth, a sharply divided court held that a
student accused of misconduct has no right to due process unless
the university administration explicitly guarantees it.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for an extracurricular education in justice?
</P>
<P>
   By a 3-2 vote, the state's highest court dismissed a student's
complaint that he had been denied a fair hearing in 1996 when the
Brandeis judicial board found him guilty of sexual misconduct. The
court found unworthy of adjudication David A. Schaer's contention
that the panel of five students and two professors did not
interview him during its investigation, that it considered
``irrelevant and inflammatory'' evidence against him, and that the
record of its closed-door proceeding reduced to only 12 lines the
conflicting testimony of 13 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   None of that matters, the majority held, because ``a university
is not required to adhere to the standards of due process
guaranteed to criminal defendants or to abide by the rules of
evidence adopted by courts.'' College judicial boards might well be
star chambers but, as the court saw it, ``it is not the business of
lawyers and judges to tell universities what statements they may
consider and what statements they might reject.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a laissez-faire attitude might have made some sense in an
era when violating curfew was the worst infraction a college
student could commit. What sense does it make at a time when binge
drinking, date rape, and plagiarism are commonplace on even the
most prestigious campuses?
</P>
<P>
   In a dissent written by Associate Justice Roderick Ireland and
joined by Associate Justice Judith Cowin, Roderick warned that,
``In a hearing on a serious disciplinary matter there is simply too
much at stake for an individual student to countenance the
university's failure to abide by the rules it has itself
articulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland and Cowin found the procedural rules Brandeis laid out
in its handbook on disciplinary proceedings not nearly as ambiguous
as did the majority. By giving a ``strained reading'' to those
rules, he wrote, the majority defied ``common sense'' and let the
university off the hook. ``Brandeis should be required to follow
its own internal rules when imposing serious disciplinary sanctions
on a student.''
</P>
<P>
   In Schaer's case, the college junior was placed on probation,
banned from campus for a summer, and ordered to undergo
psychological counseling for his ``unwanted sexual activity'' with
an old girlfriend. He had testified that the sex was consensual.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long ago that a victim of rape on most campuses could
expect her report to land in the circular file of the college
police department. Colleges were notorious for minimizing reports
of violence on campus, especially sexual assaults. That is still
the case at some schools, but at fewer now that federal law
requires them to make their police logs public and to report their
crime statistics to the US Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Those hard-won reforms, designed to ensure public safety, need
not be in conflict with the right of the accused to a fair hearing.
In a university setting, especially, isn't it important for young
adults to learn that real justice requires the protection of the
rights of accused and accuser?
</P>
<P>
   The SJC has ruled that campus justice is not a matter for
lawyers and judges. It is up to college communities themselves,
then, to choose: Will they clarify the rights of all their students
or adopt the ambiguous approach to student discipline that just
earned Brandeis a pass?

RELIGION QUESTION OF THE WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHALE PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q I'm converting to Catholicism for my husband-to-be, and I
cannot understand purgatory, nor praying to the dead for help. Am I
dense? Can this be?
</P>
<P>
   L.O., Cambridge, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Purgatory and saints can be difficult concepts for
non-Catholics to grasp, but they are essential parts of Catholic
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Purgatory is defined as ``an intermediate state of purification
between death and heaven that provides for the removal of remaining
personal obstacles to the full enjoyment of eternal union with
God,'' according to an article written for the Encyclopedia of
Catholicism by the Rev. J. Augustine Di Noia, a theologian at the
Dominican House of Studies in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that human beings, when they die, have not always
led lives without moral blemish, and so they need to be made fit,
or holy, before spending eternity in heaven with God. So purgatory
is where people are purified in preparation for heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Purgatory has been depicted by artists as a place of fiery
torment, but there is no consensus among theologians as to just
what the experience is like or how long it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what time means after death, so although
purgatory is metaphorically described in terms of time, theologians
talk of an interval,'' Di Noia said in an interview. ``It could be
instantaneous. Nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the second part of your question: Catholics pray to God,
but they pray for the dead, and they pray that the dead who have
been saved, saints, will intercede with God on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Some Catholic devotional prayers are directed at saints _ for
example, the Hail Mary is directed at Mary. But Catholic
theologians say saints cannot directly grant healing or
forgiveness, but can only intercede with God on the worshiper's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for the dead, that they would receive God's mercy and
kindness, and we pray that the saints would intercede, or pray for
us,'' said the Rev. Paul Ritt, a theologian and pastor of Saint
Theresa's Church in Sherborn. ``But it's by Christ's grace that we
receive, not by the grace of saints.''

THE WRITER'S WRONG, LONDONERS HARUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When Salman Rushdie announced last week that he had
left London for New York because he found the intellectual scene
here ``bitchy'' and ``backbiting,'' London's literati responded to
his criticism by being, well, bitchy and backbiting.
</P>
<P>
   Letterfrom LondonThe writer A.N. Wilson suggested that Rushdie,
who had grown up and later sought sanctuary in London, after his
book ``The Satanic Verses'' earned him a death edict from Iran's
Islamic leaders, was simply washed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gratitude for you,'' another writer, Jasper Gerard,
said after reading Rushdie's London-dissing comments in The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a Guardian columnist Julie Burchill, the former punk
rock writer who has turned bitchiness into a genre, who really had
a go at Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``the US has done, is doing and will do more damage
to this planet than Nazi Germany,'' Burchill accused Rushdie of
abandoning London because the British have the good taste not to
buy his books anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once more it is naked self-interest attempting to cloak its
dank and shameful crevices in the watered silk of artistic
stimulation,'' Burchill wrote in her weekly column, in which she
routinely denounces Americans as materialistic, arrogant racists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Brits move to America, be they actors, writers or stupid
sportsmen-turned-movie-tough-guys . . . they move there for one of
two reasons, both of which have nothing to do with art,'' Burchill
added. ``They move there because they are rich and greedy for more,
or because, unconsciously, they worship evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of London's more highbrow writers went off on Rushdie years
ago, when he started hanging around with Bono, the lead singer of
U2. Serious writers, they sniffed, don't pal around with rock
stars, especially Irish ones.
</P>
<P>
   But those who admired Rushdie for his writing and his defying
the Iranian fatwa stuck by him _ at least until his
less-than-cordial remarks about London appeared in the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie said London is uninspiring. ``I think it speaks for
itself that, for somebody who lived in England for as long as I
did, relatively little of my work has dealt with it,'' Rushdie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said Rushdie's not writing about London or Britain in
general had more to do with having spent the last decade in hiding,
smothered by bodyguards. Rushdie lived in 30 safe houses during the
1990s, avoiding the Islamic extremists who wanted to kill him. As
for ordinary British life, Wilson said, Rushdie had ``less
experience of it than most of us have of outer space.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie is not alone in believing that the United States is a
more stimulating place to live for writers, especially novelists.
Martin Amis, one of Britain's most celebrated novelists, has
suggested that he would abandon London for the States, citing
almost the same complaints as Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   Burchill is furious with Rushdie, Amis, and Jeanette Winterson,
another prominent British writer who has said she prefers America
to Britain. ``If you want to worship evil and cosy up in the belly
of the beast, you're perfectly free to do so, but please don't
dress it up as love of art,'' Burchill fumed. ``Preferring Britain
to the US, despite all our faults, means that you respect
tolerance, kindness and a refusal to judge people merely on how far
they have made it up the dung heap we call capitalism. Preferring
the US to Britain, on the other hand, reveals a person to be a
blind worshipper of power, money and those crazy go-to-hell golf
slacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short,'' Burchill said,``any Briton who emigrates to
America is a pathetic, traitorous little sneak, a disgrace to the
human race that is currently suffering under the studded cowboy
boot of Uncle Sam, and as such deserves to be stripped of their
British citizenship . . . and never allowed back on this sceptered
isle again.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment, apparently, is part of the kindness and
tolerance Burchill considers inherent here and missing in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie said he has been re-energized by what he calls New
York's ``famous electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much stuff just asking me to write it down here,''
the Times quoted him as saying. ``You know, all the furniture on
the street. What places are called. Everything has a different
name. Toothpaste isn't called the same thing, coffee isn't called
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But traitors are called the same thing, and for more than a few
British writers, Rushdie has thumbed his nose at them and gone over
to the Philistines.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian, which used to run an occasional column by Rushdie,
informed its readers that Rushdie's new muses are not nearly as
fond of him. Some New York socialites, the paper reported, are
reluctant to dine with Rushdie at any number of trendy Gotham
eateries, lest those unaware that the fatwa has been lifted try to
make a name for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The paper quoted an unnamed ``literary commentator'' trashing
Rushdie's latest novel, ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' and
describing Rushdie as being so egotistical that he would not allow
changes to be made in the draft. In London, when former friends
start wheeling out anonymous quotes to impugn your integrity, you
might as well pack it in.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scene that George Orwell would have loved to capture. And
once did. Salman Rushdie, it seems, is destined to become the
Winston Smith of the London literati: a nonperson.

LINEMAN WILLIAMS EAGER FOR THE NEXT GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sacks. The pressures. The lack of a running game. The
inability to punch the ball in from the red zone. The overall
offensive impotence. Traffic and water-flow problems at Foxboro
Stadium. Heck, even the Red Sox' sorry finish.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Most every time, most everyone does, figures Patriots tackle
Grant Williams, a mountain of a young man.
</P>
<P>
   The line maligned? It comes with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every offensive line is the most maligned group on
each team,'' Williams said to laughs in the Patriots locker room.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Williams said, the line needs work, as do other
spots on the team. But he thinks things are improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch the tape and you see playing good, playing good and
then all of a sudden at a key moment, there's a mistake,'' Williams
said. ``We can't do that. It can't happen at those times. There are
things I can do better. Everyone's included in that. It's a
combination of a number of things and areas. We're not bad. But
we're not good enough to make mistakes at crucial times and
overcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Bill Belichick talked about a finger-in-the-dike
theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pass protection against Tampa Bay and that wasn't a
problem (against Miami),'' he said. ``You put your finger in the
dike on the running game on first and second down and that's not a
problem. It's a big pass play on third down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at Miami, the offensive line gave up two sacks of Drew
Bledsoe, down from three the week before against Minnesota and six
each in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thing is getting him hit, and we got him hit some,''
Williams said. ``It doesn't matter if it's a three-step drop or a
seven-step drop, we should take a little more pride and not get him
hit. Myself included. I gave up, I think, one sack but I got him
hit two other times. That shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he sees that improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just see the line coming together a little bit and
getting a little better each week,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a mix-and-match proposition on the offensive line.
Veteran free agents Joe Andruzzi and Sale Isaia have been brought
in at guard in recent weeks to surround center Damien Woody.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 6 feet 7 inches and 325 pounds, was signed as a free
agent in March but injured his knee early in training camp. He
finally got into a game late in preseason and then was somewhat of
a surprise starter in the opener at right tackle. In Miami, he
played part of the game at right tackle, the rest at left tackle
when he replaced Bruce Armstrong, still hampered by his own knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The shifting can make things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have about 20 seconds to adjust in your own little way,''
Williams said. ``I come over and I always ask the guard to help me
keep my head up. Most plays, you can flip-flop over in your head,
but there are some plays that are run only one way. If I've been
running the back side of a run all week and now I'm on the front
side of a run, now you have to refresh your memory a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is, you line up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things you can't argue,'' Williams said.
``If they want me to play linebacker, if they want you to start
somewhere in the NFL, you just put your hat on and try to do the
best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams came into the NFL with Seattle as an undrafted free
agent out of Louisiana Tech. Last year, he started 15 games at
right tackle and then had a rough game, along with the rest of the
Seahawks, against Miami in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a two-year, $2.1 million contract here and the
transition has not been the smoothest. First the knee injury. Now
the rough start.
</P>
<P>
   Williams isn't letting it get him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 0-4 but at the same time I feel excited about the future
here,'' he said. ``We're still getting into our systems, and
looking up the road, it only looks better.''
</P>
<P>
   He's talking just a small piece down the street, Williams
insisted, not way off down the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here it was for the long haul and I'm still
excited about this season,'' he said. ``I'm not looking forward to
next year. I'm looking forward to this week. I was talking to some
guys and we were ready to line up and go against Denver. You just
want to get to the next one. Watch the tape, see the mistakes. And
I think there was some improvement in some areas, too, and see
those and scout Denver and get ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams saw plenty of the Broncos in his four years with
Seattle and liked playing in Denver. But he also knew his teams
were always in for a tough time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year in Seattle, we won the division and they were as
tough as anyone in that division easily,'' he said. ``They just got
off on the wrong foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrong foot. Sound familiar? The Broncos started last year
0-4. And finished 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Chad Eaton is ready to go again, too. ``The
reason you want to get out there so fast is you want to forget
about what just happened, win or lose,'' Eaton said. ``If you do
win, you want to forget about it and move on and not gloat about
it. If you lose, you want to get out there fast and forget about
it. You don't want it to eat you up. We're at a point now where I
think half the guys want to get out there and the other half are
saying, `What are we going to do?' We have to make sure everyone
has the same attitude: `Let's get back out there and let's finish.'
'' And how to read that attitude? ``You see who comes in at 9 in
the morning and who comes in at 12:30 in the afternoon, you can
tell attitude that way,'' said Eaton. ``You lead by being here at
10 a.m. and lead by example.''

`PEGASUS' OFF TO FLYING START IN HIS RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Impressive. Very impressive. That's the best way to describe the
return to the races of Kentucky Derby hero Fusaichi Pegasus, who
won a race Saturday he had every right to lose.
</P>
<P>
   A $4 million yearling, Fusaichi Pegasus was the toast of the
racing world after he won the Derby May 6. Even a loss in the May
20 Preakness to Red Bullet, who is out for the year with a leg
injury, could not diminish the luster of Fusaichi Pegasus, who was
sold to stud for $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, the big bay son of Mr. Prospector had not raced since
the Preakness. He had been on the shelf since wounding a hoof by
kicking a stall wall before the Belmont Stakes June 10. Owner Fusao
Sekiguchi and trainer Neil Drysdale had insisted to skeptics that
Fusaichi Pegasus would run again, with the $4 million Breeders' Cup
Classic at Churchill Downs Nov. 4 the ultimate goal. The colt
reappeared in Saturday's Jerome Handicap at Belmont Park, which is
restricted to 3-year-olds and run at 1 mile.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Jerome, Drysdale, either out of candor or to make
an excuse in advance, threw cold water on his charge's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say he is completely fit, but he has come along faster
than I expected,'' said Drysdale. ``We're going into this race a
work or two shy. It's not necessary for this horse to win this
race. It's just a steppingstone to the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running in this race puts us ahead if weather interrupts his
training. I look for him to move forward off this race, and it puts
him in position to run again before the Breeders' Cup. Hopefully,
he'll regain his spring form, but he might need a race or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale hardly needed to worry, or make excuses, as Fusaichi
Pegasus simply galloped to victory, looking as good as he ever did
in a career that has seen him win six of eight starts, with two
seconds, and earn nearly $2 million. If, indeed, he improves off
Saturday's effort, then everybody else is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The race was run in a rapid 1:34, but Fusaichi Pegasus surged
past the leader, Travers runner-up Albert The Great, turning for
home, and then held off Del Mar Breeders' Cup winner El Corredor,
who closed late. The margin of victory was only three-quarters of a
length, but Fusaichi Pegasus was under a hand ride from jockey Kent
Desormeaux, who won by as much as he pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we hit the eighth-pole, he put his foot down and just
took off,'' said Desormeaux. ``I think I got whiplash from it. He
finished up with something left, and I'm just so glad for the
racing fans that he's back.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that marked the return of Fusaichi Pegasus was
his model behavior before the race. One of the few knocks on him
has been that he acted up in the paddock or the post parade. On
Saturday, he was very professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more mature than he was in the spring,'' said
Drysdale. ``I think he handled everything very well. It's far too
early to discuss where he'll go next, but the Jockey Club Gold Cup
($1 million, 1 1/4 miles, at Belmont, vs. older horses) is
certainly one of our options.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a big deal if Fusaichi Pegasus starts in the Gold
Cup, because he likely would meet 4-year-old Lemon Drop Kid, who
has won the Brooklyn, Suburban, Whitney, and Woodward in
succession, and is the leading candidate to be Horse of the Year. A
duel between those two would offer a Breeders' Cup Classic preview,
sans the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it is great for the game to have ``FuPeg,'' as he is
known to his many admirers, back in action. He is a true glamour
horse, both in looks and performance, and not many of those come
around.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Valentine' shows heart
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celtics coach Rick Pitino may be looking at a difficult season
with the team, but he's definitely on the right track with his
stable. Pitino's Celtic Pride Stable has come up with a very nice
2-year-old colt named A P Valentine, who won a maiden special
weight race on the Jerome undercard. A P Valentine is a son of
Horse of the Year A.P. Indy, out of an Alydar mare. That's about as
good as breeding gets, and the juvenile cost $475,000 as a
yearling. Trained by Nick Zito and ridden by Jorge Chavez, A P
Valentine raced gamely to be third in his debut at Saratoga Sept.
4. That set him up nicely for Saturday, and he whistled home a
winner by more than 4 lengths in the time of 1:23 for 7 furlongs.
What made his tally even more eye-catching was that he beat a very
promising rival in Pure Prize. Owned by Ogden Phipps and trained by
Shug McGaughey, Pure Prize is the first offspring of champion mare
Heavenly Prize, and his sire is Storm Cat, whose stud fee is
$300,000. Pure Prize, who also had been third in his bow at
Saratoga, chased A P Valentine to no avail. It was 12 lengths back
to the third-place finisher . . . Mighty, who won the Louisiana
Derby before injuring a knee in the Blue Grass at Keeneland April
15, was unsuccessful in his return bid. Sent off at even money in
an allowance race at Belmont Friday, the son of Lord At War faded
to fifth, beaten nearly 20 lengths. His future is uncertain . . .
On the local front, kudos go out to owner/trainer Florence Siravo
for the job she did with Lonsdale, a 7-year-old gelding who
dominated the Brass Monkey Starter Handicap series at Rockingham
Park. Lonsdale ran in all seven legs of the series, which began at
a mile and one-16th June 24 and increased in distance each race
until Saturday's final at 2 miles and 40 yards, and he won four of
them, while finishing second in two others. In the concluding
contest, Lonsdale simply cantered twice around the track under
Taylor Hole, who rode him in every leg but one, to score by 3 1/2
lengths. Siravo received a trophy and a $500 bonus for her efforts.

TRUCE THEORY HARD TO SWALLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ One lunch with John Harrington, and we're supposed to
believe that peace is at hand on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   Must have been a Happy Meal. Just can't get enough of those
Pedro fries, can you?
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox spinners were so pleased that Dan Duquette and Jimy
Williams dined together at the same table _ plastic knives, we
assume _ that they posted a story on their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``DAN DUQUETTE, JOHN HARRINGTON AND JIMY WILLIAMS MEET FOR
THOROUGH DISCUSSIONS,'' the headline read.
</P>
<P>
   For the Red Sox, who pride themselves on keeping things
``in-house,'' this was akin to setting an extra place at the table
for their fans, at least those who know how to click on a mouse.
(Another kind of mouse was spotted running through the Red Sox
clubhouse Sunday, but we digress.)
</P>
<P>
   Back to the last supp- . . . uh, lunch. What was actually said,
we can't tell you. None of the principals was saying, beyond
Duquette informing a Globe editorial writer that he and Harrington
told Williams they expect him back next season, and that no one was
condoning Carl Everett's actions, contrary to the impression left
by Duquette last week.
</P>
<P>
   But we suspect that a bottle of Maalox may have been substituted
for dessert. No owner enjoys being forced to referee a fight
between his GM and manager, especially after the GM insists over
and over in public there is no fight.
</P>
<P>
   And Williams, we are told, did not let this opportunity go to
waste. He gave Harrington a laundry list of grievances he has had
with Duquette, which means, we suspect, that Everett's name wasn't
the only one that crept into the discussion. Wil Cordero, Steve
Avery, Mo Vaughn, Mike Stanley, Steve Ontiveros, and Izzy Alcantara
may have been mentioned at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   Was Williams satisfied that he got a sympathetic hearing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always learned time's a great healer,'' he said before a
game with the White Sox. ``So time heals a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it can close the cavernous wounds exposed by last week's
falling out over Everett is an uncertain prospect at best. There's
no question that while Williams may not have his GM's backing, the
public is fully in his corner. This newspaper even published an
editorial Tuesday urging the Sox to retain Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you say obituary?'' Williams said. ``I never get to that
page.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was evidence that Williams came away from lunch
unconvinced that he is long for this team. One Toronto columnist,
whose lifetime batting average on such matters is close to Manny
Alexander's, ``reported'' Tuesday that Williams had an informal
agreement with Seattle GM Pat Gillick to manage the Mariners next
season.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario of Williams managing the M's is not far-fetched.
Gillick fired Williams in Toronto, but when Duquette hired Williams
for the Sox in November four years ago, Jimy came highly
recommended by Gillick. Yet the notion that the two men already
have an informal agreement, which violates all of baseball's
tampering rules, has about as much credibility as the theory that
dinosaurs never roamed the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do?'' Williams said when asked about the report. ``I don't
know what you're talking about. I have an agreement with the Red
Sox, a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   But just in case Williams doesn't come back, we wanted to give
Harrington a heads-up on a list of successors. These are people,
for one reason or another, we feel would fit right in on Yawkey
Way.
</P>
<P>
   1. Eminem. He and Carl speak the same language.
</P>
<P>
   2. George W. Bush. By November, he may be looking for work. Like
Jimy, he claims to be a baseball man. And he's had lots of
experience raising huge wads of cash.
</P>
<P>
   3. Billy Martin. He's dead. Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   4. Kevin Kennedy. Yes, the Duke fired him once before, but never
count out a Kennedy in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   5. Carl Everett. Might as well make it official.
</P>
<P>
   6. Jules Asner. The E! girl? Just doing what we can to keep
Nomar happy.
</P>
<P>
   7. Slobodan Milosevic. Soon-to-be-unemployed dictator finds a
kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   8. Eddie Andelman. The Boston talk-show maven knows twice as
much as Jimy. Just ask him.
</P>
<P>
   9. Marty McSorley. Perfect guy to enforce clubhouse rules.
</P>
<P>
   10. Hillary Clinton. She's used to people who are unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   We're not saying this is a complete list. But it gives
Harrington someplace to start.

   The time-shifted Olympics finally come to an end on NBC _ ``The
network that brings you yesterday's news tomorrow,'' as NBC's own
Jay Leno said. Given the many time zones between us, we'll still be
watching the closing ceremony after everyone in Sydney has gone
home.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 7 to midnight prime-time events on NBC include the
men's basketball gold medal game and finals in diving and track and
field. Sunday NBC will cover the vast spectacle of the closing
ceremony, including fireworks and performances by Midnight Oil and
Men at Work. Men's marathon coverage is also scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC and CNBC will join the network in covering everything from
soccer to canoeing from 10 a.m. on. Sunday's daytime events include
8 a.m. canoeing finals on MSNBC, as well as boxing, gymnastics and
volleyball finals. (No CNBC coverage on Sunday.)

   BLACKTOWN, Australia _ On second thought, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind their angst over a three-game losing streak. The
sports psychologist and his mini-toilet for them to flush after bad
games? Keep it. The same can be said of the ritual they used last
week: taking a shower with their uniforms on, trying to bring about
an exorcism.
</P>
<P>
   None of that matters anymore. The United States is the best
softball team in the world and, Tuesday night, it walked out of the
Softball Center with several souvenirs. All the US players have
Olympic gold medals after their 2-1 win over Japan. The players
tried several times to drape a medal around the neck of head coach
Ralph Raymond, but he kept taking it off and giving credit to them.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that they all deserved the recognition. It started
with Raymond, who elected to pitch ace Lisa Fernandez on no days'
rest. That's right. Nothing. She pitched the US into the gold-medal
game with a win over Australia Monday. Twenty-four hours later, she
was back against the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to come back tomorrow night, she could (pitch)
again,'' Raymond said of softball's best pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who began to cry during the medal ceremony, said she
didn't have her game. Her pitches, which routinely reach 70 miles
per hour, didn't have their usual pop. She said the Japanese knew
what she was throwing. She was irritable, sometimes ``blowing a
fuse,'' with her teammates left to deal with the shrapnel. But as
off as she claimed to be, she gave up only one run all day, and her
center fielder wound up apologizing for that.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Japanese third baseman Reika Utsugi homered to
center. It was a well-hit, low line drive. Laura Berg appeared to
be in position to catch the ball, but she leaped and missed it, and
it landed over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized to Lisa for that,'' Berg said. ``I've got to find
a way to catch that ball. That's my job. I felt like I owed her
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their three-game skid, the Americans have been very
successful at evening the bill with each other. You paid last time?
I'll pick this one up. Not feeling well? I'll handle your chores
today.
</P>
<P>
   So there were a tired Fernandez and her teammates, needing one
run _ against a pitcher who was no-hitting them. Mariko Masubuchi
was on the mound, having no problems through 4 1/3 innings. With an
out in the fifth, she hit designated hitter Michele Smith. Smith
moved to second on a groundout. She scored when catcher Stacey
Nuveman singled.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tie game after five, and smart Australian fans
immediately called their babysitters. This was going to be a late
one. At this level of the sport, runs are cyclical. It seems that
you can watch three up, three down ad infinitum. And with rain on
the way, there was a chance the game wouldn't be completed.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the eighth when the US had two on and one out.
The lead runner was infielder Jennifer McFalls. The batter was _
look at this _ Berg, who was still trying to pay back Fernandez.
The left fielder, Shiori Koseki, was playing Berg shallow. When
Berg lifted a ball to left, further than Koseki expected, the
fielder began to backpedal. That wasn't her only problem. It was
raining, and the grass was slick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she made a valiant effort to get the ball,'' said
Dr. Dot Richardson, the US second baseman who was on first.
</P>
<P>
   She got the ball as she was falling backward. It was in her
mitt, briefly, and then rolled out. McFalls scored and the US won.
The Japanese stayed on the field for a moment, still surprised by a
strange game, a game they lost on what could be classified as a
routine flyball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time we got some breaks,'' said Berg, who woke up
her family in California (it was close to 3 a.m. there) with news
of the win.
</P>
<P>
   This tournament humbled the US. The Americans finished fourth in
the tournament, and had to travel to the gold-medal game without a
bye. The team found itself in a must-win game against New Zealand.
It lost its 112-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of these Olympics, just as they were at the end of
the 1996 Olympics, the Americans are gold medalists. As the
national anthem played, Fernandez put this team in perspective and
thought of her parents. Her father is a Cuban refugee. Her mother
is Puerto Rican. She began thinking of parental sacrifices and
freedom, and began to cry. A few minutes later, she cried when
retelling the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're free now,'' she said, speaking of her family. But then,
as she told Berg, the softball team is family, too.

THEY MADE `SURVIVOR' LOOK LIKE KID STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The 16 people who elbowed one another off the island in
``Survivor'' are still being treated as if they actually did
something. Richard Hatch, who won $1 million for turning everyone
on each other until he was the last person left was given his own
day by his hometown of Middletown, R.I. Almost all of the other
participants have been all over the television and have been
swamped with speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a storm like I've never seen before,'' said Sherri
Spillane, the agent for six of the ``survivors.'' ``The interest in
everyone is 10 times what you might have expected.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much interest in the selfish self-absorption of
contrived ``reality'' shipwrecks, you can forget what real survival
is like, stories where survival depended on the most intricate of
human cooperation. Our family was jolted back to reality this
summer by movies about Antarctic exploration at the Boston Museum
of Fine Arts and by the Peabody Essex Museum's Endurance
exhibition, which is traveling around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Endurance was the ship that British explorer Ernest
Shackleton used to set up what would have been the first-ever
crossing of the Antarctic continent by foot. The crossing never
happened. The ship and its crew of 28 men became locked in pack ice
within sight of land in January of 1915. The ice floes then carried
them way back off land and hundreds of miles off course.
</P>
<P>
   The crew was stuck in the ice all through the Antarctic winter
of 35-degrees-below-zero temperatures. They drifted until the
shifting ice crushed their ship. They drifted on a makeshift
campground until April 1916, when the ice beneath them began
breaking apart. Then, as if the preceding had not been bad enough,
Shackleton ordered his men into three small boats to reach an
island, dodging waves of boat-crushing ice and being soaked into
frostbite by splashing water that almost instantly froze.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ration of nut food and biscuits was issued, but the men's
thirst was now so intense that few of them could eat it,'' wrote
Alfred Lansing in his 1959 book ``Endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shackleton suggested that they try chewing seal meat raw in
order to swallow the blood. Pieces of the frozen meat were quickly
handed out, and after several minutes of chewing and sucking, the
men obtained enough of the bloody juice so they could at least
swallow . . . They had had no sleep for almost 80 hours . . . But
the conviction that they had to land by nightfall gave rise to a
strength born of desperation. It was pull or perish.''
</P>
<P>
   After reaching desolate Elephant Island, Shackleton still had to
find an inhabited island to be rescued. He and five other men set
out in the James Caird, a 22-foot-long boat _ not much longer a
kayak _ for an 800-mile trip to the whaling stations of South
Georgia Island. The crossing was over the stormiest waters on
Earth, where 50-foot waves are normal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   During a midnight watch, Shackleton's eyes were just getting
used to the dark ``when he turned and saw a rift of brightness in
the sky astern. He called to others to tell them the good news that
the weather was clearing to the southwest. A moment later, he heard
a hiss, accompanied by a low, muddled roar, and he turned to look
again. The rift in the clouds, actually the crest of an enormous
wave, was advancing rapidly toward them. He spun around and
instinctively pulled his head down.
</P>
<P>
   `` `For God's sake, hold on!' he shouted. `It's got us!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Caird survived the deluge. Had it missed South Georgia, the
next, hopelessly far land was 3,000 miles away in South Africa.
With miraculous readings in seas that nearly made their sextant
useless, the crew made it to an uninhabited part of South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   There were still more miracles to perform. The Caird was
damaged, so Shackleton hiked more than 20 miles across a South
Georgia so blocked with glaciers and jagged peaks that it was
thought impassable. He made it to the whaling station. They rounded
up the other three men, and a rescue boat went back to Elephant
Island to rescue the other 22 men.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton's journey gave us a new sense of endurance, one which
makes today's contrived ``reality'' disasters so silly. Our
celebrity circuit loudly rewards selfish ``survivors.'' When
Shackleton reached the whaling station, Lansing wrote that the
workers ``had no medals or decorations to bestow _ only their
heartfelt admiration for an accomplishment which perhaps only they
would ever fully appreciate . . . Of the honors that followed . . .
possibly none ever exceeded that night of May 22, 1916, when in a
dingy warehouse shack on South Georgia, with the smell of rotting
whale carcasses in the air, the whalermen of the southern ocean
stepped forward one by one and silently shook hands with
Shackleton, Worsley, and Crean.''

   MILITARY-READINESS (Washington) _ Echoing charges from
Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush that U.S. military
readiness is slipping, the nation's top military officers told
Congress Wednesday that preparedness to fight has eroded to the
point that the Pentagon's main strategy of being able to win two
wars at once now carries high risk. By ERIC ROSENBERG.

   OIL-PRICES (Washington) _ A top Energy Department official says
that home heating oil prices will stabilize over the next several

than last year. However, Robert S. Kripowicz, acting assistant
secretary for fossil energy, warned that President Clinton's
decision last week to release 30 million barrels of oil from the
nation's emergency reserve can't prevent price spikes caused by any
unusually cold winter or shipping disruptions. By MARK HELM.

fathers are involved in hands-on parenting. But the stronger,
sometimes domineering, influence of mothers on sons who wound up in
the White House cannot be denied. We know every little boy can grow
up to be president, but it helps to have a wise mother on his side.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ As we head into the final month

Americans. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (For release Sunday, Oct. 1.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Oh, he's still out every morning, a whir of pink flesh
running through South Boston, jogging and filling himself up with
life and fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been terribly quiet.
</P>
<P>
   And he used to smash right through the days and nights. He was
the state representative and city councilor and mayor who wanted to
save the poor. He ran a city. He hated that he needed sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone, Ray Flynn?
</P>
<P>
   Well, his local radio show has been off the air for more than a
year now. He heads a group called Catholic Alliance, but it's based
in Washington. He gives speeches for the organization, though they
don't make headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But now Flynn, whose sweeping political life came to a
blistering and emotional end two years ago, is coming back.
</P>
<P>
   He's got a novel, ``The Accidental Pope,'' ready to roll off the
presses.
</P>
<P>
   He has just signed up to host a show on the new American
Catholic Network that will debut in early 2001. It'll be called
``Ray Flynn Live.'' It'll be a bully pulpit. ``It'll be like Larry
King's show,'' he promised.
</P>
<P>
   And in April of next year comes his book about his experiences
at the Vatican, where he served as US ambassador and clashed with
both the State Department and White House over his
get-out-of-my-way diplomatic style. ``John Paul II: An Inside
View,'' it will be called.
</P>
<P>
   But his most concentrated effort, he now admits, has been his
personal research into the Charles Stuart murder-suicide case that
cast a racial stain on Boston during his reign as mayor. It'll be a
substantial part of a planned memoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meet with people regularly to talk about the Stuart case,''
he said. ``I had a discussion just last Friday with someone who's
intimate with the whole thing. I've talked to detectives,
prosecutors, BHA officials. A day doesn't go by that I don't think
about it. I've got a lot of information people have never heard.
I'm not doing it to sensationalize. It's no whitewash. It's `just
the facts, ma'am.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Flynn, 61 years old, has turned himself into a writing fool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's opened a new world to me in terms of creativity that I
never knew I had,'' he said of the writing. ``I always considered
myself shy, but now I feel liberated. I'm able to open myself up.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nearly four-hour interview recently at his home, Flynn
talked of his political life, his victories and setbacks, his
family, his hoped-for future, and his personal ghost, Charles
Stuart. By turn, he sounded wistful, contrite, reflective, proud,
defensive, and even poetic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's early morning and the mayor who is no longer the mayor but
who will always be the mayor is reclining in a chair in his South
Boston home. There are black-and-white pictures of Irish-born
relatives on a nearby stand. The home is elegant in an
unpretentious way. His wife, Cathy, is in the dining room, seated
at a table, dressing up a turkey for supper. The autumn light
streaming through the windows is clear as white wine.
</P>
<P>
   There's a framed photo hanging of Ambassador Flynn, Pope John
Paul II, and President Clinton. Other than that, there's nary a
political memento in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said he holds no grudges about his wintry 1998
congressional defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost fair and square,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So let the rattling bones go silent.
</P>
<P>
   But he does admit that when he returned to Boston in 1997 from
the Vatican, the reception was chilly. Many former ambassadors have
jobs waiting for them. They are wooed, chased, welcomed into
soft-carpeted boardrooms. But not Ambassador Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absurd'' is how he defines his dealings with Northeastern
University, where he went through a three-hour interview for the
job of athletic director. ``A friend from my days at Providence
College mentioned to them I might be interested,'' Flynn said. ``It
was my long interest in athletics. I went through an interview and
didn't get the job offer. I don't know. I might not have accepted
it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the powerbrokers were ashamed of him.
</P>
<P>
   To all of Boston, it looked as if Ray Flynn _ a three-time
mayor, ambassador, one-time president of the US Conference of
Mayors _ was begging for local employment.
</P>
<P>
   Brother, can you spare a job?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bit of a secret as to why,'' he said, explaining: ``I
was never the darling of the business community. I took them on.
They couldn't control me. There was no love there.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't figure out the silence, and when he did, he said, it
only made him proud of his political past. ``People should worry
about politicians who get these high-paying jobs. Maybe they've
been playing footsie with this company, with that corporation. The
answer is nobody owned me. John Hancock and Fleet Bank weren't
pounding my door down. I know some people end up on the boards of
oil companies. But I was never the corporate leaders' fair-haired
boy. They got no special land deals from me. Sometimes they were
even offended.''
</P>
<P>
   The political leaders who used to get capital from being around
Ray Flynn seemed to distance themselves as well. ``Senator Kennedy
never called. Senator Kerry never called,'' he said. ``I'm not
going to be calling them up. I only want to be where I'm wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor William Weld did call, offering a job in his Republican
administration. ``I said no.''
</P>
<P>
   So he took a job on WRKO radio. You don't find a lot of
ambassadors gliding from ambassadorships into the rough-and-tumble
world of talk radio. But Ray Flynn needed a job.
</P>
<P>
   A year into that job, he left, and became president of Catholic
Alliance _ a ``pro-life, pro-human rights, pro-poor'' organization
_ speaking out on behalf of issues important to Catholics. He
traveled and gave speeches. Flynn's annual salary is $100,000. It's
good money, though it's not ex-ambassador money.
</P>
<P>
   There was a radio job, Catholic Family Radio, but you couldn't
get it locally. It was broadcast in other regions of the country.
Ray Flynn was reduced to a voice on the radio. And in his hometown,
a Catholic town, you couldn't even pick up the signal.
</P>
<P>
   He had time on his hands. He could finally have dinner at home
with Cathy and the kids. There wasn't that urge to bolt for the
front door as if the city were sinking into a manhole.
</P>
<P>
   But the city remained on his mind. He just couldn't figure out
where it was headed. Did anyone from the Menino administration wish
his counsel, expertise? They didn't. Menino has never called. ``Not
once,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston to which he returned seemed more callous and less
caring. Folks spoke of gentrification as if it were akin to the
saving of human souls. ``It used to be a city of neighborhoods,''
he opined, sounding like a museum piece. ``Nobody talking about the
poor. People talking about Hollywood and Wall Street.'' He didn't
get it. Hollywood and Wall Street. What about the Pine Street Inn?
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the minimum wage went up.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton overhauled welfare and a lot of people on welfare found
jobs. And pride.
</P>
<P>
   The country was more boom than bust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Flynn saw only the poor. They were his sixth sense. Ghosts
at the side door.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed too young to be the lion in winter. But the shade was
beckoning.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time in his political life, Raymond Leo Flynn
looked inside himself.
</P>
<P>
   He started thinking. And he started writing.
</P>
<P>
   Writers aren't born overnight. Flynn has a co-author, Robin
Moore, who has written more than two dozen books, among them ``The
French Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote a lot of it,'' Moore, who resides in Concord, said of
Flynn and the upcoming novel, to be published in November. ``He put
a lot of autobiographical material in there. For instance, his
problems with the State Department because he was Catholic _ and
they weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days, Ray Flynn says, he puts 16 hours in at the writing
desk. ``Writing is tough,'' he allowed, sounding charmingly naive
about a craft that has been known to extract blood.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn says it was the young adults working out at the Boston
Athletic Club who lifted him from his cocoon, who got him to
thinking and writing about his role in the history of his Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of very fine young professional people who go to
the Boston Athletic Club,'' he said. ``Many come from different
parts of the country and they've gone to Harvard, BC, BU. I've had
the opportunity to meet and talk with many of them, and, quite
frankly, they kind of look to me. I often find myself holding
political court with these young people, which I enjoy, which is
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells the newcomers to read ``Common Ground,'' by Tony Lukas,
and ``The Boston Irish,'' by Thomas O'Connor. They do. Then they
return to him and ask Ray Flynn about Ray Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw myself as being the most important person in the
city,'' Flynn said. ``I looked at it from the standpoint of someone
given the opportunity to speak for people who have no political
voice. I used every opportunity I could to represent that point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   There were days in office when Ray Flynn looked unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went on the plane to the Vatican, I had 80 percent
favorability rating by the people of Boston,'' he recalled. ``I was
talking to my friend, L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley. He called me up. He
said, `Ray, can that possibly be true?' I said, `I don't see where
they'd make those numbers up.' I said, `Tom, me getting out there
with the people didn't begin when I was elected mayor of Boston. I
shined shoes as a kid. I sold newspapers.''

MEN COULD HAVE BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENED AT THE OBSTETRICIAN'S  
 &HT;

 &HT;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   If you're an expectant husband, the next time you accompany your
pregnant wife to her obstetrician's office, don't be surprised if
they take your blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because high blood pressure can go undetected for years,
health-care professionals are always looking for creative ways to
screen people. One of the most novel suggestions comes from a
recent study that says men should be screened for high blood
pressure at the obstetrician's office when they go with their wives
for prenatal checkups.
</P>
<P>
   High blood pressure, or hypertension, is called the ``silent
killer'' because symptoms rarely show up until damage has been
done. This can be especially true for men because they rarely see
doctors when they're young, unlike women who often go for annual
checkups.
</P>
<P>
   And younger men are at twice the risk for hypertension, compared
to young women. But researchers from the Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis believe they've got the solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young men don't visit doctors routinely unless
they're very sick,'' says one of the study's authors, Daniel R.
Martin, a research instructor in medicine at Washington University
School of Medicine. ``We were trying to find a way to make it
easier for these men, and to make them more aware of their
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Making men more aware of high blood pressure is crucial because
one of every four Americans has high blood pressure, according to
the American Heart Association (AHA). And as many as one-third of
those people don't know they have hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Complications include an increased risk of stroke and heart
disease, along with possible kidney damage, says Martin. Every
year, high blood pressure may be responsible for as many as 250,000
deaths, the heart association says.
</P>
<P>
   But high blood pressure is very treatable and can be controlled
using a combination of diet, exercise and medications, Martin says.
The first step, though, is finding out you have it.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and his colleagues had nurses at four different
obstetrical offices offer men who came in with pregnant women a
free blood pressure check. Almost 200 men, with an average age of
27, agreed to the test. Sixty percent were white, 35 percent were
black and 5 percent were of other racial backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Forty men, or 20 percent of those tested, had high blood
pressure. Only 5 percent of these men knew beforehand they had
hypertension. Results of the study were published in the September
issue of the American Journal of Hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   One high reading alone didn't mean those men definitely had high
blood pressure, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diagnosis of hypertension is not made on one reading. Usually
three readings are taken at different times, but one reading can be
an indicator of a problem,'' says Martin. He acknowledges one of
the study's limitations is that the researchers didn't follow the
patients to see if they were later diagnosed as actually having
hypertension. They did recommend that all of the men with high
readings follow up with their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   So, what do obstetricians think of the idea of screening men in
their offices?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good idea. You could theoretically screen a large
population, but practically, it's difficult,'' says Dr. Marcos
Pupkin, chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at
Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Pupkin says many offices would have to add staff to do this on a
regular basis. More importantly, he wonders, what is the
obstetrician's responsibility?
</P>
<P>
   What if someone's pressure came back high? Would he need to
refer that person to another physician? Would insurance companies
accept a referral from an obstetrician for a man? Would the
obstetrician need to start a chart to record that the man had been
screened in his office? He says these are just some of the issues
that would need to be addressed.

Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush that U.S. military

DIRTY TRICKSTERS IN THE BUSH CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Something may be rotten in the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A whiff of something odiferous is wafting out of Austin, even
riper than the scents of methane from the cattle pens and sulfur
from the natural gas burn-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Two key figures from a Keystone Kops 1986 political bugging
scandal in Texas are now on the headquarters staff of Governor
George W. Bush. The foreman of Bush's presidential campaign is Karl
Rove. One of his deputies is Mark McKinnon. They have been alleging
that the Gore campaign is pulling dirty tricks by spying on Bush's
Austin headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Democrats in Texas remember when this same pair
were hip-deep in similar allegations in the 1986 Texas governor's
race, when the two were on opposite sides.
</P>
<P>
   That year Rove, as campaign manager for Republican William
Clements, claimed to have discovered a listening device hidden
behind a red, white, and blue needlepoint hanging on Rove's office
wall. It was the size of a matchbox, and Rove said it had been
discovered by a security firm he hired to sweep his headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon was Rove's opposite number in the camp of Democratic
Governor Mark White, a former Texas attorney general. McKinnon
claimed that Rove probably planted the bug himself and then
announced it to smear the Democrats. There was a lot of bravado
about dueling lie detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was also suspicious. Rove claimed to have discovered
the bug only hours before the only televised debate of that
campaign. The stink got worse when the owner of the security firm
Rove hired refused to take a lie detector test ``for personal
reasons,'' reported the AP at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It may come as no surprise that Rove was a disciple of the late
Lee Atwater, whose deathbed conversion to Catholicism and public
contrition for his dirty tricks came after he helped the campaign
of George Bush the Elder savage Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater's spirit lives on in the Bush campaign. George W. was
another Bush '88 operative who learned at the cowboy boots of the
master. Dubbya's office was right across the hall from Atwater's,
and Rove is on record as being an Atwater disciple.
</P>
<P>
   Rove lost no time in claiming that the Democrats had the most to
gain by bugging his office. He called it ``Texasgate,'' natch. But
he avoided saying he had proof. McKinnon, now his fellow camper in
the Bush camp, denounced Rove then, claiming that Rove's suspicions
were ``a bunch of bull'' and worse. McKinnon claimed that Rove's
candidate was running on ``revenge . . . venom.'' But that was
then. Now McKinnon's name comes ahead of Rove's on the Bush payroll
list. Consider this sequence of events:
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign adviser who's helping prep Gore for his
debates with Bush gets a package in the mail containing a videotape
of Bush's own debate preparations plus some other material. Gore's
adviser, Tom Downey, who'd been portraying Bush in Gore's mock
debates, alerts the campaign chief, Bill Daley, who turns the
material over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Rove's minions disclaim any leak from another of their staff or
consultants; must be a dirty trick by the Gore people, they tell
one and all. Thus entered into the campaign database the ``Mole''
story. Is there a real mole? Or is this a molehill contrived to
squelch Gore's recent momentum? And was it a coincidence that this
erupted just before the first TV debate? Was it a scheme concocted
to put Gore off stride?
</P>
<P>
   Did Rove contrive to have the videotape dispatched to Downey in
hopes the Gore camp would take the cheese and not report the
episode promptly to the FBI? So they could then leak the tale to
friendly media outlets and catch the Gore camp red-handed? This
caper ``has Karl Rove's fingerprints written all over it,'' claims
Molly Beth Malcom, the Texas Democratic state chairwoman in the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   There's an eerie premonition of the Bush camp's current claim
that Al Gore will do anything to win. In '86 Rove pushed the exact
same line: ``Finding the bug convinced me that the opposition would
say anything and do anything to win an election.'' Hmmm. Isn't that
a coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   A junior staffer in the Gore camp was put on paid leave after
apparently bragging to a friend that Gore had a mole in Bush's
camp, then denying it, then admitting he'd fabricated the tale. In
a betrayal worthy of Linda Tripp, the supposed friend ratted out
the staffer to ABC. The Bush camp makes much of that. It's now part
of the GOP's you-can't-trust-Al Gore assault. A final irony: The
needlepoint hanging four feet from Rove's allegedly bugged phone in
'86 was a portrait of a venerable GOP mascot: the elephant. And you
know what they say: The elephant never forgets.

&HT;     BLACK JUDGES TO MARK PROGRESS ON THE BENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VENISE WAGNER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson
entered law school in 1959, there was only one black federal court
judge in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are about 150 African-American judges in the U.S.
court system, and they will gather in San Francisco Thursday
through Sunday to celebrate the strides that have been made and to
discuss what they would like to see change.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a hard but steady climb for African-Americans in the
federal judiciary, said Henderson, a U.S. District Court judge
here. ``One of the things we judges talked about all the time was
that you could hold a meeting of black lawyers in this little
office I'm sitting in.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, they wouldn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of blacks on the federal bench ``is making
our society more diverse,'' he said. ``It makes justice more
diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet politics may stall the appointment of more black judges to
the bench _ at least for this year _ because of resistance to
President Clinton's nominees by some Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Six African-Americans nominated by Clinton have yet to get a
hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which reviews
nominees before making a recommendation to the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Circuit Judge Ann Claire Williams, chairwoman of Just the
Beginning Foundation, declined to comment on the stalled
appointments, saying it was not the job of the judicial branch to
delve into the legislative branch of government. Although
conference discussions will forgo the issue, it is not likely to be
far from the minds of attending judges.
</P>
<P>
   John Crump, executive director of the National Bar Association,
an organization of black attorneys and judges, said the question of
qualifications always arises for African-American nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will appoint a tax lawyer to the federal district
court,'' Crump said. ``But if you take an African-American who was
a civil rights lawyer, the question will be, 'Is his experience
broad enough?' And everyone knows that a tax attorney's experience
is narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that narrowness that Henderson worries about, because it
could hurt the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just racial diversity,'' Henderson said. Justice
fails to benefit when a person of one thinking sits on the bench,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concern that those that are holding up the system have
made a statement that certain kinds of political leanings can't sit
on the bench,'' he said. ``You have to be of a sufficiently
conservative bent to be a federal judge (today), and I think that's
wrong-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference in San Francisco, co-sponsored by the Just the
Beginning Foundation, an organization of black federal judges, will
address such topics as the effect of the criminal justice system on
African-Americans and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was elevated from the U.S. District Court in
Chicago to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Illinois last year,
said the judges conference was an attempt to educate the public
about African-American contributions to the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through education, people can appreciate the significant
contributions that African-Americans do make in the judiciary,''
she said. ``By telling stories of these outstanding judges, you get
to see they are great judges, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the biennial conference had grown out of a small
gathering of federally appointed black judges eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They were honoring U.S. District Judge James Parsons, who was
retiring after 31 years on the bench. Parsons, appointed by
President John F. Kennedy, insisted that the celebration not be for
him, rather for the integration of the federal bench, Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal since has been to preserve the history of black federal
judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories of African-American judges and their struggles are
true American stories,'' she said. ``The judges have triumphed
against much adversity and have come out in a position of respect
in our society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the struggles of the judges and their stories
are inspirational, and it's important for children to have positive
role models ... It's important they see alternative routes to
success.''

HOW MUCH WILL NADER HURT GORE IN OREGON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERTON, Ore. _ In ``Earth in the Balance,'' published in
1992, the author warned that ``the unrestrained burning of fossil
fuels has many ferocious defenders.'' In 2000, with an election in
the balance, that author, Al Gore, ferociously defends fossil fuels
for unrestrained use by the SUVs and minivans that fill the parking
lots of swing vote suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   This green state was the Greenest in 1996, where Ralph Nader ran
best, winning 4 percent here. He'll get more in 2000 because he is
actively campaigning and also because Gore's suburban strategy
surrenders the environmental high ground. Oregonians are
environmentally civic-minded and skeptical of tapping the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, which Gore urged last week upon a persuadable
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon has voted Democratic in the past three presidential
elections. Could its seven electoral votes be crucial?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush thinks so. He visited a Beaverton school here
this week to declare ``an education recession in America that
threatens our future.'' Tim Hibbitts, whose latest poll shows Nader
at 8 percent, says, ``Unless there's a big tide toward Bush, I
still think Gore will win Oregon and Washington state. But if it's
a close race _ say, 45-46 _ then you could say that Nader had done
Gore enormous damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's votes aren't all Gore's to lose, the pollster argues.
``About half will not vote for Gore or Bush. I've talked to them.
The message is they're both crooks and bums. About 3 percent of
that 8 might come back to Gore and about 1 percent are for Bush on
the theory that if we're going to have corruption, let's change
crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's political tradition is squeaky clean, which explains
why Clinton twice ran below his national average and why in 1988,
Michael Dukakis, with 51.3 percent, ran above his nationwide
average. Dukakis is a conspicuous critic of highways, which won him
votes in Portland, a public-transit paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy transit spending has made Portland what John Muir foresaw
in 1886: ``a telling picture of busy, aspiring civilization in the
midst of the green wilderness.'' A Massachusetts native, the late
Governor Tom McCall banished automobiles from the Willamette
riverbank, a walkway now named for him.
</P>
<P>
   McCall opened up the riverbank. Gore has opened up the strategic
oil reserve and doubts about his beliefs. As vice president he
often talked about suburban sprawl, but he seldom does today.
Beaverton, a Portland suburb of 54,000, has Nike headquarters and
Intel nearby. It resembles what Gore talked of in 1998, ``the
panorama of sprawl outside so many of our cities _ the chaotic,
ill-planned environment'' that ``makes us use up a quart of
gasoline to buy a quart of milk.'' Gore, vigorously pumping that
gas, risks losing the city and country vote because he needs
suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   At Nader's Portland headquarters, ``most people are concerned
about reclaiming democracy, which is the core issue of this
campaign,'' says Courtney Scott, who coordinates volunteers.
``Restoring democracy encompasses the environment. Politicians are
selling out the environment to the corporate interests, who are
buying the politicians who make the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   She faults the Democratic candidate on both issues, saying:
``What we've seen from Mr. Gore is rhetoric. I haven't seen any
action on the environment or on campaign finance reform. The
opportunities he had he didn't take.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nader campaign woos Gore's lukewarm supporters by saying
he'll win easily. ``Bush has shot himself in the foot several
times. Now he's aiming at his head,'' Scott says.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is also accustomed to three-party politics. Next month
marks the 100th birthday of Wayne L. Morse, who served in the US
Senate as a Republican, an Independent, and a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   As Hibbitts charts in his polls Nader's ups and downs, he points
out that the Green Party's 1996 base is already impressive: ``Four
percent? That ain't chopped liver in a presidential race.''

   WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-READINESS (Washington) _ Echoing charges from
Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush that U.S. military
readiness is slipping, the nation's top military officers told
Congress Wednesday that preparedness to fight has eroded to the
point that the Pentagon's main strategy of being able to win two
wars at once now carries high risk. By ERIC ROSENBERG.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-PRICES (Washington) _ A top Energy Department official says
that home heating oil prices will stabilize over the next several
months but that they likely will remain ``substantially'' higher
than last year. However, Robert S. Kripowicz, acting assistant
secretary for fossil energy, warned that President Clinton's
decision last week to release 30 million barrels of oil from the
nation's emergency reserve can't prevent price spikes caused by any
unusually cold winter or shipping disruptions. By MARK HELM.

   CAMPAIGN-ROUNDUP _ Vice President Al Gore stumped in Iowa for
his Medicare prescription drug plan while Texas Gov. George W. Bush
visited a Catholic school in South-Central Los Angeles, which he
called a ``beacon of hope.'' Meanwhile, Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.,
chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said
Republican chances of keeping control of the House were good,
regardless of whether Gore or Bush wins on Nov. 7. By DAN FREEDMAN.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   HELEN-THOMAS (Washington) _ Presidents traditionally revere
their mothers and rarely praise their fathers or even speak of
them. That may not be true in the future when so many modern
fathers are involved in hands-on parenting. But the stronger,
sometimes domineering, influence of mothers on sons who wound up in
the White House cannot be denied. We know every little boy can grow
up to be president, but it helps to have a wise mother on his side.
By HELEN THOMAS.
</P>
<P>
   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ As we head into the final month
of the presidential campaign, the race between Al Gore and George
W. Bush is very close and very confrontational. But the two
candidates lack the vision and the idealism that generate great
expectations within the electorate, especially among young
Americans. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (For release Sunday, Oct. 1.)

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... sold newspapers.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His rise was gritty. South Boston sports star, then basketball
fame at Providence College.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, he nosed into politics, ran for state representative
in 1970, and won.
</P>
<P>
   When the buses rolled into South Boston in 1973 with black
children on them, young Ray Flynn flared his nostrils. He wanted to
stop the buses. He wanted the white children to stay out of school.
Ray Flynn and Billy Bulger and James Kelly: the three anti-busing
horsemen of South Boston. ``I saw it as pitting poor against
poor,'' Flynn said. Many outside of Boston saw it as denying black
schoolchildren equal education. The city became an emblem. It
wasn't pretty. ``But even during busing,'' he said, ``I used to
play basketball every Sunday morning at the Roxbury Boys Club.''
</P>
<P>
   He got elected to the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Men change. Minds bend.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was pulling different coins from his pockets. He wanted
to heal, not divide. He pulled a black man from a mob on Boston
Common. He stopped railing against busing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 he got elected to City Hall. Mayor Ray Flynn. Silky
Kevin White went off to do other things.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor, Flynn would show up at fires. He'd hustle to food
kitchens to help. He prayed in black churches. You could have
called him Ray Fiorello LaGuardia James Michael Curley Richard
Daley Flynn. He had a hammer. And he had a feather. And suddenly,
he opened his eyes and had a city to behold, a city that believed
in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being mayor of a city is a spiritual thing. It's about
personal relationships with the people. It's whether or not you can
make them better people _ or help make them better people. It's not
about issues. It's not about the economy. It's not about bond
ratings. It's about what's important to people. And what's
important to people is being treated with dignity, and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a plunk from the Tobin Bridge on a cold January
morning in 1990. And with that, it looked as if Ray Flynn were
going to meet his Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three months earlier, in October, a man, white, said
another man, black, had shot and killed his pregnant wife. A black
man, William Bennett, became the ``prime'' suspect. Flynn had
demanded that police find the killer. The criminal justice system
and the media became embroiled in a terrifying whodunit that let
loose racial fears and political fingerpointing.
</P>
<P>
   After Charles Stuart apparently committed suicide with
prosecutors closing in on his deception, blacks were angry. Ray
Flynn walked the streets of Boston. There were those who wondered
anew where his heart and mind lay. They remembered busing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember somebody gave me advice, I think Mike Haynes,''
recalled Flynn of the minister of Twelfth Baptist Church. ``He
said, `Ray, you have credibility. Get out there and go to as many
meetings as you can. Get up there and explain how you feel. Don't
try to be cute. Listen to the people and answer their questions as
directly as you can.' In all the years in politics, that's the best
advice I'd ever been given.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to a community meeting in Mattapan. The people were
there. Waiting. Women with questions. Men with anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm not going to make a political statement. When you
want me to speak, I will. I will stay and answer every question.'
Some of the people in City Hall were telling me to forget the
meeting, let it all blow over. Toward the end, this woman, very
sophisticated, very polished, said, `Mr. Flynn I'm tired of the way
you've treated me, my family and the community.' She concluded her
speech by saying, `You have been doing this for 200 years.' I
thought there would be a thunderous reception, but there was dead
silence. She says, `Mr. Flynn, the reason why I'm saying this to
you is you're the only white politician who came into my community
and not only listened to us, but have spoken for us.' And with
that, the whole place erupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn walked tall again across his neighborhoods. It was still
his city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get comfort,'' he said, ``that even my harshest critics
who have never given me credit for anything have given me credit
for being a racial healer. That's the most important thing. Without
that, nothing works.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Flynn added, the Stuart saga has never let him
go. ``This guy was one of the most devious men you'd ever want to
meet,'' Flynn said of Stuart. ``I've retraced his whole life. He
was following the homicide rates in Mission Hill. I've spoken to
people he talked to. He knew crime statistics. He knew where there
had been drive-by shootings. . . . He knew the names of local
gangs. This, a guy from Reading! This, a guy who worked in a
prestigious fur store with a Newbury Street address! And this guy
is interested in gang stuff? Why? He figured he could get away with
murder. And almost did. I never talked about it till now. That's a
story the people deserve to know. This guy wasn't following the
stock exchange, mind you; he was following crime statistics in
Roxbury. He wanted people to believe this Camelot storybook
situation with his wife making a wrong turn in Roxbury. That the
best of their world had been in front of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn seems genuinely seized by his Stuart investigation. ``I'm
working like hell on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But politics is a complex business, and rarely a deathless one.
The Stuart imbroglio took a toll on Flynn, even if, at the time,
you couldn't quite see it in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In time, there were rumors that Ray Flynn wanted to go to
Washington if a Democrat won the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And the victorious Bill Clinton appointed him ambassador to the
Vatican. The job seemed tailor-made for an Irish Catholic from
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He warned Clinton: He was going to travel the world as
ambassador. And he did, hopping to India and Somalia from Rome,
feeding the hungry, hugging the desperate in refugee camps, looking
at bodies buried in the rubble of earthquakes. He had the power to
call in Black Hawk helicopters, and did. He loved it. Not the desk
work, but the sloshing through the mud, setting food before the
eyes of the hungry in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not such a big world'' after all, he said he felt at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   He moved things by the sweat of his brow. As he had done in
Boston. But the world wasn't Boston. Other diplomats were aghast at
his style. Meetings were missed. Cables went unwritten. There were
reports he was not handling all of his duties as ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't interested in being the pomp-and-circumstance kind of
ambassador, going to lavish cocktail receptions,'' he sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   The Accidental Diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Early into Clinton's second term, Ray Flynn bowed out. He
returned to Boston and announced a run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   His candidacy, however, could not get traction, particularly
after reports in the Globe giving harsh details of social drinking
while in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   So, unable to raise money fast enough, he dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Five years abroad, and he was like a stranger in his own town.
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly, though, he announced a run for Congress when
Joseph Kennedy declined to run again in the 8th District.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to many as if Ray Flynn were trying to put the sand
back in the hourglass.
</P>
<P>
   But where there had been populist magic before, now there were
wary voters. In the primary he came in a distant second in a field
of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Capuano: 19,446 votes; Flynn: 14,839 votes.
</P>
<P>
   He lost in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different area,'' he said. ``I did well in Roxbury. I
lost in Cambridge, Somerville, Belmont, areas I didn't know as
well. I did the best I could. I took a strong pro-life position. It
was different politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got hurt,'' he said of the Globe's reporting about
his drinking. ``And the people got hurt. I don't think anybody came
out of this thing looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he says he can't envision ever running for political office
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unfair to the family,'' he said of political life.
``They didn't ask to be in the limelight. My wife was never
interested in fame or notoriety. She's a wonderful wife, mother,
grandmother. Having said that, she was very supportive of what I
wanted to do. I was a fierce competitive athlete who drove myself
to become an All-American. I also had a fierce commitment to help
eradicate injustice and poverty. I'm not apologizing for that.
That's who I am. That's how I felt. If I just decided the political
world was going to be too mean and nasty for me, well, that's not
who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Flynn was once in New Jersey, hooping with Bill Bradley.
``We both said there's no experience like competitive sports. You
practice, sweat, there's pain. You go out on the court and lose.
And you pick yourself up. You look for the next game. You don't
dwell on the losses. You move forward. I think being an athlete was
the greatest preparation to being an important political figure. I
mean, you get hit in the nose with an elbow, you take the towel,
wipe away the blood, and get back out in the field.''

   He said that if the books and TV show ``take off,'' a larger
limelight could emerge for him again.

   ``In 1983,'' said Flynn, talking of the year of his rise, ``if
you were sitting in this house _ my wife, six children, no summer
home, no property anywhere else _ well, I'm trying to say I didn't
get into politics to make money or serve my own financial
interests. So it's clear why I served the people. I wanted
desperately for them to believe in me. We all need to believe in
something.''

MANY VOICES SPOIL THIS WRITER'S TALE

The Green Suit 
By Dwight Allen 
Algonquin Press of North Carolina, 274 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Literature is littered with lovable losers, but Peter Sackrider
is not one of them. He's not hateable, either; he's just weak,
feckless, and going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   At once, he is the best feature of ``The Green Suit,'' Dwight
Allen's first book, and a symbol of its shortcomings: He and other
Allen creations are well-drawn, but there's hardly a likable (let
alone admirable) soul in the lot.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Alex, is no fun, but at least she has the excuse of
being a depressive. His girlfriend, Rachel (after he'd left his
wife, abruptly, for some other woman), is dismissive. His mentor,
Harvey, talks at him, but doesn't see him.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion has to begin with Sackrider, a writer from
Kentucky who would now be 49 if he were real. ``The Green Suit'' is
a collection of stories spanning roughly 25 years, beginning in the
mid-1970s, when he's 23. His essential weakness is expressed in
myriad ways, but it's the day he's on the tennis court with Hal,
the boyhood friend who married Peter's girl, that the
characterization is clinched: Peter has won the first set easily,
and is up 3-0 in the second, when Hal says, ``This it it, Pedro.
This is your stop.'' Hal's play doesn't change, but on cue, Peter's
does. He starts hitting into the net or outside the lines, and he
leaves the loser.
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes in the fourth chapter, one of the opening
quintet in which Sackrider is narrator. Who's talking in ``The
Green Suit'' doesn't become an issue until Chapter 6, when Willie,
the stout black woman who kept house for the Sackriders for
decades, takes over, without warning. Three other women from
Sackrider's life each take a chapter before an unknown narrates
Chapter 10, and Sackrider returns for the finale.
</P>
<P>
   As a device, it falters. First, there is the confusion that
comes from beginning the voice-swapping after 134 pages, or about
half the book. The subsequent switches are less jarring, though
they require awkward little references to establish the narrator's
identity (as in the next chapter, when Claire, Peter's wife, whom
we're well familiar with, has to introduce him as her husband).
</P>
<P>
   The execution is faulty, too. Peter's voice in the first five
chapters is comfortable, which stands to reason because Allen is
also a white Kentuckian of middle age. But Willie's voice is
foreign, and when Sackrider's mother gets her turn, it seems off by
a quarter-turn, such as when she comments: ``There's light left in
the day, even if it's all squirrelly, flickering in the crowns of
the trees.'' She's suddenly wiser, cleverer, and more poetic than
we've been told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not Renata,'' the third chapter in the women's sequence,
offers the best of what the technique has to offer: Allen gets to
explore a memory of Sackrider's, mentioned secondarily in a
previous chapter, from the other character's perspective. But the
approach to it seems like an inside joke: She's ``not Renata''
because Sackrider, when he fictionalized their break-up, changed
her name from Nora Sue. She read the story, and now gets to
respond. It suggests that Allen is writing about writing about a
break-up.
</P>
<P>
   A pleasant commonality of these stories, most of which have been
published individually in journals, is their richness of nature.
Allen clearly knows his flora, and he may have a thing for snakes,
which slither in on three separate occasions.
</P>
<P>
   In his choices of words, Allen is generally successful. There's
a charming folksiness that's becoming to a story that springs from
the South, such as when a boy's feet are ``as white as eggs under
refrigerator light.'' And he captures an essence when Sackrider
opens the room of a friend's brother who's away in Vietnam: ``The
air felt ancient, as if it were being preserved for Harry to
breathe when he came back.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he likens a house of cards to a ziggurat, he's hardly
helping, and when he writes, ``Alex gave Bernardo a long look, like
what a child might give a comedian who is perhaps not a comedian,''
he's not helping at all.

RAISING EYEBROWS IS HER JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much thought do you give your eyebrows?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in my case, is not much, and nowhere near enough by
Robyn Cosio's standards. Cosio is perhaps the premier eyebrow
stylist working today. I say ``perhaps'' because there are many
other acclaimed eyebrow stylists in cities across the land. So far,
though, Cosio is the only one to have produced a book, a handsomely
illustrated coffee-table number titled, simply, ``The Eyebrow''
(HarperCollins, $30).
</P>
<P>
   We are living in a New Golden Age of the Eyebrow, according to
Cosio, and she should know. She has a long list of celebrity
clients in New York and Los Angeles, and her services are coveted
by ordinary mortals willing to pay $65 for a five-minute eyebrow
tuneup. (By contrast, Tammy Giuoag, of Perfect Nail, named Boston's
best eyebrow artist by Boston Magazine, charges a mere $10 for 20
minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eyebrow,'' written with the help of Cynthia Robins, traces
the eyebrow's march through history, from ancient Egypt to the
present. Eyebrows, Cosio observes, are ``iconic.'' I assume she
means iconic in the profane sense, not the sacred. But perhaps not,
considering her reverential tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each period,'' she writes, ``the eyebrow, the chief
indicator of emotion and expression on the face, has spoken louder
than any word that has issued from the lips.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess it must be true, if Cosio says so. Although I confess
the importance of the eyebrow came as a surprise, until I recalled
something Virginia Kelley, late mother of President Clinton, wrote
in her autobiography, ``Leading With My Heart'': ``Do you know how
bald you look from your chin to your hairline if you don't have
eyebrows? They're put there for a reason, to hold your face
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Nature shortchanged Kelley in the eyebrow department, and she
lamented the time lost in a lifetime of drawing on eyebrows. ``No
telling what I could have accomplished in this world if I had been
born with eyebrows,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She was being a little hard on herself. After all, most of us
born with eyebrows to spare won't manage to rear a future US
president. But I understand what she was getting at because
sometimes I think I might have done more with my life if I hadn't
wasted so much time worrying about hair, weight, skin, teeth, and
all the other areas of concern that make self-maintenance
practically a full-time job. And just when you think you have
things more or less in perspective, up pops something like Cosio's
book to remind you that there's another area you've neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Before I added ``eyebrow job'' to the ever-lengthening list of
things-I'll-never-get-around-to I turned to the do-it- yourself
section and Cosio's instructions for creating what she calls ``your
perfect fantasy brow.'' How hard could it be?
</P>
<P>
   Step 1. I stared into a hand mirror while asking a long series
of penetrating eyebrow-related questions: Do my eyes look too close
together? Is one eyebrow thicker than the other? Do they march
across my nose? etc.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2. I took a pencil and, following Cosio's instructions,
held the lower end to the side of my nose, and moved the upper end
across my eyebrow trying, and failing, to locate the elusive
``perfect arch.''
</P>
<P>
   Three pages of detailed instructions later my perfect fantasy
brow remained a fantasy and $65 for five minutes of eyebrow
trimming was beginning to look like a bargain. Maybe that was
Cosio's plan.

OLD BONDS BETWEEN BLACK, ASIANS REEMERGE IN POP CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say write what you know, and that's exactly what Chi Muoi
Lo (CHEE MOY LOW) did when he scribbled out the screenplay for his
new movie, ``Catfish in Black Bean Sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by and starring Lo, tells the story of two
Vietnamese orphans adopted by an African-American family. OK, so Lo
wasn't adopted, but when his parents and 12 siblings immigrated to
the United States from Vietnam in 1975, the US government plopped
the family down in a predominantly African-American neighborhood in
West Philadelphia. ``I grew up with all African-American friends,
girlfriends, and surrogate mothers,'' remembers Lo, 31, speaking
from his Los Angeles office.
</P>
<P>
   He recreates that world, perched at the intersection of Asian
and African culture, in ``Catfish.'' This cross-cultural
intermingling is increasingly being explored not only in films, but
in music, and is also reflected in general lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Catfish'' and the upcoming ``Brother'' _ the
first American movie by Japanese star Takeshi ``Beat'' Kitano that
features African-American actor Omar Epps _ movie audiences have
watched Forest Whitaker zen out in ``Ghost Dog,'' Aaliyah and Jet
Li make like in ``Romeo Must Die,'' and Chris Tucker and Jackie
Chan goof off in ``Rush Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as musical acts the Wu-Tang Clan and Sisqo incorporate
Chinese culture into their imagery, a growing number of
Asian-American musicians are mixing Korean music with hip-hop or
rapping about the forced relocation of Japanese-Americans during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Pro basketball players Allen Iverson and Marcus Camby even go so
far as to etch Chinese symbols onto their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may dismiss this trend as shallow, ephemeral
pop-cultural sampling. But the current intermixing scratches the
surface of a shared history that blossomed at least 500 years ago,
when Chinese and East Africans began trading goods with each other.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Building bonds
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an age-old story,'' says Lisa Yun, a professor at SUNY
Binghamton, who wrote about this subject in a recent issue of Black
Issues Book Review magazine. ``It's just that we have nationally
tried to erase it from the history books.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the strong bonds exist, she says. ``You have these
communities in New Orleans, Filipino Creoles who have been there
for generations. You have Afro-Chinese from Jamaica, black Chinese
from Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   And today's mixed-race generation is increasingly getting face
time in the media. Every time Tiger Woods swats a golf ball, we see
the scion of a black father and Thai mother. Hip-hop mogul Russell
Simmons makes the social rounds with his model-wife Kimora Lee,
who's a mix of Korean/Japanese and African-American ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   So what's inspiring this cultural and emotional interaction?
``We're people that have a lot more similarities than
differences,'' Lo explains, mentioning among the former the
importance of strong family ties and the common experience of being
an oppressed group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both warriors,'' notes Tracii McGregor, editorial
director of the Source Publications, which publishes hip-hop
magazine the Source. ``Our history is very similar.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chinese immigrants first came to California in the 1800s,
Yun explains, they experienced segregation and were not allowed to
vote. ``All the laws that applied to blacks at that time were
applied to the first Asians who were coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Catfish'' stands out from many films featuring black and Asian
casts by showing realistic emotional exchanges between the two
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Lo's character, Dwayne, frets over a loving, though troubled,
relationship with his African-American girlfriend (Sanaa Lathan).
Audiences see genuine affection between Dwayne and his
African-American parents (Mary Alice and Paul Winfield), something
that didn't happen in the Asian/African-American twist on Romeo and
Juliet, ``Romeo Must Die.'' That film transformed the star-crossed
lovers into the daughter of a mob boss and a quick-kicking son of a
Chinese mafia leader. By focusing on crime and kung-fu, Lo says,
the movie ``basically uses the two major stereotypes of our
culture, combines it together, and says, `OK, we can accept you
guys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's attitudes like this that makes Yun disdainfully call some
of these exchanges ``trendy fetishizing of interracial
relationships.'' But in another breath she speaks with wonderment
of the trend's effect: ``More people are talking to each other and
asking the question, `What are the possibilities if we actually
spoke to one another beyond cultural sampling?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Answers are appearing with more and more frequency. An
exhibition at New York City's Caribbean Cultural Center next year
will explore Asian contributions to Caribbean culture in the areas
of film, music, and the visual arts. Meanwhile, at Columbia
University, a conference in November will feature black and Asian
scholars discussing their common bonds in education, music, sports,
and religion. In Washington, D.C., Bill Lan Lee works as acting
assistant attorney general for civil rights, a position long
associated with African-Americans.

   Such rapproachements don't mean there aren't tensions between
the groups. Relations hit a low point during the Los Angeles riots,
when African-Americans targeted Korean-owned grocery stores. In one
``Catfish'' scene, Dwayne's birth mother expresses mute shock when
she discovers her children's adopted parents are black.
</P>
<P>
   With that look, Lo wanted to address the racism sometimes
exhibited by immigrant Asians when they come to the United States.
It was a controversial choice within the Asian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people coming to me, usually the younger
generation, glad that I had pointed that out,'' says Lo, whose film
has already been released in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles.
``The older generation resents that I pointed it out. The fact is .
. . we don't talk about Asian prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Yun blames the intolerance on both sides on what she calls
``identity politicians'' who sow seeds of discord by stressing
cultural differences that often devolve into stereotypes. They
paint Asians as the ``model minorities'' and African-Americans as
the troublemaking upstarts.

<P>
   Mixing it up
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Protesters of Asian and African descent tried to overcome those
divisions in the 1960s and 1970s, says Yun, when political
movements attracted people from a variety of cultural backgrounds.
It was Japanese-American activist Yuri Kochiyama who cradled
Malcolm X as he lay dying in the Audubon Ballroom. Yun credits the
nostalgia for that period with jump-starting the current
cross-cultural intermixing.
</P>
<P>
   New York Knicks player Marcus Camby developed his love of
Chinese culture the way many African-Americans do: by watching
kung-fu movies. Now he has Chinese characters tattooed on his right
arm, while pop singer Sisqo uses a dragon as his personal insignia.
Some members of the Wu-Tang Clan even study martial arts under a
Shaolin monk.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing number of Asian-Americans are dipping into
African-American culture by way of hip-hop, gospel, and jazz. The
New York group Jamez mixes a musical cauldron of traditional Korean
music and hip-hop, San Francisco recently hosted its 19th
Asian-American jazz festival, and a church in Harlem teaches a
growing number of Japanese how to sing gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all this ethnic intermingling can go to one's head.
Lo's multicultural upbringing led him straight to an identity
crisis by the time he was a teenager. Since then, he's fashioned an
easy truce between those influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about being myself is I am able to take all the
good things about different cultures,'' says Lo.
</P>
<P>
   That ability shows as he melds African and Asian-American
culture in ``Catfish and Black Bean Sauce.'' After all, it's what
Lo knows.

bc-LADN-
cc,78p3 Celebrate Rosh Hashanah with variations on traditional fare 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
(Eds: WITH SIDEBAR, `SPOTLIGHT ON...') 
ART AVAILABLE 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tradition is an important part of holiday celebrations, but
sometimes it's nice to break with tradition, updating the meal with
new and different creations.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Faye Levy suggests in her new cookbook ``1,000
Jewish Recipes'' (IDG Books Worldwide, Inc.; $35).
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to cook something interesting for the holiday and don't
do the same food every year,'' says the Woodland Hills author.
</P>
<P>
   For the coming celebration of Rosh Hashanah (which begins at
sundown Friday), Levy suggests serving a sea bass prepared with
either fillets or steaks, over rice pilaf studded with golden
raisins, dried cherries or cranberries, and toasted pistachios.
Although Levy's recipe, based on one she tasted at a Moroccan
Jewish home in Paris, calls for simmering the fish right in the
sauce, it's feasible to prepare the sauce separately in advance
(keep refrigerated or frozen) and serve it hot or cold over the
fish, which can be grilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish is very traditional for Rosh Hashanah, as it represents
abundance and fertility,'' notes Levy.
</P>
<P>
   With it, try a colorful and flavorful vegetable salad. In
keeping with the holiday tradition of using sweet vegetables, it
contains plenty of fresh corn and red bell peppers.
</P>
<P>
   For Rosh Hashanah, Levy likes to make a cake topped with a
chocolate-based Honey Ganache. Pecans add the attractive finishing
touches.
</P>
<P>
   Or try candy balls that team sweet wine with two kinds of
chocolate, dried apricots and cookie crumbs that are rolled in
chopped almonds. The versatile recipe lends itself to variations in
dried fruits (try dried cherries or cranberries), liquid (use
orange or any fruit juice, or honey in place of wine), sweetener
(use jam or honey in place of sugar) and crumbs (use cake instead
of cookie). For variety, roll the balls in coconut or sifted cocoa
instead of nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The 625-page book is a treasure trove of kosher recipes running
the gamut from those for Jewish holidays to ideas to enliven
everyday and special occasion fare for family and friends. An
invaluable reference source for rituals and traditions, it also
includes chapters on Keeping Kosher and Stocking the Jewish Pantry.
</P>
<P>
   Levy hopes the book will help dispel the misconception that
Jewish food is time-consuming to prepare, boring, bland, unhealthy
and heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous it isn't anything like that. Jewish food is
varied, flavorful, fresh and exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Jewish cooking reflects the influences of many cultures
Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Eastern and Central European and
more so do Levy's recipes.
</P>
<P>
   When she lived in Tel Aviv, each of the four floors of her
apartment building had different aromas wafting from the kitchens.
``There was a Moroccan family on one floor and Yemenites and
Tunisians each on two other floors and all cooked differently and
it was all Jewish food with a wide array of seasonings and flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fascinated by the food. I thought the food I grew up on
was Jewish food, but I found out that people in Israel cook their
own style of Jewish food like Moroccan Jewish, Indian Jewish,
Yemenite Jewish, Romanian Jewish, Hungarian Jewish, Iraqi Jewish,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   All of these cultural tastes flavor her book. But the Old World
labor-intensive techniques have been left behind. Levy has
streamlined and modernized recipes and procedures to use the latest
kitchen equipment and gadgets that fit into the lifestyles of
today's cooks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``for gefilte fish, people used to buy a whole
fish, fillet and chop it by hand and it would take forever to make.
Now I buy fillets and use the food processor. However, I also like
to buy a whole fish, but I have the fish man bone it for me and
give me the bones so I can make stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy also relies on convenience foods when practical, such as
canned unsalted broths, canned tomatoes, canned beans, canned corn,
frozen vegetables and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The book is geared to both novice and accomplished cooks. To
make the recipes easy to use in kosher menus, each is coded with
``M'' for meat, ``D'' for dairy or ``P'' for pareve. Notes about
serving, ingredients and origins also accompany the recipes and
make for some interesting reading. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
CORN, SWEET PEPPER AND GREEN BEAN SALAD &QR; 
1 1/2 pounds green beans, ends removed and halved &QR; 
2 cups fresh (2 large ears) OR frozen corn kernels &QR; 
Water &QR; 
2 large red OR orange bell peppers, cut into strips &QR; 
1/4 cup minced green onions &QR; 
2 OR 3 tablespoons vegetable oil OR olive oil &QR; 
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste &QR; 
1 tablespoon fresh lime OR lemon juice OR dry white wine
(optional) &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Cook beans and corn in a saucepan of boiling salted water about
5 minutes or until beans are crisp-tender. Rinse under cold water
until cool and drain well. Transfer to a large bowl. Add red
pepper, green onions and oil. Season with salt and pepper.
Refrigerate until ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   A short time before serving, add lime juice and add more
seasoning if necessary. Serve cold or at room temperature. Makes 4
servings. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
SEA BASS IN SAFFRON-TOMATO SAUCE &QR; 
1/8 teaspoon saffron threads &QR; 
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil &QR; 
1 medium onion, chopped &QR; 
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper &QR; 
1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and pureed OR 1
(28-ounce) and 1 (14-ounce) can plum tomatoes, drained and pureed &QR; 
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste &QR; 
1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds sea bass fillets or steaks, about 1-inch
thick &QR; 
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil OR Italian parsley &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Slightly crush saffron with your fingers and soak in oil in a
small cup about 20 minutes. Transfer saffron oil to a large saute
pan or skillet and cook briefly over low heat. Add onion and bell
pepper and saute over medium-low heat about 5 minutes or until
onion begins to turn golden. Add tomatoes, salt and pepper and cook
over medium-high heat, stirring often, 8 to 10 minutes or until
thick.
</P>
<P>
   Add sea bass in one layer to sauce and sprinkle with salt and
pepper. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, spooning sauce over
fish from time to time, about 10 minutes or until thickest part of
fish becomes opaque inside; check with a sharp knife. Taste sauce
and adjust seasoning. Stir 2 tablespoons basil gently into sauce.
Serve hot or cold, sprinkled with remaining basil. Makes 4 main
course or about 6 fish-course servings. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
COCOA APPLESAUCE CAKE WITH HONEY GANACHE &QR; 
3 cups all-purpose flour &QR; 
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder &QR; 
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon &QR; 
2 teaspoons baking soda &QR; 
1 cup vegetable oil &QR; 
2 cups sugar &QR; 
2 large eggs &QR; 
2 cups unsweetened applesauce &QR; 
1/2 cup chopped pecans, plus extra chopped pecans and pecan halves
for garnish &QR; 
Honey Ganache &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grease and flour a 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Sift flour with
cocoa, cinnamon and baking soda into a medium bowl. Beat oil with
sugar and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until pale
and fluffy. Stir flour mixture alternately with applesauce into egg
mixture and mix well, either on low speed of mixer or with a wooden
spoon. Stir in 1/2 cup chopped pecans.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake in preheated 350-degree
oven 35 to 45 minutes or until a cake tester inserted in cake's
center comes out clean. Cool in pan on a rack about 20 minutes or
until just warm. Turn out onto a rack or leave in the pan; cool
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare Honey Ganache. Then, spread in a thin layer over top of
cake. Sprinkle top with chopped pecans and decorate with pecan
halves.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate cake about 2 hours before serving. Makes 16 to 20
servings.
</P>
<P>
   HONEY GANACHE: Bring 1/2 cup whipping cream, nondairy creamer OR
nondairy rice milk to a boil in a small, heavy saucepan. Remove
from heat and immediately add 6 ounces finely chopped semisweet
chocolate. Using a small whisk, stir quickly until chocolate is
completely melted and mixture is smooth. Transfer to a bowl. Cool
to room temperature. Using an electric mixer, whip mixture at high
speed about 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cream 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter OR margarine,
slightly softened, in a large bowl with an electric mixer until
very soft and smooth. Beat in chocolate mixture in 3 batches. Beat
well until frosting is smooth. Gradually beat in 3 tablespoons plus
1 teaspoon honey until blended. Makes about 1 1/2 cups, enough for
top of a 13x9x2-inch cake.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Cake batter can also be baked in a 10-inch springform pan
as in photo. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven about 1 1/4 to 1/2
hours or until done, checking often near end of baking time (cover
top of cake with foil if it seems to be cooking too quickly). Cool
and frost as directed above. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
CHOCOLATE-APRICOT WINE BALLS &QR; 
1/2 cup diced dried apricots &QR; 
1/2 cup sweet wine OR orange juice &QR; 
4 ounces bittersweet OR semisweet chocolate, chopped &QR; 
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder &QR; 
2 tablespoons sugar &QR; 
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) butter OR margarine, at room temperature
and cut into pieces &QR; 
3/4 to 1 cup cookie crumbs &QR; 
1 1/2 cups (about) chopped blanched almonds &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Combine apricots and wine in a jar and cover. Shake, then let
stand about 1 hour. Remove apricots, reserving wine.
</P>
<P>
   Heat chocolate, cocoa, sugar and reserved wine in a medium,
heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring often, until chocolate
melts. Remove from heat and add butter. Stir until melted. Stir in
cookie crumbs and apricots. Mix well. Refrigerate 30 to 45 minutes
or until firm enough to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Put almonds in a shallow bowl or tray. Shape chocolate mixture
into balls, using about 2 teaspoons for each. Roll balls in
almonds. Set candies on plates. Refrigerate 1 hour before serving.
Serve in foil or paper candy cups. Makes about 30 candies. &QL;

Sydney. She since has refused to eat and has lost 15 pounds from
her 115-pound frame. Her coach has been spoonfeeding her. One of

``time out'' from politics, which he announced after losing in the
1999 election to Ehud Barak, will likely end soon. Netanyahu, the
man Israelis either love or love to hate, was in the United States,
but he is expected to return and start trying to knock off those
that stand in his way _ first Likud Party icon Ariel Sharon and
then, in expected early elections, Barak. (Kaplow, Cox News

   FOOD-BELGIAN _ When the Crown Prince and Princess of Belgium
announced they'll visit New York this fall, it made the cover page
headlines of the New York Times, in part because Belgium is so in,
especially when it comes to food. The number of Belgian restaurants
in the big apple have jumped from 4 in the early 90s to nearly 20
now. The latest power lunch in Washington is a French/Belgian
bistoro. And Atlanta's first Belgian bistro hit the scene earlier
this year. There's more to the food than waffles and brussel
sprouts. Their twice-fried fries set the standard and mussels are
magnificent. Belgian beers are popping up in bars around, town,
too. w/recipes and sidebar on belgian beer by Bob Townsend.

light to wash over me, cleanse me of sticky summer, show me fresh
views of the garden. So, on some days I become my father when he
was an old man, going to bed with nightfall, rising early, getting
to the garden as often as I can, staying as long as light lasts _
and beyond. How ironic that there's less light just when lower
temperatures make being outside more bearable. (May, Atlanta

   MILITARY-READINESS (Washington) _ Echoing charges from
Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush that U.S. military
readiness is slipping, the nation's top military officers told
Congress Wednesday that preparedness to fight has eroded to the
point that the Pentagon's main strategy of being able to win two
wars at once now carries high risk. By ERIC ROSENBERG.

<P>
   OIL-PRICES (Washington) _ A top Energy Department official says
that home heating oil prices will stabilize over the next several
months but that they likely will remain ``substantially'' higher
than last year. However, Robert S. Kripowicz, acting assistant
secretary for fossil energy, warned that President Clinton's
decision last week to release 30 million barrels of oil from the
nation's emergency reserve can't prevent price spikes caused by any
unusually cold winter or shipping disruptions. By MARK HELM.

   HELEN-THOMAS (Washington) _ Presidents traditionally revere
their mothers and rarely praise their fathers or even speak of
them. That may not be true in the future when so many modern
fathers are involved in hands-on parenting. But the stronger,
sometimes domineering, influence of mothers on sons who wound up in
the White House cannot be denied. We know every little boy can grow
up to be president, but it helps to have a wise mother on his side.
By HELEN THOMAS.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ As we head into the final month
of the presidential campaign, the race between Al Gore and George
W. Bush is very close and very confrontational. But the two
candidates lack the vision and the idealism that generate great
expectations within the electorate, especially among young
Americans. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (For release Sunday, Oct. 1.)

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Regarding that form of drug known as
``performance enhancing,'' there is only one claim I would
definitely believe from any athlete:
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, Chief, I slurp 'em up like corn flakes. I can't
wait to finish talking to you so I can go get me some more.''
</P>
<P>
   That person I would believe.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it's better to not say anything. If you haven't
touched off the alarms, like some hapless tourist trying to enter
Olympic Park with a manhole-sized 50-cent coin in your pocket, just
keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   If they haven't busted you, don't make rash statements. Don't
hold news conferences. Don't release your latest urinalysis
printouts. I don't want to know. Just keep running or jumping or
flinging heavy weights into the atmosphere, whatever your redeeming
social value may be.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if this is your thing, keep jogging around the premises with
your burly significant other strapped onto your back. This
brand-new Olympic event is currently being performed by Marion
Jones, the latest ``Perils of Pauline'' heroine to capture the
imagination, the sympathy, of the world during these Final Days
(how biblical) of these Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   First Cathy Freeman survived her frigid dousing from the
artificial Olympic rain forest during the opening ceremony, and won
a gold medal. Then Marie-Jose Perec did not survive the goblins,
external or internal, that pursued her, and she got outta town. Now
it is Marion Jones' soap opera, and welcome to it.
</P>
<P>
   Jones became a candidate for Oprah, or maybe even Springer, on
Monday when it was announced that her husband, C.J. Hunter, had
been busted for testing positive. He's a very large person who
throws the shot. He says the stuff probably got into his system
through some nutritional supplement he was taking. I say,
yeah-yeah-yeah.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal about Hunter, but because I suspect many
athletes are ingesting or inoculating all kinds of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday we witnessed the weird spectacle of a former
world-record holder, Mihaela Melinte of Romania, being escorted off
the infield moments before she was to commence throwing the hammer.
Melinte has been suspended for testing positive for nandrolone _
the very same substance that was found in Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt she has her explanation, but Hunter surely did not get
much sympathy from the members of the International Olympic
Committee, who are becoming world-class skeptics. There is plenty
to be skeptical about.
</P>
<P>
   There was a story in the paper the other day that workers in the
Athletes' Village were concerned after finding syringes in the
bedsheets and towels and general detritus of the residents. At
least one worker was pricked, a scary prospect in this day and age.
It is doubtful there are that many diabetics in the village, and
besides, people with real medical needs tend to be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the athletes only mirror the rest of us, a world
full of chemical junkies, gobbling one thing or another for the
sniffles or the pips or the blues or the skinny biceps or whatever
it is we think ails us.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes can only hope their chemists are on top of their game,
unlike the blithering idiot of a doctor who apparently or allegedly
gave cold medicine to the 16-year-old gymnastics gold medalist from
Romania, Andreea Raducan.
</P>
<P>
   The kid had to cough up her gold medal because we're all on the
lookout for drug cheats. It's all so sad, but what are you going to
do? When they wake us up in the middle of the night in Seoul or
Sydney and say, hey, they just busted Ben Johnson, or Marion Jones'
husband, the whole world goes on drug alert. What a bore.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has no known history of dabbling with forbidden
fruit, had to pursue her dream of five gold medals while dealing
with the busting of her husband. Goodness only knows whether she
was aware of it. Husbands don't necessarily tell their wives
everything they do.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Jones stood by her man at a news conference.
Wednesday she had to qualify in two more events, a long day at the
Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 11 a.m., she ran the first heat of the women's
200-meter qualifier, finishing in 22.75 seconds, not exactly
gold-medal-final pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said all along this would be my hardest day at the
Olympics,'' Jones said. ``The heats and the long jump. I took it
easy in my race, and now I'll try to stay off my feet for a few
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   She came back in the evening and qualified for the finals. Then
she qualified for the long-jump final round in her first qualifying
jump and got off her feet again. She's carrying a lot of weight
around these days.

GARDNER OF U.S. STARTLES WRESTLING WORLD WITH GOLD MEDAL VICTORY

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The wrestling behemoths stood side-by-side
during introductions, diplaying two distinct versions of 286-pound
physiques. On the left was the lean and sculpted Siberian tax
officer complete with snarl. On the right, with his hands clasped
before him, was a bulky slab of prime Wyoming beef who looked like
a shy kid with too much baby fat.
</P>
<P>
   Rulon Gardner knows how his roundish 29-year-old frame appears.
``Yeah, people make fun of me, like I ate a little kid and he's in
my chest,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know it, but that enormous 54-inch chest guards a
pair of lungs harnessing a deep reservoir of aerobic strength that
would be his weapon of endurance against his opponent, Alexander
Karelin, the emperor of Greco-Roman wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of the most startling upsets in Olympic wrestling
history, Gardner defeated Karelin, 1-0, in overtime of the
130-kilogram (286-pound) final, blocking Karelin's attempted march
to a fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal. It was at least the
most surprising since Andrej Wronski of Poland won the Greco-Roman
heavyweight title in 1988 with no previous international titles.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin had never lost in international competition, and had not
lost at all since 1987. That loss was to a Soviet wrestler, back
when there was a Soviet Union, a still-standing Berlin Wall and a
cold war. For sheer surprise, Gardner's victory over such an
overwhelming favorite may rival the U.S. hockey team's upset of the
Soviet team at the 1980 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was a first-time Olympian, but he said he felt unusually
calm as he faced Karelin, an ease of mind doubtlessly unlike many
of Karelin's victims since 1987. When Karelin was starting his
13-year unbeaten streak, Gardner was milking cows, baling hay and
shoving rocks on his family's struggling dairy farm in tiny Afton,
Wyo., completely unaware of the terror of Karelin's signature
reverse body lift. It wasn't until 1992 that Gardner said he'd even
heard of a mighty Russian wrestler with Herculean strength but
didn't know his name. By 1995, Gardner knew who he was. By then,
Karelin had won gold in Seoul and Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a single, unbroken path to wrestling for Gardner.
At the University of Nebraska, he was the lineman who got away from
then coach Tom Osborne. Had Osborne matched the size of his
wrestling scholarship, Gardner might be fending off Jevon Kearse,
not grappling with Karelin.
</P>
<P>
   Now they were on a stage in Australia, in an exposition hall
packed with fans including Henry Kissinger and Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And Karelin was expected to fling Gardner, best known for
winning two Pan American championships, about the yellow and red
mat and return to Novosibirsk in Siberia with his fourth gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   But nine minutes later, there was Gardner exulting with a
somersault and a cartwheel. He had beaten Karelin by never letting
the Siberian toss him, turn him, take him down or flip him on his
head. Karelin was incapable of getting a firm or lasting grip on
the elusive Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   They pushed and poked each other relentlessly but Karelin failed
to gain an advantage even when grabbing Gardner's shaved head in
his big mitts. Nothing worked. Karelin lifted Gardner twice, but
Gardner's bulkiness, that huge chest, that center of gravity, kept
him grounded. In Greco-Roman wrestling, holds are not permitted
below the waist.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Big Man made a mistake. In a clinch with Gardner
for a minute to start the second three-minute round, he released
his lock. Gardner's coaches roared to the referee that he had
earned a point. The clock stopped, the three officials conferred
and gave Gardner the only point he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on that almost every day in practice,'' Gardner said.
``In the semis, I lost a point in a clinch. I have no idea why he
broke the clinch. I knew he broke it, but I thought he was going to
throw me and I thought: `Oh, no. What if the tape doesn't show he
broke the clinch?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner compared battling Karelin to moving a reluctant horse
where it doesn't want to go. But no, he amended the thought. A cow,
not a horse. ``If you get a chance,'' he said, ``go up against a
cow and push it. Just experience pushing a cow, to get her to move
where you need her, and that's what he's like. Only he's a bit
quicker. No, a lot quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe Karelin was tired after two matches Wednesday. Even
Goliath's knees start creaking. A Russian journalist joked that
Karelin may have been distracted by his duties in the lower house
of the Duma, the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin took his loss with class, placing his right hand on his
heart to acknowledge the fans simultaneously roaring in amazement
that he had lost while saluting his former invincibility. Then he
disappeared without a word.
</P>
<P>
   For Gardner, there was plenty to say, though, and plenty of
support. His parents, Reed and Virginia, four sisters and three
brothers were there. They and seven more members of the Gardner
family had scraped together the money to stand by Rulon.
</P>
<P>
   As his son cheerfully and skillfully talked with a horde of
reporters almost as large as Afton's population, Reed stood apart,
an American flag draped from his left shoulder down to his waist.
He held it in place with his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Gardner talked about hard times on the farm, of living
year-to-year, ``struggling to stay alive and hope next year will be
better.'' All the kids have left the farm, save Rulon, who runs it
now while his father helps out.
</P>
<P>
   His father remembered when Rulon, the youngest of his nine
children was chubby and quiet and easy for other boys to tease
</P>
<P>
   Reed Gardner said that his son's one defeat by Karelin three
years ago was a whupping to build on, an indelible memory of
frightening strength. Certainly, Karelin was not an abiding
obsession, as he was to Matt Ghaffari, the effusive Iranian-born
U.S. wrestler who lost the Olympic gold medal match to Karelin in
1996. ``As far as Alexander Karelin intimidating Rulon,'' Reed
Gardner said, ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was asked if he had sensed Karelin backing off,
surrendering, in the waning moments? Yes, he said, but added that
he had to be ready ``for one last explosion.'' But somewhere in
those final seconds, he said, Karelin mumbled something in Russian.
``I think,'' Rulon Gardner said, ``it was basically, `I give up.'''

RUSSIANS AND FORMER RUSSIANS SHINE IN BOXING; 3 U.S. FIGHTERS MOVE
ON 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ They come from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan,
Uzbekistan, Ukraine and Russia, burly men who fight with a
relentless, intractable boxing style. On the 12th day of the 2000
Olympic boxing tournament, in a headstrong march through the
quarterfinals, it was the fighters from the countries formed by the
breakup of the Soviet Union that imposed a new pecking order on the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The once invincible Cuban boxers lost four consecutive
quarterfinal bouts and the Americans got back in the medal hunt
with three fighters _ Ricardo Juarez, Ricardo Williams Jr. and
Jermain Taylor _ advancing. But when the day ended, with the
semifinals set in 12 weight classes, the talk was no longer of the
rivalry between the United States and Cuba, it was about the
widespread improvement in fighters from nations that had once
fought under one federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you had one guy from the Soviet Union to get
past in each division,'' Tom Mustin, the U.S. boxing coach, said.
``Now, realistically, there's four or five of them from what used
to be the Soviet Union. And they're all good. Real good.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fighters from Russia, Ukraine and
Kazakhstan won one gold medal each. Cuba won four gold medals and
three silver. The United States won one gold medal and four bronze
medals.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sydney Games, Russia has placed seven fighters in the
semifinals, more than any other country. Five fighters from Ukraine
have advanced to the medal round as well, four from Kazakhstan,
three from Uzbekistan and one each from Georgia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has six semifinalists and the United States has four,
including bantamweight Clarence Vinson, who will face Cuba's
Guillermo Rigondeaux Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Since both losing fighters in the semifinals receive bronze
medals that means the countries from the former Soviet Union are
assured of winning 21 boxing medals at this year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are brawlers and they're extra strong,'' Mustin
said. ``They probably do a lot of weight lifting and neck exercises
because punches don't seem to affect them. They walk through them
and keep hitting you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustin plans to get some head-to-head competition with Russia or
Kazakhstan in the coming non-Olympic years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to bring those guys in for some dual meets,'' he said.
``They are also fighting rougher _ more pushing and shoving and
pulling a guy's head down. And we've got to get used to that, learn
some of that. In U.S. amateur boxing, we fight relatively clean.
But you can see in these fights, they're letting more of that go.
We've got to adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for Mustin's team, something the U.S. fighters
needed after their team captain, Michael Bennett, was eliminated by
Cuba's heavyweight, Felix Savon, on Tuesday. Middleweight Jeff Lacy
was also soundly beaten on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest U.S. victory Wednesday came from Juarez, a
featherweight who defeated Somluck Kamsing of Thailand, a gold
medalist in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez, a reigning world champion, was behind on points, 11-9,
midway through the third round. But Juarez unleashed a 10-second
flurry of punches, chasing Kamsing from the center of the ring to
the ropes and keeping him there where he landed eight unanswered
punches. The fight was stopped in the fourth round because Juarez
was ahead by 15 points, 31-16. In the Olympics, fights are stopped
if one boxer is behind by 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Kamsing was 6 inches taller than the 5-foot-3-inch, 125-pound
Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough situation,'' Juarez said. ``But I'm pretty
tough, too. I don't worry about taller opponents, at my height,
everyone is taller.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, meanwhile, predicted he would win the middleweight
division after his convincing 19-14 victory over Germany's Adnan
Catic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going all the way,'' Taylor said. ``I'm going to win the
gold medal, I feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was expected to have to face Cuba's Juan Hernandez in the
next round. But Hernandez, a world champion who had several
commanding victories in the last two weeks, lost to Yermakhan
Ibraimov of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Williams will face Cuba's Diogenes Luna in the welterweight
semifinals. Luna won his quarterfinal Wednesday with a knockout,
which is unusual in amateur boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can hit, but he also can be hit,'' Williams said of Luna.
``He takes a lot of punches and I'm going to feed him a lot of
leather.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was involved in a close fight with Russia's Leonov
Alexandre when he outpointed Alexandre, 7-1, in the third round.
Mustin calls Williams the U.S. team's most talented fighter because
of his great footwork and quick hands. Williams, 19, may need that
quickness against Luna, a seasoned 23-year-old who has barreled
through all of his opponents here.
</P>
<P>
   Luna was the lone Cuban fighter to win his bout Wednesday.
Tuesday, Cuban fighters were undefeated in five fights. Besides
Hernandez, Alexis Rubalcaba, Manuel Mantilla and Yosvany Aguilera
also lost.
</P>
<P>
   Flyweight Jose Navarro was the lone American to lose Wednesday
when he was defeated by France's Thomas Jerome on points, 23-12.
Navarro fell behind in the third round, and desperate for a
comeback, left himself open for even more punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried, but he was scoring more and more,'' Navarro said.
``I'm going to try to mature from this. I did the best I could.'' &QL;

   LITHGOW, Australia _ The teacups clinked daintily as the ladies
of the Lithgow Valley Lawn Bowling Club sat down to lunch. But the
talk was of male Olympic swimmers and their rippling muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Lenny Krayzelburg,'' said Beryl Hammonds, clutching her
heart in a mock swoon as she referred to the American backstroker
who won three gold medals. ``There's nothing wrong with him that I
can see.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Kirkland and Ruth Harries nodded vigorously as they
recalled their own long nights in front of the television. The
women cooked 15 dinners before the Games started, so they would not
miss a minute of the coverage. They watch at home so they can toast
every medalist, no matter the nationality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get nice and drunk because all we have to do is fall into
bed at the end of the night,'' Harries said with a titter.
</P>
<P>
   Lithgow, population 15,000, lies at the end of the electrified
railroad line 90 miles west of Sydney, on the slopes of the Blue
Mountains. It is not the sort of place the writer Donald Horne was
thinking of when he famously described Australia as ``the lucky
country'' four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Remote, economically depressed and cursed with depressing
weather, Lithgow is worlds away from the designer skyscrapers and
sun-splashed beaches of Sydney. A few cars rattled along Main
Street, barely outracing the fog that scudded down from the nearby
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all its hard-luck veneer, Lithgow is as proud, as
captivated and as unabashedly excited about the Olympics as is
Sydney. At a time when its factories are shutting down and its
young people are fleeing for better opportunities elsewhere, the
Games have given Lithgow's residents _ coal miners, train engineers
and prison guards _ something to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of towns like Lithgow speckled across the
Australian hinterland. Left out of the economic boom that has
transformed Australia, and neglected by politicians who live on the
coast, these towns are nevertheless rejoicing in the success of the
Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've shown that for a small country, we can put on a
great show,'' said Don Green, a driver for the state roads and
traffic authority. ``That's what has made a lot of Australians very
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who was nursing a pint at the Grand Central pub, noted
that Lithgow had a distinguished Olympic tradition. Marjorie
Jackson, a runner who won two gold medals at the Helsinki Games in
1952, came from here. Last month, the Lithgow Flash, as Jackson is
called, returned to her hometown to carry the Olympic torch when it
passed through on its way to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played net ball against Marjorie Jackson in school,''
Kirkland said at the lawn bowling lunch. And Barbara Bryce chimed
in, ``I lived next door to her.'' Everybody had a Marjorie Jackson
story.
</P>
<P>
   Only slightly less exalted is John Doyle, a local comedian who
under the stage name Roy Slevin is the co-host of the ``Dream,'' a
wildly popular late-night show that follows the Olympics on
Australia's Seven network.
</P>
<P>
   Slevin and his partner, H.G. Nelson, take gleeful jabs at
everything from New Zealand to the grandees of the International
Olympic Committee. And Slevin draws heavily, if not altogether
factually, from his childhood here.
</P>
<P>
   A drive through Lithgow explains why the Olympics have lifted
this place in a way, perhaps, that it would not lift an Appalachian
mining town. Beyond Main Street, and the stony ruins of a
19th-century steel mill that gave the town its start, lie verdant
playing fields and sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
   For a town with few resources, Lithgow has spent a fortune on
sports. It has a heated Olympic swimming pool, a new basketball
stadium, a running track, tennis courts, cricket grounds and hockey
fields that Len Ashworth, the editor of the local paper, says cost
the taxpayers here nearly $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sports is how Lithgow has coped with being on the short end of
one economic cycle after the other. First the steel mill closed,
then the coal mines cut back. The small-arms factory that makes
machine guns was downsized after the Australian army began
importing them from overseas. And, in the most recent setback, a
bra factory shifted its operations to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people get laid off around here, they take up another
sport; it's better than moping at home,'' said Annette Geddes, who
works at the Lithgow Workmens Club, where the members play
competitive snooker.
</P>
<P>
   Some people take a more cynical view of Lithgow's jock culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else is there to do?'' asked Paul Nichols, a barber, as
he lounged in his shop, watching a field hockey match on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Lithgow's addiction to sports does not mean it has escaped the
more normal addictions of a town in tough times. Drug abuse is a
problem and the town's seven pubs _ or hotels, as they are called
in Australia _ fill up each day with locals who come to drink their
lunches and dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If beer drinking were an Olympic sport, we'd represent all of
Australia,'' said Nichols, 24, whose hair is dyed white.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do people here have any illusions about whether the Olympics
will help them. The Australian government forecast is that the
Games will attract 1.5 million more tourists to the country than
usual between 1998 and 2002. But with few attractions aside from
the rugged Blue Mountains, most will not make it this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest, Sydney is going to get all the benefits,''
said Robin Clark, a laborer who has been unemployed since he hurt
his shoulder a year ago. ``It's going to help Australia, but not
all of Australia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clark spends his days hunkered over a snooker table at the
Workmens Club. He thinks Lithgow's future depends on attracting new
industries. A silicon manufacturer and a fireworks maker recently
set up shop here, while a consortium of companies has talked about
building a vast aluminum smelting plant. That would create 1,000
jobs and could transform Lithgow's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has got to happen soon, because a lot of people have
been laid off,'' Clark said, his voice briefly rising above a
monotone.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the unemployed wind up at the local off-track betting
parlor, where a bank of televisions was showing the field hockey
match and a harness race. Betting on the Games is not allowed in
the province of New South Wales, so the few wagerers ignored the
hockey to focus on the ponies.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Campbell, who runs the parlor, said business had fallen by
10 percent to 20 percent since the Games started. Even the
hard-core gamblers, she said, seemed to be taking a rest to watch
the Olympics on television. The traffic was equally thin next door,
at the Bracey department store.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their personal struggles, people here have set them
aside for two weeks to savor Australia's moment in the sun. Green,
of the roads and traffic authority, chalked it up to the Australian
spirit.

&HT;     THIS CAMPAIGN LACKS RHYME AND RHYTHM

   WASHINGTON _ As we head into the final month of the presidential
campaign, the race between Al Gore and George W. Bush is very close
and very confrontational. But the words spoken by the two
candidates lack the vision and the idealism that generate great
expectations, especially among young voters.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' last week, former Gov.
Mario Cuomo of New York declared: ``You campaign on poetry; you
govern on prose.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems not to have infiltrated the political psyches of Gore
and Bush, who rarely venture beyond pedantic prose. Damning the
opposition candidate can solve a vital political need _ votes. But
poetry and idealism are required to lift the spirits of Americans
and make the young understand that they live in a great country
with a great future.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate obviously wants to know where the candidates
stand on such issues as Social Security, Medicare, the cost of
prescription drugs, education and, of course, a national energy
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Many crave a menu of old-fashioned beef and potatoes _ a repast
of the sturdy victuals that sustain life and good health. But they
also desire an ample serving of frothy dessert complemented by an
effervescent glass of Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy were masters at using language to
inspire as well as to inform. They understood the art of generating
enthusiasm for the opportunities that lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After denouncing big government, high taxes and lavish spending,
Reagan would paint a glowing word picture of the ``shining city on
the hill,'' an idealized vision of America as it was and as it
could be. In doing so, he nourished the hopes and dreams of the
people and won great victories at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   As he traversed the country in 1960, Kennedy repeatedly sounded
a basic theme that dwelt upon the vast opportunities that lay ahead
if he were permitted to ``get America moving'' again. In his
inaugural address in 1961, Kennedy electrified America when he
declared: ``Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you
can do for your country.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, the new president lifted the human spirit far
above the Cold War problems that faced America on that frigid day.
</P>
<P>
   For one glowing moment, people everywhere applauded the concept
of putting their country ahead of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Humphrey had a similar effect on many Americans in 1948,
when he was seeking his first term in the Senate. Appearing before
a Democratic National Convention that was deeply divided over civil
rights, he proclaimed: ``The time has arrived for the Democratic
Party to get out of the shadow of states' rights and walk
forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Humphrey's words and the civil rights plank adopted by
the convention led to a walkout of some Southern delegates, they
placed the national Democratic Party foursquare behind full
constitutional rights for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment forward, black Americans knew they had staunch
friends in one of the republic's major political parties. The road
ahead was littered with violence and bloodshed as courageous civil
rights advocates battled the defenders of racial segregation and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson, a son of the old Confederacy,
signed into law legislation that outlawed segregation in employment
and in public accommodations. It also authorized the attorney
general to initiate desegregation suits.
</P>
<P>
   That law and others that followed broke the back of racial
segregation in the South and, to the surprise of many Southerners,
opened the door for economic boom in that section of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson both stirred the latent
idealism in the people and greatly enriched the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Adlai Stevenson twice was defeated for president, his
majestic rhetoric raised politics to a new level. He, like Kennedy,
instilled in millions of young Americans a belief that public
service is a noble calling.
</P>
<P>
   Young Americans, witnessing Gore and Bush's constant scrimmaging
over Social Security, Medicare, prescription drugs and other issues
dear to the hearts of senior citizens, must wonder why they should
vote.
</P>
<P>
   These young people need an eloquent dose of the kind of vision
and determination that Franklin Roosevelt used to assure the
American people that the sun would shine through the dark clouds of
the Great Depression. Their votes and their participation are
needed in our future.

<P>
   Exposure to certain metals may do more harm than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Lead and cadmium appear to make people more susceptible to
alcohol and drug addiction, says Jack Nation, a psychologist at
Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an unhappy situation where our chemical environment
may be altering patterns of drug use and abuse,'' says Nation, who
has spent 15 years studying the effects of environmental
contaminants on drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Cadmium, a component of cigarettes, enters the body when someone
smokes, and it stays for decades, Nation says. It also enters
fetuses when mothers smoke during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   A common exposure to lead comes via old paint, making children
in poor neighborhoods especially vulnerable. A 1999 study warned
that 70 percent of children in major metropolitan areas might be at
risk of dangerous exposure to lead.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings in the latest study stem from the researchers'
tests on rats.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to lead changed how the rats in the study reacted to
the effects of cocaine, Nation says.
</P>
<P>
   The processes that cause drug addiction in rats appear similar
to those in people, Nation says. And, unlike other drugs, he says,
cocaine packs a bigger punch as people use it more often, which
makes it especially addicting.
</P>
<P>
   The rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine by pressing a
lever that sent the drug into their jugular vein, he says. While
initial doses of cocaine didn't do much for the lead-exposed rats,
the animals actually became ``supersensitive'' to later doses, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to cadmium, on the other hand, made the rats more
tolerant of the effects of alcohol and drugs, the study says.
Results appear in the October issue of the journal
Neuropsychopharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   In some people, higher tolerance to drugs and alcohol could keep
them away from addiction because they won't get much of a kick from
their first doses, Nation says. But others might face greater
danger because they'll need to take more drugs to get their desired
high, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about are cases where you have people who
are going to use drugs because of their life circumstances,'' he
says. ``They're going to have to opt for a higher dose.''
</P>
<P>
   And those higher doses will pose greater harm to their bodies,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   The two metals _ lead and cadmium _ appear to change the way the
chemical dopamine works in the brain, Nation says. Scientists
suspect dopamine is a major player in addiction because it
regulates positive feelings, like euphoria, that can accompany a
drug-induced high.
</P>
<P>
   However, not everyone is convinced that a definite link exists
between lead, cadmium and increased drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kuczenski, a psychiatry professor at the University of
California, San Diego, says it's clear that lead affects the way
dopamine functions in the brain. But, while lead exposure changes
the way a body adjusts to drug use, that doesn't automatically
translate into greater likelihood of addiction, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And it's far from clear whether greater tolerance for a drug
will make someone more likely to become an addict, Kuczenski says.
</P>
<P>
   As for nicotine, he says, researchers still need to investigate
what the combination of smoking and hard drugs does to the body.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO
</P>
<P>
   Whether lead exposure does or does not make drug addiction more
likely, lead remains a hazardous substance. If you live in an older
building, learn about lead and how to protect yourself and your
family.
</P>
<P>
   For information about lead poisoning and how to avoid it, take a
look at information offered by the Alliance to End Childhood Lead
Poisoning (www.aeclp.org/2/index.html).

<P>
   A single slice of whole wheat bread a day can be a lifesaver,
says a report on a long-term study showing that a higher intake of
whole grain foods reduces the risk of stroke by more than 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is so striking that ``replacing refined grains with
whole grains by even one serving a day may have significant
benefits in reducing the risk of ischemic stroke,'' a group led by
Dr. Simin Liu of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston writes in
the latest Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Ischemic stroke, in which part of the brain dies when its blood
flow is blocked, accounts for 70 percent of the 600,000 strokes in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   One serving of bread is a single slice, says Diane Quigliani, a
registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic
Association. So switching from white bread to whole wheat bread at
the breakfast table can make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   The finding comes from the Nurses' Health Study, which has
followed 75,521 women since 1984. Liu and his colleagues compared
the incidence of stroke with the participants' reports of their
eating habits. They focused on refined grain foods _ sweet rolls,
cakes, white bread, English muffins, pancakes, waffles and the like
_ versus whole grain foods including cooked oatmeal, brown rice,
wheat germ, popcorn, and whole grain breakfast cereals.
</P>
<P>
   THE MORE GRAINS, THE BETTER
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of ischemic strokes among the 20 percent of women
who reported the highest intake of whole grain foods, 2.7 servings
a day, was 43 percent lower than in those reporting the lowest
intake, an average of only one-eighth of a serving a day, the
researchers found. In between those two extremes, there was pretty
much a direct relationship between whole grain intake and lower
ischemic stroke risk. There were not enough hemorrhagic strokes, in
which a blood vessel bursts, to give statistically significant
results.
</P>
<P>
   The protective effect remained constant when other major risk
factors for stroke, such as smoking, exercise, dietary fatty acids
and hormone therapy for menopause were examined, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   There are several possible reasons why whole grain foods are
better for health than refined products, says Liu, of the division
of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Whole
grains contain an abundance of antioxidants, minerals and fiber,
all of which are removed by processing. They also contain folate,
magnesium, vitamin E and potassium, all of which have been linked
by different biological mechanisms to reduction of the hardening of
the arteries that leads to heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis found that the presence of all those components
did not explain the protective effect completely, ``indicating that
other constituents may contribute to additional protection,'' Liu
says.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers note that the 2.71 daily servings of the
women with the highest intake still falls short of the three
servings a day recommended by the American Dietetic Association and
other medical and nutritional authorities. Overall, the average
intake of the nurses was one serving a day _ and that is much
better than the intake of Americans in general, who average
one-half of a serving daily.
</P>
<P>
   Whole grain foods range from the prosaic, like ordinary
breakfast cereals, to the more exotic, including bulgur (a form of
whole wheat found in the Middle East), couscous and quinoa. One
ounce of a whole grain cereal, a half cup of brown rice and that
one slice of whole wheat bread will provide the three recommended
daily servings, she says: ``These are not huge amounts.''
</P>
<P>
   And the benefits go beyond stroke prevention, Quigliani adds.
``The Food and Drug Administration has approved a health plan
saying that diets rich in whole grain food and lower in total fats
and cholesterol can reduce the risk of heart disease and certain
cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to identify whole grain foods, says dietician Diane
Quigliani: Read the ingredient label. ``Look for the ones that have
whole grains as the first ingredient,'' she says. ``Whole wheat,
whole oats, whole barley, cornmeal, cracked wheat, graham flour,
brown rice. If you see one of these as the first ingredient, it's a
good choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Read the labels to pick out the whole grain products, add fruits
and vegetables and other fiber-rich foods and protect your heart
and brain. You don't help yourself very much if you eat whole wheat
bread only to constantly put junk between the slices.
</P>
<P>
   Also keep in mind that this is a study of nurses, who tend to
lead healthier lifestyles than do most people.
</P>
<P>
   The American Dietetic Association (www.eatright.org/nfs/) can
get you started eating right, and the the American Medical
Association (www.ama-assn.org/insight/spec_con/stroke/stroke.htm)
has more information about strokes.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I bought a new set of top quality drill bits for my electric
drill to make holes in metal.
 &HT;    However, I find that whenever I want to drill a hole through a
smooth metal surface, the tip of the bit ``wanders'' or skitters
around before it gets started, making it very difficult to form the
hole exactly where I want to.
 &HT;    What do you think I am doing wrong?
 &HT;    A: A drill bit ``wandering'' before it gets started is not an
unusual problem.
 &HT;    To prevent this use a variable speed drill running at a low
speed and start by first using a center punch to make a slight
dimple in the metal where you want the bit to start.
 &HT;    Then build a small ``dam'' around this dimple, using a ring of
putty or glazing compound, and fill this with a small amount of
kerosene or light lubricating oil before starting to drill.
 &HT;    The lubricant will help the bit cut faster and cooler.
 &HT;    Another tip: Before using a bit larger than 1/4'' start by first
drilling a smaller hole, then finish with the larger bit.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My fireplace hearth is made of marble and I have been told
that this stains easily.
 &HT;    Is there a sealer you can suggest that can protect the marble
against such staining?
 &HT;    A: The coating most frequently used on marble is a good grade of
white or clear paste wax which is rubbed on, then buffed vigorously
to produce a shine.
 &HT;    There is also a variety of stone sealers for use on marble,
usually sold in home centers and by local marble or stone dealers.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Our kitchen sink has a garbage disposal unit under it, and
there is a foul odor coming from this drain.
 &HT;    Short of replacing the disposal unit, what can I do to get rid
of this smell?
 &HT;    A. Many markets and hardware stores sell special cleaners and
deodorants for use in garbage disposals.
 &HT;    Another household remedy that often works is to pour vinegar
into the drain and let it sit for about 30 minutes before flushing
it down with running water.
 &HT;    A cupful of household bleach mixed half and half with water
poured into the disposal also is claimed to work, but flush this
away with water after about 10 minutes.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Our old bedroom furniture is finished with mahogany veneer
and this thin veneer has a blister on the top. Can it be repaired
without completely refinishing the dresser?
 &HT;    A: Slice through the blister with a razor blade, then press one
side of the blister down and slide the tip of a thin knife blade
under the raised half.
 &HT;    Use the tip of the blade to scrape out as much of the old dried
glue as you can, then press this half of the blister down and do
the same under the other half.
 &HT;    When finished, use a toothpick or thin blade to spread a small
amount of white carpenter's glue under each raised half of the
blister.
 &HT;    Press down firmly on the whole blister and wipe off any excess
glue that oozes out.
 &HT;    Cover the area with waxed paper, then pile some books or
magazines on top to hold the veneer down until the glue has dried.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``DRILLING A HOLE IN SHEET METAL'' goes
with this column.
 &HT;    CAPTION: Center punch is used to create dimple in metal, and dam
of putty holds pool of lubricating oil to help drill bit cut
precisely and faster.

usually sold in home centers and by local marble or stone dealers.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Our kitchen sink has a garbage disposal unit under it, and
there is a foul odor coming from this drain.
 &HT;    Short of replacing the disposal unit, what can I do to get rid
of this smell?
 &HT;    A. Many markets and hardware stores sell special cleaners and
deodorants for use in garbage disposals.
 &HT;    Another household remedy that often works is to pour vinegar
into the drain and let it sit for about 30 minutes before flushing
it down with running water.
 &HT;    A cupful of household bleach mixed half and half with water
poured into the disposal also is claimed to work, but flush this
away with water after about 10 minutes.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Our old bedroom furniture is finished with mahogany veneer
and this thin veneer has a blister on the top. Can it be repaired
without completely refinishing the dresser?
 &HT;    A: Slice through the blister with a razor blade, then press one
side of the blister down and slide the tip of a thin knife blade
under the raised half.
 &HT;    Use the tip of the blade to scrape out as much of the old dried
glue as you can, then press this half of the blister down and do
the same under the other half.
 &HT;    When finished, use a toothpick or thin blade to spread a small
amount of white carpenter's glue under each raised half of the
blister.
 &HT;    Press down firmly on the whole blister and wipe off any excess
glue that oozes out.
 &HT;    Cover the area with waxed paper, then pile some books or
magazines on top to hold the veneer down until the glue has dried.

SOME PROTESTS CONTINUE IN PRAGUE AS OFFICIALS CONDEMN VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Scattered anti-capitalist protests
continued in Prague on Wednesday, but financial officials and many
demonstrators condemned the outbreak of violence and vandalism that
turned a conference of aid officials into a street battle.
</P>
<P>
   Shattered glass covered the sidewalks along Wensceslas Square,
where hundreds of protesters _ many of them black-masked anarchists
armed with clubs _ smashed a Kentucky Fried Chicken, a Dunkin'
Donuts and a Mercedes dealership late Tuesday. Earlier that day
they had repeatedly clashed with police near the hilltop conference
center where officials from the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund held their annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people were injured, 63 of them police officers,
according to a local government spokesman. The police arrested 420
people, though many of those taken into custody were quickly
released.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Wednesday sealed the protesters' center of operations
in an old factory building on the outskirts of Prague. Wednesday
afternoon, two cordons of police in full riot gear surrounded
several hundred protesters in a downtown square, holding them in
place until they agreed to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   The violence helped the demonstrators generate publicity but
highlighted a gulf between them and representatives of poor nations
that they often claim to represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence has no place in a civilized society,'' Yashwant
Sinha, India's finance minister, told delegates Wednesday morning.
``I stand here on behalf of India, the land of Mahatma Gandhi, who
espoused the cause of non-violence, and I condemn the violence
which was unleashed here.''
</P>
<P>
   Czech government officials complained that the protesters had
lied to them when they promised peaceful sit-ins during marathon
negotiations before the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But protest organizers distanced themselves from what they
called hoodlums and extremists who had no ties to the main protest
march. Even some anarchists criticized the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to non-violence, and it all turned out badly,'' said
a 24-year-old Brazilian who gave his name as Ivan and wore a ``Punk
not Dead'' T-shirt caked with dust. He sat with other protesters on
Peace Square Wednesday, hemmed in by police who would not let them
march.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I should say that I respect the people who committed the
violence,'' he added. ``They are not my enemy. The enemy is the
IMF.''
</P>
<P>
   Though protesters distracted the media from the aid conference,
just as they had helped to undermine trade negotiations in Seattle
late last year, some said the almost ritualistic violence common to
several recent anti-globalization protests had obscured the
protesters' main message. Many have argued that the World Bank and
the IMF do more harm than good in poor countries and need to be
either radically overhauled or abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media only care about the violence, not about our
arguments,'' said Katarina Bartovicova, 22, of Bratislava,
Slovakia. ``They are making us pay for yesterday.''

CENSORSHIP: TAKING CHOICES AWAY FROM ADULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. He is a member of the Freedom to Read
Foundation Board, the litigating arm of the American Library
Association. His e-mail address is levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   The campaign season often gives rise to dumb ideas. Weeks ago,
the FBI released statistics showing that youth and school violence
is at its lowest level in more than a decade. Yet, members of
Congress chose this month to blame the film and television
industries for rising teen violence.
</P>
<P>
   The message to Hollywood: Get rid of the violence on your own,
or we'll pass legislation that does it for you. The political
chorus was joined by Democratic candidate for president Al Gore,
his running mate, Joseph Lieberman, and Lynne Cheney, wife of
Republican vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians don't believe that the American people can find the
off button on their television sets. They want the government to
make decisions about what adults and children will be allowed to
watch. Never mind parental decisions. Never mind the First
Amendment. The threat of congressional legislation is real. The
Senate Commerce Committee passed a bill on Sept. 20, that will ban
television shows containing graphic bloodshed or violence during
daylight hours when children might be watching _ from 6 a.m to 10
p.m. Presumably, news reports are excluded from the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who sponsored the bill, wants a
``safe harbor'' for children during the time when they watch
television. Hollings doesn't believe that the much heralded V-chip
technology, required by law in all new TV sets larger than 13
inches, has worked.
</P>
<P>
   The V-chip can be used by parents to block violent or sexual
material. But many parents don't want technology making choices for
them, so they don't use it. That should be a clue to Hollings. If
parents don't want a V-chip making judgments for them, they
certainly don't want the government doing it.
</P>
<P>
   This political attack on Hollywood has been fueled by a phony
report recently released by the Federal Trade Commission that
pretends to show that violence in the media causes teen violence in
the streets and schools. But even the FTC report did not claim that
violent programs and violent video games cause aggression. It
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The report hedged by noting statistical ``correlations'' between
violent media fare and teen violence. Correlations can indicate
some relationship between two different kinds of events _ or
correlations can indicate absolutely nothing. If one were to chart
birds singing before dawn with the rising of the sun, one would
find an almost perfect correlation. But to then suggest that bird
songs cause the sun to rise would be patently ridiculous. Yet the
correlation is unmistakably present.
</P>
<P>
   A correlation between the 100 best books in English and the 100
most frequently challenged books in the past decade, as compiled by
the American Library Association's Office of Intellectual Freedom,
would be very high. Perhaps someone could argue from the
correlation that the better a book is, the more likely it is to be
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   No credible scientific evidence exists that shows a
cause-and-effect relationship between watching violent programming
and aggressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the politicians will beat their chests and act holier than
thou as they try to drum up votes. These same politicians, if they
are over 50 years old, were likely raised on the often frightening
fairy tales by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm and sad tales like Hans
Christian Andersen's ``The Little Match Girl'' and ``The Steadfast
Tin Soldier.'' Few would claim such stories twisted the psyches of
those who read them.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, the Grimm Brothers' adaptation of ``Little
Red Riding Hood,'' by the way, was attacked by teachers and parents
in the United States for being too violent.
</P>
<P>
   This is also Banned Books Week _ the week that the American
Library Association set aside to celebrate our freedom to read.
It's an appropriate time to read a banned book, if you haven't
already in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series received the dubious honor of
being the most frequently challenged books in 1999. The attempts to
ban the series were based on charges that it encourages a belief in
the occult, wizardry and magic.
</P>
<P>
   The number of books that were targeted for banning last year,
according to the list compiled by the Office of Intellectual
Freedom, dropped to 472. Challenges to books have been dropping
steadily since 1995 and since the Internet has become a major focus
of censorship attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the attempts to ban books are reported by public
libraries, public schools and school libraries. And most challenges
to books are initiated by parents, library patrons and school
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't read one of the books on the list of the American
Library Association's Ten Most Challenged Books of 1999, you
haven't been reading: John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men'' is sixth
on the list; Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings`` is
seventh; Margaret Atwood's ``The Handmaid's Tale'' is eighth; Alice
Walker's ``The Color Purple'' is ninth; and in 10th place, David
Guterson's ``Snow Falling on Cedars.''
</P>
<P>
   These classics were challenged because some folks were offended
by the strong language and the realistic sexual scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat comforting to know that ``Of Mice and Men'' still
shocks some readers. Books should shock us out of our complacency,
should make us uncomfortable with their truths. Shake us a little.
They should make us think, or even reevaluate our lives or issues.
</P>
<P>
   One finds Mark Twain's ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''
high on the list of books most frequently challenged in the past
decade. Authors like J.D. Salinger, Maurice Sendak, Toni Morrison,
Harper Lee, Aldous Huxley, Kurt Vonnegut, Richard Wright, William
Golding and Isabel Allende have books on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Stumped for a good book to read during those winter months when
the snow is high against your door? Call your local library or
bookstore and ask what book has been banned recently, then go down
and get a copy. It's bound to be worth reading.

bc-LADN- Social Club's Portuondo to grace UCLA's Royce Hall 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. ``TONIGHT'' refers to Fri., Sept. 29, 2000.) 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
When Celia Cruz sailed the Florida Straits to find fame and fortune
in the U.S., Omara Portuondo remained in Havana as Cuba's premier
diva for 50 years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sole female member of Buena Vista Social Club, Portuondo's
seductive, velvety vocals could, it's been said, make the dead
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Lately she's been making audiences rise instead, wherever she
and other members of Buena Vista Social Club appear.
</P>
<P>
   While she's been a huge star at home for decades, she made her
U.S. solo concert debut just three years ago when Buena Vista
Social Club performed at Carnegie Hall. That event was filmed by
Wim Wenders for his Oscar-nominated documentary, ``Buena Vista
Social Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Portuondo has toured extensively with the Social
Club's Ibrahim Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez (who was her pianist in
the '40s), released an acclaimed self-titled album, and embarked on
a headlining trek that brings her to Royce Hall tonight, Saturday
at Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts and Oct. 7 at the
Hollywood Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's music people understand,'' Portuondo, 70, said in Spanish
through a translator. ``I think it has an element that's fresh. It
has melody and harmony that's very attractive to the ear, even to
people who never understood our culture. So they think they're
hearing something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Often compared to the likes of Edith Piaf and Billie Holiday,
Portuondo began her musical career in the '50s when she and her
sister sang American jazz standards and later formed a female vocal
quartet. In 1959 she issued her first album, a collection of
American jazz and Cuban favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nat King Cole, like Tony Bennett, Sarah Vaughan and Piaf, were
presented in Cuba for special events,'' Portuondo recalled. ``It
was the surprise of my life when I saw Piaf. She was dressed in
black. She didn't move or anything. She was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Portuondo met Buena Vista Social Club producer Ry Cooder by
accident. She happened to be at a Havana studio at the same time as
the guitarist, who was putting together a collection of golden-age
Cuban songs played and sung by the surviving musicians of the era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew it was going to get a Grammy,'' she said of the
resulting album. ``I went to record with friends who knew the
music. But we didn't know anything would happen around the world
because of it. It's a good album. That's all we knew. In reality,
an artist never knows what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do it with lots of love and dedication. I couldn't predict
it was going to be such a huge hit because, in reality, there are
other records that aren't hits. So, it was a beautiful surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Portuondo lives in a high-rise Havana apartment with
views of the sea and remains a flamboyant fixture on the local
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I spend so little time in Cuba,'' she said. ``I
travel all over the world, in Europe and South America, especially
after the Buena Vista Social Club. In all parts of the world,
people know the film and the album and they're in love with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, they're in love with all of us. This is a work
that unites lots of elements. It comes from a great love.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Homeowners can fix some storm damage
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Not every property damaged by the violent storms
that swept through the Miami Valley Sept. 20 is a total wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes create only a narrow band of devastation, but the
accompanying storms create a huge swath littered with broken tree
limbs, broken windows, sagging gutters and missing shingles.
</P>
<P>
   If your house and yard sustained minor damage, you may be able
to handle most of the repairs yourself without calling in
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   TREE LIMBS
</P>
<P>
   Scattered small limbs are common in the aftermath of a storm,
and they can be a nuisance to get rid of if you don't happen to own
a shredder to turn junk limbs into useful mulch.
</P>
<P>
   If you and your neighbors all have piles of brush and broken
limbs, perhaps you can go in together and rent a shredder. Local
tool rental shops rent shredders capable of handling branches up to
about 3 inches in diameter for about $125 to $150 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Larger branches or felled trees probably will require a chain
saw to clear, and you can rent a saw with a 16-inch blade for about
$50 a day if you don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriate clothing is essential to chain saw use. Use safety
glasses or goggles, and earphones to deaden the sound. Steel-toed
shoes are suggested if you're working with heavy branches higher
than your waist. Avoid dangling, loose-fitting clothing that could
catch in the blade.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful when starting a gasoline-powered chain saw. Engage
the chain break. Place the saw on a flat, hard surface. Hold it
down with one foot on the back handle and a hand on the top handle.
Pull up on the starter cord with the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   When cutting, it's important to try not to force the saw blade
through the wood. If the saw blade is sharp, it will work its way
through the wood if the user applies light, even pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid kickbacks _ a sudden upward jerk of the blade _ by cutting
with the center of the blade rather than the tip. Also avoid
cutting near solid surfaces such as walls that might catch the
blade tip. You can also use a blade tip guard that prevents
accidental tip contact.
</P>
<P>
   Gripping the saw with one hand instead of two increases the
chances of kickback. A firm grip is important, so keep the saw
handles clean and free of oil and wear gripping gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sexton, a licensed arborist and owner of American Forestry
Service in Kettering, said cutting up a downed tree is a lot like
pruning a standing tree: You remove the branches one at a time
before cutting up the main trunk.
</P>
<P>
   If the tree has fallen on a vehicle or building, Sexton said
it's best to refer the job to tree service that has the equipment
to lift and move the tree safely.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said you must also be aware of limbs that are under
pressure from the weight of the fallen tree. Sawing through a
branch that is bowing from stress is dangerous; it can snap
suddenly throwing itself or the saw at the cutter. Such branches
might be best left to professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Be suspicious, though, of people claiming to be tree specialists
who pressure you to make an immediate agreement to remove a fallen
tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad situation, but a lot of guys will come in after a
natural disaster, and you hear stories of people asking $6,000 or
$7,000 to remove a single tree,'' Sexton said. ``That gives all of
us in the business a black eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said most tree services charge in the range of $90 to
$110 an hour for a standard three-member crew. Large tree removals
may take most of a day and often cost around $700 to $800.
</P>
<P>
   If your tree has a broken limb, you may be able to save the tree
by cutting the branch away. Cut the branch outside the collar where
the branch attaches to the trunk. The collar is a raised rounded
area at the base of the branch, and it should be left attached to
the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   A tree surgeon can access whether the tree can survive after its
damaged branches are removed.
</P>
<P>
   A tree service also may be best equipped to grind up the stump
after a tree is cut down. Grinding the stump allows the home owner
to plant grass over the hole where the tree used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ROOF AND GUTTER DAMAGE
</P>
<P>
   A strong wind can rip away a section of roof shingles or just
fray the edges of a few shingles. Wind and flying debris can also
move gutters and downspouts out of alignment or knock them down.
</P>
<P>
   If you have minor roof damage and your roof has a fairly shallow
pitch so you can move around on it comfortably, you can replace
torn or missing shingles. If your roof is steep, you may be able to
work on it using brackets called roof jacks that hold boards to use
as platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the uppermost damaged shingle, grasp it by the
edges and wriggle it loose. Remove the nails that held the shingle
in place using a pry bar or tap them down flush.
</P>
<P>
   As you remove shingles, patch any holes in the paper
underlayment with roofing cement. Roofing cement comes in tubes
like caulk and sells for about $2 a tube.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hillix, general manager of P&AMP;W Roofing Supplies Inc., said
you can bring an old shingle with you to the building supply store
when you shop for replacements, but chances are you won't find an
exact match. Even shingles of the same make and style won't match
shingles that have weathered a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Hillix said one way to minimize mismatching is to remove
shingles from the back side of the house to make repairs on the
street side. New shingles can then be used on the back side of the
house where the color difference won't affect the home's curb
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Shingles are sold in packages of about 25 shingles, and each
package covers about 30 square feet. Basic shingles with a 20-year
expected life run about $7.50 to $10, and fancier, more durable
shingles cost more.
</P>
<P>
   Add replacement shingles starting at the bottom of the repair
area and working your way up. Position shingles so they just
overlap the beginning of the slots in the shingles below them.
</P>
<P>
   When replacing shingles directly under a row of good shingles,
you may need to cut notches in the top of the new shingles to fit
around nails and bits of the old shingle that could not be pulled
loose.
</P>
<P>
   Space the nails in shingles about a foot apart so each new
shingle has four nails. Use only nails or staples designed for
roofing; the wrong type of nail can rust and create unsightly
streaks in the shingles.
</P>
<P>
   A line of roofing cement on the top half of the uppermost row of
repair shingles will help seal out possible future water problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gutters are held in place by straps or spikes, and they're
fairly easy to replace. Use a ladder leaned against the side of the
house or propped against the roof with a U-shaped stabilizer. Don't
lean the ladder on the gutters themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the type of fasteners that hold your gutters in place
and buy matching fasteners at a hardware or home improvement store.
Add fasteners alongside old fasteners that have failed and remove
the old fasteners. Cover any holes in the gutters from the inside
with metal or plastic tape sealed with roofing cement.
</P>
<P>
   Examine all the connections between the gutters and downspouts
and seal any leaks with caulk.
</P>
<P>
   WINDOWS
</P>
<P>
   Broken windows are easiest to replace if you can remove the
frame from the track and lay it flat on a working surface protected
with a layer of newsprint a few pages thick. If removing the frame
from its track is difficult, you can replace the glass with the
window in place.
</P>
<P>
   Where eye protection and gloves when working with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   For a wooden frame, use heat to soften the putty holding the old
window in place. Putty or glazing compound is the clay-like
substance put around the glass to create an airtight seal.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape away the softened putty with a putty knife, then
carefully pull out and discard the broken glass. You'll find small
metal pins called glazing points under the putty. Pull them out
with the tip of the putty knife.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap sandpaper around a small block of scrap wood and sand the
L-shaped channel where the glass will sit to remove old paint and
glazing compound. Apply a wood sealer to the sanded wood and allow
it to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Measure the inside of the window frame exactly from side to side
and top to bottom. Subtract 1/8 of an inch from the measurement to
allow for contraction and expansion, and buy a sheet of replacement
glass from a hardware store, home improvement store or glass
business.
</P>
<P>
   Apply a thin line of glazing compound to the L-shaped channel
and gently press the glass into place to spread the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Using the putty knife push in a new set of glazing points to
hold the glass securely. Don't apply downward pressure while
installing the glazing points; you could crack the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Apply a thicker line of glazing compound along the edges of the
glass. Use a moistened finger to smooth the compound into the
joint.
</P>
<P>
   Glazing compound should be painted after it dries. Allow the
paint to extend about 1/8 of an inch onto the glass to improve the
moisture seal.
</P>
<P>
   Glass in a metal or vinyl frame will be held in place with a
vinyl string called a spline. To remove the glass, pry up one
corner of the spline and carefully pull it loose. Repeat the
process for the other three sides.
</P>
<P>
   If the spline is still flexible, save it for reuse. If it's
brittle, take it to the hardware store and buy a matching
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   If the old glass was glued to the frame, a little paint remover
should loosen it. Run a putty knife or screwdriver blade along the
frame to remove any remaining bits of glass. You don't need to
replace the glue; the spline will hold the new glass securely.
</P>
<P>
   Measure the inside of the frame and buy a piece of glass 1/8 of
an inch smaller. Lay the glass in the frame gently.
</P>
<P>
   Cut one end of a spline at a 45-degree angle and push it into
the spline channel of the frame. Cut it again at a 45-degree angle
at the end of the first side.
</P>
<P>
   Make a 45-degree angle and the beginning of the next section of
spline so the angled ends fit together snugly at the corners of the
frame. Repeat the process until all four sides are splined.

<P>
   Save the bogong moths! That's the cry from Greenpeace, which is
protesting plans to exterminate the moths that are swarming around
Olympic Park. The stadium lights attract the moths, and official

   First a medal, now a watch
</P>
<P>
   Gold medal winner Cathy Freeman was spotted at the Watches of
Switzerland store downtown, where her husband, Sandy Bodecker,
bought her a Cartier watch. The store would not say which watch she
chose, but the styles she looked at cost between $19,000 and
$64,000, depending on the number of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Really pulling for Freeman
</P>
<P>
   More than 8 million Australians watched Freeman win the
400-meter race, making it the most-watched sports event in Aussie
history. More than 90 percent of all televisions in Sydney that
were on at that time were watching the race.

   Tattoo mania
</P>
<P>
   Sydney stores are running out of the stick-on flag tattoos that
Aussie fans like to wear on their faces. The tattoo, which costs
$2-$3, is one of the hottest selling items at the Games. More
supplies are on the way _ but they may not get in stores until
after the Olympics.

 &HT;    Tour de France winner triumphs, but it's not Armstrong
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - A Tour de France winner captured the gold at the
Olympic men's road race here, but it was not Lance Armstrong.
German Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour de France winner and runner-up to
Armstrong this year, powered away from two other riders on the last
lap and then raised his hands in triumph after just under five and
one-half hours of cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandre Vinokourov of Kazakhstan took the silver with
Ullrich's German teammate Andreas Kloeden taking the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   George Hincapie was the top U.S. finisher at eighth. Armstrong,
the current Tour de France champion and a cancer survivor, was
13th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a road race and things didn't roll our way,'' Armstrong
said. ``We had a plan, but unfortunately those three guys got out
and rode away.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said that the plan was for someone to go out early
then have Hincapie ride with the leaders and for him to then take
over near the end. He said he reached Hincapie, who assured him
there was no one out on a breakaway. Armstrong saw a monitor and
said, ``George, who's that?''
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie was more stunned than Armstrong that other riders had
gotten away.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong still has the individual time trials coming up on
Saturday and is considered one of the favorites, along with
Ullrich, in that event.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a super talent,'' Armstrong said. ``He'll be hard to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming in Armstrong thought that in this one-day road race over
relatively flat terrain there could be a number of possible
winners. He named Ullrich, but also included some of his U.S.
teammates. None, however, threatened to win a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the race was literallly a ride in the park.
The 148.5-mile course consisted of 14 laps in and around Moore
Park. For the first seven of those laps Armstrong and cycling's
bigger names and countries were content to watch a quartet of
riders stage a small breakaway. After seven laps Orlando Rodrigues
of Portugal, Remigijus Lupeikis of Lithuania, Evgeny Wacker of
Kyrgyzstan and Piotr Wadecki of Poland had a lead of just under
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   By the eighth lap, however, they'd been reeled with Frenchmen
Laurent Jalabert and Laurent Brochard among the leaders as well as
Armstrong's teammate Tyler Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   This road race was Armstrong's third Olympic effort in that
event. In 1992 in Barcelona he finished 14th and in the 1996 Games
in Atlanta, he finished 12th. ``I didn't think about that. I was
riding for today,'' Armstrong said.

MIND TRIP 
`DREAM' SITE MIGHT BE A NIGHTMARE

   Take a trip to www.requiemforadream.com and you'll find yourself
wondering if you have taken the wrong potion in Wonderland. This is
not your usual movie promotional Web site, but then ``Requiem for a
Dream'' is not from your usual filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Aronofsky, whose first film, ``Pi,'' dealt with an
obsessed math genius, turns his attention to Hubert Selby Jr.'s
novel of drug-fueled delusion and isolation in the Coney Island
district of New York. ``Requiem,'' which stars Ellen Burstyn, Jared
Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans, is set for release Oct.
20 from Artisan. Though the film is currently unrated (it was
originally rated NC-17, but the filmmakers withdrew their
application), there is little as far as we can tell that is overtly
sexual, violent or advocates drugs.
</P>
<P>
   What you find when you first encounter the site which uses movie
scenes, excerpts from the book and sound bytes is an upbeat,
somewhat confusing scene. Soon, though, as you try to interact,
colors begin to fade, error messages occur, and you're directed
into weird places. If you don't know any better, you'll think there
is something wrong with your computer and you're no longer in
control. The site, according to Artisan, is meant to be an extended
mind trip that mirrors the characters' quest for happiness and
their ultimate disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   You be the judge as to whether this Web site works or not, but
it's clear that you'll be seeing more of these kinds of adventurous
sites as studios seek new ways to promote their films.

A ``BEAUTIFUL'' EXPERIENCE FOR SALLY FIELD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
TORONTO _ After 35 years in show business, Sally Field knows all
about the limitations and expectations placed on women. For much of
her career, Field traded on being cute and perky; when that ran its
course, she went for sexy in such movies as ``Stay Hungry'' and
``Smokey and the Bandit.'' She even posed for the cover of Playboy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not until ``Norma Rae'' in 1980 did Hollywood begin to take her
seriously as an actress, but even then she didn't feel secure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, when she won her second best-actress Oscar (for
``Places in the Heart''), winning the industry's approval still was
a paramount concern, as shown by the way she famously trilled ``you
like me! You really like me!'' in her acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   So it's interesting to hear her say that what attracted her to
``Beautiful,'' the new Minnie Driver comedy that Field chose as her
feature directing debut, was that the female lead character isn't
very likable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What appealed to me was the character,'' Field said recently
in Toronto, where ``Beautiful'' was screened as part of the Toronto
International Film Festival. ``It is what made me interested in the
first place and kept me interested all the way, even though we
really developed the piece for about a year and a half to get the
story as close to right as we could get it. But it was the
character that I loved, this larger-than-life, hopefully funny
female, who was very flawed and complicated and who really walks a
fine line between being likable and not likable.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the serious Field talking. Post-cute. Post-Playboy sexy.
She's still trim and pixyish. She still has that familiar girlish
voice. But you don't think Gidget. You don't think the Flying Nun.
The confident, middle-aged woman sitting ramrod-straight in a chair
near the window in this nondescript hotel suite isn't straining to
amuse. This woman is a movie director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most female characters come on screen and they're asking to be
liked, constantly, nowadays especially,'' she continued. ``And Mona
(the character Driver plays) never does that. Ultimately, if you
don't end up liking her _ which you may not _ you end up caring
about her. You want to see her survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mona has had one goal her whole life _ to be crowned Miss
American Miss.
</P>
<P>
   One irony of the film is that, while winning the title might be
seen as the ultimate in societal approval, Mona is so singleminded
in her pursuit of it that she alienates almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby, her friend from childhood (played by Joey Lauren Adams),
is the only person who can stand her.
</P>
<P>
   Mona is the kind of woman who would wear a pageant crown to a
diner and think people were staring because she's beautiful. When a
pregnant woman goes into labor in the supermarket, Mona springs
into action _ not because she cares about the woman and child, but
because the publicity will do her good.
</P>
<P>
   And when she gets pregnant as a teen-ager, she avoids
disqualification as a beauty queen by giving the child (Hallie Kate
Eisenberg) to Ruby to raise as her own.
</P>
<P>
   The child doesn't know, and no one else acknowledges, that Mona
is the mother.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tricky movie that tries to work on several levels, to
make big statements about societal and personal values while also
keeping audiences entertained.
</P>
<P>
   Field previously directed and co-wrote a made-for-television
movie, ``A Woman of Independent Means,'' and she directed an
episode of Tom Hanks' HBO series, ``From the Earth to the Moon,''
but those projects didn't fully prepare her for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bigger story to tell,'' she said of ``Beautiful.''
``There's a lot going on. We have children and beauty queens and
singing and dancing and musical numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   To juggle all of this in a small-budget movie that is both a
comedy and a character study wasn't easy. And Field acknowledges
that she isn't yet the director she hopes to become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it (directing) slowly so that I could both
figure out if I really wanted to be in this arena, No. 1, and No.
2, if I should be in it at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She's made up her mind that she wants to keep directing,
although she doesn't yet have another movie lined up. And she
doubts that she'll be directing herself in a movie anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, directing is such a difficult task I don't want to
give myself any other ball to keep in the air while I'm doing it,
other than just trying to learn as fast as I can,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be able to do both. I'd like to be able to have
the opportunity to learn, to be better at directing. I'm a much
better actor than I am a director. I'd like to get better at it.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll be seen this season in six episodes of ER, playing the
mother of one of the regular characters, Maura Tierney.
</P>
<P>
   Stars nowadays, as a group, wield more power in Hollywood than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Field was among the first of the current crop of actresses to
open her own production company to find and develop movies. It was
a way of manufacturing good roles in an industry that often
shortchanges women.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get out there and do what you can to find the
product that you would like to be part of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sit back and shake your fist. That's a good first
step, but not much gets done when you sit back and shake your
fist.''
</P>
<P>
   A solid strain of feminism runs through Field's work, especially
in her movies about strong women persevering against all odds. She
downplays the feminism of ``Beautiful,'' though.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parenting issues and the single-mother issues and all that
are there,'' she said, ``but at the bottom of all of it is this
character who has this pain and damage from childhood that she
carries around with her, and to grow up and be a productive,
worthwhile adult, she has to let them go and move on to another
part of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the biggest and most difficult thing for a
human to do _ to not cling on to those things from the past, to
find who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   But, while she prefers talking about ``the human dilemma'' Mona
faces, Field acknowledges that there is much in the movie that she
can relate to as a woman in the show-business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the pressures of those parameters that are set up for
women to be like, to cram yourself into some little box,'' she
said. ``Whether it's society, the advertising industry, the motion
picture business or whoever sets this up, if you don't fit into
that box, you're not female, you're not attractive, you're not
productive, somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides the physical things you have to fit into, so many
of the things that are precious to human beings _ whether it's
ambition, drive, passion, anger, cleverness or desire _ all of
those things in a woman can be considered negative, and really
they're just glorious.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about how this relates to the movie, Field laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mona's case, sometimes they're a little more ... colorful
than one would like,'' she said. ``But that's what I love about her
_ she makes big, big ol' ugly mistakes, and she's not a perfect
person. I like that.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) When the grizzly charged, Patricia Van Tighem did what
hikers have always been told to do.
</P>
<P>
   First, she scampered up a tree.
</P>
<P>
   The bear batted her down.
</P>
<P>
   Then she lay still on the ground, playing dead. The bear began
gnawing on her face, ripping skin and muscle from her skull.
</P>
<P>
   Van Tighem finally did something she wasn't supposed to do: She
reached up and poked the bear in the nose.
</P>
<P>
   The bear retreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying still didn't work,'' said Van Tighem, whose new book,
``The Bear's Embrace,'' details the grueling 20-year physical and
mental aftermath of the attack on her and her husband. ``If I kept
playing dead, I would have BEEN dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The common advice always has been _ and still is _ that if
you're threatened by a grizzly, play dead; if you're threatened by
a black bear, fight back. But a summer of attacks involving not
only fierce grizzlies but also normally docile black bears has some
experts questioning those approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The issue becomes more important as bear populations increase
and human-bear conflicts, the term that researchers use for these
sometimes violent interactions, become less rare.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, a black bear preyed upon hiker Glenda Ann Bradley
about 10 miles outside Gatlinburg, Tenn. It was the first recorded
black bear fatality in the history of the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early in July, Canadian biathlete Mary Beth Miller was
killed by a black bear outside Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
   After that, human-bear conflicts made news all summer:
</P>
<P>
   _ Black bears clawed or bit four Boy Scouts in July at the
Philmont Scout Ranch in northeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   _ In August, two backpackers were charged by a bear of
undetermined species in Glacier National Park in Montana. One was
bitten on the thighs and hips.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also in August, a Calgary, Alberta, man was mauled by a
grizzly in the Kananaskis Country of Canada's Rockies. It was the
second incident in 12 hours; those were the first attacks there in
22 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ In September, attacks have been reported in Clam Falls, Wis.;
Hoonah, Alaska; Grand Junction, Colo.; Anchorage; McLeod Lake,
British Columbia; and Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conflict is increasing all over,'' said Gary Shelton, who has
studied bears for 35 years and written two books considered to be
the seminal works on bear aggression. ``What's happening is bear
attacks are taking place where they haven't before, there's a
higher level of fatalities, and there are more deadly attacks by
black bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting people and their property from bears is a politically
sensitive issue. ``Bears have become an icon that represent all
things bad mankind has done to nature,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey recently canceled a black-bear hunt after public
protest. In the last year officials there have documented 25 bear
attacks on livestock and 40 on household pets.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, who lives in the remote Bella Coola Valley of British
Columbia, began his career as a conservationist. He came to think
that bears were becoming ``overprotected'' _ that populations were
growing too large _ so he ``shifted gears'' to study what people
can do to avoid or minimize bear attacks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the North American Bear Society, nearly 800,000
black bears roam across Canada and all but seven American states.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzly numbers are harder to track, as the bears are more
elusive. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that 1,200
grizzlies are spread throughout Montana, Idaho, Washington and
Wyoming, and 30,000 live in Alaska. University of Calgary
environmental scientist Stephen Herrero, a bear expert, estimates
that 60,000 brown bears, the species that includes grizzlies, live
throughout North America.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on bear attacks are difficult to compile. Many happen
in remote wilderness and go unreported.
</P>
<P>
   Herrero, author of ``Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance,''
estimated that on average, bears kill three people and seriously
injure between five and 15 annually in North America. ``Overall the
injury rates are very low considering the millions of interactions
that occur each year,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, Herrero told the Calgary Herald that the number
of bear attacks this year is among the highest since biologists
began keeping records 28 years ago. Specific numbers were
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   If people want to learn how to co-exist with bears, ``it is
incumbent upon us to figure out how they think,'' said Tom Smith, a
research wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in
Alaska and an expert on bear-human interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is studying grizzly bear responses to smells, sights and
sounds associated with human outdoor activities. He travels through
the wilderness displaying different colored tent materials and
playing voice recordings, noting bear reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Avoidance remains the best defense, yet some people are naive
about keeping bears at bay, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campers put papaya-guava-honey shampoo on their heads and then
wonder why bears are paying attention to them,'' he said. ``Come
on, people, this is stupid.'' To a bear, that's about as inviting
as ``bacon and egg shampoo'' would smell to a hungry hiker, Smith
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Smith's research runs counter to accepted bear-avoidance
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   He has discovered that pepper spray, a common deterrent,
actually may attract bears if used incorrectly _ that is, applied
to tents, containers or clothing as opposed to sprayed directly at
a bear.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also published a study on the use of ``bear bells,'' which
hikers hang from walking sticks, belts or backpacks on the theory
that a noisy approach will keep them from catching a bear off
guard. He hung a row of the noisy bells on a bush. Over time, 15
grizzly bears wandered past the bells as he rang them; the beasts
``didn't even twitch an ear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things that are taught as standard safety messages, I
think, `Why in the world do we do that?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith sees this summer's attacks as an aberration. ``The
overwhelming majority of bears have no desire to deal with
people,'' he said. However, ``there are those Jeffrey Dahmer and
Ted Kaczynski bears,'' like the human murderers, that set out to
kill.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, meanwhile, is preparing a paper for the International
Bear Association conference next May that details his theory: Black
bears, in certain circumstances, will indeed prey on humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a slow, steady increase of predatory black
bear attacks that will catch bear managers off guard,'' he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton pointed out that because black bears and grizzlies
evolved from a common ancestor, a ``true predator,'' each species
is capable of predatory attacks. So the common advice to fight a
black bear but play dead for a grizzly may not hold true,
particularly if the bear has targeted a human as prey.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting in-depth interviews with 40 survivors of attack
by bears, both black and grizzly, Shelton now takes ``a strong
position against playing dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bear is deciding if you're prey, and you play dead,
that's exactly what happens to you,'' he said. He devotes a chapter
in his upcoming book to the topic.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the best way to protect yourself in bear country?
Shelton said to carry pepper spray and use it correctly _ shoot it
directly at the bear, then leave the area immediately, as the bear
will be temporarily stunned by the burning sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the spray success rate runs at about 75 percent,
it is a far better strategy than the `play dead/fight back'
concept,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Van Tighem, the attack survivor, advises hikers to ``be
educated'' about bear encounters _ and be on guard at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Despite literally losing the left side of her face _ including
her eye _ and battling ongoing infections, she continues to hike
with her husband, Trevor, and their four children, ages 3 to 14,
near their home in the mountains of southeastern British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep my head up. Alertness is very important; it's
surprising a bear that can get you into trouble,'' she said. ``We
also make noise and keep scanning the trail.''
</P>
<P>
   They recently came upon a large brown bear, the first Van Tighem
had faced since the attack. ``I was terrified,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her family stood still.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't budge,'' Van Tighem said, ``but it was completely
nonaggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The bear ``sat and scratched, and dug, then took a few steps,
but mostly paid no attention to us.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her family slowly retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the parking lot, Van Tighem's 10-year-old son, Daniel,
said, ``That bear was acting normal. That was good for you to see a
bear acting normal, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack 20 years ago taught Van Tighem a lot about bears, and
why humans react to them the way they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bears are a metaphor for all the things we can't control,''
she said, ``things that are unpredictable and powerful and make us
feel paralyzed and question who we are.''

TALK OF END OF MILOSEVIC ERA FILLS BELGRADE'S STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In the crumbling streets of a faded
Belgrade, tired and worn from 10 years of international sanctions
and isolation, most people have simply had enough of the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not sure he is going to go quietly after his
apparent defeat in Sunday's elections here. And they are nervous
about a police crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Serbia, so why should anything be easy?'' said Sasha,
drinking an espresso at the Ipanema cafe. ``Everything is clear.
It's not finished, but it's clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Gojko Komazec, a waiter with a long ponytail, said that few
believe the preliminary vote totals that state television suddenly
announced Tuesday night, showing Milosevic trailing his main
challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, but denying Kostunica an outright
victory in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica immediately accused the government of vote fraud,
challenged the Federal Election Commission to verify its results,
and said he would not participate in a second round on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Is Milosevic finished? ``I hope so,'' Komazec said. ``This is
the first time I can remember that I'm not worried about our
future. But I am very worried about the next few days,'' when the
opposition, which says Kostunica has won outright, holds rallies to
support him.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, people were snapping up independent daily
newspapers like Blic, Danas and Glas Javnosti to get the news, and
there were angry conversations about Milosevic's effort to buy time
and hang on to power. Overhead, campaign posters for Milosevic's
Socialist Party are beginning to fade.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the bomb damage from last year's NATO airstrikes
has been fixed in Belgrade, including repairs to the Foreign
Ministry and the Serbian Parliament buildings, other structures,
like the headquarters of the Yugoslav army and the Serbian and
federal Interior Ministry buildings, are untouched, blasted and
sooty.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even the Brankov Bridge over the Sava River to New Belgrade is
only half-painted, with one set of guardrails an already fading
blue, while the other side was never repainted at all.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the markets are full of fruits and vegetables, even if there
is grumbling over the prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be better for all of us if he just goes, and takes
his family, too,'' said Pero Drvenica, pushing his three-year-old
daughter, Milica, through the Kalenic market, full of bright red
peppers and orange squashes. ``He's finished, and he has to know
it. It's obvious he lost and he's in a panic, and nobody believes
this children's story of a second round.''
</P>
<P>
   Drvenica said he would come to any rally the opposition called
and bring Milica, too. ``It's her future,'' he said. ``This guy, if
he's clever, could finish this very easily and just accept the vote
of the people. In a second round he'll be humiliated even more.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Darko, who asked that his last name not be used, said that he
had been pressured in his company to sign a petition for
Milosevic's candidacy. In the end, he said, he signed twice, for
two different bosses. He voted for Kostunica anyway, in part
because of his anti-communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic has got to go,'' Darko said. ``I'm so happy, but
mostly for my father,'' whose property had been confiscated after
World War II by the victorious communists. He said he had convinced
his sister, a Milosevic supporter, to vote for Kostunica, too. ``I
told her, `Don't vote for yourself. Vote for your kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dragana Kreca, 31, works as a waitress, complaining that jobs in
state companies are mostly reserved for members of the ruling
parties of Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is over,'' she said. ``Maybe not today, but sometime
soon. Serbia voted for Kostunica and a different future _ it's
enough of this life of cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Miroslav Curcic, 48, was selling huge sacks of peppers and
cucumbers from his truck. ``I don't know how Milosevic will give up
technically and how he'll accept his loss, but he's gone,'' Curcic
said. ``America punished all of us because of this guy, who was
your ally at one moment, and you didn't do much to help us get rid
of him,'' he said. ``Now he can go to China or India, it doesn't
matter, but he has to go.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Curcic, Milosevic's campaign was offensive. ``These are
stupidities they sell to old people,'' he said. ``We all know our
kids aren't terrorists, and it's crazy to call anyone who thinks
different an enemy of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, by contrast, said Nenad Piljak, is ``a normal man.''
Piljak sells fruit in the morning and studies to be a
physiotherapist in the afternoon, and he likes Kostunica's defense
of Serb interests. ``I believe it is an honest and fair patriotism
that he represents,'' Piljak said. ``I think it's fine that he has
this distance from America. Serbia belongs in Europe. The Americans
bombed this country and committed a big crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't European countries in NATO bomb, too? ``Yes, they
participated,'' he said. ``But everyone knows who the big boss
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs also committed crimes in Kosovo, Piljak said,
especially with the expulsion of so many Albanians. ``But Serbia
was also defending what belongs to her,'' he said. Kostunica
strikes the right balance, Piljak said, adding that he found the
Milosevic campaign offputting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest crime is to divide your own people into patriots
and traitors because of their political beliefs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These elections ``are the beginning of the end of Milosevic,''
Piljak said. ``He needs to lose the Serbian elections before he
finally goes.''
</P>
<P>
   As for himself, Piljak has no plans to study this week. ``I'm
going to go to the rallies and greet my new president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Brankovic, a civil engineer, will go, too. But he's
anxious. ``I hope Milosevic is finished, but I'm not sure,'' he
said. ``He still has the police and the army. I'm too old _ I'm 51
_ and I'm a little bit afraid of what will happen, but really I'm
afraid for my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Stankovic, 32, says he voted for the first time in 10
years, and he thinks Kostunica is right to reject a second round.
``In the evening, I'll come out with my brother and my friends to
the rallies, and if we have to fight, we'll fight,'' he said. ``But
I don't think the police and army will fight with us. I really do
expect them to accept the will of the people.''

<HEADLINE>
GEORGE RODRIGUE'S POP-ART POOCH IS HOTTER THAN EVER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ANDREW MARTON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may well go down as the most profitable bedtime story ever
told. When George Rodrigue was just a tyke growing up in the
southern Louisiana town of New Iberia, he was spellbound by his
mama's French-Cajun tale of the werewolf, or ``loup-garou.'' This
snarling creature would prowl the nearby sugar-cane fields, his
mamma said, snatching up misbehaving youngsters and devouring them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when Rodrigue, 56, had grown into a moderately
successful Louisiana-based painter, he was working on illustrations
for a book on Louisiana ghost stories like the ones his mother
recounted. Drawing from memory and some mysterious inspiration,
Rodrigue began painting a dog-wolf creature bathed in the blue glow
of a bayou moon. Rodrigue's friends and hangers-on soon dubbed the
result ``the Blue Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``cash cow'' might be a better name for Rodrigue's bit of
brushwork. Rodrigue's Blue Dog has become one of the most
recognized and marketed artistic icons ever conjured up. Not since
Andy Warhol's Campbell's soup can, Peter Max's Froot Loop-colored
posters or Keith Haring's radiant dog series has one artist plugged
in so completely to the mercurial pop-art market.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigue's azure doggy is reaping all the rewards that
commercial pop art can offer. From that memorable week in 1990 when
20 of the artist's Blue Dog works all but flew out of his New
Orleans gallery, Rodrigue now enjoys $8 million in annual sales of
Blue Dog art at his four galleries in New Orleans; Carmel, Calif.;
Munich; and Tokyo. At one time, a Blue Dog oil painting could be
had for $400 to $600. Today, they can't be fetched for under
$15,000, with ones measuring 8 feet by 12 feet commanding close to
$350,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first painted the Blue Dog, it was what I wanted, and
then all of a sudden it was what everyone wanted,'' Rodrigue
sheepishly admits.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigue's most recent book, ``Blue Dog Man'' (Stewart, Tabori &AMP;
Chang, $50), has sold briskly, and the Blue Dog Cafe opened in June
of last year in Lafayette, La.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Blue Dog's A-list of patrons, beginning
with Bill and Hillary Clinton. Jane Fonda also owns Blue Dog art.
Whoopi Goldberg has six of the cerulean creatures and wants to base
a TV series on the mysterious canine. Stroll through the homes of
TV anchorman Tom Brokaw or jazz entertainer Harry Connick Jr., and
several Blue Dog works will all but bark at you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Dog is a character, not a cartoon like Snoopy,''
Rodrigue cautions. ``It's a pure pop art image that, unlike Andy
Warhol's art, which was made from established labels, I've created
on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, yet no pop image can officially take its place
alongside such famously faddish logos as the yellow smiley face
until a corporation makes it part of an ad campaign. For Rodrigue,
that happened when the Xerox corporation created a $200 million,
five-year campaign requiring 30 renditions of the Blue Dog for the
corporation's print and TV ads. NBC's current Olympics broadcast
features one spot in which the Blue Dog pitches Xerox's latest
``new breed'' of color printer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These commercials are just another type of painting for me, a
way to get the image to people for free,'' says Rodrigue, who
allows only that he will ``get a lot'' financially in the Xerox
deal.
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, Rodrigue's Blue Dog fame brought him to North
Texas, as Neiman Marcus invited him to be its guest at the annual
Cattle Baron's Ball. There, Rodrigue presided over the charity
auctioning of one of the three painted cows he made for Chicago's
``cows on parade'' street exhibit. One of the cows, covered in his
Blue Dog motif, reaped $25,000 at the ball's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The object of all this feverish spending is a disarming little
creature with a cobalt-blue coat and a downy white snout. The
sources of its mass appeal must be in its completely placid pose,
and its yellow eyes that seem to hypnotize a viewer even as they
project a Buddhalike empathy. It seems to be a furry oracle, a
feral fount of life's answers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one, starting with its creator, really understands the
root of its overwhelming success. ``I painted the dog as if it was
a person and a spirit,''
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigue says. ``He is looking on behalf of mankind. I mean,
I've seen people cry in front of it, love it, cherish it and just
connect with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave of his current commercial appeal, Rodrigue
doesn't seem defensive about the possible co-opting of his artistic
creativity by the bottom-line world of corporate marketing. ``In
pop art, there is no longer a real hard line between art and
promotion or advertising,'' Rodrigue says. ``The public already
interacts every day with pop art images from Exxon or Coca-Cola, so
really, it is just about how you reach the public with your
product, and art is my product.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, for all Rodrigue's acceptance of the commercial
requirements of being a pop artist, he holds on tightly to the
creative reins of his Blue Dog creation. Indeed, before Xerox
approached Rodrigue, he had turned down dozens of other
corporations because he would have lost creative control of his
Blue Dog image. He has also rejected those who want his dog to
decorate T-shirts and key rings, although he will produce, at least
according to his own Web site, Blue Dog notecards and a desk
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to sell my Blue Dog in some open-ended deal the
way Snoopy was sold to Met Life,'' Rodrigue says.
</P>
<P>
   Just how closely Rodrigue plans on clutching his Blue Dog idea
will be seen in next year's Xerox print ads, in which Rodrigue
tentatively plans to paint all the elements (images of the Xerox
printers, the ad text) along with his signature Blue Dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Dog is of today, and whether it lasts or not, history
will tell us,'' Rodrigue says. ``The first test, though, was to
break away and get out of the pack. The public already made that
happen.''

 &HT;    A feast for eyes, nose and mouth
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Van Waerebeek puts the Belgian love of food like this: ``We
are a country of 10 million people and 5 million cafes.'' At those
cafes (and in their home kitchens), Belgians love to feast on
mussels and fries, divine chocolate and specialty beers.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian native Philippe Haddad, chef/owner of Philippe's a
Bistro in Peachtree Hills, remembers his parents' dinner parties
featuring exquisite charcuterie, sauerkraut made with champagne and
cabbage pickled at home. ``It was a feast for your eyes and your
nose and then your mouth,'' said Haddad.
</P>
<P>
   Here, we offer a few representative dishes that are easy to
prepare and guaranteed to open the door on a whole new cuisine that
many of us have not experienced in depth before.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, start with the mussels, which have become far
easier to find in grocery stores (though to be sure you still may
want to order ahead). Keep in mind that mussels are still alive
when you purchase them. So don't keep them in an airtight bag. Do
keep them in chilled ice water until ready to cook. Add a pinch or
two of cornmeal to the water to aid in cleaning. Use a sharp knife
to scrape off the beards. If a mussel opens during cleaning, tap it
lightly; it should close again. If it doesn't, it's dead and should
be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking mussels couldn't be easier. Those of you with home deep
fryers will have no excuse for not trying the traditional frites.
(Fried potato lovers may want to invest in a fryer.) The beef and
beer stew is simple and absolutely ideal for the cool weather
ahead. And chocoholics won't want to miss the Belgian ganache tart.
Be sure to pick up some Belgian beers to enjoy with this cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   APPETIZER

<P>
   Steamed Mussels With Beer and Curry

<P>
   Makes 4 appetizer servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 7 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, mussels are often served family style; the steaming
pot is brought to the table along with a big empty bowl (or the lid
of the pot) for discarded shells. This version gets its sunny
yellow sauce from the curry. Be sure to have plenty of bread on
hand for dipping. The sauce is divine.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>

<P>
   1 tablespoon finely minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely minced chives
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a pot large enough to hold all the mussels. A
large stock/soup pot will work; so will a large saute pan. You'll
need a lid. Add the shallots, garlic and curry powder and saute for
about 3 minutes. Add the mussels and sprinkle with a generous
grinding of black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the beer and the cream over the mussels and cover the pot
tightly. Steam the mussels over high heat for 3 to 4 minutes, until
they open. Take pot off heat and shake vigorously to toss the
mussels with the buttery shallots and garlic. Garnish with parsley
and chives. Serve at once. _ From: Ruth Van Waerebeek, Cook's

   This is a classic Belgian-style mussel dish that Philippe Haddad
serves at his bistro in Peachtree Hills. If you want to serve it as
an appetizer, simply steam fewer mussels, but you'll probably want
to keep the amounts the same for the rest of the recipe. That way,
you'll have plenty of sauce for dipping bread into. Serve with
fries and Belgian beer for a complete and classic Belgian meal.

   Shaun Doty, chef at Mumbo Jumbo, and his assistant Jeremy Fox
have both trained in Belgian restaurants and mastered the art of
pommes frites. The key is to fry the potatoes twice (russet
potatoes work best). Use a home deep fryer rather than a pot, which
can be dangerous (grease pops out) and difficult to get even heat
in. And work in small batches; too many fries at once will bring
down the temperature of the oil.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a step-by-step recipe. Master it and you'll understand
why the Belgians love to have frites with just about everything.
Serve with homemade mayonnaise for the authentic experience. They
are unbelievable with bearnaise sauce. And, of course, the American
standby, ketchup, is also good.
</P>
<P>
   6 large russet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   Peanut oil or canola oil, enough to fill a home fryer to
manufacturer's specifications (some call for as much as 2 quarts
oil)
</P>
<P>
   Salt (and pepper or other seasonings, if desired)
</P>
<P>
   Peel the potatoes and cut them in half lengthwise. Put the flat
side of each potato half on a cutting board and cut lengthwise into
1/4- to 1/2-inch wedges. Soak the cut potatoes in a bowl of water
for 15 minutes to overnight (this rinses off the exterior starches
so the fries won't stick to each other).
</P>
<P>
   Add oil to the deep fryer and heat to 300 degrees. Remove the
fries from the water and thoroughly pat dry with a kitchen towel.
In small batches, fry the potatoes for about 3-4 minutes. The fries
should still be fairly white and al dente (soft on the outside but
still firm in the center). Drain and place in single layers on dry
kitchen towels. Allow to rest for at least 15 minutes. (You can do
this step in the morning, cover and allow to rest until evening if
desired.)
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in the deep fryer to 375 degrees. Again in small
batches, fry the potatoes for another 3-4 minutes, until the fries
are golden brown. Remove and season immediately with salt and other
preferred seasonings such as pepper, paprika, cayenne, garlic salt
and chopped parsley. Serve with dipping sauces (mayonnaise is the
classic Belgian choice).

   Just in time for apple season, this salad is simple and elegant
_ a fine example of Belgian cuisine. The bitter endive is mellowed
by the sweet vinaigrette. The salty cheese toast pairs nicely with
the apple wedges. To toast walnuts, spread in a single layer on a
baking sheet and bake in a 400-degree oven until they begin to
brown, 7-9 minutes. You'll have plenty of vinaigrette left over;
store tightly covered in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   For the vinaigrette:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup walnut oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup corn oil
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup raspberry or cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   For the Roquefort Toast:
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces Roquefort or other blue cheese, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room
</P>
<P>
   temperature
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 slices firm white bread, lightly toasted
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely minced fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   (optional)
</P>
<P>
   For the salad:
</P>
<P>
   4 cups Boston lettuce, red-leaf lettuce, radicchio and/or
watercress leaves, rinsed, dried and torn into bite-size pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 Belgian endives, cored and leaves separated
</P>
<P>
   1 tart green or red apple, unpeeled, halved, cored and thinly
sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup walnuts, lightly toasted and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler. To make the vinaigrette, whisk together the
walnut oil, corn oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and set aside. Next,
cream together the cheese and the butter with a fork or on the low
setting of a mixer. Spread the mixture on the toasted bread and
broil until the cheese has completely melted and becomes bubbly,
1-2 minutes. Sprinkle with the chives, if using. Cut each toast
diagonally into 4 triangles.
</P>
<P>
   For the salad, spread the mixed leaves on a big platter. Arrange
the endive leaves, alternating with the apple slices, on top of the
lettuce leaves. Sprinkle with walnuts and shallot. Just before
serving, drizzle 1-2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette over the salad.
Arrange the warm Roquefort Toast triangles on the salad. Serve
remaining vinaigrette on the side (and refrigerate leftover
vinaigrette in a tightly closed container for up to 1 week). _

   Brussels sprouts are one of those vegetables that divide _
either folks love them or hate them. I used to be in the ``hate
them'' camp until I began to experience them fresh and lightly
cooked. Philippe Haddad serves grilled chicken over the sprouts and
potatoes in this hearty dish that's popular at his bistro _ it
makes for an ideal fall meal. The bacon really adds extra flavor.
Applewood bacon can be found at eatZi's in Buckhead. You can
substitute another smoked bacon if you prefer. Haddad uses a
bone-in breast; we adapted the recipe to boneless chicken breast.
If you prefer bone-in, increase cooking time to ensure the chicken
is thoroughly cooked.
</P>
<P>
   4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, free range
preferred, about 6 to 8 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 slices applewood-smoked bacon, sliced
</P>
<P>
   crosswise into thin strips
</P>
<P>
   1 large shallot, diced
</P>
<P>
   3 Idaho potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds total), peeled, cut into
3/4-inch dice, blanched
</P>
<P>
   for 3 to 4 minutes, and drained
</P>
<P>
   1 cup brussels sprouts (about 8 to 10 medium), blanched for 2 to
3 minutes, drained well, and halved
</P>
<P>
   Pinch freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dark Belgian beer
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Trim all excess fat from chicken breasts, brush with 1
tablespoon of the olive oil, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the
thyme, the rosemary and black pepper to taste. Heat a large cast
iron skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat and brush with a
little of the olive oil. Place the chicken breasts in the pan, skin
side down, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes or until golden on that
side. Turn and continue cooking until just cooked through and
browned on the second side. (You can use a charcoal or gas grill if
preferred.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the remaining olive oil, the bacon strips and shallots. Cook,
stirring constantly, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the
potatoes and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the
brussels sprouts and nutmeg, and continue to cook until browned.
Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   When chicken is done, remove to a plate and set aside. Add the
beer to the pan you cooked the chicken in to deglaze it. Boil
briefly, adding the remaining thyme, and season with salt and
pepper to taste. Slice the breasts on the diagonal, and serve at
once on top of a mound of the potato-brussels sprout mixture. Pour
a little of the sauce on top of each serving.

   Leeks are hugely popular in Belgium and are prepared a number of
ways _ braised, steamed and broiled. It's quite lovely. This recipe
comes from ``Belgo Cookbook'' by Denis Blais and Andre Plisnier
(Clarkson Potter, $25). Belgo is a trendy restaurant in London and
New York that features Belgian cuisine and waiters dressed as monks
(paying homage to the beer-brewing tradition of Belgian monks).
</P>
<P>
   Try to find slender leeks if possible; if not, split thicker
ones lengthwise for a nicer presentation. Look for leeks that have
a longer white section compared to the green. That will make them
easier to wash well and still be able to cook whole.
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds leeks, about 8 medium
</P>
<P>
   Water for cooking leeks
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon finely chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   Good pinch fresh thyme leaves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Peel off the outer leaves of the leeks, and trim the root ends
and green tops so that they are all the same size. Wash them well.
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large skillet or saute pan with water, add 1 teaspoon
salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the leeks and cook
until they are tender right through when tested with the point of a
knife _ this will take about 20 minutes, depending on size. (Twenty
minutes was about right for leeks that were about 3/4 inch in
diameter.) Remove the leeks from the pan, refresh under cold
running water, then gently squeeze them dry. Place in the
refrigerator and chill until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prepare the vinaigrette: In a small mixing bowl,
combine the mustard, garlic, shallots, thyme, vinegar, salt and
pepper. Slowly add the oils, whisking constantly. When ready to
serve, remove the leeks from the refrigerator, pour the vinaigrette
over them and serve at once.

   Put this on the menu for fall and winter. It's easy and robust.
This stew has long been a part of the culinary heritage of Belgium,
and every cook has his version of it, passing along the secrets to
the next generation. This is best made a day ahead, and the success
depends on the quality of beer. Look for a rich, dark and slightly
bitter beer, like Rodenbach, a dark Abbey beer or Leffe Dark. This
is another dish that Belgians eat with fries.
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds boneless stew meat (beef), such as chuck, cut into
2-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   3 large onions (about 2 pounds), thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 bottles (12 ounces each) of dark beer,
</P>
<P>
   preferably Belgian
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons red currant jelly (or brown sugar)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cider or red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Season the beef cubes with the salt and pepper and dredge with
the flour. Shake off any excess. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter
in a large heavy skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking.
Add the beef cubes and saute until nicely browned on all sides.
Work in batches so as not to crowd the beef cubes or they will
steam instead of saute. Add 1 tablespoon of butter, if necessary.
Transfer the beef cubes to a heavy Dutch oven.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet and melt
over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally,
until browned, about 15 minutes. If necessary, raise the heat
toward the end of the cooking time. It is important to brown the
meat and the onions evenly to give the stew its deep brown color.
Stir the onions just enough to avoid burning them but not so often
as to interrupt the browning. Put the onions in the Dutch oven with
the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the beer into the skillet and deglaze, scraping with a
wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits and bring to a boil. Pour the
beer over the meat. Add the thyme and bay leaves. Simmer, covered,
over low heat until the meat is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Just
before serving, stir in the red currant jelly or brown sugar and
the vinegar; simmer for 5 minutes. (Do not skip this step. It gives
the stew great depth of flavor.) Taste, adjust seasonings and serve
(or allow to come to room temperature, and then store in an
airtight container in the refrigerator for a day, reheat and
serve.) _ From: ``Everybody Eats Well in Belgium Cookbook'' by Ruth

<P>
   1 recipe Basic Flemish Pie Crust (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces best-quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped into small
pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon espresso powder (or 2 tablespoons instant regular
coffee)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup confectioners' sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg yolk, mixed with 1 tablespoon water for egg wash
</P>
<P>
   Unsweetened cocoa powder for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks for serving, optional
</P>
<P>
   Generously butter a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.
Roll out the pie crust dough on a lightly floured surface into a
circle slightly less than 1/4 inch thick. Line the tart pan with
the dough, trim the edges and prick the bottom evenly with a fork.
Refrigerate for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line the bottom of the tart pan
with aluminum foil. Fill 2/3 full with dry rice or beans or pie
weights. Place in the oven and bake 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 375
degrees and continue baking until the pastry is lightly browned,
another 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the foil and pie weights and let the
crust cool completely on a wire rack. Leave the oven on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prepare the chocolate filling: Place the chocolate
pieces in a mixing bowl. In a medium saucepan over medium-high
heat, combine the cream, espresso powder and confectioners' sugar.
Bring to a rolling boil. Immediately pour this hot cream mixture
over the chopped chocolate and stir with a wooden spoon until the
chocolate is melted and smooth. Beat in the eggs and egg yolks, one
at a time, until thoroughly combined.
</P>
<P>
   Brush the bottom and sides of the pastry with the egg wash. Pour
in the chocolate ganache and bake in the preheated 375 degree oven
until set, about 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
When cool enough to handle, remove the side of the pan and let cool
completely. Chill in the refrigerator for 4 or more hours before
serving.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Use a fine sieve to sprinkle the cocoa powder evenly
over the surface of the tart, place a doily on top of the cocoa,
and sift a layer of confectioners' sugar on top. Very carefully
remove the doily. You will have a very pretty decorative pattern.
Or simply serve the tart cold with a bowl of freshly whipped cream.

   Waffles are usually the first thing that comes to mind with the
prompt ``Belgian food.'' Yeast is what sets Belgian waffles apart.
The waffles are light, buttery and have just the right amount of
sweetness. They would be great topped with ice cream and chocolate
sauce for dessert. You do need a Belgian waffle iron, with the deep
holes and extra height, to make these work.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe calls for leaving the batter on the countertop
overnight. While most food and bread experts say the ages-old
practice is safe because the batter will be fully cooked and any
harmful bacteria destroyed, federal food safety advice is to
refrigerate it. If you are concerned about any health risk,
refrigerate after two hours' fermentation.

whites in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk.
Beat egg whites until they form soft peaks. Using a rubber spatula,
gently fold the egg whites into the batter. Do not overmix. The
batter might have streaks or be slightly lumpy. Pour 1/2 cup of
batter into each square section of the waffle iron, spread evenly.
Cook for 3 minutes or until golden brown (times may vary by waffle
iron). Repeat with remaining batter.

 &HT;    The Belgian Way: At last, small country's cuisine is beginning
to make big inroads in America _ and the robust dishes go way
beyond waffles
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, a friend in New York nudged me toward a
restaurant in her Greenwich Village neighborhood. ``Belgian food,''
she said. ``Cafe de Bruxelles. You'll like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Waffles for dinner won't do, I protested. And I don't want
brussels sprouts, either, exhausting my knowledge of Belgian
cuisine in half a breath.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed me through the door into the cramped and casual cafe.
We sat down at a table topped with white butcher paper and cracked
open the menu.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't believe my eyes. A recent convert to mussels, I was
astounded at the choices. There were mussels in cream and herbs.
Mussels with tomatoes and garlic. Mussels with wine and shallots.
Mussels steamed in beer. Mussels at least a dozen different ways.
There was the promise of plenty of bread to sop with, and (here's
where I really fell in love) there were the traditional pommes
frites on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The uninformed (as I was) would refer to pommes frites as french
fries. The Belgians will hear nothing of it. So what if France,
Spain and England all lay claim to frites; Belgians believe they
are the original potato-frying nation. To back this claim, they've
perfected the twice-fried-to-a-crisp technique and serve them in
paper cones or cups with an array of sauces for dipping.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the only proper partner for the classic Belgian
bistro fare of mussels and fries is Belgian beer, which is taken as
seriously as wine is in France.
</P>
<P>
   If your knowledge of Belgian cuisine is as limited as mine was,
don't fret. The Belgians are coming.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Cafe de Bruxelles has been joined by
nearly a dozen Belgian restaurants in New York, from trendy
chain-concept Belgo to farmhouselike Le Pain Quotidien. Why, right
there at Times Square is B. Frites, a fast-food outlet that often
has a line out the door. It serves only Belgian fries and dipping
sauces (the classic is homemade mayo).
</P>
<P>
   And, this month, the city so hard to impress practically gushed
over Belgium's Crown Prince Philippe and Princess Mathilde when
they visited the Big Apple. The New York Times referred to the
couple as ``the fabulously cool new royals'' (compared to the
stodgy old British ones) and noted the ``effusion of Belgianoph
eateries'' and the ``explosion of interest in Belgian beers,
chocolates and double-fried potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Atlanta, Belgian-born chef Philippe Haddad opened a
bistro in Peachtree Hills this year featuring many classic Belgian
dishes such as braised rabbit and waterzooi (a seafood stew).
Belgian-trained Shaun Doty, chef at Mumbo Jumbo, includes some
classic Belgian bistro cuisine on his menu, including pommes
frites. Belgian beers like Hoegaarden and Stella Artois are flowing
more than ever from bars around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belgian cuisine is one of the last of the Western European
cuisines to make a presence in the U.S.,'' said Milford Pruitt, a
writer for Nation's Restaurant News who has tracked the trend.
</P>
<P>
   While New York has been the epicenter, Belgian eateries are
popping up in other cities such as Washington and Philadelphia. And
Belgo, which began in London, is eyeing expansion to other U.S.
cities beyond New York.
</P>
<P>
   Better not to wait for a Belgian bistro to pop up on your
corner, though.
</P>
<P>
   This food, which Haddad described as ``close to French, but not
as artsy,'' is easy to make at home and worth the (fairly minimal)
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use just a few ingredients, but we do everything right,''
said Ruth Van Waerebeek, author of ``Everybody Eats Well in Belgium
Cookbook'' (Workman, $15.95), who recently taught a cooking class
on Belgian cuisine at Cook's Warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Waerebeek explained that Belgians rely on heirloom recipes that
seek to balance bitter and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The native Belgian endive, for example, is often braised and
then finished with a powdering of confectioners' sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet scallops might be splashed with a spicy and bitter aged
beer. Carbonades Flamandes, or beef stewed in (what else?) beer, is
given a splash of vinegar after a couple of hours of slow cooking.
</P>
<P>
   We offer a primer on Belgian classics, including one of Haddad's
mussel recipes, Doty's step-by-step pommes frites, Waerebeeks' beef
stew and a Belgian chocolate ganache tart that begs for pairing
with a little Kriek, the Belgian cherry-flavored ale that's often
served as an after-dinner drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most amazing food,'' said Haddad.
</P>
<P>
   ``So simple and so tasty.''

 &HT;    In the mountains, nature stages its own light show
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ Light is like any other valuable; the less
there is of it, the more it's worth. Trying to enjoy every particle
as days grow shorter, I want light to wash over me, cleanse me of
sticky summer, show me fresh views of the garden.
</P>
<P>
   So, on some days I become my father when he was an old man,
going to bed with nightfall, rising early, getting to the garden as
often as I can, staying as long as light lasts _ and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic that there's less light just when lower temperatures
make being outside more bearable. Here on my ridge, light arrives
like a slow-moving train; it is not until 9 or 10 o'clock that we
see and feel it fully, hours after it shows itself from afar,
lighting up the top of the ridge across Fightingtown Creek.
</P>
<P>
   While light here still is relatively free of man-made haze, some
mornings do block it with rolling fog, lending a lovely surreality
to the landscape, showing trees and shrubs through a lens dimly
lit.
</P>
<P>
   But like so much of nature here, light operates in extremes.
Foggy early, yes, but later it rises above the thick forests of
pines, oaks, maples and shines, bright, hard-edged, on autumn's
garden, that space combining seasonal renewal and decline. This
light is unforgiving and uncompromising, exposing every crevice and
crinkle. At midday, it can be white hot, even in autumn. At the
same time, light is a garden feature in itself, fashioning plant
shadows into intriguing images. (Look over there _ a cloud-pruned
Japanese black pine that becomes a stick figure lying on the
ground.) And it provides as illuminating a look at individual
plants as you'll ever get.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I saw a treeful of deep-green magnolia leaves
glistening, shimmering in the light breeze, surrounding five white
blossoms still waiting to open. The light turned their thin petals
to satin. Satin, too, were the pink blooms of the hardy begonia,
complementing the hanging seed pods _ little brown lanterns lit by
the afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   At last, I have grown zinnias from seed, seed donated by several
zinnia gardeners who knew of my past failures. This year, those
pretty-petaled plants stand tall, glowing in the sunshine like
fringed balloons of many colors.
</P>
<P>
   Fuzzy mullein has to be touched, explored. How else can you know
how fine that hairy surface feels when sun streams across it?
</P>
<P>
   Mullein and other grays and whites _ and yellows _ always light
dark corners of the garden, but this time of year they seem to glow
brighter than ever. Leaves of dusty miller, blooms of lantana,
goldenrod absorb the light and give it back, magnified and
magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   Standing near each another, the purple-blooming rosemary and the
bloomed-out lavender compete for best of show in the gray-green
category. In lighting up their part of the garden, they give extra;
brushing and enjoying their fragrant leaves during a walk down the
path would be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The darker fennel shines too as light streaks through its lacy
form, turning that sweet plant into an elaborate spider web,
catching attention and admiration for hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   As always, there is decay in the garden, even amid light, which
is life itself.
</P>
<P>
   When you get real close to joe-pye weed this time of year, you
notice that its pinkish-purplish flowers have started to come
undone, showing fuzzy white at their unraveling tips. And the last
cherry tomatoes glow lonely, looking so much like the Jerusalem
cherry fruit soon to shrivel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the leaves of gold and red and yellow, drifting
through autumn light, represent decay too, but what glorious decay.
Divine decadence, really. Remnants from lives of spring and summer.
Remnants of lives lived well.
</P>
<P>
   How satisfying that they, and we, see the light.
</P>

 &HT;    Shopping Destination: Cashiers, N.C.
 &HT;    A country crossroads that brims with flavor
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cashiers, N.C. _ Maybe it was the gray of the day, but somehow
cut flowers never looked more colorful and home-grown tomatoes
never redder than they did on a recent rainy Sunday morning at the
Cashiers Farmers Market.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drizzle, a steady stream of folks stopped in to
trade with owners Robin and Tom Crawford, who welcome regulars and
first-timers alike with small-town friendliness. The place is
packed with the region's bounty: fresh-from-the-farm produce,
apples from Hendersonville, breads from Annie's Naturally in Sylva,
sourwood honey from Cashiers, Morgan Mill grits and flour from
Brevard, coffee from Smoky Mountain Roasters in Clyde and the
market's private-label jams, jellies and relishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bit of European shopping,'' says Paul Sanger,
holding a plastic bag filled with ripe tomatoes. The landscape
contractor owns homes in Atlanta and Cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   Sanger says a trio of businesses are his favorite places in
Cashiers: the Farmers Market; the Chopping Block, where he buys
meat and seafood; and the Chattooga Nursery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the atmosphere that makes it special,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The Farmers Market is one of the few businesses open on Sunday,
but on Saturday the town at the intersection of U.S. 64 and N.C.
107 _ they call it the ``Crossroads'' _ is full of browsers and
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shop-lined ``downtown'' in Cashiers. Instead, most
of the businesses are clustered in mini-shopping centers such as
Cashiers Commons, Chestnut Square and Village Walk Fine Shops.
Antique shops are scattered around the area. Less than a half-mile
from the Crossroads on N.C. 107 is where you'll find Basketworks,
Rusticks and Vivianne Metzer Antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cashiers shops are outposts of stores in nearby Highlands.
One is Southern Hands, which carries fine crafts from North
Carolina artists, such as woodturner Donald Krebs of Scaly Mountain
and Lee Davis of Brasstown, as well as other Southern artists. But
the store also has an area exclusive on handmade hardwood
reproduction Shaker furniture by Douglas Dines of Pennsylvania.
Another sister store is Bird Barn, which has everything for birds
and bird lovers, gardens and gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   Cottage Walk, one of the few shops open Sundays, is a treasure
chest of antique and reproduction furniture, lamps and interesting
accessories. Of particular interest are trunklike Austrian wedding
boxes from the 1880s used to hold a bride's dowry. ``Some have the
original locks and paints, and all have lots of history,'' says
employee Dan Allen. Prices range from $500 to $1,100.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to drive on N.C. 107 south to check out Basketworks,
where the eclectic array of merchandise displayed in room vignettes
includes some rare 17th- and 18th-century Chinese figures. Nearby
is Rusticks, which has everything to decorate a mountain home in a
style that blends rustic with elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Before you set out for the stores, pick up a shopping guide at
the Cashiers Area Chamber of Commerce on N.C. 107 north, next to
the Laurelwood Mountain Inn. Think of it as a road map to retail
nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   The map also shows the Cashiers Walking Trail, which loops
through the main shopping area.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be surprised if you run into someone you know. As Bird
Barn employee Janice Bryson says: ``Most of Atlanta is up here.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From downtown Atlanta, take I-85 to I-985 and
stay on Ga. 365/U.S. 23 to U.S. 441 at Cornelia. North of Dillard
look for signs for Highlands and follow N.C. 106. In Highlands, go
west on U.S. 64 to Cashiers, which is at the intersection of N.C.
107.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most shops are open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays; a
few shops are open Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Spaces are provided outside businesses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: At the Cashiers Area Chamber of Commerce, N.C. 107
south (at the Crossroads). Also, restaurants and the Exxon station
offer facilities for customers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Some steps.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 828-743-5191 (Chamber of Commerce).
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wild Thyme Gourmet Continental Cafe: If the urge to get a bite
strikes while you're browsing the shops of Village Walk, head
straight to Wild Thyme for sandwiches, soup, salads and
from-scratch baked goods. Two excellent choices are Curry Chicken
Salad ($6.95) and the Turkey, Brie and Avocado Wrap ($7.50). N.C.
107 south. 11:30 a.m.-3 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays. 828-743-1065.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cornucopia: Near Basketworks, the Book &AMP; Specialty Shop and
Rusticks, this wonderful little restaurant is housed in the
second-oldest building in Cashiers Valley, built in 1892. Lunch
entrees include the Fifth Generation Meatless Sandwich, with
spinach, cream Havarti and avocado ($6.95); Chicken Mandarin
Spinach Salad ($7.95); Bengal Curry Chicken Salad ($8.49, served in
a melon half); and Crab Cakes ($10.95). Leave room for homemade
desserts _ we went for the vanilla buttermilk pie ($3) and the
fresh blackberry cobbler a la mode ($3.50). 11 a.m.-2:30 p.m.
daily; 6-9 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays. N.C. 107 south. 828-743-3750.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Laurelwood Mountain Inn: You can't beat the location of this
rustic mom-and-pop-style motel and log cabin suites. It's a half
block north of the Crossroads and walking distance from most shops
and restaurants. There's a large deck with rockers, and the wooded
grounds are beautifully groomed. On the 1 1/2 acres are a
children's playground, gazebo, picnic table and grill. Owners Bob
and Lise Dewes live on site and can help you plan tennis and golf
outings, skiing, horseback riding, drives to the area's many scenic
waterfalls _ or whatever you want to do.
</P>
<P>
   $67-$135. 1-800-346-6846; www.laurelmountaininn.com
</P>
<P>
   Beyond shopping
</P>
<P>
   At least nine waterfalls _ including Whitewater Falls, which at
411 feet is the highest falls in Eastern America _ are within a
30-miles radius of Cashiers. For more information, see the Jackson
County Chamber of Commerce tourism site at www.nc-mountains.com and
click on waterfalls. Or call 1-800-962-1911. Also, see

   Q: Please advise where I can find Andrea's Eye Q's Undereye
Circle Complex. I have searched in pharmacies in my area and could
not find it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dorothy Aenlle, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another Andrea query: For years I've used Andrea's Eye
Makeup Remover Pads, but recently I have not been able to find
them. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Miller, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: The eyes have it. Andrea's Eye Q's Undereye Circle Complex
($6.49 for a .5-ounce tube) is available at most Ulta stores. We
found ours at the 2059 Scenic Highway location in Snellville
(770-979-7151). The manufacturer says this treatment, which
contains vitamin K, diminishes undereye circles. The other Andrea
item, Eye Make-Up Remover Pads Original Formula, is available at
Eckerd Drugs, 2325 Pleasant Hill Road, Duluth (770-497-4425). A jar
of 65 pads is $4.49. These pads condition the eye area while gently
removing all traces of shadow color, liner pencil and mascara.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At an auction, I purchased an item containing a gift
certificate for a pound of See's Candies. I've never seen one of
their stores here. I'm originally from out West and consider See's
Candies a rare treat. Can you help me locate a store where I can
redeem the certificate?
</P>
<P>
   _ Eleanor Mascheck, Norcross, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: See what we found for you. Since 1921, the California-based
See's Candies has been making yummy confections. Today, See's, now
owned by Berkshire Hathaway, makes more than 100 varieties of
candies including chocolates, toffee, peanut brittle and lollipops.
The company does not have any shops in Georgia; however, for the
holiday season, it will open four gift centers that will sell
prepackaged candies and that will accept your gift certificate. The
openings and locations are: Nov. 11, Perimeter Mall and Mall of
Georgia; Nov. 16, North Point Mall in Alpharetta and Town Center at
Cobb. Shops will close Dec. 29. You can also order See's Candies at
www.sees.com or by calling 1-800-347-7337.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For years, I have been trying to locate ``Lindsay's Tea _
Royal Fireside.'' The container claims that the ``tea is full of
excitement.'' It also says to ``live dangerously and invite someone
you'd like to know better to tea.'' Please help me locate this
wildly delicious ambrosia!
</P>
<P>
   _ Midge Kennedy, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another tea request: I am trying to find TenRen Hibiscus
Spice Tea, which I bought in a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles.
Once brewed, the color is red. I would love to buy more of this
wonderful tea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Robin Patterson, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's tea for the two of you. Both San Francisco-based
companies offer a variety of teas steeped in tradition. Lindsay's
Teas has been family-owned for four generations by Mountanos Bros.
Coffee. The teas, which come from tea gardens around the world,
include black, green, oolong and white, as well as specialty teas.
Royal Fireside is a blend of China black tea, elderberries, orange
flowers and red sandalwood. A 4-ounce canister of loose tea is $9;
25 tea bags are $6.50. To order: 1-800-624-7031.
</P>
<P>
   TenRen has been a tea manufacturer in the Far East for more than
40 years. It exports a wide variety of teas including herbal,
green, black, white, oolong and King's tea, a blend of oolong and
ginseng. The tea is sold in California, Hawaii, Washington state,
Illinois, Texas, Maryland and New York. You can order Hibiscus
Spice, a blend of black tea and dried hibiscus flowers, through the
Internet (www.tenren.com) or by calling 1-877-898-0858. A box of 20
bags is $2.35; a box of 50 bags is $5.60.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been looking in every store for ``correction tabs'' to
be used on typing errors. You slip one into the typewriter, hit the
key where your error is, then retype with the correct letter or
number. The older I get, the more I need them. Help, please!
</P>
<P>
   _ Edna Ellingsen, Powder Springs, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: No more typos for you. We traced your item, officially called
Re-type Correction Film Tabs, to Artlite Office Supplies &AMP; Pens,
1851 Piedmont Road N.E. (404-875-7271). A box of 30 is $1.59.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to replace my 30-year-old Kik-Step kitchen stool by
Cramer. You kick the stool, and it rolls on casters. There's no
bending or lifting for hard-to-reach items. So far, I can't locate
a store that carries this item.
</P>
<P>
   _ William J. Johns, Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We got a kick out of your request. The Kik-Step kitchen stool
was invented by Roy Cramer in the '50s and is still rolling right
along. Kick the 14-inch stool and it rolls on casters. Step on it
and it locks. Nonskid treads prevent slipping. With its wraparound
bumper, your walls and furniture are protected. The Kik-Step
($49.95) comes in a variety of colors. It's available on the
Internat (www.kikstep.com) or by calling 1-888-670-5049. You can
also order it through a Crate &AMP; Barrel catalog for $59.95:
1-800-323-5461.

PREPARING THE POOL FOR WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best thing about having a swimming pool in your back yard is
that it's there whenever you want to use it.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing is that it's still there even when you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people like to keep their pools open as long as
possible,'' said Steven Mundree, president of H2O Pools, a pool
maintenance company in Irvington, N.Y. ``But right about now is
when I'm getting the most calls from customers who want to close
them up.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mundree and other pool experts said, while most
customers use pool maintenance professionals to shut down their
pools for the winter _ at a cost that can range anywhere from $100
to $500 _ it is a fairly simple procedure that a handy homeowner
can accomplish in an afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Keane, the owner of Ultimate Pool Covers in Mastic,
N.Y., said the first thing a homeowner should do when closing an
in-ground pool is to drain the filter by disconnecting the line
that runs from the filter to the pool and opening any drain plugs
on the filter itself. Then, Keane said, the water level in the pool
should be lowered using a submersible pump attached to a garden
hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to drop the water down below the jets,'' Keane said,
referring to the outlets through which filtered water is returned
to the pool.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that this allows any water in the lines between the
filter and the pool to drain back into the pool. The lines need to
be drained, Keane said, to prevent them from freezing and breaking
during the winter. In fact, he said, it is usually wise to ``blow
out the lines'' by connecting a hose attached to an air compressor
to the line leading to the pool at the point where it was connected
to the filter. (Homeowners who do not have an air compressor, Keane
said, can use a shop vacuum or even a leaf blower to blow out the
lines. The fittings necessary to attach the vacuum or blower to the
pool line can be improvised using common plastic fittings found in
most home centers.)
</P>
<P>
   Once all water has been removed from the filter and the lines to
the pool, Keane said, the homeowner should plug the jets and
skimmer holes (the holes where water exits the pool on its way to
the filter) so that no water can get back into the lines. (Some
homeowners also put a special pool antifreeze into the skimmers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Most pool manufacturers and supply stores sell winterizing
kits that include the plugs for the jets and skimmers,'' he said,
adding that homeowners should also purchase winterizing chemicals _
basically, chlorine and an algicide _ in appropriate quantities for
their pool size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the jets and skimmers have been plugged, I like to raise
the level of the water to just below the tile line and then add the
winterizing chemicals,'' Keane said. If the water level in the pool
is above the bottom of tiles installed along the top foot or two of
the pool wall, he explained, there is a good chance the tiles will
be damaged if the water in the pool freezes.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to install the pool cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the perfect time to decide whether you should be in the
market for a new cover,'' said Phil Del Negro, general manager of
Specialty Pool Products, a pool maintenance and supply company in
Broad Brook, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Del Negro said there are various styles of pool covers that
range in price from as little as $150 to $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic and least expensive cover, he said, is a plastic
sheet that extends a couple of feet onto the surface of the deck
around the pool. The sheet generally lies on top of the water
(which is why Keane likes to raise the level after plugging the
jets) and is kept in place using water-filled plastic bags to weigh
it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with traditional covers is that they usually end
up at the bottom of the pool by springtime,'' Del Negro said,
explaining that freezing weather can damage the water-filled
plastic anchoring bags and that accumulated leaves, rain or snow
can pull the cover from under the anchors. More important, however,
is the fact that traditional pool covers offer no safety features;
anyone who ventures out onto such a cover will almost certainly end
up underwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why your best bet is a safety cover,'' Del Negro said,
referring to a woven mesh-type cover that is stretched tautly over
the pool and held in place with springs attached to anchors
embedded in the pool deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a safety cover is basically like having a trampoline
over your pool,'' Del Negro said. In addition to their potentially
life-saving advantages, mesh covers allow rain and melting snow to
pass through the cover and into the pool, making it unnecessary to
pump water off the cover when the pool is opened.
</P>
<P>
   Such covers, he said, cost about $800 for a 20 by 40 foot pool
and can be installed by a homeowner with a drill and an afternoon
to spare.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want the ultimate in convenience, nothing beats a
fully automatic solid vinyl cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an automatic cover, you turn a key, hold it for about 45
seconds, and your pool is open or closed,'' said Corinne Zemla,
president of Poolsaver, a cover manufacturer in Walnut, Calif., who
recently opened a distribution center in East Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   With an automatic cover _ which costs about $6,500 installed for
a 20 by 40 foot pool _ the sides of a solid vinyl cover are
attached to tracks that run along the side of the pool. An electric
motor _ usually mounted at the deep end of the pool _ turns a
pulley that draws the cover along the surface of the water from one
end of the pool to the other. Since the cover is supported at its
sides by the track and in the middle by the water, it is considered
a safety cover and will support the weight of at least two adults
and a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a big water bed in your backyard,'' Zemla
said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional information about covers can be found on Poolsaver's
Internet site, www.poolsaver.com, and at Specialty Pool Products'
site, www.wintercover.com. Another useful site is

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Cities are nice, but livin's
easier in a small town
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I was in Boston and New York City this past
week. I do love the big towns.
</P>
<P>
   Just being there seems to make me breathe easier. I think it's
anonymity, knowing that if I happen to stub my toe trying to step
up on a curb and pronounce a bad word, the incident will not be
reported later that day in the coffee shops.
</P>
<P>
   I guess that's one of the good things about life in a small
town. It keeps you on your toes.
</P>
<P>
   This was a personal trip. My wife and I were visiting our middle
daughter Erin, her husband Jessie and our baby grandson Wesley who
live near Boston, in Worcester, where our son-in-law is a
geophysicist.
</P>
<P>
   (Try saying ``geophysicist'' three times fast. You'll sound like
a spitting cat.)
</P>
<P>
   Among his various titles, my favorite is Visiting Scientist at
M.I.T. If I were him, I'd put it on the side of my car.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember when the side of his car said Pizza Delivery.
That was when he was working his way through school toward a Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   He also toiled as a roofer, which hereabouts is often considered
a more productive profession than Ph.D., assuming that doesn't
stand for Post Hole Digger.
</P>
<P>
   Please note, lest the above might indicate otherwise, my
son-in-law is no Yankee boy. He grew up right here in Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to guess, I'd say he is most likely the only Visiting
Scientist at M.I.T. with a portrait of Robert E. Lee hanging in his
den.
</P>
<P>
   Too, if my daughter would allow it, he'd fly the Confederate
battle flag from the front of the house just to shake up the
neighborhood. Geophysicists are that way.
</P>
<P>
   As a compromise, I suggested he display the proud flag of the
Lone Star State of Texas. After all, we won our war.
</P>
<P>
   People in Massachusetts will tell you the same about their
set-to with the Redcoats. The Revolutionary War seems much on their
mind, the Shot Heard 'Round the World still ringing in their ears.
</P>
<P>
   We visited Lexington and Concord, beautiful towns in a wondrous
countryside. Amazing that they have all those woods and no log
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   I made it a point to pay my respects at the graves of Nathaniel
Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Louisa May
Alcott, all buried on Authors Ridge in the Concord cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped by Walden's Pond as well where Thoreau retreated to
nature to write and meditate and live alone in a cabin. Never mind
that his mother brought him a hot lunch every day.
</P>
<P>
   My son-in-law, genius that he is, drove us into New York City
and never missed a turn. We all stayed at the Plaza Hotel, my first
time there.
</P>
<P>
   I'd be embarrassed to tell you what the rooms cost. Suffice it
to say a bottle of Coca-Cola from the mini-bar was $5. And I'm
talking about a little Coke.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, I guess I do breathe easier in my own
hometown where four-bits will buy you the coldest Coke in town, and
that's the big bottle.

   Entertainment and culture stories from The N.Y. Times News
Service for Thursday, Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-FUNDS-BRITAIN (London) _ As London is seeing the greatest
cultural expansion in its history _ a $600 million millennium
effort funded in part by England's National Lottery and in part by
private donations _ a list of many of the largest donors reads like
a who's who of American philanthropists. New galleries and
courtyards, libraries, reading rooms and additions are being
christened with names like Annenberg and Sackler. By Carol Vogel.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICS-NAUGHTY-WORDS (Cambridge, Mass.) _ The publisher of the
Loeb Classical Library, the very proper series of Greek and Roman
literature for English-speaking readers, has been gradually putting
back the naughty bits it had been editing out of the books. By
Julie Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   VIDAL-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Gore Vidal's ``The Golden Age,''
reviewed by Janet Maslin.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-TALK (New York) _ Of the various newfangled epiphanies that
has smote book publishing lately, the most interesting is not the
future of the e-book or print-on-demand or on-line publishing.
Rather, it is that there is a large, and growing, citizenry of
black people who buy books and are greedy for reading material
relevant to them. By Martin Arnold.

&HT;     PRESIDENTS ARE MAMAS' BOYS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Any reporter who covers the White House soon learns
that presidents revere their mothers and rarely praise their
fathers or even speak of them.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be true in the future when so many modern fathers
are involved in hands-on parenting. But the stronger, sometimes
domineering, influence of mothers on sons who wound up in the White
House cannot be denied.
</P>
<P>
   In her new book ``First Mothers,'' veteran Time magazine
correspondent Bonnie Angelo tells the stories of the women who
shaped the lives of presidents, dating back to Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The fathers of these men who rose to the pinnacle of political
power were often distant. They were formidable to their offspring
and too busy making a living for their usually large families to
mold their boys, Angelo explained.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these fathers were losers, and their famous sons _ such
as Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan _ were ashamed of them.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's depicted his father as a failure, both in business and
as a California citrus fruit grower. Reagan's dad was an alcoholic
who left an indelible memory on his son when he came home drunk on
Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But their mothers stepped into the breach. Who can forget
Nixon's anguished cry, ``My mother was a saint,'' as he announced
his resignation from the presidency on Aug.9, 1974?
</P>
<P>
   No one doubted the firm hand of Sara Delano Roosevelt in guiding
_ or interfering in _ her son's life. She was the aristocratic
grand dame who said she had only wanted her son to grow up to be
``straight, honorable, just and kind, an outstanding American.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelo shows that the caring mothers were not just comforting to
their sons, they were also strong disciplinarians and tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Harry S Truman's mother, Martha, taught her son to be a
voracious reader of stories of heroic men and great events. Truman
said that by the time he was 14 years old he had read all the books
in the Independence (Mo.) public library ``and our big old Bible
three times through.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman knew his history and loved it. His historical knowledge
served him well in the presidency when he had to make the daring
decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. He had been in World
War I and understood the value of rebuilding Europe in the
aftermath of World War II to stop the spread of communism.
</P>
<P>
   Truman and his mother were very close and she spent months at a
time in residence at the White House. Her devoted Harry went back
to Independence and stayed in the family home when his mother, then
in her 90s, was dying. When his top aides questioned his long stay
away from Washington, he said his mother had cared for him when he
was growing up and he wanted to do the same for her in her final
days. She died on July 26, 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight D. Eisenhower's mother, Ida, came from the same stalwart
midwestern stock. She had six sons and ``Ike'' was the most
troublesome. Although orphaned and poor, she managed to go to
college and formed a strong personal commitment to education. She
provided the spark that ``inspired her sons to make something of
themselves,'' Angelo said.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoirs, Eisenhower wrote that his mother ``was by far
the strongest influence on our lives.'' When his father died,
Eisenhower was commanding the allied troops in Europe in World War
II and couldn't go home for the funeral. He could only send a
telegram. Ike later said, ``My only regret is that it was always so
difficult to let him know the great depth of my affection for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kennedy family, it has always been assumed that Joe
Kennedy, patriarch of the clan, ruled the roost and pushed his sons
into politics. He did that but Rose Kennedy was ``the one who was
there,'' Angelo wrote. President Kennedy said, ``Mother deserves
more credit than she gets. She read to us. She took us to Plymouth
Rock and Old North Church and other historic places. She gave me my
interest in history.'' Kennedy said his dad ``was not around
much.'' At the same time, Angelo said ``in all fairness, Joe did
his share of imparting the realities of life and politics to his
children.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rose Kennedy's maid told her: ``You've had the best of
everything, haven't you, Mrs. Kennedy?'' Angelo writes that Mrs.
Kennedy looked into the distance and replied softly, ``I've had the
best of everything and the worst of everythingthe agony and the
ecstasy, that's what my life's been like.''
</P>
<P>
   She had lost two sons by assassination and a son and daughter in
plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon B. Johnson used to tell us that his mother, Rebekah
Baines Johson, would shake his toes at dawn to wake him up and
would chide him that the other boys on the block had already been
up for an hour. She was a political liberal and believed that the
strong must take care of the weak. Her philosophy ``was the core of
the Great Society programs,'' Angelo said.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush also put his mother, Dorothy, on a
pedestal. Her philosophy was ``give the other guy credit. Don't
whine and complain. Count your blessings. Honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first day in the Oval Office, Bush invited his mother to
sit next to him in the armchair, usually reserved for visiting
heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter's mother, ``Miss Lillian,'' and President
Clinton's mother, Virginia Kelley, were fun loving and irreverent.
They both lived to see their sons become president.
</P>
<P>
   We know every little boy _ and girl _ can grow up to be
president, but it helps to have a wise mother on his or her side.

 &HT;    PANEL TELLS HOW TO IMPROVE MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHING
 &HT;    570&AMP;add. With GLENN-DATA.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation should spend more than $5 billion a year
to raise the ``unacceptable'' performance of the nation's
``scandalously underpaid'' math and science teachers to world
standards, a national commission reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to act now, before it's too late,'' said former Sen.
John Glenn, the ex-astronaut who chairs the National Commission on
the Teaching of Science and Math in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of the teaching force will turn over in the next 10
years,'' he said. ``That's frightening, but maybe we can look at it
also as an opportunity. If we can galvanize people into better
standards, into expecting more out of teachers, then the (higher)
pay will be looked at as fully deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel of business, education and government officials and
outstanding math and science teachers released its report, ``Before
It's Too Late,'' at the National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Patting the heat shield of Friendship 7, the 2,900-pound
spacecraft that carried him into orbit around the Earth 38 years
ago, Glenn said, ``I am glad that the math and science that went
into that were first-class stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, too few students learn as much about math and science
as is necessary to protect the nation's prestige, good jobs,
military security and competitive position in a global, networked
economy, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   It cited often-used statistics from the mid-1990s that show most
Americans emerge from high school with less knowledge of math and
science than most students their age in other nations, and
suggested widespread use of several remedies that have been tried
only on a limited scale.
</P>
<P>
   More recent statistics showed that many students in middle and
high schools, especially in big cities, study math or science under
teachers who neither majored in nor were certified to teach those
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Cures endorsed in the report included increasing paid,
on-the-job time for training and professional development during
the school year and summer for math and science teachers. It said
they also need more administrative support and better classroom
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   To recruit and prepare new teachers, the commission called for
the creation of 15 new university-based math and science academies
offering one-year $30,000 stipends to 3,000 potential teachers, and
a Web site that would serve as a national portal to research-backed
tips on teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
   It said the federal government should expand programs that
forgive the student loans of math and science teachers who go to
underserved schools. Anticipating the report, the House hurriedly
passed such a measure Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations would cost $5 billion a year, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
   About $4.5 billion of that would be split between the federal
government, which would pay two-thirds, and state and local
governments. That is a far cry from the current ratio, in which the
federal government pays only about seven cents out of every dollar
spent on kindergarten through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   The other $500 million would consist of rewards and incentives
by businesses to teachers and schools whose teachers excel in math
and science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the children's fault that they're deficient when they
come out of high school. It's the system that's broken and must be
fixed,'' said commission member Craig Barrett, president and CEO of
Intel Corp.

   He and Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming, who were among the most
active members during the commission's year-long study, also
emphasized that the report linked rewards for teachers to
assessments of how much their students are learning.
</P>
<P>
   The report said, ``Schools with exemplary professional
development systems, and those that, most importantly, show
improvement on rigorous assessments of student achievement in
mathematics and science, must be recognized with monetary rewards
for their teachers and other staff, and through well-publicized,
showcase events.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of pay raises for teachers was not included in the
estimates. But the commission warned that many math and science
teachers are hired away by private firms that offer higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   The commission plans to mail copies to the estimated 135,000
school board members in the nation's more than 15,000 districts.
``We have lists with almost all of their addresses,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of reaching school board members too busy to read
beyond the three-page ``executive summary'' near the front of the
47-page report, the commission will also mail videotapes created
and donated by the Disney organization.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the report from the commission he created in July
1999, Education Secretary Richard Riley said that approval of
President Clinton's education budget by Congress ``would be a
strong down payment on the kind of investment called for by this
commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, a Democrat, and Geringer, a Republican, later said that
they thought the nonpartisan report provides the presidential
candidates with a framework for intelligent debate on math and
science teaching, rather than ammunition for either side.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ According to former Olympic track coach Mel
Rosen, there is only one good place to run a long sprint from lane
1 _ the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Earthbound athletes have to contend with tight curves and
centrifugal force and staggered starts. It is difficult even to see
all the runners in the seven outer lanes, much less to catch them.
When Angelo Taylor drew lane 1 for Wednesday night's 400-meter
hurdles race, he whistled to himself and wondered whether he had
any chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a spotty night for the Americans. Marion Jones
cruised through the second round of the 200 meters in 22.50 seconds
and qualified efficiently for Friday's long jump final, leaping 22
feet 3 inches on her only attempt. Chris Huffins also led the
decathlon after five events. But Gail Devers stopped during the
100-meter hurdle race, saying she had aggravated a hamstring
injury. And until the very last stride, it appeared that Taylor,
too, would find unfulfillment in the 400 hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   He ran a smooth, patient race, though, making a ferocious charge
over the final three hurdles. At the tape he made a desperate lean
and won the gold medal in 47.50 seconds in a photo finish over Hadi
Souan Somayli of Saudi Arabia, who took second in 47.53 for his
country's first Olympic medal. Somayli had the lead out of the
final turn, but he leaned backward over the 10th hurdle and lost
some slight momentum, which was the difference between gold and
silver.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Taylor finish first in the dreaded lane 1, he set a
personal best. It was the fastest race ever won from the inner
lane. Still, the outcome was so close that Taylor did not realize
he had won. He dropped to his knees to pray, and it was only when
he heard his name declaring him the winner did he learn that he was
an Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be a tough race and I didn't know if
I was going to be able to do it,'' said Taylor, who is 21 and was
just out of high school in suburban Atlanta during the 1996 Summer
Games. ``This let me know I could run from any lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning from lane 1 would not be an obstacle, his friend,
Terrence Trammell, convinced Taylor before the race. They had been
high school teammates in Decatur, Ga., and Trammell had won a
silver medal in the 110-meter hurdles Monday night. ``Shock the
world from lane 1,'' Trammell shouted to Taylor by cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was not unprecedented to win a gold medal in the 400-meter
hurdles from the inside lane. At the 1972 Summer Games in Munich,
Germany, John Akii-Bua of Uganda set a world record in 47.82
seconds. Before Wednesday night's race, Taylor convinced himself
that there would be one huge advantage on the inside. He was the
fastest sprinter among the hurdlers, with a personal best of 44.89
seconds in the open 400. The others would not be able to see him
coming. When he accelerated out of the final curve, they would have
to begin chasing him just as their legs grew heavy with fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told myself to stay relaxed,'' Taylor said. ``Those
guys know I have the best speed. There was more pressure on them
than me.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   At DeKalb High School in suburban Atlanta, Taylor had learned to
run on a cement track. He tried to pattern himself after the
two-time Olympic champion Edwin Moses, who attended Morehouse
University in Atlanta. And when he attended one day of the Atlanta
Olympics, it was to watch Derrick Adkins win the 400-meter hurdles.
They later became training partners.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Taylor ran patiently on the tight curves,
measuring his speed to jump fluidly over each hurdle, taking 13
steps between the first eight hurdles, and 14 between the final two
as he made his charge, seeing Somayli out of the corner of his eye,
chasing him down with a final lean, winning by the thickness of his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always watched the Olympics and thought, ``That could be me
one day,'' Taylor said. ``My day is here.''

</P>
<P>
   If there was a more impressive performance, it came in the
women's 400-meter hurdles. Irina Privalova of Russia established
herself as one of the most versatile Olympians of all time, winning
in a personal best of 53.02 seconds, eight years after winning a
silver medal in the 100 meters at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would get a good result, but I never thought I
would win a gold medal,'' said the 31-year-old Privalova, who
defeated the 1996 champion Deon Hemmings of Jamaica. ``This medal
means more. I was younger and healthier before. This one took a lot
more effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also demonstrated her versatility as she continued her
quest to become the first female track and field athlete to win
five gold medals in one Olympics. Her attempt has been complicated
by the disclosure that her husband, the shot putter C.J. Hunter,
had tested positive for the steroid nandrolone. The track is her
one refuge from the turmoil and the suspicion that now attends her
own performances.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Jones took a sizeable lead then downshifted
across the finish line of the 200 heats. Then she needed only one
attempt in her most uncertain event to qualify for Friday's final
of the long jump. Only Heike Drechsler of Germany, the 1992 Olympic
champion, had a longer jump Wednesday night at 22-5 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, the last couple days have been really
difficult,'' Jones said. ``Right now, I have gold medals to win.''
She added: ``Once I stepped on the track, everything that had
happened the last couple days was in the back of my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' chances of winning five gold medals seemed to grow more
precarious, however, when Devers pulled up in the 100-meter
hurdles. Devers is a two-time Olympic champion in the open 100
meters and was scheduled to run a leg of the 400-meter relay on
Saturday. Her status is now uncertain. Inger Miller has decided to
run the relay, her coach John Smith said, but she will not be fully
recovered from a hamstring injury that kept her out of the 100 and
200 sprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a challenge,'' Smith said of the American
relay. ``The Bahamas has four healthy girls. Jamaica has four
healthy girls. We don't. That's a problem. Four healthy girls will
outrun one.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in her Olympic career, Devers experienced a
bizarre conclusion to the 100 hurdles. At the 1992 Summer Games in
Barcelona, Spain, she led after nine hurdles, only to clip the
final hurdle with her lead foot. She stumbled across the finish
line, but four other hurdlers beat her to the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, she seemed to run smoothly over the first four
hurdles, only to stop before reaching the fifth hurdle. Devers has
suffered from chronic hamstring problems throughout her career,
complicated now by a bout of sciatica. The hamstring began to
tighten on her during the rounds of the hurdles, she said, adding
that she thought during the final she would ``go all out until the
leg fell off.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hamstring began to clench, and would not loosen, and she
could not go on, she said. She dismissed any suggestion that she
felt jinxed in the 100 hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think luck is involved in track,'' Devers said. ``It's
skills. This day, my skills were not enough to get me through this,
mentally or physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Had her leg not restricted her, Devers should have easily won
the race. Olga Shishigina of Kazakstan took the gold in 12.65
seconds. Devers has run eight races faster than that this season,
including 12.61 in the first round of the Olympics. Second place
went to Glory Alozie of Nigeria, who finished the Games in poignant
triumph after beginning it with the death of her fiance, Hyginus
Anugo, a sprinter who was hit and killed here by a bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would go home, but I was encouraged by my coach,''
Alozie said. ``I still feel what happened, but my friends, my coach
and my family helped make me feel happy again.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Devers was not the only favorite to experience frustration
Wednesday night. Wilson Kipketer, the Kenyan who has become a
world-record holder as a Danish citizen, let the 800 meters unfold
too slowly and could not take the lead with his urgent kick at the
finish. Nils Schumann of Germany won in 1:45.08, while Kipketer was
second in 1:45.14, four seconds off his world record. It was the
slowest winning time in the 800 since the 1980 Moscow Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic, the world-record holder in
the decathlon, slumped to seventh after five events. Huffins stood
first with 4,554 points, although he struggles with the javelin and
1,500 meters on the second day. Sergei Bubka, the world-record
holder in the pole vault, continued his Olympic frustration in a
career that has been diminished by injury. He missed all three
attempts at 18-8 1/2 in Wednesday night's qualifying round. After
winning a gold medal in 1988, Bubka has reached the final only once
in the past three Games, failing on that occasion to clear any
height.
</P>
<P>
   Another drug scandal hit track and field Wednesday when Mihaela
Melinte of Romania, the gold-medal favorite in the women's hammer
throw, was told on the track before the qualifying round that she
had tested positive for nandrolone. Victories were also tempered by
the knowledge that Shishigina in the 100 hurdles and Elina Zvereva
of Belarus in the discus had previously served drug suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the suspicion in track and field that Devers was asked
whether she withdrew to avoid having to take a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't infer one thing from the next, and one person to the
next,'' Devers said. ``It's not fair. Me pulling up is an injury.
That wouldn't be a thought that would cross my mind. If people are
going to speculate, they are going to speculate. If that was my
concern, I wouldn't have started this Olympic Games.''

ONLY MEMORIES REMAIN OF FIERCE U.S.-RUSSIA BASKETBALL COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The game was over, and the aging Russian man
quickly made his way through the emptying stands and down to the
floor until he finally reached his old friend at courtside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Doug,'' Aleksandr Gomelsky said in charming, if
halting, English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Coach,'' Doug Collins replied, sounding like someone
whose high school teacher had caught up with him as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice to see you. How've you been?'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, OK. We talk later, yes?'' Gomelsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins and Gomelsky are links to a different era of U.S.-Russia
basketball, when meetings between the two countries meant so much
more than sports. On Thursday night, they will meet in an Olympic
quarterfinal, a game almost anyone can find a ticket to in Sydney
proper. Collins and Gomelsky, employed as television commentators
for their respective countries, agree that the Americans are simply
too skilled and strong for the Russians to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not like the old days,'' Gomelsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Not like 1988, when Gomelsky coached what would be the last
Olympic team from the Soviet Union to a gold medal in Seoul, South
Korea, defusing the press of John Thompson's American college
players, stunning the United States and doing his part to usher in
a new, potent era in international basketball: The U.S. of NBA.
</P>
<P>
   And not like 1972, when Collins, a stringy-haired collegian,
stepped to the foul line in the final seconds while Gomelsky, an
exiled national coach, watched from home. The Soviets won a
disputed 1-point victory over the United States in Munich after the
final three seconds were replayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night at halftime, they showed '72 up on the arena
screen,'' said Collins, the NBC analyst who hit two clutch free
throws for the United States and, along with his teammates, refused
the silver medal as a protest to the controversial ending. ``You're
always going to feel it at Olympic time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time I'll feel it most is when they hand out the medals.
And when the United States gets the gold and they play the national
anthem _ the thought of being up there with your teammates and
having that experience ... you know, something we should have had
was taken away from us. That's what gets me more than anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomelsky, whose visa and job were revoked for losing a
competition to Yugoslavia the previous year, did not attend the
Munich Games. But he watched with pride as the Soviets, employing
his system of screens and movement, finally stayed on the same
court with the great American athletes. He is astounded at how
wronged many Americans still feel over Munich.
</P>
<P>
   ``American people say it is not the right competition because
American boys don't take home a gold medal,'' he said. ``But
history is not always fair. I won the world championship in 1959 in
Chile. But my team got a disqualification because we didn't play
against Formosa. I won every game in Chile, two times United States
and two times Brazil. But history's champion is Brazil. Same in
Munich with the United States. See, history is not always fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, they call Gomelsky the Silver Fox. Whether the
nickname pertains to Gomelsky's personal or professional life is up
for conjecture. He turned 72 this year. Yet Gomelsky's fourth son _
his oldest is 46 _ turns 3 years old in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is 33 now,'' he said. Second wife? ``No, No. 3. Every
20 years, I change women.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomelsky, who lived in San Diego for a time in the 1990s, is now
president of Central Army, the Moscow basketball club that
routinely wins the Russian championship. His brother, Yevgeny,
coaches the Russian women's team. Gomelsky has attended 10
Olympics, beginning as an assistant with the Russian team in
Melbourne in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the '56 team,'' he said. ``Much better than this
team. Bill Russell. K.C. Jones. Great, great players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want my opinion on this United States team?'' Gomelsky
asked, unsolicited. ``In my opinion, the first Dream Team and the
second Dream Team were much better than this team. Because not only
were they great names and great people, but all the players on
Dream Team No. 1 were together _ with Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and
Jordan. Fantastic players. These are good players, but not great.
Regular players. But for this competition, there is not much
interest (for the game) in your team. Because your team is much
better. Your team will win, but not by a big score.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomelsky's old team is spread among several former Soviet states
today; the Eastern European threat to U.S. supremacy faded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he plans to catch up with Gomelsky. They rarely
talk about Munich. ``But when we do, he's always been very kind to
me about stepping up and making the free throws,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is truly a legendary figure in the game,'' he added.
Collins said that Gomelsky was one of the first international
coaches to use American methods ``to teach the Russian players the
fundamentals, the basic skills of the game, and to get the pro
offenses and the college offenses the United States were using.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomelsky had already gone when Collins was finished talking. He
was off looking for another former U.S. Olympic player with a
wealth of basketball knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Brown, he is a very, very good friend,'' Gomelsky said
of the U.S. assistant coach. ``I must talk to him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight years after Munich, 12 years after Seoul, the
Silver Fox is still at work.

ON THIS MTV SHOW, VIEWERS DIRECT FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHEL MARRIOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At first glance, the scene at MTV's Times Square
studio on a recent Monday afternoon was familiar to anyone who has
ever watched even a few minutes of the channel. There were music,
dancers, DJs, guest appearances and, of course, music videos. But
this show, called Direct Effect, may be anything but typical. Its
producers say that it offers a glimpse into the near future of
television for all viewers, even those who can't hold a beat in a
basket.
</P>
<P>
   Direct Effect's primary distinction from regular television fare
is that it offers viewers to not only watch it on cable television,
but to help direct it through computers wired to MTV.com. Well, at
least, they can help select _ interacting in real time _ what music
videos will be featured on the live hourlong hip-hop music show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perfect for our audience,'' said Sara R. Cohen, vice
president of programming for MTV.com. She described MTV's young
core audience as being ``convergent people,'' as comfortable with
their computers and cell phones as they are with their televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Once logged on to MTV.com, viewers can follow a link to Direct
Effect, where they will find three thumbnail pictures and
descriptions of the artists and videos. To vote for the next video
to be played on Direct Effect, viewers click once on a spot under
the description of the video. The vote is sent to the network's
control room in New York, where it is rapidly tabulated with
others. A running tally of the vote is posted on the live
television screen almost up to the last minute before the next
video is shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the presence of this sort of show is really
reassuring,'' said Todd Boyd, a professor at the University of
Southern California's School of Cinema and Television and an expert
on hip-hop culture, ``especially when you hear so much about the
`digital divide' and large numbers of black people and minorities
being left out of the digital revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, when one considers how increasingly comfortable
young people, all kinds of young people, are with cutting edge,
computer-based technologies like computer games and digital music,
``it's not surprising that we have reached a point where the
connection of television and the Internet is so direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without a computer, what viewers see on their television
screens is a blend of old-fashioned television dating back to the
days of American Bandstand and Soul Train and Web-inspired multiple
screens and banner text. In some instances as many as five screens
may compete for the viewer's attention at once.
</P>
<P>
   MTV producers and executives said that they are encouraged by
their own studies of their audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our audience demonstrates that it is very willing to
participate in multi-screen programs here and now,'' said Nicholas
Butterworth, president and chief executive of MTVi, the interactive
arm of MTV Networks.
</P>
<P>
   As high-speed, broadband Internet service is slowly
proliferating the United States, television and Internet executives
are increasingly promising that PC-smart, set-top boxes will one
day soon start transforming television, making much of it
interactive. Brian Graden, president of programming for MTV, said
his viewers were not willing to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our audience is probably not like any other,'' added Brian
Graden, president of programming for MTV. ``About 70 percent of
them have computers and TV in the same room and use them at the
same time. They have come up with a crude two-box solution to
interactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTV Networks/Viacom Study of Media, Entertainment and
Leisure Time found last summer that there has been a significant
swell in the numbers of people owning and using personal computers
in their homes. But the study also showed that television is not
losing its audience to the Internet. Instead, the two media are
co-existing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than making trade-offs between different media options,
Americans are finding ways to incorporate new forms of media into
their lives without sacrificing the things they already love,''
said Betsy Frank, executive vice president for research and
planning at MTV Networks.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, many people are multitasking, reflecting
something she calls ``behavioral convergence,'' which she defines
as ``people acting as if their media platforms have already
converged even though the technology isn't there yet.''

A VIDEOGAME WITH CINEMATIC ASPIRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
 By CHARLES HEROLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It could happen to any developer. You spend years working on a
game, creating an elaborate story, detailed characters and
beautiful snow scenes carefully lighted to reflect the time of day.
Then, just as you think you're finished, you realize that you have
completely forgotten one thing: giving people something they can
actually play. With no time left, you quickly toss in a little
mindless action and release the game.
</P>
<P>
   That is not necessarily what happened with D2, Warp's
action-adventure game, but it feels that way. D2 is a game that is
good at all the extraneous elements of a videogame but bad at the
one central necessity _ that it be entertaining to play.
</P>
<P>
   The game begins with terrorists ranting about an entity called
``Shadow, the Final Destroyer'' as they cause a plane to crash over
Canada. Laura, a passenger, awakes in a cabin she has been carried
to by a fellow passenger, Kimberly, who found her eight days after
the crash. How Laura survived for those eight days is one of the
central mysteries of D2. Even more mysterious is why one of the
terrorists arrives, pulls a gun on the two women and then turns
into a savage plant.
</P>
<P>
   After Laura shoots the plant, the game begins. D2 has an
unusually lengthy introduction, 20 minutes long. Games often have
``cut scenes,'' which interrupt the game with short animations that
move the story forward, but it soon becomes clear that D2 has
enough footage for a full-length feature film. It's an excellent
film _ the cut scenes are as good as you'll find in any game. The
problem is what happens between them.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication of a problem comes when that terrorist
``blossoms,'' which is D2's poetic way of referring to the plant
transformation. Until then, the look of the game is elegant and
crisp, but the monster plant has the look of something out of a
Roger Corman horror film: awkward, ugly and downright silly.
</P>
<P>
   Once Laura heads out into the snowy Canadian wilderness, she
discovers that these plant monsters are everywhere. The game
suggests that they may all be mutated passengers of the crashed
plane, but if so, there must have been several thousand people
aboard because you never run out of monsters.
</P>
<P>
   When attacked, you go into battle mode, which involves shooting
at monsters until they're all dead. As you kill things, their green
blood splatters on the screen. At times you can barely see what
you're shooting at. When everything is dead, you start walking
again.
</P>
<P>
   That will happen over and over again, with little variation.
There are only a handful of different monster types, and there is
not much strategy needed to kill any of them. Most action games
position monsters for maximum effect, giving you a feeling of dread
as you turn a corner because you know you're about to be inundated
by zombies or aliens. But D2's monsters simply show up every time
you have walked a dozen steps or so. All through the game it's the
same thing: Walk, kill, walk, kill, walk, kill.
</P>
<P>
   There is no terror, no surprise. Instead of feeling that you are
trapped in a nightmare world where you are battling for your life,
you feel as though you are being repeatedly asked to take out the
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   You will also need to use your rifle to hunt for food, which can
be used to replenish your health. That is rather tedious, but at
least the bunnies don't look like horror movie rejects. The
adventure component consists simply of going from place to place
and picking up everything you find. D2 is an adventure game without
puzzles, an action game without excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Failing miserably as a game, D2 succeeds remarkably well as a
movie. A boy is forced to practice piano until he goes mad, a
scientist puts his wife's mind into a computer, a mutating woman's
eye falls out, and a butterfly emerges from the socket. The best
thing Warp could do for D2 would be to string the cut scenes
together and release it into theaters.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most notable oddities in D2 is that the character you
lead through the snow to kill plant-people is less interesting than
everyone she meets. Laura doesn't speak a word until the game is
almost over. She generally expresses herself with thoughtful,
empathic looks and a variety of sighs, grunts and screams,
depending on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The real star of D2 is Kimberly, a depressed drug-addicted poet
who saves and befriends Laura and keeps telling her how wonderful
she is. (That is almost a running joke of the game; Laura wins
friendship, love and devotion while evincing absolutely no
personality.)
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly is a fascinating character. In the real world a
garrulous, self-involved poet would be annoying, but within the
game her melancholic musings and sudden bursts of anger are
fascinating. There is something truly remarkable about an action
game in which a woman sits down and explains her poetry. At length.
</P>
<P>
   The imagination that informs the story contributes to the few
successful action moments in the game, when you must battle the
particularly strong ``boss'' monsters.
</P>
<P>
   These monsters are the least plantlike because they have
retained vestiges of their humanity and talk to you while you are
killing them. It is chilling to shoot a plant-man as he's reliving
a conversation with his granddaughter or to fire repeatedly at a
plant-woman as she says, ``I thought we were friends.'' If D2 had
fewer monsters with more personality, its humdrum pedestrian action
would be more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The last section of the game turns the tedious gameplay on full,
as Laura runs a gantlet of monsters before facing the last boss.
There is no secret to killing your final foe _ you just have to
keep shooting and replenishing your health until the enemy dies. If
you haven't stored up enough first-aid kits and killed enough
bunnies to outlast the monster, you'll never make it to the end.
It's the ignominious finish to the game's lackluster play.
</P>
<P>
   After the final lengthy cut scene, the game ends with a list of
statistics involving pollution, starvation, AIDS and other horrors.
The implication is that the story has something to do with the
evils of war and disease, although it is impossible to see how that
was meant to be conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   It is a puzzling finale for a puzzling game. The game's central
mystery is not how Laura survived for eight days, or why people are
turning into plants, but how D2's makers believed that they could
get away with such anemic gameplay. As Laura would so eloquently
put it, ``Hmmmm?''
</P>
<P>
   D2, developed by Warp and published by Sega of America for
Dreamcast; $49.95; for 17 and older.

HAGGLING ON THE WEB,   INTERFACE TO INTERFACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have spent an extended period of time in the company of
children (five minutes should suffice), you will understand the
full scope of the tactical error I made soon after the
foot-powered-scooter craze reached my neighborhood: I bought one
for my family to share.
</P>
<P>
   With a zeal more typical of novices in a convent, two of my
daughters immediately vowed to abandon all other modes of
transportation in favor of a life devoted to a shiny chrome
scooter. I have not had a moment's peace since Ella, 9, drew up an
Official Schedule of Scooter Turns and posted copies in every room
of the house. Although Zoe, 11, agreed in theory to restrictive
conditions that included ``blackout dates'' on holidays,
negotiations threatened to break down last week after an allegation
of an unauthorized glide around a Dead End sign.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, nobody's arm got pinched. Instead they started
haggling for the purchase of a second scooter, offering in return
personal services in the form of ``free baby-sitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Having seen their work (I recently returned home to find the
baby wearing nothing but a single patent-leather party shoe and
applying blue nail polish to a cat), I was leery. However, I had
made last-minute dinner plans but had no baby-sitter. Really, the
cat looked fine after a bath.
</P>
<P>
   So although I have spent enough time with children to suspect
that once the scooter shortage eased so would my daughters'
interest in the vehicles, I did a quick online search and found
prices for the Razor miniscooter hovering in a range from $79.99
(at Kmart's Bluelight.com) to $99.99 (at Thesportsauthority.com).
Could I beat that? I decided to try my own skills of negotiation,
by bartering at a site called Hagglezone.com.
</P>
<P>
   At Hagglezone.com, shoppers can negotiate prices on nearly 1,000
items in 16 categories, from computers to luggage to toys. Each
item has a sticker price _ the scooter was $99 _ that serves as a
starting point for bargaining. The selection includes a hodgepodge
of Scooby Doo dinnerware sets ($17), semi-pro karaoke singing
machines ($329) and dumbbell racks ($149), a jumble that heightens
the feeling of wandering through an open-air bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't haggle with a human; at Hagglezone.com a software
application does all the negotiating, after taking into
consideration such factors as a shopper's bidding history and
pattern of negotiation, the availability of inventory and a
database of previous sales.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other negotiating sites like Nextag.com (where you
bargain simultaneously with multiple merchants) and Mercata.com
(where prices drop as demand for an item increases), Hagglezone.com
puts a human face on the software. Shoppers choose to barter with
one of six fictional hagglers, each of whom has a name like Monte
or Vince or Dot, and a personality description along the lines of
``Sharp as a tack and ready to cut a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The hagglers' moods shift, depending on the credibility of your
offers. If their little thumbnail photos start to show frowns
instead of smiles, they may be on the verge of ending a negotiation
by announcing, ``I've gotta boot you out, Slatalla. Don't wanna,
but gotta.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded corny (Don't wanna, but gotta?), but I wanted the
scooter. If I could get it cheap, then I wouldn't feel so bad
buying an item doomed to sit ignored in the shed.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing how dumb my position seemed, I sought support for my
desire to beat the system. I phoned Susan Porter Benson, an
associate professor of history at the University of Connecticut
whose research explores the habits of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   She said my motivation was the same honorable one that prompted
hagglers for centuries. ``If my grandma were still around, she'd be
right on there, haggling,'' said Benson, the author of ``Counter
Cultures: Saleswomen, Managers, and Customers in American
Department Stores, 1890-1940'' (University of Illinois Press,
1986). ``If you just buy something for a fixed price, you haven't
accomplished anything, but if you haggle, you have been in some
kind of a battle and you have prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   I registered at Hagglezone.com, which took about 30 seconds and
required no personal information except an e-mail address. Then I
clicked on Monte. (``He'll make you laugh, he'll make you cry. He's
Monte, self-proclaimed `Deal Maker of the Century.''')
</P>
<P>
   Monte, meet Michelle. (She's cranky and would rather be buying a
margarita blender for herself.) Here is a partial transcript of our
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Monte: ``What a kick to have you in the HaggleZone for the first
time, Slatalla! 3! 35! Set! Hut! Hut! Go long with an offer of
$94.35!!''
</P>
<P>
   Me: $55.
</P>
<P>
   Monte: ``What's the offer du jour? How 'bout $84.37?''
</P>
<P>
   Me: $58.
</P>
<P>
   After eight bids, with Monte stalled at $69.92 and me at $63,
the software booted me. But I wasn't defeated because
Hagglezone.com does not penalize bidders for failing to make a
deal; I could repeat the negotiation as many times as I wanted,
with any of the six hagglers I chose. When I phoned Charlie
Reynolds, a spokesman for Hagglezone.com's owner, One2OneDynamics
Inc., he told me that reluctant shoppers may end up softening the
software's stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's been nine times and you still haven't bought anything,
it's eager to make you happy,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   After bartering with the other hagglers, I realized the software
tended to drop the price in increments of slightly less than $10
before all stalling somewhere between $69.92 and $70.52.
</P>
<P>
   I changed my strategy by increasing bids by $5 increments to
persuade the hagglers that I was serious. All six eventually agreed
to sell the scooter to me for $65, plus $9.95 for shipping. (
Reynolds said the software sets a bottom line price for each item,
which varies greatly depending on factors like popularity,
availability and previous sale prices.) I couldn't get them to go
any lower. So although I didn't feel as much personal satisfaction
from battling an algorithm as I would a human, I bought the
scooter.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, I think I am better off bargaining against
software than the crafty human negotiators I faced later. Somehow,
I agreed to pay for a new bottle of blue nail polish. (Don't wanna.
Gotta.)

ANOTHER PORTRAIT OF ORSON WELLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
(Eds: Jonathan Mandell reviews theater for Broadway.com and is the
managing editor of GothamGazette.com, a Web site about New York
City politics and policy.) 
 By JONATHAN MANDELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just before Orson Welles died, as the scene is
presented in ``War of the Worlds,'' a new biographical drama that
opens the Next Wave festival on Wednesday in the Harvey Theater at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music, he uttered a last word that could be
taken as the key to his whole personality. The word was ``Thorne,''
the name of a room he often visited at the Art Institute of Chicago
when he was young. ``It was a place of magic for him,'' said Naomi
Iizuka, who wrote the script in collaboration with Anne Bogart, the
artistic director of the SITI Co. which helped create the play and
will perform it at the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Could Welles' last word actually have been ``Thorne''? Could
there be such a startling parallel between the life of this actor,
director and bon vivant and the plot of the film ``Citizen Kane,''
Welles' masterpiece in which the title character, the newspaper
magnate Charles Foster Kane, speaks a similarly evocative name,
``Rosebud,'' just before he dies?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's speculative,'' Iizuka conceded. ``Anne and SITI and I
are speculating about that, in the same fashion that Welles
speculated about Rosebud.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not exactly in the same fashion. When Welles made
``Rosebud'' the last word of Kane, he was probably having sly fun
with William Randolph Hearst, the real-life figure on whom Kane is
often thought to have been based. Hearst did have a Rosebud who was
dear to him. It was not his childhood sled, as in the movie, but
rather his adult mistress, Marion Davies, whom he had given the pet
name Rosebud. More to the point, when ``Citizen Kane'' came out in
1941, Hearst had not actually uttered any last words; he was still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   To the creators of ``War of the Worlds,'' part of a surge of new
works about Welles, fact is not relevant. ``Welles was very
interested in fiction, often including fictions he told about
himself,'' said Bogart, who conceived and directed this latest in a
number of avant-garde biographical dramas dealing with what she
calls ``big people.'' Previous subjects: Andy Warhol, Robert
Wilson, Marshall McLuhan; present or future subjects: Virginia
Woolf, Robert Rauschenberg, Leonard Bernstein. ``The people who
know my work will be surprised at how linear this one is,'' Bogart
said.
</P>
<P>
   As in most of her productions, she said, she started with a
question. This time it was, ``When did news become entertainment?''
</P>
<P>
   She thought the answer was ``The War of the Worlds,'' the 1938
radio play that made the 23-year-old Orson Welles a star. He turned
the H.G. Wells tale about a Martian invasion of Earth into a
simulated news broadcast that was so convincing it panicked
listeners across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I changed the question,'' Bogart recalled. ``It
became, `How do you ever know a person?'''
</P>
<P>
   ```War of the Worlds' is not a documentary,'' she added. ``We
use the poetic language of the stage.'' Many characters are
composites or invented outright. ``It tells his story,'' she said,
``but I can't say it's his life.''
</P>
<P>
   If not his life, it is, in a way, his movie. ``War of the
Worlds,'' which also has been presented at the Humana Theater
Festival in Louisville, Ky., and the Edinburgh Festival in
Scotland, is named for the radio broadcast. It is ``Citizen Kane,''
though, that is the more direct inspiration for ``War of the
Worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play, Welles is given the Kane treatment, the story of
his life and work explored as if it were a mystery. The play
appropriates the film's structure and even some of its scenes and
techniques. (Hence the Thorne speculation.)
</P>
<P>
   Along with all this invention and meditation, there are some
facts in the play, and they too are surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a tragic character,'' said Bogart about Welles. ``He
had a fantastic life, full of traveling and people and love and
great restaurants. I think audiences will be surprised by the
breadth of his work, and just the quantity of it, if not the
quality. At the end of the play, we list the films he was involved
in; there must be 100, and that's not even a complete list.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogart and her company are far from the only artists who have
become taken with the man and his work. Fifteen years after his
death, Orson Welles _ boy genius turned portly outcast, film
pioneer, theatrical innovator _ is experiencing a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com lists 45 different titles about him. (It lists 34
about William Randolph Hearst.) The respected Welles biographer
Simon Callow is soon to come out with his second and last volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``RKO 281,'' a movie shown last November on HBO and now out on
video, tells the story of the making of ``Citizen Kane'' (``RKO
281'' was the way RKO, the studio that financed ``Citizen Kane,''
referred to Welles' project before its release). It is based on the
1997 documentary ``The Battle Over `Citizen Kane,''' which was
nominated for an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   A month later came the theatrical release of Tim Robbins' film
``Cradle Will Rock,'' which tells several true stories from the
1930s, including that of Welles' defiant staging of Marc
Blitzstein's pro-union musical ``The Cradle Will Rock'' over
government objections. (The Jean Cocteau Repertory Co. is currently
staging a revival of Blitzstein's musical at the Bouwerie Lane
Theater.) In an irony that Welles fans note with some bitterness, a
year before his death, Welles wrote his own screenplay about this
episode from his past, with the title ``The Cradle Will Rock,'' but
he could not get the financing to make it into a film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of artistic necrophilia,'' Henry Jaglom, a filmmaker
and one-time Welles collaborator, told The Hollywood Reporter.
``There is all this interest in him and his work, but when he was
alive he was cast aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, William Hurt starred in ``The Big Brass Ring,''
a film about a gubernatorial candidate threatened by a scandalous
past, which was adapted directly from another screenplay that
Welles wrote, in 1982, and could not get produced.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Postal Service has gotten into the act, last year
issuing an ``Orson Welles' `Citizen Kane''' postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with Welles is continuing this year on the
stage. ``Orson's Shadow,'' written by Austin Pendleton and produced
by the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago, tells the story of
Welles' production of Ionesco's ``Rhinoceros'' at the Royal Court
Theater in London. At the urging of the theater critic Kenneth
Tynan, he directed Laurence Olivier and Olivier's new love, Joan
Plowright.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mystery to me why he's in the zeitgeist,'' said Bogart.
``I was disappointed that this person that I spent years
researching is suddenly everywhere. I thought, `This was mine!'''
</P>
<P>
   For Bogart, doing a play about Welles offered her a chance to
translate close-ups, panning and point-of-view techniques to the
stage: ``So much of my work as a director is deeply affected by
cinematic technique. Too much of our theater is stuck in the 19th
century, with box sets and living rooms.'' Still, she said: ``I
will never make a film. I'm interested in being in the same room
with people, breathing common air.''

COMPUTER COLUMN: THIS NET IS JUST FOR GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a lovely September afternoon and I was doing what many
like-minded souls do on weekends in autumn: playing football with
friends. But instead of running around and possibly damaging
valuable body parts, I was sitting in a comfortable chair at my
friend Jenn Sturm's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   I held the video game controller while Jenn typed taunts at our
opponent (who was in Michigan) on a keyboard attached to a Sega
Dreamcast video game console. We were playing Sega's new
``SegaSports NFL 2K1'' football game, the first Dreamcast title
that has built-in connectivity to Sega's brand-new gaming network,
SegaNet.
</P>
<P>
   SegaNet, which opened its servers to gamers all over the country
on Sept. 7, is a combination Internet service provider and
high-speed private network. It was designed and built especially
for people who like to play video games against opponents online,
either from a PC or a Dreamcast console, which has a convenient 56K
modem inside.
</P>
<P>
   People who sign up to use the network pay $21.95 per month and
can also browse the Web from the Dreamcast. Customers also get a
personal sega.net e-mail address, and to sweeten the pot, Sega is
offering a $150 rebate check (which is about the price of the
console these days) and a Dreamcast keyboard to customers who sign
up for 18 months of SegaNet service.
</P>
<P>
   Playing games against other people over the Internet is nothing
new. On the low-tech side, people have been e-mailing chess moves
to opponents for years. More recently, battle games like ``Quake''
and ``StarCraft'' have drawn legions of faithful players into
real-time online competitions to blast bad guys off the screen.
``Ultima Online,'' a Web-based role-playing game cast in a medieval
setting, has drawn players from more than 114 countries. ``Ultima
Online'' players have even gotten married in real life, thus
merging virtual and real community.
</P>
<P>
   And the concept of community is a big part of gaming,
particularly with console games. I always found the old Atari 2600
to be most fun when I could whomp my sister in a game of
``Warlords'' after school. It was much better than playing
``Pac-Man'' by myself at the mall, because there was a human
element there (not to mention sibling rivalry). The
unpredictability and competitiveness of the game environment is a
big part of the appeal for many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gaming has always been, certainly from our perspective, a
societal undertaking,'' said Peter Moore, the president and chief
operating officer of Sega of America Dreamcast. ``It's often been
perceived as this lonely guy in his bedroom playing video games all
night long on his own, but as our research tells us, when
multiplayer games became popular, it became a way of kids getting
together and playing against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed and response to the things happening on screen are vital
for surviving in a video game. And on those days when the Internet
just crawls, playing a game is darn near impossible due to the
agonizingly slow response on the screen to player input.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the problem, Sega.com, the online-entertainment
company founded by Sega Enterprises Ltd. in Japan, created SegaNet
just for the dial-up-modem game-playing environment. SegaNet
engineers created regional hubs and reduced the number of hops (all
the different computers a particular packet of data bounces to on
its way to its destination) for the connection to increase the
network's speed. The network was created to work with 56K modems,
although broadband options will be available later.
</P>
<P>
   I figured if I was going to try SegaNet, I should play with a
professional. Jenn, in addition to being a whiz who regularly
fillets me in the Dreamcast fighting game ``Soul Calibur,'' is also
the director of systems for Flooz.com, an online gift currency
site. We popped in the ``NFL 2K1'' game disk, connected a telephone
cord to the modem jack and attached the Dreamcast keyboard to the
game console. It didn't take us too long to find the option to
connect to the network, since it's right there on the game's main
screen. (People who buy the football game get 50 free hours to try
out SegaNet, and gamers can also sign up at www.sega.net.)
</P>
<P>
   The instructions on the screen walked us through setting up a
user name and a password for SegaNet, as well as a local access
number. We connected to the network at 28.8 kilobits per second. We
soon landed in the lobby, where we could see how many people were
connected to the network at any given time and where they were
from, based on the information from the SegaNet user account. To
strike fear into the hearts of our opponents, we chose the online
name TruckerMan for our first SegaNet experience.
</P>
<P>
   The game includes a chat program so that you can type comments
on the keyboard before and during the game, and we soon found
ourselves in a match with someone from Michigan. The ``NFL 2K1''
game itself is hyper-realistic, with beautifully rendered players
and all the trappings of a televised game, like multiple camera
angles, instant replay and announcers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite our connection at half the potential speed of the modem,
Jenn thought the game's response times were pretty good. There were
also only about 50 or 60 people connected to the network at the
time, which might have had something to do with it. We traded moves
with the person in Michigan smoothly enough to make it seem as if
he were right there in Brooklyn with us.
</P>
<P>
   Jenn went back on the network one weeknight a few days later and
noticed some slow response times in the chat function, as well as
in the game's team selection and setup; it might have been because
three times as many people logged on, compared with our first time.
</P>
<P>
   Sega representatives said voice-chat capabilities were in
development for future games, which is good, because it was rather
hard to type in the chat window on the keyboard while playing. So I
handled the actual gameplay _ and promptly got our quarterback
sacked three plays in a row. (TruckerMan turned out to be one of
those ``all talk and no action'' kind of guys.)
</P>
<P>
   The Sega Dreamcast platform has a lot of competition coming up.
Microsoft has announced plans for a game console called the X-Box,
and Nintendo is working on its new GameCube device. And then
there's Sony's much-anticipated PlayStation2, which is set to
appear in the United States in late October.
</P>
<P>
   With CD, DVD and online capabilities, PlayStation2 looks like it
wants to be an all-purpose entertainment center, so Sega's decision
to concentrate on pure, hard-core gaming over the phone lines sort
of sets it apart. The company plans to steadily release game titles
with the built-in network functions for SegaNet, including a scion
of online game royalty, Quake III Arena, in October.
</P>
<P>
   Gamers are a fussy lot, so whether SegaNet takes off depends on
whether it can keep up with the whims and demands of its target
audience. For a network that has just come to life, it's off to a
pretty good start as a network and a community.
</P>
<P>
   And TruckerMan is really looking forward to ``Quake III Arena''
on the Dreamcast.

 &HT;    Tiny Nigerian fight's through pain of fiance's death, wins
silver medal
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ She will head back to Nigeria with a silver medal and
the body of her fiance'.
</P>
<P>
   No athlete at the Sydney Olympic Games has gone through anything
quite like Glory Alozie. She has experienced crushing loss,
spectacular triumph and, Wednesday night, the embrace of an Olympic
Stadium crowd that knew some of what the tiny athlete has endured
in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Alozie is a hurdler and hers is the ultimate story about getting
over hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   It's about trying to somehow force yourself forward after you've
been too shell-shocked to march in the Opening Ceremonies, or even
leave your room in the Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
   It 's about being so numb in the days before your race, that
your coach _ seeing you'd lost some 13 pounds in two weeks _ had to
all but force his way into your room and feed you with a spoon, so
you'd finally eat. It's being so frightened of being alone at night
that your teammates and close friend, Joan Ekah, must crawl into
bed with you and hold you until your eyes finally close.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the 2000 Olympic Games approached, the
22-year-old Alozie could not have been happier. Even though she now
lived and trained in Valencia, Spain, she was a national heroine in
Nigeria. She was the second-best 100-meter sprinter in the world, a
5-foot-1 sprite who always was on the back heel of popular American
runner Gail Devers.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, her beloved boyfriend, Hyginus Anayo Anugo _ the
guy who loved to give her flowers and gifts and playful kisses, the
Bible-carrying Christian who would pray daily with her _ had
proposed to her. They planned to marry four months after the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Like Alozie, Anugo was trying to make the Nigerian Olympic team.
He had been one of the sprinters in the mix for the Nigerian 4 X
400-meter relay team. But by the end of August, the
financially-strapped Nigerians decided to send just six relay
sprinters, not eight, to Sydney. Anugo didn't make the cut
</P>
<P>
   That's when Alozie stepped in and pleaded with officials to
bring Anugo to the Games. She ran better when he was around.
</P>
<P>
   No Nigerian woman had ever won an Olympic gold medal and Alozie
stood a chance. That's why she had left her isolated town in
Nigeria and moved to Spain three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing near her village,'' said her manager, Julia
Garcia. ``To train on a decent track, she had to ride a bus 18
hours. It was impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   She took silver at the World Championships in Seville last year
and this season had run strongly in Europe. Her last Olympics'
tune-up was to be a race in Japan. Anugo, meanwhile, headed to
Sydney to train with the other sprinters and await Alozie's
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, one of the first nights he was here, Anugo left the
apartment he shared with the Nigerian coaches in a southwest suburb
of Sydney and ran to a nearby convenience store to get food. On his
way back, he ran in front of an idling bus, smiled, waved at the
driver, and...stepped into the path of a speeding car.
</P>
<P>
   Hyginus Anayo Anugo was dead at 22.
</P>
<P>
   When Alozie was told the news, she pulled out of the Japanese
meet and planned to do the same in Sydney. She couldn't fathom
running. Her thinking convoluted by shock and grief, she blamed
herself for Anugo's death. If she hadn't insisted he be at her
side, he would not even have been in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   She came to Sydney only because this was where Anugo's body was.
While she reported to the Athletes Village, she could not bring
herself to train.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the accident happened, I thought there would be no way
Glory would be in shape to run,'' Garcia admitted.
</P>
<P>
   She told how it took Alozie's coach, Rafael Blanquer, five or
six days to finally coax Alozie to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Word spread through the Village and soon other athletes from
other nations were visiting Alozie, encouraging her, looking out
for her as she began to venture from her room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got phone calls and letters and E-mails from people I did
not know,'' Alozie said. ``I began to think God was helping me. He
was showing me the way.''
</P>
<P>
   If she competed, she figured she would be doing what Anugo had
wanted her to do. That is why he'd come here. He'd always loved to
see her run.
</P>
<P>
   So she worked her way through the 100-meter hurdle prelims and
then won her semifinal heat. In the other semifinal, Devers, the
gold medal favorite, pulled up lame and that set the stage for the
final.
</P>
<P>
   When she was announced, Alozie kissed her fingertips and shyly
flung the kiss skyward. With the gun, she got a good start and led
the rest of the field through nine hurdles. But Kazakhstan's Olga
Shishigina caught her at the 10th hurdle and managed to lean into
the tape before her. Shishigina finished at 12.65. Glory was second
at 12.68 and American Melissa Morrison won bronze with a 12.76.
</P>
<P>
   A half dozen strides past the finish, Alozie collapsed to her
knees in prayer. From the crowd, a teammate called to her and held
out the green and white Nigerian flag. Alozie wrapped it around her
shoulders, then stood and watched a replay on the stadium's
overhead screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she has done tonight is spectacular,'' Garcia said. ``She
is so little and she stood so big.'' One by one, most of the other
women in the race came over and hugged her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glory is a very strong lady,'' Morrison said. ``We all wanted
her to know how we felt about what she'd done.''
</P>
<P>
   With some coaxing, Alozie took a slow victory lap. She held the
flag over her head, then draped it back on her shoulders. She ran,
she walked, she stood and then started again. Many in the crowd
stood and applauded. The two other medalists had completed their
circuits and she still had a third of the stadium to go. She was in
no hurry to finish. No hurry to leave the track and face what was
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said she would wait until morning to talk to Alozie about
working out funeral details. The Nigerian officials here haven't
yet said they have funds to handle the arrangements of taking
Anugo's body back home. ``We have many things to decide, but that
will wait,'' Garcia said. ``Right now, this should be a good moment
for Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   On the awards podium, Glory held her silver medal in her hand
for a long time and finally bent down and kissed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I though of Hyginus,'' she said later. ``I thought of
what had happened and how difficult the past weeks have been. I
thought about where I was now. This medal is the most important one
of my life. It is Hyginus' medal.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking briefly with the media, Alozie slipped down a
hallway and was met by Ekha, who cradled the little hurdler's face
in her hands, then kissed her on the cheek. Slowly, the two made
their way into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``God will help me through this,'' Alozie said. ``I don't know
why this happened or what it's all about, but God must have a good
plan for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her voiced trailed off ...
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to. He wouldn't leave me all alone.''

 &HT;    Strong pitching, timely hitting lead U.S. over Cuba
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Behind his back, we laughed at Tommy Lasorda. He's so
brazen sometimes, many times, that his expressions border on the
outrageous. Well, not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Games, the former Los Angeles Dodgers manager all but
assured an American gold medal in baseball, even though TeamUSA had
to get through prohibitive favorite and international powerhouse
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come 10,000 miles to lose,'' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't. In a stunning performance, Wednesday the United
States thrashed two-time defending Olympic champion Cuba 4-0 to
capture the gold medal _ and make Lasorda a prophet.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Ben Sheets of the Milwaukee Brewers' organization shut
down the explosive Cuban bats, giving up just three singles in
going the distance. And the U.S. bats, which at times have been
quiet, brought more noise than anyone expected against the dominant
Cuban pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Neill started things in the first inning with a home run,
and the United States never looked back in earning its first
baseball gold medal. The win avenged a dominant Cuban 6-1 victory
over America last week.
</P>
<P>
   The United States probably stunned itself with Neill's
opposite-field home run to left. Cuba manager Servio Borges clearly
recognized the significance of the game, removing starter Pedro
Luis Lazo after just one inning.
</P>
<P>
   In came Jose Ibar, who had not given up a run in the Games. And
true to form, Ibar was brilliant, not allowing a ball out of the
infield for three innings. Then, even he became hittable.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, Catcher Pat Borders lined a double to the
wall in right-centerfield to drive in Doug Mientkiewicz, who had
walked. It was 2-0, U.S., and chants of ``U.S.A., U.S.A.'' began.
</P>
<P>
   Ibar was replaced by Maels Rodriguez, with runners on first and
third and one out. He walked Brad Wilkerson, struck out Neill, but
allowed a two-run single up the middle to rightfielder Ernie Young,
giving America a commanding 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly imposing advantage because Sheets was on
his game. Cuba never had a runner reach second base, as Sheets had
full command of his arsenal. He was throwing in the low 90s in the
eighth inning, a display of power. But his offspeed stuff kept Cuba
guessing _ and guessing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When Sheets recorded the final out, Team USA mobbed him on the
field, a wild celebration many did not believe would occur _ except
Lasorda.

<P>
   Who makes the greatest demands on computer networks? Napster
fans, real-time gamers, corporate video conferencers?
</P>
<P>
   Ha. They're amateurs compared with your average particle
physicist. Researchers are developing an entirely new kind of
computer network to accommodate the data expected to come from the
next-generation particle accelerator scheduled to go live in 2005
at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN
because of its French acronym. Each year, the CERN accelerator,
near Geneva, will generate a petabyte (1 billion megabytes) of
experimental data, all thirstily awaited by thousands of physicists
in 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientific megaprojects will also be served by the new
system. In time, the new network _ GriPhyN (pronounced
``griffin''), for Grid Physics Network _ may transform the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   GriPhyN will be far from the simple data delivery system
familiar to users of the World Wide Web. It will be the first
large-scale data grid, an intelligent network that will deliver not
just raw data, but also the power to do challenging computations.
To GriPhyN users, thousands of computers and millions of gigabytes
of data will look like one single computing engine of unprecedented
power.
</P>
<P>
   If a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, for
example, requested a particular analysis, GriPhyN would locate not
just the data, but also sufficient computing power for the job. The
data might be pulled from disk drives in a dozen different
countries and sent to computers in a dozen others for processing,
with only the final results reaching Caltech. If more than one copy
of the data resided in the network, GriPhyN would make an
intelligent choice, based on the expense of moving it, in deciding
which copy to call up. If another scientist has already done some
or all of the calculations, the network would know where to find
the work. The whole process will be invisible to users, who will
simply initiate requests and let GriPhyN attend to the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to take advantage of resources that an
individual may not have at any one institution,'' said Dr. Paul
Avery, a high-energy physicist at the University of Florida and the
lead scientist for GriPhyN, ``a whole network of resources that he
can bring to bear on a single problem. That way he can solve much
larger-scale problems than can be solved today.''
</P>
<P>
   The project, led by the Universities of Florida and Chicago, has
just received $11.9 million from the National Science Foundation
for research and development. The network itself will cost another
$70 million to build.
</P>
<P>
   It will link scientists involved in four megascale projects in
astronomy and physics: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and two experiments
at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN to find the origins of mass.
The Sloan sky survey, based in New Mexico, has already begun
mapping 100 million astronomical objects in one-quarter of the sky;
next year, the gravitational-wave observatory, based in Louisiana
and Washington, will start measuring the gravitational waves
(predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 but never directly observed)
produced by violent events in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is no coincidence that CERN was also the birthplace
of the World Wide Web. (Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first Web
software at CERN in 1990 and 1991.) GriPhyN is an invention born of
the same need for better tools for collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're desperate,'' Avery said. ``The experiments at CERN
require so much data movement that they actually need this grid
system. It's not so much a good idea as a necessary one.''
</P>
<P>
   GriPhyN is not a hardware challenge. With Internet bandwidth
doubling every year, scientists do not have to build a physical
network; they can buy the capacity they need from Internet service
providers. It is the software _ the intelligence in the network _
that will be difficult. The central task of keeping track of
petabytes of data is far from trivial. GriPhyN researchers have
decided to adopt a ``virtual data'' model, which means that,
unknown to users, not everything offered in the data ``catalog''
will physically exist. Instead, data sets will be derived from
other data on demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you have a recipe for creating the data, it doesn't
have to actually exist,'' Avery said. ``It might be much cheaper,
if you have a lot of resources, to recalculate a lot of the raw
data on the fly, rather than store it, because it may just be too
big. In other cases, because it may be expensive to calculate, it
may be much cheaper for you to store it in more than one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if multiple copies of data exist, GriPhyN will have
to ensure that they are all kept current. In addition, the network
has to be able to function even if pieces of it crash _ if one
processor or disk drive goes down, the network must not come to a
halt. It must also be secure, able to identify authorized users and
determine what they are allowed to do, and scalable, able to manage
the load as the collection of data grows and new experiments,
scientists and computers are added.
</P>
<P>
   Grid computing is not a new idea. Last June, Globus, a software
project for grid computing that has been in development since 1996,
helped solve a 32-year-old mathematical challenge that was beyond
the power of any single computer. More than 1,000 computers around
the world, many of them desktop workstations, were tapped by the
network, and the problem was solved in a week. Globus' tools will
also be used by GriPhyN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual computers have become powerful enough that they're
interesting resources,'' said Dr. Ian Foster, an associate
professor of computer science at the University of Chicago who is a
member of both the Globus and the GriPhyN teams. ``You can take a
lot of desktop machines and build clusters that have the
capabilities of supercomputers.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea is already being introduced to millions of ordinary
Internet users via projects like SETI(AT)home, which uses the idle
time of thousands of computers to analyze data from radio
telescopes, looking for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence.
Avery predicts that GriPhyN's far greater capabilities will attract
wide interest, at first from other researchers, like biologists
sharing information about gene and protein structures, and then
from corporations that want to do things like extracting customer
information from large databases. To service such companies,
commercial grids might spring up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computing will become more and more of a commodity,'' Avery
said, ``much like electricity is now. If you plug a toaster in, you
don't care where the electricity comes from. In the same way, we're
hoping that in the future you won't care where you get your
computing from or your storage. You basically plug in, and you just
expect some storage to take place or some computing to take place.
It's an economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if that happens, ambitious computations will bump
against limits. ``Computing is always going to be a scarce
resource,'' Avery said. ``It will never be too cheap to meter.''

CHALLENGES FOR THE NEW CURATOR AT THE COOPER-HEWITT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Britain)   By JULIE V. IOVINE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As an Englishman about to move to New York, Paul W.
Thompson has a lot to think about. Where should he and his family
live? Is it too late for his daughters to get into Spence? Oh, and
what's to be done about reinventing the Cooper-Hewitt National
Design Museum?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Thompson was appointed the new director of the
Cooper- Hewitt, a cultural organization housed in a flamboyant
Fifth Avenue mansion at 2 East 91st St. The Cooper-Hewitt is
national design museum and archive, historic collection and
graduate study program. Its exhibitions over the years have ranged
from the hardly spine-tingling 1991 airing of ``The Cooper-Hewitt
Collections: A Design Resource'' to the raucously interactive 1998
exhibition ``Unlimited by Design,'' an unprecedented review of
universal design products.
</P>
<P>
   It is an institution that bears the awkward responsibility of
tending vast, idiosyncratic holdings that include matchbooks,
Soviet porcelain, shopping bags and the Tibor Kalman papers, while
simultaneously trying to accommodate the demands of today's
hyperactive design community longing for a mecca to call its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there's the whole name thing,'' Thompson said in a
telephone interview from London as he pondered what awaits him at
the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum when he starts early next
year. ``It's such a long name, maybe it needs shortening.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be a new leaf _ if not a whole new life _ for the
41-year-old who will be leaving his post as director of the Design
Museum in London, where he made a name for himself by paying off a
nearly $2.2 million debt and keeping Sir Terence Conran, the
museum's expansive founder, somewhat at bay. Chronically short of
money, the Design Museum has relied heavily on importing
exhibitions that originated elsewhere, including ``The Work of
Charles and Ray Eames'' (which was initiated by the Library of
Congress in partnership with the Vitra Design Museum and traveled
to the Cooper-Hewitt) and ``The Life and Work of Buckminster
Fuller'' (which came from Zurich). At the time of the museum's 10th
anniversary last fall, Rowan Moore of The Evening Standard in
London gave the museum three cheers, but then noted that ``it still
doesn't quite fizz.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was the first curator of one of the most popular
permanent installations, called ``Review,'' a continuing display of
the latest work coming out of London's design studios. His most
ambitious recent offering was an exhibition this year on the
Bauhaus that took advantage of materials that had only recently
resurfaced in post-Cold War Germany, including Walter Gropius' own
office desk from Dessau.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing Thompson's eight years at the helm of the Design
Museum, Conran said, ``He's not a visionary but he will bring a
professionalism that frankly the Cooper-Hewitt has lacked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cooper-Hewitt has also had to combine original exhibitions
with more standardized fare. But it strove to be a pacesetter with
increasing success in such shows as the intensely colorful
``Alexander Girard'' retrospective that opened this month and the
recent ``Design Culture Now,'' a triennial presentation of
breakthrough designs in architecture, graphics, fashion, landscape,
new media and theater.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, whose London friends describe him as consummately
British _ dry humor, loud ties and all _ seemed less concerned
about the next really big show than about the museum's identity.
``I need to work on it as a brand,'' he said, hesitating only
briefly before lunging into full-throated marketing lingo. ``It
needs to be contemporized _ what a horrible word,'' he said. ``Not
enough people know about it. I have to concentrate on getting its
brand really established.''
</P>
<P>
   As word of the naming of Thompson spread, the design community
in New York offered their thoughts and ideas, both pragmatic and
wistful, about the future of a museum that had been tended with
missionary zeal by Dianne H. Pilgrim, who retired in January after
being the museum's director for 12 years. Pilgrim happily allowed
her curators to hammer home their themes when more subtle means
would have sufficed.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York needs a museum that perpetually shows contemporary
work,'' said Karim Rashid, the designer who aims for high design at
cheap prices. ``The Cooper-Hewitt is relatively steeped in the
past, when it could be the epicenter of what's new. Let the Met do
the old stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cooper-Hewitt's core collection is more than 100 years old,
started by the three Hewitt sisters, granddaughters of the
industrialist Peter Hewitt. That collection includes 19th-century
textiles, drawings, prints and other collectibles befitting a
Victorian stash. ``It's really two museums in one building,'' said
Constantin Boym, who is known for using recycled and found objects
to make household wares. He added that the new director must face
the challenge of finding a connection between the applied arts of
the 19th century and the problems of design as a cultural
phenomenon now. ``The importance of the institution is growing at
the same rate as design is becoming important in the economy and in
the culture at large,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing more than a few other New Yorkers, Boym said he dreamed
of a Cooper-Hewitt that would be as actively involved as museums
used to be in the 1920s and '30s, not only organizing exhibitions
but also design competitions, housing studies and design awards.
``I want to see shows that aren't just reflections of what's
happening, but catalysts to help things happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the 1899 Cooper-Hewitt building itself, built by
Andrew Carnegie and taken over by the museum in 1976, that comes
under the most frequent fire as an almost impossible venue for
staging exhibitions on modern design. It was a problem easily
appreciated by visitors to the Eames show as they were forced to
make out the couple's radical experimental films projected in
darkly paneled rooms, something like showing newsreels in a black
hole.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few bystanders are suggesting, why not divide the
old from the new and move the more contemporary spirited
exhibitions to a more flexible, dare we say hipper, location.
``It's a really heroic institution in a tough building,'' said
Paola Antonelli, a design curator at the Museum of Modern Art, who
said that early on in the process she turned down the chance to be
considered for the director's job. Bifurcation, she worried, would
impoverish an audience that needs to see design as it has evolved
within its entire context.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who now lives in a turn-of-the-century terrace house
in West London (which he noted was ``like living in Brooklyn'') but
works in a white cube on the south bank of the Thames designed by
Conran Roche, seemed to have few qualms about the Cooper-Hewitt's
present home. He soundly rejected any suggestion that he might be
thinking of a move, or that he might be susceptible to the
expansionitis infecting so many other museum directors. He did,
however, allow that the garden at the Cooper-Hewitt looked very
attractive. The land under it, that is.

COVERAGE OF LEE CASE HAD FLAWS, TIMES SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a half-page note to readers that defended its coverage but
acknowledged some shortcomings, The New York Times Tuesday
published a highly unusual post-mortem of its controversial and
much-criticized reporting on the Wen Ho Lee espionage case.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist at the center
of the Chinese nuclear spying saga, pleaded guilty to one count of
wrongdoing earlier this month and was released by a judge who
apologized for the government's overzealous handling of the case.
Shortly thereafter, President Clinton expressed his regrets and a
White House aide directly criticized the Times's journalism.
</P>
<P>
   It was a front-page March 6, 1999, Times story by James Risen
and Jeff Gerth _ which sounded a loud alarm about Chinese theft of
nuclear secrets and pointedly compared it to the Rosenberg
espionage case at the dawn of the Cold War _ that triggered what
Committee of Concerned Journalists chairman Bill Kovach called
``the media chase of Wen Ho Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of the perception that Lee has been unfairly treated,
the Times, which, like The Boston Globe, is owned by the New York
Times Co., has generated vocal criticism that it had rushed to
judgment. Several days ago, for example, the Web magazine salon.com
published a story called ``How The New York Times helped railroad
Wen Ho Lee.'' And given the paper's traditional reluctance to air
its dirty linen in public, Tuesday's lengthy editors' note _
co-authored by executive editor Joseph Lelyveld and managing editor
Bill Keller _ had the media world buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an extraordinary thing that they did,'' said
Kovach, who sees it as an attempt to ``be more transparent with New
York Times readers about the choices they make.''
</P>
<P>
   The note sent mixed messages to those readers. On one hand, it
stated that ``we remain proud of work that brought into the open a
major national security problem of which officials had been aware
for months, even years. Our review found careful reporting that
included extensive cross-checking and vetting of multiple sources,
despite enormous obstacles of official secrecy and government's
efforts to identify The Times's sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the editors suggested that the coverage had failed
to ``give Dr. Lee the full benefit of the doubt,'' said the paper
``did not pay enough attention to the possibility that there had
been a major intelligence loss in which the Los Alamos scientist
was a minor player, or completely uninvolved,'' and lamented the
failure to create a tone of ``journalistic detachment from our
sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Times editors did not comment Tuesday and the paper's
spokeswoman Catherine Mathis said ``the assessment of our reporting
speaks for itself.'' But observers had differing reactions to that
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a mea culpa . . . The prevailing tone for me
was more of a defense and explanation of what they had done,'' said
David Anable, president of the Washington-based International
Center for Journalists. ``My feeling is they got (the spying story)
pretty much right and the balance between slamming a poor harmless
old man and accurately reporting a potentially large breach of
security is difficult when everybody is trying to keep it from
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly better, more declarative ways to say `we
screwed up,' '' said Steven Brill, the founder of Brill's Content
magazine, which ran a November 1999 story assailing the Times's
coverage of the spying case. The editors' note ``reads like it was
written and edited by 20 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovach said he thinks the explanation will enhance the Times's
credibility with readers, but said it might have been better
presented as an analysis piece ``so that whoever wrote it could be
a little less defensive about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anable said the lesson of the Lee story is the burden placed on
the Times by its own clout. ``What happens is everyone else latches
on to the Times, particularly the politicians,'' he said. ``And the
residue washes back over the Times.''

   YUGO-ELECTIONS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ A vast crowd of at least
200,000 converged on central Belgrade Wednesday for a rally to show
support for opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica. (Summary from
wires.) By Steven Erlanger.

</P>
<P>
   YUGO-SCENE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ In the crumbling streets of
a faded Belgrade, tired and worn from 10 years of international
sanctions and isolation, most people have simply had enough of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. But they are not sure he is
going to go quietly after his apparent defeat in Sunday's elections
here. And they are nervous about a police crackdown. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-NETANYAHU (Jerusalem) _ After deliberating for six
months, Israel's attorney general has found insufficient evidence
to prosecute former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption
charges, clearing the way for a possible political comeback by the
charismatic rightist leader. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-GAS (Jerusalem) _ Traveling with a boatload of aides to
a drilling rig 19 miles off the Gaza coast, Yasser Arafat
celebrated the multibillion-dollar discovery of what industry
officials confirmed Wednesday is a major natural gas deposit in
waters controlled by Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The gas find,
considered more than enough to meet Palestinian needs for a decade
or more, will provide ``a strong foundation for a Palestinian
state,'' Arafat said. By William A. Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   LOCKERBIE-TRIAL (Camp Zeist, Netherlands) _ In an atmosphere so
hostile that the witness's fear could be heard even in the voices
of his translators, the testimony of the most important witness in
the Lockerbie trial was systematically torn to pieces on Wednesday.
Two defense lawyers spent the day decimating every important point
made on Tuesday by Abdul Majid Giaka, a Libyan double-agent who has
been in a federal witness protection program for the last decade.

   VIOLENCE-MEDIA (Washington) _ A top entertainment executive told
the Senate Wednesday that it was a ``judgment lapse'' for his movie
company to try to advertise a film with violent scenes on a
children's television network. The executive, Mel Harris, president
and chief operating officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment,
defended his company in another instance when children aged 9 to 11
were interviewed as part of the test marketing of a violent R-rated
movie. Harris was one of eight executives from the country's
largest movie studios who testified Wednesday before the Senate
commerce committee about the marketing of violent movies to
children. By David E. Rosenbaum.

   INSURE-POOR-KIDS (Undated) _ Three years ago, Congress provided
$4.2 billion to the states to provide health insurance for the
millions of children whose parents were too poor to afford
commercial plans, but who made too much to qualify for Medicaid.
But a majority of the states are in danger of forfeiting their
share of the federal money, because they have not been able to get
their versions of the program, The Children's Health Insurance
Program, up and running. What separates those states that have
managed to enroll children into health insurance programs from
those that did not defies convenient leaps of logic and, in many
cases, the expectations of experts of the program. By Jennifer
Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   FDA-ABORTION-PILL (Undated) _ In a major victory for supporters
of abortion rights, the Food and Drug Administration ended an
18-year standoff Wednesday and announced it had approved the
marketing of an abortion-inducing pill, the first alternative to
surgical abortion approved in the United States. By Gina Kolata and

 &HT;    Gospel divas stay in the spirit
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shirley Caesar doesn't give you time to wonder whether or not
you want to sing the Lord's praises. At the start of the gospel
pioneer's 35th album in her 33-year career, the New Direction Choir
announces:``This is the day that the Lord has made, rejoice!'' A
rhythm guitarist punctuates the statement with an excited strum.
Trumpets blast. And the muscular, husky blare _ that is, Caesar's
voice _ snatches you by the spirit and pulls you in.
</P>
<P>
   Then she puts on her ``breastplate of righteousness'' for the
bluesy call-and-response ``Armor of God,'' rounding it off with a
sung sermon that reaffirms she is an equally gifted pastor. It's a
moment of improvisation that's too rare here.
</P>
<P>
   For a more R&AMP;B-sounding CD that is a little less direct about
its subject, there's Yolanda Adams' ``Mountain High... Valley
Low.'' Smoother and sharper vocally than Caesar, the Grammy winner
glides capably from the big orchestrations of the conventional
``That Name'' to ``Time to Change,'' which opens with turntable
scratches. But she really wins when she combines the two schools of
gospel on ``Open My Heart,'' employing Janet Jackson's producers
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to come up with a song simple and earnest
enough for those of Caesar's generation to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Can Make It''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Caesar. Word/Epic. 10 tracks. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountain High ... Valley Low''

 &HT;    Share in charming eccentricity of `Secret'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Gould (Ian Holm, right) was a colorful eccentric who roamed
the streets in the '40s, dividing his time between flophouses and
an in-circuit of celebrity parties, all the while going on about
his great work. Gould became ``famous'' when he was profiled by
genteel New Yorker essayist Joe Mitchell (Stanley Tucci, who also
directed). The overall impression is a kind of New Yorker sketch of
a movie. Spare, mystifying, yet with a lingering impact.

<P>
   &QR;  ``Final Destination'' (R) _ Sole survivors of a jet explosion,
Devon Sawa and six other high schoolers realize the Grim Reaper,
feeling cheated, is stalking them one by one. Not exactly a
classic, this teen horror flick still boasts some intelligence and
frisky wit.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Black and White'' (R) _ The latest from writer-director
James Toback is a largely improvisational look at interactions
between white and black culture in New York. It's not a very good
or intelligent movie, but it's a topical powderkeg likely to launch
arguments and discussions more complex and sophisticated than the
film itself. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _SM
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' (PG) _
Yabba-dabba-don't. A new, needless, live-action ``Flintstones,''
with Mark Addy as Fred, Stephen Baldwin as Barney and the courtship
of Wilma and Betty as the plot. Inoffensive and mildly amusing in
spots, but hardly worth it. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   _Stephen Whitty, Newhouse News Service
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Where the Heart Is'' (PG-13) _ A corn pone comedy-drama
about a single mom, made with enough polish to be a guilty
pleasure. Natalie Portman plays the pregnant teen who heads for
California and winds up becoming the Wal-Mart Mom in Oklahoma. She
gets good support from Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd and Sally
Field. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _SM
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Cup'' (G) _ If the Jamaicans can field a bobsled team to
the Olympics, why shouldn't some Tibetan monks-in-exile succumb to
soccer fever? That's the premise of this slight, sly charmer set in
Bhutan (a tiny country in the foothills of the Himalayas), directed
by a lama and starring real Buddhist monks. A soccer-mad
14-year-old monk-in-training is determined to see the finals of the
1998 World Cup. It is a refreshingly candid and gently humorous
film. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _ERG
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Waking the Dead'' (R) _ A haunting romance in which an
aspiring politician (Billy Crudup) in the early '80s thinks his
radical beloved (Jennifer Connelly), killed in a car bombing in the
'70s, may be back from the dead. Crudup is superb, and Connelly is
effective in a more limited role. The movie is a little too
earnest, a little slow, but it's more than recommended to those who
love fine acting. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _ERG
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Last September'' (R) _ Set in rural Ireland in 1920,
four years after the Easter Uprising, the movie comes off as a kind
of minor-league ``Heartbreak House'' in which the fates of assorted
characters gathered in and around a once grand manor mirror the
political tensions between the Irish rebels and their English
rulers. Oh, it's well-crafted and elegantly acted, but a mess
nonetheless. Grade: C-

 &HT;    Aussie theme aids Olympic overindulgence
 &HT;    For Olympic respite, try Aussie classic
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeling a little overdosed on the Olympics? Nobody should
stomach a steady diet of competition, interviews with medalists,
cooking demonstrations, Katie Couric with a kangaroo, etc. Time, I
say, to watch a movie. Maybe something from, well, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad Max,'' ``Crocodile Dundee'' and Russell Crowe are some of
the more familiar wonders from Down Under. Here are some worthy
titles you may not have seen:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Man From Snowy River'' (1982): If you were wondering
what all those cowboys in the Sergio Leone dusters were doing at
the Opening Ceremonies, here's one possible source of inspiration.
This full-gallop film is a great family choice. Think David Lean
directing ``My Friend Flicka.'' Handsome Tom Burlinson is the
titular ``Man From ...,'' an Outback nobody who must prove his
worth _ to himself, to a haughty, horse-loving rancher (Kirk
Douglas, who also plays his twin, a guy with a wooden leg) and to
the rancher's spunky daughter. The boy-to-man challenge _ to
capture a wild stallion that's made off with Douglas' prized
racehorse _ is shown as a death-defying round-up, near mythic in
its raw, surging power. Incidentally, the movie is based on
Australia's national poem (of the same name) which was written by
Banjo Paterson, who also wrote the ubiquitous ``Waltzing Matilda.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Gallipoli'' (1981): Before he became famous in America for
such movies as ``Witness'' and ``Dead Poet's Society,'' director
Peter Weir was one of Australia's most successful directors. And
before he became famous as Mad Max, the Road Warrior, Mel Gibson
made movies like this magnificent anti-war picture about two Aussie
sprinters who join ``the greatest game of all'' (i.e., World War I)
and meet their destinies on the blood-soaked beaches of Gallipoli.
The picture blends the boisterousness and bluff naivete of a boys'
adventure book with a twinge of after-the-fact sorrowing cynicism.
Like some Australian John Ford, Weir turns the predictable into
poetry. And while the opening sequence of ``Saving Private Ryan''
may pack more special-effects power, you're not likely to forget
this film's brave, doomed beachfront assault. Gibson, as a harmless
rascal, and Mark Lee, as a sunshine boy sprung full-blown from a
Siegfried Sassoon poem, are both excellent as the two mates who
learn all too well where the paths of glory lead.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Last Wave'' (1977): Weir again, this time in a more
mystical mood. Richard Chamberlain, a.k.a. the once and forever Dr.
Kildare, looks like the whitest white man in the Southern
Hemisphere as a big-city lawyer who becomes involved in ancient
Aboriginal mysteries. While black rain and frogs fall on Sydney
(hmm, wonder if Paul Thomas Anderson watched this before writing
``Magnolia''), Chamberlain tries to sort out his strange dreams
which seem tied to an Aborigine prophecy about the world being
destroyed by a flood. And if you thought the wave at the end of
``The Perfect Storm'' was something, consider this movie's final
image.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Walkabout'' (1971): A sort of back-to-nature warm-up for
such suggestively image-laden films as ``Don't Look Now'' and ``The
Man Who Fell to Earth,'' Nicolas Roeg's first solo effort as a
director takes its power from the primal beauty of the Australian
wilderness and its multitude of inhabitants. Two well-off English
children _ young Lucien John (Roeg's son) and Jenny Agutter,
embodying the essence of an adolescent English Rose _ are suddenly
on their own in the Outback when their father commits suicide.
They're rescued by a young Aborigine (David Gulpilil, who's also in
``The Last Wave'') who imparts a few life lessons as he returns
them to safety. The story is pretty simple, but Roeg, a former
cinematographer, turns authenticity _ the film was shot on
location, a huge deal 30 years ago _ into artistry.

&HT;     MILITARY CHIEFS SAY U.S. READINESS IS IN DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Echoing charges from Republican presidential
nominee George W. Bush that U.S. military readiness is slipping,
the nation's top uniformed officers told Congress Wednesday that
fighting preparedness has eroded to the point that the Pentagon's
strategy of being able to win two wars at once carries a risk of
higher casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that has guided the military since the fall of the
Berlin Wall in 1989 has been to train for a worst-case scenario of
fighting two major wars at the same time. Simultaneous wars against
Iraq and North Korea are the most commonly cited hypothetical
example.
</P>
<P>
   But Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said
that a combination of factors has undermined U.S. military
readiness. He cited declines in defense budgets and overall force
levels over the last decade coupled with aging military equipment
and frequent deployments abroad on peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Shelton said, the U.S. armed forces likely would
prevail if war broke put in two different parts of the world _ but
the wars would last longer and U.S. casualties would be higher than
if readiness were not declining.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does mean is that it would take us longer to respond
to hostilities. In turn, that can mean territory lost and the
potential for a longer fight with increased casualties,'' Shelton
told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assess the risk factors for fighting and winning the first
major theater war as moderate,'' Shelton said. But low readiness
rates for certain military units combined with problems in ferrying
weapons to the second war zone would result in a ``higher risk''
for the second theoretical conflict, he said, referring to higher
casualties and a lengthier conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The other service chiefs from the Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps agreed with Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Vern Clark, chief of naval operations, added that fighting
a second war at the same time ``will be a difficult task.'' Air
Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan said that while the United
States at present could prevail in two wars, ``It's the future I
worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   The readiness of the U.S. military has become a campaign issue,
with Texas Gov. Bush and Dick Cheney, the vice presidential nominee
and a former defense secretary, contending that the armed forces
are in disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney have accused the Clinton administration of
eroding military readiness by sending the armed forces abroad too
often on peacekeeping missions, by cutting defense spending and by
not replacing older weaponry. As a result, the GOP ticket argues on
the stump, the military has low moral, insufficient training and
outdated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, Bush said that the armed forces have been
``undermined by back-to-back deployments, poor pay, shortages of
spare parts and equipment, and rapidly declining readiness.'' Bush
has referred to the U.S. armed forces as ``a military in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration and Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic
opponent, have conceded the military needs improvements,
particularly in pay and benefits, but that readiness is not
faltering. In fact, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart says the
Army, Marines and Air Force are more ready for battle today than in
1993, when Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the committee,
countered Bush's charges Wednesday, saying that military readiness
had not slipped since 1993 when President Clinton took office.
Levin said, ``the quality of today's force is excellent by any
measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, who was appointed by Clinton, took pains not to endorse
Gov. Bush's readiness views. He said that the ``first to fight''
units _ those troops sent to police Kosovo and Bosnia and the
pilots enforcing no-fly zones over Iraq and Navy aircraft carriers
at sea, for example _ ``are trained and ready.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This readiness capability has repeatedly been demonstrated
during the past year in the Balkans, in Southwest Asia in East
Timor, and in other operations and exercises around the world,''
Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   But readiness is in decline among key support units, he said,
including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance units,
combat support units, airlift aircraft and airborne tankers for
mid-air refueling.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving a specific dollar figure, the military chiefs
said that the services need more money to replace aging equipment
with new weapons that are less costly to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   For example, operations and maintenance costs in the Army ``have
increased by 30 percent over the last three years because it costs
more to maintain aging equipment,'' said Army chief of staff Gen.
Eric Shinseki.
</P>
<P>
   In the Air Force, the average age of planes is 22 years ``and we
are buying about one-third of the aircraft we need'' to replace the
aging force, said Ryan. ``We have never dealt with a force this
old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, meanwhile, needs to buy between 160 and 180 planes
annually to replace existing planes for its aircraft carrier fleet
but has money for only 128 per year, said Clark. The Navy also
needs nine ships annually to sustain its current force level of 318
ships. But is purchasing about three less than required.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goure, a military analyst with the non-partisan Center
for Strategic and International Studies, said the testimony from
the chiefs underscored that the next president will need to commit
additional funds for national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without massive increases in funding, the U.S. military will
decline to a shadow of the force that won the Gulf and Kosovo
wars.'' Goure said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush have pledged more money for the military.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report, the Congressional Budget Office says it will
take an additional $51 billion a year over the next 15 years to
keep the U.S. military at its current strength. The CBO said that
the government should be spending about $340 billion annually to
sustain military levels and keep readiness constant. This year's
budget calls for $289 billion.

GREAT GIFTS FOR BOYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, we gave you four nifty and thrifty birthday present
ideas for girls _ all less than $15. This week: Boys have their
day. We looked for things other than the usual suspects: baseball
caps, racing cars, dinosaurs, trading cards and the like. Here,
four fab ideas.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1. MUSIC MAKES THE WORLD GO 'ROUND
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending almost $20 on a new CD, why not stick with
old favorites? There are dozens of discount CD stores where an old
Aerosmith or Stevie Wonder CD will cost you about $9.99 at most. If
your friends are listening to the A(asterisk)Teens' hot versions of
``Mamma Mia'' and ``Dancing Queen'' (and how can they avoid it?),
give them something to talk about with an original ABBA collection.
Or try the Jackson 5, the original boy band.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   2. OVER AND OUT
</P>
<P>
   Backyard commando-style games wouldn't be complete without the
proper equipment. And, considering that most guys love electronic
gadgets, these walkie-talkies (from the Store of Knowledge) make
the perfect gift. They're great for hours of indoor and outdoor
use, and at $12.99, they're a terrific deal.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   3. DARK KNIGHT
</P>
<P>
   For the older kid who's ``too old'' for action figures but still
loves superheroes, try this Batman pen and key-ring set (Warner
Bros. Studio Store, $7.50). Other favorites such as Superman, Bugs
Bunny and Tweety are available as well. Give your backpack a new
midsemester look with one of these swinging key rings.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   4. OLDIE BUT GOODIE
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the usual suspects can be a good thing. Boys can't
have too many footballs, can they? But instead of the regular
pigskin, try a slight change, like a ``sure-grip'' football and
``turbine tail-fin'' football, both from Zoam (KB Toys, $11.99).
They're great for backyard tossing, and they tear through the air
like rockets _ a big plus with boys. Other classic toys will do the
trick as well: a basketball, a baseball and bat or a soccer ball.

LISTEN UP: CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF LIZ, AND GOSSIP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CHRISTOPHER KELLY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I first fell in love with Liz Smith as a boy growing up in New
York in the 1980s, when I was hopelessly addicted to the NBC
affiliate's daily news program, ``Live at Five.'' An odd mixture of
news, celebrity interviews and goofy banter, ``Live at Five''
employed Liz as its gossip reporter. She'd pop in three or four
times a week, muse in her relaxed Texas drawl about whichever stars
happened to be in the news that day, and then, after two or three
minutes of her shtick, shuffle off _ presumably to some fabulous
party or neon-lit Broadway opening.
</P>
<P>
   As a 10-year-old, I probably should have been terrified by this
odd bird _ a preternaturally leathery old lady dressed in the sort
of unflattering '70s-era pantsuits that even my dotty old
grandmother knew enough to avoid. Instead, I was deeply intrigued.
As Liz yakked on and on about complete and utter nonsense (I seem
to remember Madonna and Sean Penn's marriage being one of her
favorite subjects), all I could think was: When I grow up, I want
this woman's job.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I decided to pursue a (slightly) more legitimate
path as a film critic, but Liz taught me some lessons. After all,
here was a woman who made a lot of money doing exactly what I loved
to do most as a kid _ namely, obsess about popular culture. She
helped me to understand that if you treat your passions seriously,
no matter what they are, people will treat you seriously for them.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is by way of saying that Liz's long-awaited memoir,
``Natural Blonde,'' has landed on my desk _ and it makes me happy
just to look at the cover. Liz beckons in all her blond-coiffed,
pantsuited glory before a bright yellow background. Unsurprisingly,
she's smiling. She's always smiling. Which is another reason I love
Liz. That smile is completely infectious. Perhaps it's her dowdy,
dorky manner, or perhaps it's her Southern-girl-done-good charm
(she was born, in fact, in Fort Worth) _ but whatever the case, she
makes us think that we can be just as fabulous, just as successful,
just as unabashedly frivolous as she is.
</P>
<P>
   What does one say about a book like ``Natural Blonde?'' It reads
like, well, a 445-page Liz Smith column. She drops names with the
fury of God sending down a plague of locusts. She precedes
virtually every one of these names with one of the following
phrases: ``my great friend ...,'' ``the brilliant ...'' or (my
personal favorite) ``that adorable rat fink.'' She writes things so
senseless _ ``Sometimes I say under my breath, `To be or not to be,
but to be in Vanity Fair.' '' _ that they almost sound profound.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite part of the book (and her column) is when she
shamelessly effuses over various celebrities. She likes to imagine
her favorites _ like Elizabeth Taylor or Madonna _ as some sort of
cosmic combinations of Laurence Olivier, Gandhi and Lady Godiva. In
Liz's world, the greatest virtues are talent, charitable largess
and physical beauty that's been tempered by sordid scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps my single favorite moment of the book occurs when she
has drinks with Frank Sinatra, not long after having criticized
some of his loutish public behavior in her column. Her
so-purple-it's-bruised prose sums up a lifetime spent blissfully in
thrall of the stars: ``As his chauffeured car drove away, I
realized I had thrown all judgment to the wind. I was Sinatra's
slave. Co-opted by a couple of gin and tonics. I was his for the
rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   I know, it all sounds so lightweight, so empty-headed, so
relentlessly sycophantic _ so why can't I get enough of it?
</P>
<P>
   Because, quite simply, I love celebrity gossip. I'm a junkie.
Sure, there's a pernicious side to turning private lives public and
shaping human tragedy and trauma into easily digestible pop
entertainment. But I prefer to look on the brighter side, which is
that gossip also helps to fuel our most outlandish _ and, in this
celebrity-soaked age, sometimes necessary _ pipe dreams: that we
can mingle with the rich and famous; that we're on a first-name
basis with Julia and Tom and Mel; that we can perhaps even BE one
of the rich and famous; above all, that we can pursue our quixotic
dreams and someone might even be foolish enough to reward us for
them.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of ``Natural Blonde,'' Liz rhetorically asks what she
wanted from her life. She writes: ``I wanted to win friends and
influence people. It happened. I wanted a voice. I got one six days
a week and in syndication for almost 30 years. ... I wanted to work
hard and be so absorbed that sleep would fall on me nightly like a
blessing. It does.''
</P>

FINE DINING IN LAS VEGAS? YOU CAN BET ON IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The men and women who love business are beginning to
love men and women who cook.
</P>
<P>
   The businesspeople who built up this gambling oasis were more
concerned with house profits than house wines. But in recent years,
they've found that paying attention to the culinary side of the
house adds up on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 72 restaurants opened in Las Vegas, and many had
marquee names on the menu. One of the first big names to take his
show to Las Vegas was Mark Miller, owner and executive chef of the
Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe and Red Sage in Washington, D.C. Miller
opened his Las Vegas location in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Las Vegas, restaurants get tourist business on the weekend
and convention business during the week,'' Miller says. This
around-the-clock dining generates big cash. It also keeps hotel
guests in the hotel, the better to part the guest from his money at
the gaming tables. More big cash.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when Vegas served the culinary equivalent of the lowest
common denominator. Buffets, hidden in the bowels of casinos behind
mazes of slot machines and keno parlors, were a big draw for their
prices, not their presentation. Shrimp cocktail, the celebration
food of the 1950s, was often as high up on the food chain as
restaurants swam.
</P>
<P>
   But since the early 1980s, eatertainment has become an American
avocation. Chefs have become celebrities, and dropping dish names
at dinner parties has become a parlor game. Now, avid diners can go
to Las Vegas and sample the food of the restaurant world's biggest
names.
</P>
<P>
   Can't make it to Boston to sample Todd English's food at Olives?
Don't have plans to jet into the Big Apple to check out Le Cirque?
Not to worry; you can go to branches of both restaurants in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware, though, that with the huge leap in quality, these
Vegas restaurants come with far higher tabs than the trenchermen
buffets. And if you lose most of your money at the gaming tables,
the buffets at Circus Circus feed 10,000 diners on an average day.
</P>
<P>
   AUREOLE, MANDALAY BAY HOTEL, (702) 632-7401:
</P>
<P>
   Despite its ``Mission: Impossible''-style 42-foot-tall wine
cellar _ servers are hoisted by a rope to grab one of the 10,000
bottles _ Charlie Palmer's restaurant doesn't disappoint in the
substance department.
</P>
<P>
   A slick hardscape of wood, water and metal results in a room
that is far more welcoming than it would seem. Some of that warmth
can be credited to a professional, egalitarian waiter who ushered a
lone woman to a banquet instead of the dining equivalent of Elba.
</P>
<P>
   The food is just as thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Aureole's fixed-price menu ($55) is three courses with as many
as 10 options each. The spiced lobster chowder, dolled up with
ambrosial mascarpone dumplings, made an impression that lasted for
days _ through many other solid meals. Spiced tuna tartare was the
only misstep _ the minced tuna was sided with sesame flatbread in
the shape of chopsticks. (Perhaps I was expected to eat the fish
Chinese-style?)
</P>
<P>
   But no matter. A superb blueberry Meyer lemon cheesecake was the
perfect meal ender _ a touch of citrus that left things on a light
note despite an hourlong meal.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two will run about $200.
</P>
<P>
   BORDER GRILL, MANDALAY BAY HOTEL, (702) 632-7403:
</P>
<P>
   The Mandalay Bay is a prime example of how Las Vegas hotels are
mixing up their offerings so guests won't get bored and stray. The
Food Network's Two Hot Tamales, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan
Feniger, offer up food that is fun and festive without being
stuffy.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's cantina opens at 11:30 a.m., offering lamb
tacos ($7), guacamole and chips ($7.50) and poblano quesadilla
($8.50). Remember, we said this food would cost you.
</P>
<P>
   COYOTE CAFE, MGM GRAND HOTEL, (702) 891-7349:
</P>
<P>
   Coyote Cafe is one of the old dogs on the Vegas scene, but don't
let that stop you from checking it out. Just down the way from the
wildly popular Emeril's New Orleans Fish House in the MGM, this
restaurant seems comfortable in its skin.
</P>
<P>
   This was the only restaurant where I had a waiter who was
middle-aged, a comforting sign. I approved when he tried to talk a
customer out of ordering a frozen margarita, saying the ice covered
the flavors. And I loved it when he brought my chile grilled ahi
tuna just as requested _ seared outside and cool in the middle. And
it didn't hurt that the fish was sided with tempura-fried fennel
and wonderful blue potato hash. Heaven. Age definitely has its
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   NOBU, HARD ROCK HOTEL, (702) 693-5090:
</P>
<P>
   Nobu rocks _ and not just in its location.
</P>
<P>
   This Japanese restaurant, co-funded by Robert De Niro, offers a
rollicking good time to well-heeled diners throwing back sake and
tucking into artful plates of sashimi. Howard Stern may be this
restaurant's biggest fan, but the clientele would not appear to be
his audience _ all were using their napkins and sitting upright in
their chairs.
</P>
<P>
   For a blowout meat, a multicourse meal at the chef's discretion
is $70 a person and up. A dinner entree runs around $25 per person.
</P>
<P>
   But half the fun with sushi and sashimi is the point-and-pick
element. The yellowtail ($7 for two pieces) was excellent, as was
the toro (tuna belly) at $10 each. I told you this food would cost
you.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two, depending on the gluttony factor, is around
$150.
</P>
<P>
   PICASSO, BELLAGIO HOTEL, (702) 693-7223:
</P>
<P>
   Picasso is one of the restaurants in Steve Wynn's Bellagio, a
complex built as a tribute to his art collection. Wynn's ego isn't
the only thing on display _ the folks in the restaurant are mighty
proud of themselves, too.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because it was named Best Restaurant of the Year in
``Esquire'' magazine, it's the most difficult room in town in which
to get a table. I made a reservation in June for an August meal. Is
it worth the price ($325 for two) and the advance planning? I don't
think so.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are lovely, with subtle touches of the painter's
southern France tucked into inconspicuous places. Beyond the
curtained window are energetic spouting fountains, in sort of a
Versailles _ or is it Kansas City? _ homage.
</P>
<P>
   Diners can go two ways with the menu _ an $85 five-course
``degustation'' menu or a $75 four-course dinner. To simplify the
wine process, a sommelier's wine pairing for each course is $48 for
the degustation, $38 for the prix fixe.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Julian Serrano is a former Alain Ducasse (he of the six
Michelin stars) protege, and the influence shows. The food is
beautifully presented _ a perfectly folded white napkin nestled
shells holding oysters in a Vermouth sauce. Andalusian gazpacho was
tarted up with lovely bits of Peekytoe crab.
</P>
<P>
   But as the meal progressed, dishes lost their focus. Medallions
of fallow deer were well-done _ but there were so many bits and
bites of vegetables that the meal became confusing. And irritating.
The waiter appeared to be a transplanted New Yorker. Overhearing a
comment about a $25 margarita, he seemed to assume that our table
might not be good for the bill. The rest of the meal featured
sarcastic responses and perfunctory service.
</P>
<P>
   TAQUERIA CANONITA, THE VENETIAN HOTEL, (702) 414-3773:
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Pyles' newest concept is Star Canyon lite _ smaller,
slightly less-expensive variations of the food he serves at his Oak
Lawn restaurant in Dallas. Difference is, here the food is served
next to the canal _ yes, that's right _ complete with gondolas,
that runs through the second floor _ yes, again _ of the Venetian
Hotel. (The Vegas edition of Star Canyon is on the first floor of
the same hotel.)
</P>
<P>
   Small plates are in the $6 range and are, indeed, small portions
of gorditas, tamales, tacos and the like. For more filling fare,
order chicken tampiqueno ($11) or grilled shrimp with toasted
cumin-lime crema. This food and experience don't touch the
experience of eating at Star Canyon, but for a quick bite, it's
fine. And comforting. It's good to know that Southwestern cuisine
has the legs to make inroads into a dining category that doesn't
require valet parking. And look for Taqueria Canonita to pop up all
over. The first Metroplex location has now opened in Plano.

THESE PIES ARE WORTH THE DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you haven't placed your Thanksgiving or Christmas pie order
with Auddrena Smith of Albany, Texas, you're just about too late.
</P>
<P>
   The banana cream pies, the coconut creams; all those pies with
the mountainous meringue toppings will be going to the early birds
_ the folks who live in the West Texas town near Abilene, or read
about Smith's pies in the local press.
</P>
<P>
   The Abilene newspaper recently ran a story about Smith's pies.
It came out on her 77th birthday; she got calls of congratulations,
but she also got a lot of holiday pie orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this thing has gone this far,'' she said,
laughing. ``My pies aren't really a business. It's just something
to do. I'm retired, and a lot of times there isn't much to watch on
television, and I get tired of reading. So I make pies.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a business aspect to her pies. The Fort Griffin
General Merchandise restaurant and the Terra Cotta tearoom in
Albany feature her pies.
</P>
<P>
   Smith makes deliveries to both each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny how it started,'' she said. ``I asked to bring some
pies for dessert to a Lioness club meeting. We were meeting at the
Fort Griffin restaurant and I told Ali and Nariman Esfandiary, the
owners, that I would bring my own plates and everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, they came to me and asked me if I would come to the
office,'' she remembered. ``I thought, `Oh, what is this about?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the restaurant owners were looking for someone
to make pies, and once they tasted Smith's, they knew they had
found the right person.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 77 years old and have been cooking all my life,'' she
said. ``But I didn't ever think about selling anything. I wouldn't
be selling them now if it wasn't for that meeting. I just made them
for church dinners, or when neighbors got sick or were in the
hospital. Whenever the church had an event, I would get the
desserts. I usually take a pie. I keep the crust dough made up in
my freezer.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that she isn't getting rich making the pies, but that
it does give her something to do, and the money adds up. ``I'm
going to Branson, Missouri, in October,'' she said, ``and I don't
have to pay for the trip out of my living expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith can't divulge her recipes, she said, because the
restaurant owners are afraid that if everyone knows how to make the
pies, they'll stop coming to Albany to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Smith doubts that will happen, though. Making pies her way takes
a lot of time and care. The recipes were her mother's, and she has
never seen them in a cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I make my pie filling, I use a water bath, or
bain-marie,'' she said. ``When I make the cream filling, I put in
my sugar and cornstarch, then mix a little bit of milk with that to
form a base. Then I add egg yolks, and finish by adding the rest of
the milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I cook the filling in a pan over hot water. I put my
butter in it, then flavoring. If I'm making a fruit pie, I put in a
little more cornstarch so it will plate out, and I drain the fruit
really well, or it will be a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's most-requested pies are cherry, lemon meringue, lemon
chess, chocolate cream and coconut cream.
</P>
<P>
   For the crust, Smith said, she uses only Gold Medal flour and
Crisco shortening. The basic proportions for a batch of Smith's pie
crusts include 4 cups of flour, 2 cups of Crisco, a teaspoon of
salt and 1 cup of ``real cold'' sweet milk. It's enough for about
six pies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just work all that into a dough, cover it and refrigerate
overnight,'' she said. ``If you have to, you can make it early in
the morning and use it later that afternoon, but it won't be as
good as if you left it overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith rolls out the dough, places it in pie pans and stacks them
in the freezer. When it's time to use them, she lines them with wax
paper and weights them with dried beans or rice. They are baked in
a 400-degree oven for about 20 minutes, the weights and wax paper
are removed and the crusts are returned to the oven, under a
watchful eye, for an additional 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The meringue, something of a Smith signature, is made with six
egg whites. She beats the eggs until they are stiff, then adds a
mixture of sugar, cornstarch and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always mix your cornstarch with cold water,'' she said. ``Then
add the sugar and heat until the sugar is dissolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith works the hot liquid into the beaten egg whites, then
flavors the meringue mixture with a little vanilla, pineapple or
banana extract _ depending on which kind of pie she's making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to do more than give it just a little taste,''
she said of the extracts. ``I want just enough to flavor the egg
whites. It doesn't take much. I don't measure that. I just know
about what kind of little hole it's going to make and when that
little hole is filled, that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith warns emphatically, though, not to use lemon extract, and
``don't ever try lemon juice.''
</P>
<P>
   Both will quickly flatten the egg whites, she said.
</P>

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush takes a lead on character, personality
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush led Al Gore 48-42 percent among likely voters
based on a recent advance in strength on character and personal
traits, despite Gore's higher marks on every issue except the
military, according to a Los Angeles Times poll (4 percentage point
margin error) out today. Bush's advantage was based largely on his
appeal among men and married women. And in the key state of
Michigan, Gore is hanging onto a slim 45-41 percent lead in a
CBS-New York Times poll (3 percentage point error margin) because
of heavy backing by union voters. Gore is also seen as running a
more positive campaign than Bush in the state with 18 electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH VISITS SCHOOL IN SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting attempts to portray him as a champion of the wealthy,
George W. Bush visited a Catholic elementary school in
South-Central Los Angeles that he termed a ``beacon of hope'' today
to call for safer classrooms and increased spending on character
lessons. ``The classrooms need to be safe havens,'' Bush said. He
proposed a law to shield teachers from being sued for enforcing
disciplinary rules. And he pledged to triple federal ``character
education'' funds that flow to schools. ``It's one thing to learn
to read and write, but we also want you to learn the difference
between right and wrong,'' he said. The previous night, Bush
mingled with well-heeled donors at estates in northern and southern
California but said he would be a more aggressive advocate for all
Americans than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   GORE DRAWS CONTRASTS ON RX PROPOSAL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore questioned George W. Bush's commitment to Medicare today
and declared ``it is time'' to help 13 million senior citizens get
prescription drugs. ``I've met too many seniors who have to choose
between filling their prescriptions and filling up their shopping
cart,'' Gore said in Altoona, Iowa. Gore gave 200 senior citizens a
brief pitch for his $253 billion proposal to add a prescription
benefit to the Medicare program, and he also drew a contrast with
Bush's more modest proposal. Gore argued that his opponent's plan
would leave seniors at the mercy of insurance companies and HMOs.
Taking the argument a step further, Gore argued that Bush and other
Republicans have a history of opposing Medicare. ``They never have
really liked Medicare,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   HELP PROMISED WITHOUT GOING TO CANADA
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman met today with senior citizens so strapped by the
cost of prescription drugs that they boarded buses for Canada to
buy their medication. He called the situation ``an embarrassment''
and said Al Gore's Medicare plan would help. George McKinney, 70,
told Lieberman that he takes high blood pressure and prostate
medicine and his wife needs heart medicine. Together, they pay $500
a month in the United States for their drugs, but saved 63 percent
in Canada. ``I feel a little ashamed sometimes,'' McKinney said.
``We're the richest country in the world. Why do we have to go all
the way to Canada?'' Lieberman assured McKinney and five other
seniors participating in a forum at the Wilson Park Senior Center
in Milwaukee that, if he and Gore are elected, help is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY CLINTON POLLS 50 PERCENT FOR FIRST TIME
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton has reached the 50 percent support level for the
first time in her Senate race against Rick Lazio, according to a
major statewide independent poll released today. Among the likely
voters questioned, Lazio trailed with 43 percent, according to the
poll issued by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. A Sept.
12 Quinnipiac poll had the first lady leading the congressman from
Long Island by 49-44 percent. The poll has a 3 percentage point
margin of error. ``We know this race is going to be close, but it's
nice to hit the big five-oh,'' said Clinton spokesman Howard
Wolfson. Lazio's campaign played down the new results. ``Polls have
been all over the place, so we don't pay much attention to them,''
said Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH TO PRESENT ENERGY POLICY
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush plans to outline his own energy policy Friday
while brushing aside Democratic attacks that his long ties to the
oil industry give him little credibility on energy matters. Bush
will unveil a series of steps to boost the domestic supply of
energy and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, says Lawrence
Lindsey, his senior economic adviser. Lindsey said Bush will blame
the administration for creating a squeeze in the oil markets
through ``eight years of neglect'' that have led to a decline in
domestic oil exploration and regulatory delays in building
refineries, electric generating plants and natural gas pipelines.
Bush also will argue that he and Dick Cheney are more knowledgeable
about energy issues than Al Gore, an ardent environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATE INVITATIONS SENT: NO SURPRISES
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates has formally invited Al
Gore and George W. Bush to participate in the first of three
planned debates, on Tuesday, Oct. 3, at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston. The bipartisan commission announced that
only those two met all of the panel's requirements. The central
requirement is that a candidate must have the support of an average
of 15 percent in five national polls by news organizations. Two of
the excluded candidates, Ralph Nader of the Green Party and Pat
Buchanan of the Reform Party, have repeatedly criticized the
15-percent threshold as virtually unobtainable for a third-party
contender. The commission also invited the two major-party
candidates for vice president, Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman, to a
debate on Oct. 5 in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   A DOUBLE AGENT ON THE INSIDE
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney got a bit of a surprise when he found out whom Joe
Lieberman has tapped as his surrogate Dick Cheney for practice
debates. It's Robert Barnett, the Washington-based lawyer and book
agent who represents Lynne Cheney, who is the wife of Dick. ``He's
Lynne's book agent!''' Dick Cheney said when he got the news. To
which Lynne Cheney joked, ``My former book agent. Until this minute
he was my book agent.'' Mrs. Cheney, who has written a number of
books, has the Secret Service code name ``Author.'' Lieberman also
has written several books, and his agent also is Barnett. How does
Cheney think Barnett will do portraying him? ``I'm sure he does
fine,'' Cheney said. ``He's a smart guy.''
</P>
<P>
   BOLD THEMES IN A LYNNE CHENEY NOVEL
</P>
<P>
   An obscure novel, ``Sisters,'' is an Old West romance replete
with whorehouses, lesbian affairs and attempted rapes. It was
written by Lynne Cheney, the former head of the National Endowment
of the Humanities and a crusader against American educational
decline and multiculturalism. She's also the wife of Dick Cheney.
Her brief biography on the official Bush campaign Web site lists
only two books to her credit: a history of the House of
Representatives she wrote with her husband, and ``Telling the
Truth,'' which argues that political correctness is breaking down
America's morality. But, according to the New York Times, she also
has written two other novels, ``Executive Privilege'' in 1979 and
``The Body Politic,'' which was written with Victor Gold in 1988
and concerns the wife of a dead vice president. ``Sisters'' was
printed in 1981 only in a Signet Canadian paperback.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHENEY WOULD DO IN EMERGENCY
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney said if called upon to take over as president in an
emergency, his first move would be to confirm that the chief
executive really was incapacitated. ``You'd need to go back and get
confirmation,'' Cheney told a high student in Sharon Hill, Pa., who
asked what he would do in the first 24 hours if forced to assume
the presidency. The second thing on Cheney's list was taking the
oath of office. Third, he would let the public know what was
happening. The former defense secretary said his next move would be
to put international security forces on a safety alert. Cheney took
the question this morning before flying to Washington to practice
for his debate next week with Joe Lieberman. Cheney also will speak
at a fund-raiser for Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN DEBATING _ JUST NOT FACE-TO-FACE
</P>
<P>
   One week before he goes toe-to-toe with Dick Cheney in a
televised debate, Joe Lieberman is already arguing with his
Republican rival, just not face-to-face. Lieberman responded today
to one of Cheney's criticisms: that he and Al Gore were
hypocritical for condemning media violence while accepting big
Hollywood contributions. ``Al Gore and I have had the toughest
response to this story. . . . You shouldn't market adult-rated
material to children,'' he said. ``We've said to them, `Stop it.'
`` Lieberman added that self-imposed marketing changes the industry
was announcing today were ``positive steps . . . but it's not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   LEAVE IT TO THE STATES, PART 1
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has always walked a political tightrope over the
issue of public education, and it became evident again at Sequoia
High School in Redwood City, Calif., on the edge of Silicon Valley.
Students, in a school filled with purple iMac computers, quizzed
Bush on how he intends to improve education nationwide. Instead,
the candidate stated all that he is unwilling to do. The first
questioner asked about school vouchers. The next about raising
teachers' salaries. The third about reducing classroom sizes. To
all three, Bush gave the same answer: He has no intention as
president of addressing any of those issues. Those matters are for
the states to address, he said. ``Write your governor,'' he advised
one young woman.
</P>
<P>
   LEAVE IT TO THE STATES, PART 2
</P>
<P>
   For weeks Dick Cheney has promoted the Bush campaign's plan to
take federal money away from failing public schools and give it to
parents to use on educational alternatives, a plan that Democrats
describe as a voucher system that would hurt public schools. But
when Cheney came to Michigan this week _ a swing state where a
ballot initiative calling for a voucher system has become a
political minefield and drawn the opposition of Republican Gov.
John Engler _ he was virtually mum on the subject. He did not
mention it at all at an elementary school in Traverse City, not
even when asked to comment on vouchers by a woman in the audience.
``That's for the state to decide,'' he told the woman.

   BEHIND THE SCENES HELP FROM CHRISTIAN COALITION
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, going out of his way to avoid being pegged as
too conservative by moderate voters, has decided to skip what for
the last two Republican presidential nominees was a must-stop on
the election circuit: the Christian Coalition convention that opens
Friday in Washington. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush would
not attend the Christian Coalition event because it would
``conflict with our debate preparations this weekend.'' Coalition
chairman and founder Pat Robertson said that his group would be far
more active in aiding the Republican presidential ticket than it
was four years ago. In a letter to supporters this month, he wrote,
``Our naysayers are in for a big shock this November!''

<P>
   BUSH SPURRING FBI ON TAPE PROBE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said someone is ``sweating bullets'' as the FBI
closes in on a possible double agent in the presidential campaigns,
and Bush's aides called on investigators to seize computers from Al
Gore as part of its investigation. The FBI is trying to determine
how a debate coach for Gore came to receive a videotape of one of
Bush's debate practice sessions. The coach, ex-New York Rep. Tom
Downey, immediately turned the package over to his lawyer, who gave
it to the FBI. ``Someone working for me did not send the
material,'' Bush insisted.

<P>
   BETTER FOR LABOR, NADER SAYS
</P>
<P>
   Green Party candidate Ralph Nader criticized Democrats for what
he said is their shabby treatment of the labor vote. The longtime
consumer advocate said he was disappointed that United Steelworkers
of America joined the AFL-CIO in backing Al Gore . ``They felt they
had to go with the least of the worst . . . instead of the best,''
Nader said in Pittsburgh. ``But choosing between the bad Democrats
instead of the worse Republicans is a downward slide, election
after election, for the labor vote.'' The result, he said, is that
Democrats take labor votes for granted.
</P>
<P>
   BAN ON ADS FOR CHILDREN PROPOSED
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that advertisers were directing a ``barrage of
materialistic marketing''at children, Hillary Clinton called on the
federal government to ban commercials aimed at preschool children,
and to prohibit advertising inside public elementary schools.
Clinton, before a Jewish audience in Cedarhurst, N.Y., said the
Federal Trade Commission should be authorized to ban advertising
that it determines is intended for children susceptible to
manipulation. She also called for legislation to prohibit the
marketing of materials to children in elementary schools, as in
book covers with ads. ``Too many companies simply see our children
as little cash cows that they can exploit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   `HOOKER' REMARK BRINGS REBUKE
</P>
<P>
   A Missouri Republican Party spokesman is under fire for accusing
the Democrats of parading the female state auditor around ``like a
cheap hooker.'' Democrats demanded the GOP fire Daryl Duwe, who
works for the Republicans under contract and made the remark last
week on his private company Web site. ``State Auditor Claire
McCaskill let the Democrats parade her around like a cheap
hooker,'' it said. Duwe defended the comment, though it was later
changed to read ``cheap politician.'' The remark came after
McCaskill criticized political ads by Republican gubernatorial
candidate Jim Talent. The ads attack the Democrats over the use of
riverboat casino money for education. Duwe said McCaskill should
not have used her state office to speak out for one political
party. McCaskill said the remark left her ``at a loss for words.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE BURNS OUT ON HOT SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   When Ike ``Big Daddy'' Seymour asked, ``Are you man enough?'' Al
Gore had no choice but to dig in. The three-alarm hot sauce at Big
Daddy's Bar-B-Que in Des Moines, Iowa, left Gore _ nose running,
eyes tearing and face flushed _ scrambling for a remedy. While his
Secret Service agents laughed (and refused to try the sauce
themselves), Gore chugged cold tea, then poured salt in his mouth.
Working? ``Not so far,'' he gasped. Then he sucked a hard candy
and, finally, tried milk. ``Milk works,'' he reported. A good
remedy for burning mouth, however, is to chew some bread.
</P>
<P>
   SANTORUM LOOKS STRONG IN PENNSYLVANIA
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' high-priority targeting of Sen. Rick Santorum for
defeat this year in Pennsylvania is proving to be an uphill
struggle so far for his challenger, Rep. Ron Klink. After a
divisive primary fight, Klink has had trouble raising the
television money he needs for the expensive Philadelphia and
eastern state markets. These are Democratic strongholds, yet polls
show two-thirds of the voters don't recognize the name of Klink,
who's from western Pennsylvania. Democrats hope Al Gore's rise in
popularity will energize the Democrats' 500,000-voter edge in state
registration and propel Klink toward an upset.
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN HOUSE RACE NECK AND NECK
</P>
<P>
   When Democrats set their sights on winning control of the House
this year, they expected Debbie Stabenow in Michigan to easily win
re-election. But the Democrat from Lansing decided to run for the
Senate, giving Republicans the chance to regain the 8th District
seat after four years. The vacancy has created one of the most
closely contested House races in the country. Two state senators _
Republican Mike Rogers, an ex-FBI agent, and Democrat Dianne Byrum,
a hardware store owner _ have matched each other stride for stride
in fund-raising and support. Polls show the pair locked in a
statistical dead heat. Neither had a primary opponent, and neither
has been able to gain a significant lead.

ADS ON CELL PHONES (AND YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD ESCAPED) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
 By JEFFREY SELINGO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a Saturday night and all the tables at the hot new
restaurant in town are reserved. But you're in the neighborhood
when suddenly your cell phone chirps, alerting you of a table that
is available at the last minute along with a coupon for a free
drink. A few minutes later, you are being seated.
</P>
<P>
   That could happen with the next ring of your cell phone.
Advertisers are beginning to tap into the country's 101 million
cell phones with text messages to reach customers in a more direct
and timely way. For marketers, a wireless pitch is unlike any other
because it can be aimed at certain people and particular locations.
Technology can now track a user's position to within 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really wants advertising,'' said Daren Tsui, chief
executive of SkyGo Inc., a wireless-advertising company. ``But
consumers see advertising as information if it's focused,
convenient and personalized, and that's what wireless ads can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 29, SkyGo will deliver pitches to 1,000 test
users in Boulder, Colo., on behalf of more than two dozen local and
national businesses, including CompUSA and Goodyear. In exchange
for sharing their personal information and accepting several
messages a day during the four-month trial, the testers will
receive a $100 Ericsson phone free and subsidized wireless service
from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the Boulder test, Tsui said, is to determine what
consumers like and dislike about wireless advertising: How often
and when should messages be delivered? How long should text ads be
on tiny screens? What type of ad generates the most response from
customers?
</P>
<P>
   John Siewierski, a Boulder businessman, said wireless ads were a
``dream realized'' for his specialty outdoor sporting goods store,
GearDirect.com. ``It allows me to focus on certain consumers at a
certain moment,'' he said. He likes the concept so much that he
signed on to the SkyGo trial as both a user and an advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clientele is incredibly wired,'' Siewierski said. ``They
always come into the store with their cell phones.'
</P>
<P>
   He pictured himself zapping a message to potential customers
stuck in traffic on their way to the mountains for the weekend. The
text ad could remind them that his store is right off the highway
in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is so enthusiastic about wireless ads,
particularly those people who have received them unsolicited,
without choosing to have them, which is called ``opting in.'' A few
start-up firms have spammed users in this way, either by purchasing
phone numbers or by randomly sending text messages to phones. In
April, Plugout.com, a company that sells cell-phone accessories,
sent a text ad to some 10,000 AT&AMP;T wireless customers, most of them
in Washington, D.C. _ to say, ``Check out Plugout.com and save 50
percent off cell phone accessories.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those users was Michael C. Malarkey, who heard his Nokia
cell phone chirp while he was in a morning meeting. He checked it
immediately because only a few people have his cell phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I read the message, I realized I was spammed,'' Malarkey
said. He then fired off an e-mail note to Plugout.com and called
AT&AMP;T to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few places for privacy these days,'' said
Malarkey, who has not been hit with an ad since then. ``And now you
can cross the cell phone off that list.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., said he planned to introduce a bill soon
that would expand federal legislation that already protects
consumers from unwanted faxes to include wireless spam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is concerned about consumer privacy should find the
growing practice of unsolicited commercial messages to wireless
phones of concern,'' Holt said. ``The practice is intrusive,
irritating and costly to customers.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the privacy concerns are the technical hurdles that
companies like SkyGo have to overcome. There is room for only about
100 characters on a cell phone screen, and there are more than 200
different cell phone models sold in the United States. And only 5
percent of cell phone users have phones that can show Web pages
with graphics, according to the Strategis Group, a consulting firm
based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ovum, a research company based in Boston, predicts that
by 2005, wireless advertising will be a $16 billion market, up from
just $1.2 billion in 2003. As the number of cell phone users grows
(it is currently increasing by 50,000 people a day), Tsui said, he
expects wireless-advertising firms to lure customers in the future
not only with offers of free phones or free air time, but also with
frequent flyer miles, chances for free trips or even cash as they
try to persuade consumers to view or respond to ads.
</P>
<P>
   AdBroadcast, a service of Advertising.com, based in Baltimore,
already pays users 5 cents to 50 cents every time they view an ad.
While 150,000 people signed up on the company's Web site for the
free cash, the company can communicate with only 27,000 of them
because users have either failed to activate their text messaging
service or have changed their phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of leakage,'' said John Ferber, co-founder of
AdBroadcast. In addition, he said, only a small segment of the
population is willing to view ads to save a few dollars. As a
result, the company's growth in wireless advertising has already
slowed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, wireless advertising is a text-based medium, said Rob
Middleton, national media director for SF Interactive, a San
Francisco marketing company that has purchased wireless ads for
clients. ``It has lots of limitations,'' he said. ``So it's really
not for companies that can't take advantage of the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, several marketing executives said that the potential for
location-based advertising outweighed any limitations on graphics
and text. For instance, retailers could sell their goods based on
the weather in their neighborhood, or professional sports teams
could unload unsold tickets at the last minute to people near the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But for many cell phone users, the advertising is not worth the
annoyance of unwanted rings. ``My privacy is very important,'' said
Laurie Ann Ryan, who received unsolicited advertising from
Plugout.com in April. The ad arrived in the middle of the day, and
she said the chirp had sounded like a low-battery alert. ``I have
become so dependent on my cell phone that I don't want people using
it as an advertising tool,'' Ryan said, ``even if they're giving me
something for it.`

DALLAS NATIVE LIKES RUNNING WITH `GIRLFRIENDS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MIKI TURNER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas native Jill Marie Jones has a great new job in LA for
which she gets to wear fabulous designer outfits, deliver witty
dialogue and nearly freeze to death on a Hollywood sound stage for
14 hours a day. Sound like fun?
</P>
<P>
   It is for this Girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, one of the stars of ``Girlfriends,'' UPN's new Monday
night sitcom about four African-American women (Tracee Ellis-Ross,
Golden Brooks, Persia White and Jones) with different dysfunctions,
opened to mixed reviews last month, with some critics calling the
show the black ``Sex and the City.'' But Jones is too busy having
the time of her life to get caught up in what other people think.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the most amazing feeling ever,'' says Jones, who
plays Toni, a shamelessly materialistic and manipulative real
estate agent in search of a man with the three P's _ Porsche,
portfolio and a closet full of Prada suits. ``To be in LA for only
1 1/2 years and to have my first real acting job on a prime-time
show, it's like an incredible thing. Toni is so much fun to play
because she's so unlike me. She's very `me' oriented, and I'm very
Southern and family-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' journey from Duncanville High School to Hollywood's
Paramount lot has been a surprisingly easy one considering that
there are so few quality parts for women _ particularly
African-American women _ in Tinseltown. She credits her good
fortune to determination and divine will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I wanted to be in entertainment,'' says Jones, a
former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and Dallas Mavericks dancer whose
previous acting credits include the HBO movie ``America's Dream''
and NBC's Saturday morning series ``City Guys.'' ``I've been
modeling for a while, but I really wanted to be a soap opera
actress. I've been watching soaps since I was a little girl, and I
still do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't always been easy, but I'm blessed. Thank God. I have
friends who have been out here for years, and they're like still
knocking on doors. I didn't think it was going to happen this
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jones thinks LA is ``cool,'' she also says she ``would not
be here if it weren't for the business.'' And she books flights
back to Texas every chance she gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for me to be around family,'' says Jones,
who spends most of her time watching her soaps and Blockbuster
movies with her mom when she's in Dallas. ``I miss a lot about
Texas. Dallas represents more than home for me. It's a beautiful
place, and I love it. Hopefully, one day I'll be able to return.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in LA, Jones rarely has time to do anything outside work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what life is like outside of Paramount Studios,''
Jones says. ``We've been working so much. Sometimes we all hang out
together and do dinner or something. When we go dancing together,
something scary happens on the dance floor. It's out-of-body!
</P>
<P>
   ``But nothing has really changed for me. All of this is still
somewhat surreal.''

THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIVES
</HEADLINE>
bc-GIRL-FIGHT (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily Newscc,78p3  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been hundreds of boxing movies. In recent years, as
female prizefighting has become more of a reality, a few quick-hit
films on that particular subject have slipped in and out of the
marketplace with about as much notice as a bleeder who never makes
it past the first round.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes ``Girlfight'' feel like a contender? For one
thing, its writer-director, Karyn Kusama, has been sparring for
seven years, and her experiential knowledge of gyms and the
characters she met there brings bracing life to what, in most other
boxing movies, are rote cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the film's star, first-time actress Michelle
Rodriguez. A young woman of fierce presence and smoldering
intensity, the uninhibited 22-year-old is frighteningly convincing
as a belligerent Brooklyn projects teen who discovers
self-discipline -- and, for the first time, the possibility of both
hope and love -- when she enters the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Although it took many years for Kusama, a longtime assistant to
indie film icon John Sayles, to gather the financing for her
low-budget featuremaking debut, and Rodriguez had to undergo a
grueling, 4 1/2-month training regimen before the project began,
the effort, so far, seems to have been worth it. ``Girlfight'' won
the best directing award and shared the grand jury prize at the
Sundance Film Festival in January and was a popular favorite at the
prestigious Cannes festival in May.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the eve of this highly personal but potential-laden
labor of love's commercial release, its principle girls are girding
for the fight of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always hard to make a movie, but now I'm realizing that
there's a whole other, second process of getting the movie out
there and seen,'' notes Kusama, a 32-year-old New York University
film school graduate who's wanted to direct since she fell in love
with mvies during her St. Louis childhood. ``I hope people will
respond. I have a good sense that it's a somewhat likable film. I
don't want to say it's commercial, but it is an emotionally
accessible film. And people always like a good story, for the most
part.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kusama sounds a bit tentative at this advanced stage of the
game, imagine the creatively volatile combination of instinctual
aesthetics and uncertainty that's gone into ``Girlfight'' from its
very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, what's a suburban woman of Japanese-Midwestern
parentage doing making a story about inner-city Latinos? And then
giving the starring role to a snarly Jersey girl -- after passing
on some 350 other applicants, many of them professional actresses
-- who just got fired from her Toys 'R' Us job?
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was always that one about a woman making a
film about an extremely masculine-identified sport. But it's clear
that Kusama was better prepared for that part of the task than most
men who've aimed cameras at the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised, to be honest, by how many boxing movies I see
that don't have much understanding of boxing,'' Kusama notes. ``I
think what has informed films' interest in the boxing world for so
long was that world outside of the ring, because it was so colorful
and filled with drama. Of course, I wanted to represent that
beautiful, rich culture, but I wanted to have something going on in
the ring that felt as substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something that we forget about boxing is that it is a sport
and it requires strategy and a kind of mental skill and toughness,
not just brawn. I wanted to create a story around a character
learning a craft.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Rodriguez fit in. Beautifully. Despite her complete
lack of boxing knowledge and minimal movie experience (she'd been
an extra in ``Summer of Sam,'' ``For Love of the Game'' and
``Cradle Will Rock''; hated it, too), she came to the cattle-call
audition -- her first -- with what the director calls ``presence
that just stood out.''
</P>
<P>
   The refreshingly upfront Rodriguez describes her appeal more
bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was PMS; PMS and pessimism,'' says the actress, a
onetime military brat who's been brought up, alternately, by a
Dominican mother and Puerto Rican father. ``That's the combination.
I'm such an extremist, sometimes, and could probably be an
extremely crazy broad. Karyn is so, like, together; we're total
opposites. I'm this weirdo who always gets there late while she's
so on-point and knows what she wants. But she saw something in me
that I didn't know was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, getting Rodriguez reliably to ``Girlfight's'' sets
entailed moving her into the home of one of the film's producers
during production. On the other hand, the novice actress displayed
an incredible dedication to physical training for months before
production started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture this: You get up, five days a week, and travel two
hours on trains from Jersey City all the way to Brooklyn,''
Rodriguez explains. ``Once you get there, you change and run for a
half hour, usually about two miles. Then you jump rope for 15 to 20
minutes, which is pretty painstaking. And that's just the warmup.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, you move strategically in the ring for 15 minutes,
throwing punches. Then you go hit the speedbag; getting my timing
precise for that was the hardest thing of all. After that, you
spar, maybe, twice out of the five-day week. You're dodging punches
and getting frustrated because you are not as trained as the person
you're fighting or getting punched in the gut because you are more
trained than the person you're fighting, and he's 20 pounds heavier
and a guy and angry because you whacked him. Then you go to
calisthenics and get 20-pound sandbags thrown on your stomach.
...''
</P>
<P>
   OK. We're exhausted just hearing about it. And remember, there
were a few required acting classes, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a whole mental experience of preparing for this
role, too,'' Rodriguez acknowledges. ``I'm much more rambunctious
than the character in this movie, much more talkative. I took about
a month's worth of training with an acting coach in the Village,
and his focus was to teach me to internalize my emotions. Karyn
really wanted me to get to that internal core, and what I had to do
was just suck it all in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusama, who refers to Rodriguez as ``The Hurricane,'' admits
that she took a big gamble on the untried girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelle's instincts were great, and she just had a great, raw
talent as both an athlete and actor,'' Kusama notes. ``But it was a
big risk to cast such an untested property. Everybody you work with
has that to some degree; I just presumed it would be more volatile
with her. To some degree it was, but you know, she showed up and
was a total pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Although new to the movie and boxing games, Rodriguez was in a
position to judge Kusama's ability in a key area, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Karyn's depiction of Latin families and Latinos was
incredibly well-done,'' the actress says. ``I think that had to do
with hanging around the gym for seven years, getting to know the
coaches and going to the parties at their homes. There's a very
big, intense, crazy love of life within Latin minority groups, and
acceptance of situations that you're in. That's a beautiful thing
that I think she was able to capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusama, though always reluctant to acknowledge getting anything
right, traces whatever works in the movie to her love of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just really responded to the routine, the repetitiveness and
the aggressiveness of boxing,'' notes the director, who was turned
on to fighting by a female co-worker at a New York film exchange.
``Figuring out ways to find what power you have, and then control
it, was exhilarating, and I believe it's a theme in a lot of our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought the sport was great. But more than that, I
loved the workout, and I loved the people, who I felt that, over
time, accepted me. The gym was a place unlike any other for me, in
terms of how lively it was and how mixed it was, with so much
interaction between all different kinds of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what a lot of storytelling is is trying to find
what you connect to in a foreign world,'' Kusama concludes. ``That
foreign world, to some degree, can be your imagination. I was
definitely concerned, while I was making this film, about creating
an authenticity to the world, the characters, to their struggle; I
can't be sure, obviously, that I succeeded, but I wanted to find
the emotional honesty there. I think that's the big struggle: You
can get the facts and do the research, which is the stuff that's
just my obligation as a storyteller. But then, to find what's real,
that's more the role of the artist.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The United States' senior military commanders told
Congress Wednesday that the armed services needed an increase in
defense spending that would exceed what has been proposed by either
major presidential candidate and would consume a large part of the
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
and the chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps
testified before the House and Senate that aging weapons and
equipment were threatening to erode military readiness and that
only an infusion of dollars would sustain U.S. military might in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chiefs did not formally propose increases, they
offered estimates, when pressed, of what they believed they would
need.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. James L. Jones, commandant of the Marine Corps, said $1.5
billion a year was needed over the next seven years to make a
``modern Marine Corps.'' Gen. Eric K. Shinseki of the Army called
for an increase of $10 billion. The chiefs of the Navy and Air
Force went further, calling for increases of $20 billion to $30
billion a year _ much of it for buying new aircraft, ships and
other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must find the resources necessary to modernize the force,''
Shelton told members of the Senate's Armed Services Committee on
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearings _ in the midst of a presidential race in
which the state of the U.S. military has been hotly disputed _ had
little to do with current Pentagon spending since the budget for
the next fiscal year has already been passed and signed. Instead,
the chiefs outlined what amounted to their argument over how to use
the nation's surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, President Clinton announced at the White House
Wednesday morning that the federal government had a record surplus
of $230 billion for the fiscal year that ends on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office estimated
that it would cost $50 billion a year more than current spending to
sustain the military at roughly the same size it is today. While
Pentagon officials disputed the report's methods, the chiefs on
Wednesday largely endorsed its findings, saying that for years they
had diverted money from new weapons to pay for current operations.
</P>
<P>
   What went unspoken at Wednesday's hearings before the armed
services committees of the Senate and House, where members are
generally more supportive of defense spending, was how that defense
spending would absorb much of the estimated budget surpluses over
the next five years, leaving little else for tax cuts and other
spending programs that politicians on both sides support.

 &HT;    CONGRESS DUBIOUS OF FILM INDUSTRY'S MARKETING PROMISES
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening Scene: Eight movie moguls sit at witness
table facing a committee of skeptical senators, only hours after
revelations that major studios used children as young as 9 to
screen R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   These are Hollywood's top honchos, star-makers and star-breakers
powerful enough to green-light a $50 million movie from their car
phones. But now they're pitching a proposal of their own: the
studios will voluntarily restrict marketing of violent and raunchy
movies to underage audiences.
</P>
<P>
   It's classic East Coast vs. West Coast, political polls vs. box
office. Elections are only weeks away, and some of the senators
have actually read the movie-makers' proposed guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filled with loopholes,'' proclaims the committee chairman,
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   There is stirring in the ornate Capitol Hill hearing room jammed
with lobbyists and journalists and activist moms and PR types and
TV crews and aspiring screenwriters hoping to slip a script to a
Hollywood executive. Conflict in the opening scene has grabbed this
audience.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called Wednesday's hearing of the Senate Commerce
Committee after the studio chiefs snubbed an earlier session to
review a Federal Trade Commission report that the entertainment
industry was targeting underage children with advertising for
R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Wednesday, The New York Times reported that major
studios routinely recruited underage teenagers and children as
young as 9 for audiences test-screening rough cuts of violent films
and trailers for R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Under committee questioning, some studio executives admitted
peddling inappropriate movies to underage audiences in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Harris, president of Sony, parent company of Columbia
Pictures, conceded that it was ``judgment lapse'' to try to
advertise ``The Fifth Element,'' a violent PG-13 science fiction
film starring Bruce Willis, on the children's network Nickelodeon.
The network refused the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said their new guidelines would end such
inappropriate marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he was ``concerned about the language'' in the
proposals. One pledge, for instance, is that ``each company will
review its marketing and advertising practices in order to further
the goal of not inappropriately specifically targeting children in
its advertising of films rated 'R' for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not simply say 'we will not market R-rated movies to
children under 17, period'?'' asked McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Because some R-rated movies _ like ``Saving Private Ryan,'' for
instance _ are appropriate for some teens under 17, replied Stacy
Snider, chairman of Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Such responses displeased some committee members.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, noted that the government
has stepped in to prevent kids from being targeted by tobacco and
alcohol ads. If the entertainment industry doesn't stop on its own,
she warned, ``you're going to see some kind of legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the studio heads warned that such legislation might violate
constitutional guarantees of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition its action on R-rated films, the industry should
stop peddling PG-13 movies to pre-teens during commercials for
cartoons and other children's programs, senators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to review the appropriateness of all
advertising,'' promised Rob Friedman, vice chairman of Paramount's
Motion Picture Group.
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association of America announced 12 new
guidelines for its marketing practices the day before the hearing.
Committee members called the proposals a promising first step, but
pressed for more concrete pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., asked if the studios would promise
flatly to stop advertising R-rated movies on Internet sites
primarily visited by teenagers. Several of the executives refused,
insisting that such decisions must be made on a film-by-film basis.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, some executives declined to forswear airing any
commercials for R-rated movies on TV networks before 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   However, the studios did unanimously promise not to
``knowingly'' allow children under the age of 17 into research
screenings for films rated R for violence unless they are
accompanied by a parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
   But the chairman believes the entertainment industry needs to
work more on the conclusion of this saga.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines represent ``significant progress,'' McCain
concedes. But ``the language is not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   And even beyond cleaning up its marketing practices, he says,
the entertainment industry should consider a ``universal system''
to rate everything from movies to TV shows to video games.

   Castles, condos and courtyards. Million-dollar mansions and
fixer-upper bungalows. They'll all open their doors for your
inspection on the HGTV network beginning next week.
</P>
<P>
   Nine new series focusing on what Burton Jablin, senior vice
president and general manager of HGTV network, calls
``informational escapism'' will premiere, with 23,000 home
improvement and step-by-step instructions offered throughout the
fall TV season.
</P>
<P>
   While home decorating and remodeling shows aren't new, HGTV
spokeswoman Emily Yarborough says this type of program is exploding
in popularity because more people are interested in turning their
homes into their castles. ``Some will watch to learn how to do it
themselves, while others will watch and decide to hire someone to
do the work, and our programs are aimed at both,'' says Yarborough.
</P>
<P>
   For those who love attending Showcase Houses, ``Fantasy Open
House'' (7:30 and 10:30 p.m. Fridays) is a delightful romp through
the homes of the rich and famous from the comfort of your sofa. On
the first episode, host Claire Berger takes you to three
ostentatious homes, including a $9 million penthouse of the
prestigious Wilshire House in the Westwood corridor. Here host
Berger and owner Shelli Goodman show viewers all the vantage points
from the elevator that literally opens right into the living room,
to windows that overlook the nearby marina. Design details Goodman
points out include walls covered in limestone as well as padded
silk with pictures hung on brass rods.
</P>
<P>
   In upcoming episodes of ``Fantasy Open House'' viewers will
snoop through several local estates in Santa Monica, Hollywood and
Montecito, as well as palatial estates across the country.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose idea of a castle to call one's own is a modest
apartment in need of new flooring, ``Weekend Warriors'' (7 and 10
p.m. Tuesdays) is the ticket. Hosted by Brien Blakely, this program
celebrates the do-it-yourself trend with up-close-and-personal
videos of real folks ripping out the flooring and literally cursing
the dry rot they discover underneath. Talk about realism. It could
happen to you, so take note and learn how to remove it properly and
lay a brand-new tile floor, while saving $1,600 in labor alone.
</P>
<P>
   Other new HGTV series to premiere next week include: ``Old Homes
Restored'' (4:30 p.m. Tuesday and 3 p.m. Sunday; premieres next
Tuesday), ``Dream Drives'' (7 and 10 p.m. Friday), ``Designers'
Challenge'' (6:30 and 9:30 p.m. Thursday), ``Going Home'' (7:30 and
10:30 p.m. Tuesday) and ``Our Place'' (6:30 a.m. weekdays). &QL;

   Take a trip to www.requiemforadream.com and you'll find yourself
wondering if you have taken the wrong potion in Wonderland. This is
not your usual movie promotional Web site, but then ``Requiem for a
Dream'' is not from your usual filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Aronofsky, whose first film, ``Pi,'' dealt with an
obsessed math genius, turns his attention to Hubert Selby Jr.'s
novel of drug-fueled delusion and isolation in the Coney Island
district of New York. ``Requiem,'' which stars Ellen Burstyn, Jared
Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans, is set for release Oct.
20 from Artisan. Though the film is currently unrated (it was
originally rated NC-17, but the filmmakers withdrew their
application), there is little as far as we can tell that is overtly
sexual, violent or advocates drugs.
</P>
<P>
   What you find when you first encounter the site which uses movie
scenes, excerpts from the book and sound bytes is an upbeat,
somewhat confusing scene. Soon, though, as you try to interact,
colors begin to fade, error messages occur, and you're directed
into weird places. If you don't know any better, you'll think there
is something wrong with your computer and you're no longer in
control. The site, according to Artisan, is meant to be an extended
mind trip that mirrors the characters' quest for happiness and
their ultimate disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   You be the judge as to whether this Web site works or not, but
it's clear that you'll be seeing more of these kinds of adventurous
sites as studios seek new ways to promote their films.

   ``Jew vs. Jew'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Samuel G. Freedman &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $26) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the most horrible people that God put breath in,'' a
woman says about the strictly observant Hasidic Jews of Kiryas
Joel, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A member of some anti-Semitic fringe group? No, the naysayer is
Jewish, and the conflict embodied in that situation is the essence
of Samuel G. Freedman's informative ``Jew vs. Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the suburban streets of Great Neck to the foot of the
Western Wall, I have witnessed the struggle for the soul of
American Jewry,'' the Columbia University professor writes, saying
that the central questions are: How is Jewish identity defined? Who
decides what true Judaism is? What is the Jewish compact with
America?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jew vs. Jew'' divides itself into six major sections, pairing
an introductory essay with an illustrative episode. For instance,
``Unity vs. Pluralism: Visions of Jewish Community'' embodies
itself in an unsuccessful Modern Orthodox push for a
synagogue-school campus that bitterly divides an Ohio town _ a
community that is more than 80 percent Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman's book is fairly lengthy (about 350 pages) but quite
readable, and it provides a picture of religious and cultural
conflict that has undoubtedly evaded the radar of many readers. &QL;

   ``The Jesus Mysteries: Was the `Original Jesus' a Pagan God?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Harmony Books, $24.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether you conclude that this book is the most alarming heresy
of the millennium, or the mother of all revelations, ``The Jesus
Mysteries'' deserves to be read.
</P>
<P>
   Its premise is that Jesus Christ was not a historical figure,
but a Jewish adaptation of the pagan ``god man'' myth. The authors
insist that their research points to a Christianity that is even
older than 2,000 years. Today's Christians, in their myriad
denominations, are painted as the descendants of the Gnostics.
</P>
<P>
   Event by event _ starting with the virgin birth in a cowshed,
all the way to the martyred death and miraculous resurrection _
parallels are found for The Greatest Story Ever Told in the
mythology of ancient Egypt, Greece and Persia. Each example is
weighted with notes and sources.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, the systematic deconstruction of Christian
mythology becomes a little tedious. But just when you want to shut
the book, along comes a provocative summary or analysis that tempts
you to read on. At the end, you are left with a reaffirmation of
Christian antiquity _ and a better understanding of paganism, to
boot. &QL;

NBC CHIEF LAUDS NETWORK'S PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Wright, the president of NBC, has heard all the criticism of
the network's coverage of the Sydney Olympics and has seen the
ratings fall below NBC's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains steadfastly upbeat. ``I feel terrific about the
coverage,'' he said by phone from Sydney. ``I'm finding the whole
experience very exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   He is referring in part to the experience of being in Sydney
itself, traveling to the event sites, which he described as
spectacularly beautiful. But Wright emphasized that NBC is making
no apologies either for its coverage or for its ratings
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings may have fallen short of NBC's promises to
advertisers, but, he said, ``We're reaching 23, 24, 25 million
viewers a night.'' That has been good enough on most nights to beat
all of NBC's network competition combined, validating, by NBC's
definition, the status of the Olympics as one of television's
signature big events.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era of fractionalizing audiences,'' Wright said, ``the
ability of the Olympics to gather audiences of that size will only
get more valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he was encouraged that the ratings began to
increase during the second week of broadcasts, something that
usually does not happen. But that upward trend did not hold up
through Tuesday night, when NBC suffered a steep drop-off, scoring
just a 12.4 rating, one of the lowest for any night of an Olympics
in history.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives said Wednesday that they expected a weaker
performance because the second Tuesday, with gymnastics over and no
main track-and-field events scheduled, always brings a lull in
competition.
</P>
<P>
   NBC filled with cycling, volleyball and a heavy dose of weight
lifting. Audiences fell away. From 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., the Olympics
came close to being beaten by a rerun of a celebrity edition of the
ABC game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, while praising the production work in Sydney under Dick
Ebersol, said he agreed with some of the reasons being cited for
NBC's struggle with the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That time difference is really tough,'' Wright said. ``I don't
really know what Dick could have done about that.'' Certainly NBC
made its ratings situation more difficult by extending its
prime-time hours from 7 p.m. to midnight, up from the traditional 8
to 11. ``That set up some rather nasty comparisons with past
Olympics,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   But like many other NBC executives, Wright totally disparaged
the comparison to the live telecasts of events being carried by
Canadian television, noting that NBC could hardly pay $705 million
for rights to the Games and then run them live from 3 a.m. to 8
a.m, as the CBC is doing. ``That isn't even working for Canada,''
Wright said, noting that ratings there are ``minuscule.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the rating patterns in the United States have
taken an odd turn, with the Olympics playing best in cities where
they are the most delayed. Among the top 20 cities, the highest
ratings are from West Coast markets like Seattle, San Francisco and
Los Angeles, while only one city in the Eastern time zone,
Philadelphia, is among the top 20. To NBC executives this suggests
that the time delay is not completely the problem, though it may
have something to do with the media concentration in the East,
where the results seem inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Wright pointed out that the ratings news has been good for NBC
elsewhere than in network prime time. The ``Today'' show is at
near-record rating levels, and NBC's cable channels, MSNBC and
CNBC, are up by two and three times more than their normal ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Wright recalled that eight years ago in Barcelona, Spain, NBC
tried the infamous ``Triplecast,'' pay-per-view supplementary
coverage of the Games on cable channels in partnership with
Cablevision. ``We each ended up losing $50 million,'' he said.
``This year we have the true Triplecast. Baseball and softball and
boxing are totally available on cable, and they're doing very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, without citing specific figures, Wright said,
``Financially, we're going to be fine.'' Before the Games he had
predicted that NBC would make a very small profit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, everything that is happening to NBC at Sydney, good and
bad, is relevant to the network's financial future, because NBC has
committed more than $3 billion in rights to the next five Olympics.
Wright stressed that NBC remains enthusiastic about holding those
rights, though he conceded that it is incumbent on NBC to improve
on ways it can keep viewers informed about Olympic athletes between
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true with young viewers, he said, many of
whom don't follow Olympic sports at all. ``The Internet will be a
big part of that challenge,'' he said. NBC will try to use the
Internet to keep interest in Olympic athletes high.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping advertisers excited about supporting the Games may be
the biggest challenge. Wright conceded that with the Salt Lake City
Winter Games coming up in just 16 months, there is a risk of
Olympic oversaturation. But he said that he would certainly not
favor a return to the days when both winter and summer Olympics
were held in the same year. ``If I'm an advertiser, that doesn't
work for me,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, ``Salt Lake City is a domestic Olympics. That
will take care of itself.'' He said NBC has already sold about 60
percent of the advertising time for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But the Summer Games in Athens will follow only another 17
months after Salt Lake City. The figure for advertising sold for
that production is at 20 percent. ``Athens is the next challenge,''
Wright said.

&HT;     U.S. ENERGY OFFICIAL SAYS HEATING OIL PRICES WILL STABILIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the help of President Clinton's decision to
release 30 million barrels of oil, home heating oil prices will
stabilize over the next several months, a top Energy Department
official predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the winter months, consumers should see prices holding
steady,'' Robert S. Kripowicz, acting assistant secretary for
fossil energy, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that prices will remain ``substantially'' higher
than last year and that the decision to release the oil over the
next 30 days from the nation's emergency reserve can't prevent
price spikes caused by an unusually cold winter or shipping
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people should understand that this policy is not
an iron-clad guarantee and that they could see some kind of
temporary price increases because of a number of reasons,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kripowicz also rejected claims that the administration's release
of 30 million barrels _ which equals about 1-and-1/2 days worth of
oil used in the United States _ would have little impact on prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to remember that the current price jump was caused
by the reduction of only about one or two million barrels a day,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kripowicz said that replenishing a million barrels a day to the
market should cause prices to level off.
</P>
<P>
   World production of crude oil is between 75 million and 76
million barrels a day, with the United States consuming about 19
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of home heating oil have fallen in the wake of the
Clinton administration's decision but they remain near 10-year
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have predicted that consumers will pay close to $2 a
gallon to fill their home heating oil tanks this winter. The East
Coast retail price averaged $1.4635 a gallon last winter, with a
high of $1.9470 in the first week of February, according to the
Energy Information Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal winter, a typical house uses 680 gallons of home
heating oil, according to the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Kripowicz said that increased production from OPEC members also
should cause oil prices to begin to fall sometime next spring or
summer.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that neither the release of the strategic
reserve oil nor OPEC's promised increase in output this winter will
help increase inventories of home heating oil, which reached a
24-year low in August.
</P>
<P>
   Home heating oil inventories, according to the Energy
Department, are at 48.1 billion barrels, down from 72.4 billion a
year ago. On the East Coast, heating oil inventories are 24.4
billion barrels, down from 48.5 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 800,000 barrels a day in increased production that OPEC
promised earlier this month will not start flowing until Oct. 1,
and it takes about six weeks to arrive at refineries in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The crude oil from the reserve is not expected to show up as
home heating oil at the retail level until the end of November or
December.
</P>
<P>
   Kripowicz said the low inventories and rising prices were caused
by low oil prices in the mid-1990s _ which pushed both foreign and
domestic producers to cut back or shut down _ and a sharp increase
in demand for oil resulting from the economic boom in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Vice Chairman Jim Saxton, R-N.J., said the release of
the strategic reserve oil should be a temporary solution to
``America's dependence'' on foreign oil. He said the government
needed to develop a policy to promote more domestic oil exploration
and to use U.S. influence to stop OPEC members from ``exploiting''
U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States must do everything in its power to undermine
the OPEC cartel and its monopoly power over supply and prices,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imports 57 percent of the crude oil it
consumes.

AIR FRANCE TO SUE CONTINENTAL OVER CONCORDE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Air France said Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit
against Continental Airlines because it believes a metal strip from
a Continental DC-10 led to the crash of its Concorde jet in July.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators have said they believe that a thin strip of
metal fell off the Continental plane, which had taken off on the
same runway as the Concorde, and set off the events that caused the
Air France jet to burst into flames and crash within minutes after
its takeoff. All 109 people aboard were killed as well as five on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Air France issued a one-paragraph statement on its lawsuit,
saying it had been filed in the Pontoise commercial court, which
covers the town of Gonesse, where the plane had dropped onto a
small wooden hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said that under the civil aviation legal code, an
airline is responsible for damage caused by any pieces that fall
off its aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Continental acknowledged that a strip of metal
found on the runway among debris from the plane was similar in
shape to a piece missing from its DC-10, which had been heading for
New Jersey just minutes before the doomed Concorde took off.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators believe the strip shredded one of the
Concorde's tires, sending huge chunks of rubber through the jet's
fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Continental issued a brief statement on Wednesday, saying that
there was not proof that it was linked to the crash. ``At this
stage in the investigation there is no conclusive evidence that
Continental is involved in the Concorde crash,'' the statement
said. ``Continental will continue to cooperate fully with all the
French authorities investigating the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal case was lodged by Air France and the airline
insurance consortium Reunion Aerienne.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts said it was rare for airlines to sue each
other, but somewhat logical in this particular case.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very unusual circumstances,'' said Shephard Melzer,
who recently stepped down as the chairman of the Aeronautic
Committee of the Association of the Bar of New York City. ``Usually
it's a manufacturer who gets sued for a defective part. But here
that is not the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Melzer said it was really the insurance companies that called
the shots in such lawsuits. ``Which insurance company is going to
pay?'' he asked. ``That's what this is about. And from Air France's
point of view, you can see the advantages. They are saying there
was nothing wrong with their plane. It was really a freak
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before it took off, the Air France Concorde was in trouble.
Flames could be seen engulfing its left wing. But the plane was
going too fast for the pilots to abort the takeoff. Instead, they
tried to land at a smaller airport just a few minutes away. The
plane lost altitude, however, and crashed into the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   French and British aviation authorities last month withdrew
Concorde's airworthiness certificate, saying a ruptured tire should
not bring a plane down. Air France and British Airways, the only
two airlines to operate the supersonic jets, have been studying
whether corrective actions can be taken to insure that such an
accident could not occur again. Before the crash, the planes had
one of the best safety records.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ As the United States closed in on a
remarkable victory over Cuba Wednesday night, Bob Watson, the man
who helped put the team together, rose from his seat behind home
plate and began to accept congratulations. When Mike Neill made a
sliding catch of Yasser Gomez's fly ball to left to seal Ben
Sheets' three-hit shutout, the emotion that had been building since
the middle of the third inning exploded in chants and cheers.
Watson and his wife, Carol, were right there in the middle of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   The United States upset Cuba, 4-0, to win its first Olympic gold
medal in baseball. The victory was not met with the cascades of
emotion that Cathy Freeman of Australia received on Tuesday _
nothing the United States will do here will equal those _ but it
came close.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. baseball team had done the impossible. Four days after
being vanquished by mighty Cuba, ruler of international baseball
for decades, a U.S. team mixed with minor leaguers past their prime
and young players still short of theirs snapped Cuba's domination.
This team won the U.S. first official Olympic gold medal in the
sport known as the American pastime.
</P>
<P>
   True, the United States won the gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics,
but baseball was a demonstration sport that year and _ more
important _ Cuba boycotted those Games. But Cuba, the two-time
defending gold medalist, had been front and center in international
baseball for a long time, and Cuban scouts said this team was one
of their country's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys pitching for the Cubans can go right into the
majors,'' said Tommy Lasorda, the U.S. manager. ``But it's not
always the best team that wins or the strongest man who wins the
fight. In most cases, it's who wants it more than the other. We
wanted it more than the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States jumped on Cuba immediately. Neill's solo home
run in the first inning set the tone; three runs in the fifth
sealed Cuba's fate. With a 4-0 lead, Sheets, 22, was untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   After Cuba won the gold in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992 and
repeated at Atlanta in 1996, Watson, the former major league player
and general manager, was part of a delegation to put together a
team of professional players who would stand up to the Cubans. This
eclectic group of players rose to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday night's game, Lasorda gushed _ as only he can _
that this was larger than winning a World Series ring, that he felt
more excited about Neill's home run than he did about Kirk Gibson's
famous pinch-hit homer in the 1988 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other one was for a team,'' Lasorda said. ``This is bigger
than the World Series; I managed in four World Series _ it's
bigger. When the Dodgers win a championship, the Dodger fans were
happy. Today, the United States of America is happy.''
</P>
<P>
   This victory did not have the suddenness of the Miracle On Ice
in 1980 at Lake Placid, when a young American hockey team upset the
powerful, unbeaten Russians. This was closer to an extended rescue
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The national pastime had been appropriated by Cuba, which has
dominated not only the U.S. team but all others in international
baseball for decades. The Cubans were 64-1 in international
tournaments between 1986 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The perplexing question for the United States was twofold:
</P>
<P>
   How could the nation that invented the game, a nation in which
baseball's mythology is so much a part of its character, a nation
whose lore and spirit is wrapped up in the game, be so thoroughly
dominated by an island nation a fraction of its size?
</P>
<P>
   The other question, expressed as a doubt, was: Could this team
break down a teamful of stars?
</P>
<P>
   ``When this team was picked,'' said Doug Mientkiewicz, the U.S.
first baseman, ``a lot of people looked at the names on the list
and asked: `Who are these guys? Who are they sending over?' That
was the motivating factor for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Cuba's manager, Servio Borges, whether his team's
loss to the United States signaled the end of an era for Cuba, too.
He said no, quite the contrary. ``A new era is just beginning,'' he
said. ``This is the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Cuba Wednesday night became the victim of its own
success in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans forced the United States to get better, to drop
college players from its team and enlist toughened professionals to
uphold the nation's baseball image.
</P>
<P>
   For Cuba, the question is: Now what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to work harder,'' Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart and soul of this U.S. team were three players whose
best days as major-leaguers were behind them. The grit came from
them. Ernie Young, the 31-year-old right fielder who now plays in
the Pacific Coast League in the St. Louis Cardinals organization,
broke the game open with a bases-loaded single. Pat Borders, the
37-year-old catcher who plays with Class AAA Durham for the Tampa
Bay Devils Rays, delivered an RBI double. And Neill, 30, who is
with Class AAA Tacoma in the Seattle Mariners' system, had the
early home run.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the U.S. team rests with a pitcher like Sheets,
who is just beginning his career in the Milwaukee Brewers' system.
Sheets, who signed the highest bonus in Brewers history, played at
Class A Huntsville and Class AAA Indianapolis this season. He
should move into the major league rotation next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first got here I predicted that when this is all over,
everybody in the world is going to know about these players.''
Lasorda said. ``By golly, they know now that these guys are
outstanding.''

FILM EXECUTIVE ADMITS `JUDGMENT LAPSE' IN TRYING TO ADVERTISE TO
KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A top entertainment executive told the Senate
Commerce Committee on Wednesday that it was a ``judgment lapse''
for his movie company to try to advertise a film with violent
scenes on a children's television network.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Mel Harris, president and chief operating officer
of Sony Pictures Entertainment, defended his company in another
instance when children aged 9 to 11 were interviewed as part of the
test marketing of a violent R-rated movie. But Harris said Columbia
Pictures, a subsidiary of Sony, would no longer use under-age
children in focus groups unless they were accompanied by their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was one of eight executives from the country's largest
movie studios who testified Wednesday before the Senate commerce
committee about the marketing of violent movies to children.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the eight (not including Harris) promised they will stop
appealing to children younger than 17 in their marketing of R-rated
films. But the other four said they could not make such a promise
because it was appropriate for some children under 17 to see some
R-rated movies, like ``Saving Private Ryan'' or ``Amistad,'' with
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Motion Picture Association of America announced
new voluntary steps to limit the marketing of adult-rated movies to
children. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who heads the Commerce
Committee, was critical of the new policy. ``I don't understand
this language,'' McCain said. ``It is filled with loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, R-Texas, said Wednesday that if the
industry does not take steps to keep violent films away from young
children ``you're going to see some kind of legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   At another hearing on the other side of the Capitol, an awkward
moment occurred when a congressman asked Gerald Levin of Time
Warner whether the media promoted violence. Levin, whose son was
killed, responded that the congressman had not experienced violence
as a personal tragedy.

AS EBBETS LIGHTS ARE DIMMED AGAIN, A LINK TO DODGERS NEEDS A HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.C., Mass., Ill.)   By DANIEL J. WAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lights of Ebbets Field, which gazed down on a
golden past of Robinsons and Reeses and Walkers and Furillos, found
a home in Downing Stadium when the wrecking ball tore into the home
of the Dodgers and stilled the heart of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Now dem lights _ or whatever may be left of them _ are about to
go homeless again.
</P>
<P>
   Downing Stadium faces demolition this fall as part of a $200
million renovation of Randalls Island, its home near the Triborough
Bridge and at the conjuncture of Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The Randalls Island Sports Foundation, a public-private
partnership with the Parks Department that is developing the park,
plans to hand over the stadium, emptied of anything of value, to
the demolition contractor on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is worth saving, if it means something to
someone,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern. ``If these are
the lights from Ebbets Field, they have to be preserved. You'd have
to be a philistine to destroy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooklynites still call Walter O'Malley far worse than a
philistine for moving their beloved Bums to Los Angeles after the
1957 season. Indeed, the lights are a reminder of the power of one
of America's great nostalgia machines: baseball. The Dodgers are
still such a powerful presence in Brooklyn that the design for the
proposed New York Mets stadium consciously evokes Ebbets Field, and
a Dodger flag flies over Brooklyn Borough Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But the lights are not the only holy relic from New York's
baseball past.
</P>
<P>
   Another stadium, the Polo Grounds of the New York Giants, was
done in four years after the same wrecking ball demolished Ebbets
Field in 1960. (The ball was painted white, like a baseball, in a
whimsy of the time that now seems cruelly mocking.)
</P>
<P>
   At the former stadium sites, the only remnants are plaques and
the names, which are attached to housing projects. But in spots
around the city, in museums and in private homes, bits and pieces
of New York stadium history abound.
</P>
<P>
   Over on Utica Avenue in East Flatbush, in front of Canarsie
Casket Co., stands the center field flagpole from Ebbets Field. It
was erected there by Marvin Kratter, a developer who owned the
stadium in its final years and who built the housing project,
according to a plaque.
</P>
<P>
   The pole is a source of pride for Samuel M. Romano, an owner of
the casket company, who worked as a maintenance man at Ebbets Field
and still loves his old team. ``We're Mets fans, but really Dodgers
fans,'' he said. That's the Brooklyn Dodgers, please understand.
</P>
<P>
   Kratter also donated about 2,200 Ebbets seats to a ball field
for inmates at the old workhouse on Hart Island. After years
exposed to the elements, they fell into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   Some were salvaged and presented by the Brooklyn Dodger Hall of
Fame to former Dodger players. A few iron frames were passed on to
the office of the New York City correction commissioner, said
Thomas C. McCarthy, a correction spokesman. One was given as a gift
to honor the long service of a correction officer who worked on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Old Ebbets Field seats, in fact, are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Donald N. Thompson, a Dodger outfielder in 1951-54 now living in
Asheville, N.C., has several. A client of his real estate business
gave them to him several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still got them,'' Thompson said. ``They work perfectly, No.
23 and 24. They fold up in back, in that old Dodger blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown has
one, plus two benches from a grandstand, the cornerstone and home
plate. Four seats reside at the Brooklyn Historical Society, along
with another home plate, a base, a section sign, a brick and the
1955 World Series pennant.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Gladstone, a collector and the owner of the Class A
minor-league team in Pittsfield, Mass., owns a bronze plaque that
hung in the Ebbets Field rotunda and lists the team's ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The Polo Grounds has a lower profile in the nostalgia gallery,
but its ghosts also linger.
</P>
<P>
   Up in Manhattan and a mile or so north of Downing Stadium stands
a decrepit concrete staircase. Clothes litter the steps. Most of
its railing is gone. A chain link fence blocks the top entrance, at
Edgecombe Avenue and 158th Street. But large bronze letters on the
middle landing declare: ``The John T. Brush Stairway presented by
the New York Giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Named after a Giants owner, the stairway descends part of
Coogan's Bluff, down to a road that runs into Harlem River Drive
and just a few hundred feet from where the Polo Grounds stood.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mandt, director of operations at Shea Stadium, says he
has a little piece of the roof from a Polo Grounds dugout, courtesy
of a former Shea employee whose father, a rabid fan of the Giants,
salvaged it during the demolition, just as many fans scooped up
earth and bits of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame in Cooperstown holds other remnants of the Polo
Grounds: the seat used by the wife of John McGraw, the Giants
legendary manager; a concession stand; a souvenir board; a
megaphone used for announcements before a public address system was
in place; a turnstile; several seats; iron figures from an aisle
shaped with the letters NYG; and a gong used to signal the start of
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Less well-known stadiums have left remains. Near the Gowanus
Canal in Brooklyn, a brick wall on Third Avenue between First and
Third streets forms part of a Consolidated Edison warehouse. Con Ed
and baseball historians say the wall came from Washington Park,
home of the Brooklyn Dodgers for 14 years before the team moved to
Ebbets Field in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Stengel played his first game at Washington Park, and Cy
Young his last.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the story of a relic is even better than the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Ebbets Field clock was long believed to have rested atop the
minor-league park in Asheville, N.C., home of the Asheville
Tourists. Not so, said the team's assistant general manager, Chris
J. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a scam,'' he said. ``Someone drove through the state
with a van full of Ebbets Field clocks, selling them to
minor-league stadiums.''
</P>
<P>
   Must have been a New Yorker, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The market for stadium memorabilia truly began with the
restoration of Yankee Stadium in the early 1970s, said Bert Sugar,
the boxing writer and baseball author and a collector.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors swept away old seats, metal plaques from box-seat
railings, bricks, even Stadium Club matchbooks, Sugar said. A
Japanese department store bought the flagpoles that bore pennants,
uniforms, even grounds-crew overalls.
</P>
<P>
   When the Boston Red Sox refurbished the famous wall in left
field in 1975-76, the team sold chunks for charity, Sugar points
out. The Chicago White Sox did the same with bricks and chairs from
the old Comiskey Park.

 &HT;    LAWMAKERS CRITICIZE AGENCIES REVIEWING AOL MERGER
 &HT;    550&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House hearing Wednesday to examine interactive
television was dominated instead by lawmakers blasting the federal
regulators and antitrust officials reviewing the proposed merger of
Time Warner Inc. and America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the process stinks,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman
of the House Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced Jan. 10, both the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have
been studying it to determine whether the combination of AOL, the
world's No. 1 Internet company, and Time Warner, one of the world's
biggest cable and media companies, would force cable customers to
buy the new company's services and content.
</P>
<P>
   Because the review process often involves private negotiations
with corporate executives, the federal regulator has become ``the
master in a dark room,'' Tauzin told reporters after the hearing.
He said he will push legislation next year to bring ``sunshine'' to
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have been particularly concerned about interactive
television, a new technology that allows consumers to use their TV
sets to surf the Internet, send e-mail and exchange instant
messages while continuing to watch their favorite programs.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that consumers have many options for receiving this
and other Internet-related services, regulators are negotiating
with the companies. They appear poised to force the merger partners
to accept certain conditions to win approval of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Washington Post has reported that the FTC may
ask AOL to sell its $1.5 billion stake in General Motors Corp.'s
Hughes Electronics unit, a maker of satellites and a potential
competitor for Time Warner cable lines. And the Wall Street Journal
has reported that regulators might restrict AOL Time Warner's
relationship with AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest cable operator.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, AOL Chief Executive Steve Case and Time
Warner Chief Executive Gerald Levin said their cable lines, instant
messaging services and interactive television will be open to
rivals, though they do not want to be bound by a legal requirement
for ``open access.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition from digital subscriber lines, wireless devices and
satellites will force them to provide customers with plenty of
choices, so there is no need for regulations, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, the executives sidestepped questions about their
merger on the grounds they were in negotiations with the FTC and
FCC.
</P>
<P>
   While Tauzin was criticizing regulators in his hearing, House
Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., was issuing a letter
to FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky saying his agency should not force
AOL Time Warner to open its cable lines to competitors, on the
grounds that the FTC lacks the expertise to dictate such a
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators should hold off on ``open access'' issues until a
national policy has been established and applied to all companies,
Bliley said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Case said the closed-door merger review process
was not the right place to create and impose a new policy for the
nation's cable system. ``There are some significant policy issues
that are best dealt with in the proper policy forum,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While Republican lawmakers were complaining about regulators,
Democrats were sharply criticizing Tauzin's decision to call only
Case and Levin to testify. Several Democratic subcommittee members
said corporate competitors and consumer groups also should get a
turn to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those groups have testified at other hearings, both in
Congress and before the FCC. ``I think this merger has been the
most scrutinized merger in history,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tauzin said he would hold a second hearing for merger
opponents, most likely on Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of both companies already have approved the deal.
The companies say they expect to win regulatory approval later this
fall.

 NEW YORK: Comiskey Park.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Downing Stadium is unlikely to attract the same sort of
veneration, though it has its own rich memories. There, Jesse Owens
qualified for the 1936 Olympics, Pele played his first game for the
New York Cosmos and the Black Yankees of the old Negro National
League played a season, in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Now, cracks ripple through the foundation, and reinforcing metal
rods are laid bare and rusty from crumbling concrete. There are no
concession stands, hot water in the locker room showers or even
seats at the stadium, which has a capacity of 21,000.
</P>
<P>
   Parks officials promise to preserve what is worth saving,
including stylish bathroom tiles, old wooden refrigerators and
exterior murals painted by the students at New Dorp High School of
Staten Island, which said it was willing to take them back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow, history seems to still shimmer in the air above.
The lights of Ebbets Field, after all, shone on the first black man
to play major-league baseball in the 20th century. They lighted up
one of the game's great moments: the second consecutive no-hitter
by Johnny Vander Meer of the Cincinnati Reds, on June 15, 1938. It
was the first night game at Ebbets Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe right then and there, those lights became magic,'' said
Michael Benson, a baseball historian and the author of ``Ballparks
of North America.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Downing lights were offered for the new
minor-league stadium being built in Coney Island, which would have
been an all-too-perfect fate, but city officials said they were too
expensive to adapt. Officials of the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown
said they would come down to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   Stern had a few spur-of-the-moment ideas: hang them at park
headquarters or a historic house, or maybe a museum wants them.
</P>
<P>
   But after a closer look, it turns out there is not much Brooklyn
left in the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Department records show that after the destruction of
Ebbets Field, the lights were sent to Downing Stadium and plans
were drawn up in 1962 to have them installed on new poles and
frames. Over the years, many of the individual lamp fixtures were
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how many of the original are left above the
stadium or in storage space filled with fixtures, which seem mostly
newer but with a sprinkling of heavy cast-iron and glass models
that parks electricians say are originals.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Downing Stadium or the Parks Department seems to know
what happened to the rest of the original lights.
</P>
<P>
   That does not matter much to one former Dodger, Ralph Branca,
who perhaps more than anyone else unites the Polo Grounds and
Ebbets Field. Branca threw the pitch that Bobby Thomson hit over
the fence at the Polo Grounds and became the ``shot heard 'round
the world'' to give the Giants the 1951 pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Branca said the Ebbets lights prompted ``no feelings, to tell
the truth,'' and he could think of little use for them now _
``unless you got some collector who's got a big back yard who wants
to light it up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   One night this summer, Robert Smith was in a bar debating the
name of an obscure supporting actress in an equally obscure John
Wayne film. It was his telephone that finally settled the
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, didn't call anyone. Instead, using a minibrowser
on his Samsung digital cell phone, he poked around the Web for
about five minutes before finally uncovering the answer. ``I was
amazed I could pull that off,'' he said later, ``especially since I
had $5 riding on the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But winning bar bets is low on the list of things that persuaded
Smith to get wireless Web access. (About two months later, he
couldn't even remember the name of the actress or the film involved
in the bet.) Smith, a regional manager for a company that insures
renters of everything from party tents to portable toilets, began
using the wireless Web 11 months ago to tap into a Web-based
database of his 1,200 clients without having to use a laptop
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix estimates that nearly 7.4 million households in the
United States now have devices like cell phones, pagers and
personal digital assistants that can pluck data from the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   And although there are no reliable overall figures, people in
the industry say that only a small percentage of users with
Web-ready devices actually exploit that feature. Only 200,000 of
Sprint PCS' customers have signed up for Web service. Similarly,
AT&AMP;T Wireless estimates that just 100,000 of its subscribers tap
into the wireless Web.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do explore the wireless Web are discovering that it is
a very different world from the Web they reach on desktop and
laptop computers. The content now available on the wireless Web _
mostly stock quotes, sports scores and weather forecasts _ is
served up in basic text menus with a minimum of graphics and
fanfare. In some ways, it is almost the opposite of the
all-singing, all-dancing wired Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``In focus groups, people say that they want full Web browsing,
and that's the one thing we can't deliver,'' said Michael Mace,
chief competitive officer at Palm Inc. ``We need to let people know
that wireless is not like using a PC. When people who don't know
that get there and try to browse, they say, `What is this
garbage?'''
</P>
<P>
   But some others, like Smith, are even beginning to prefer the
wireless version. He likens using his sleek, state-of-the-art
Samsung phone to his early days of personal computing, when he was
a proud owner of a boxy Kaypro.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find on the Web is too much junk,'' Smith said. ``Logos
and graphics don't thrill me _ content does. But the wireless Web
is like it was in the old days when we were tapping into bulletin
boards with a 300-baud modem.''
</P>
<P>
   In a narrow sense, Smith isn't actually on the Web. While
wireless users may think they're viewing the World Wide Web, many
wireless providers in the United States, including AT&AMP;T, limit
their customers to special pages stored on closed servers. Some
people in the wireless Web business predict the Web will become
increasingly divided into two streams, wired and wireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is going to become highly segmented,'' said Andrew
Sukawaty, the former president of Sprint PCS, the wireless company
that counts Smith among its customers. ``You're going to see
specialized pages for specialized needs'' Exactly what Americans
are doing on the wireless Web and what it may look like in five
years remain something of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, none of the major Net ratings companies has
started tracking wireless Web use. And Bruce Ryon, vice president
of Media Metrix's new-media group, which is developing such a
measurement system, said that the widespread use of the wireless
Web in Asia and Europe does not offer a model of what is likely to
happen in the United States. In Europe, for example, online
wireless games are popular. In Japan, there is a Web-based version
of karaoke.
</P>
<P>
   American customers are not likely to be singing karaoke into
their cell phones anytime soon. The biggest difference is cost. As
with traditional phone service, there is a bewildering array of
options for wireless Web customers, most of them more expensive
than those in Europe or Japan. Sprint PCS, for example, estimates
that its customers pay an average of 25 cents a minute to surf the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Europe and Asia is that there's a whole
different economic model,'' Ryon said. ``In both places it's very
expensive to be wired to the Web. It can cost hundreds of dollars a
month. But wireless access costs only a few dollars a month. Here,
I have a Web cell phone that I'm paying about $70 a month for, and
most people can get on the wired Internet practically for free.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ryon said, the relative expense of wireless
browsing means that North Americans ``will not use it for time
killing, like people in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS was the first U.S. wireless phone service to offer a
practical way onto the Web using handheld gadgets. Most major
wireless companies offer some form of Web service. Typically, they
deliver text-only Web pages written in Handheld Device Mark-up
Language _ HDML _ or Wireless Mark-up Language _ WML.
</P>
<P>
   In part because wireless modems are sluggish _ most systems in
the United States reach a top speed of only 14.4 kilobits per
second _ companies like AT&AMP;T try to reduce delays by holding pages
on closed servers and by using a series of technology standards
known as the Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP.
</P>
<P>
   The content offered by the wireless Web also pales beside that
of its wired cousin. Fast Web and Transfer, a search engine
company, has indexed 400 million Web pages from the traditional Web
in its main search engine. But its WAP search engine offers only
400,000 pages configured for the wireless Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``This space is so new to all of us that we don't really know
what services people will want on mobile devices,'' said Deanna
Sanford, lead project manager for the mobile version of Microsoft's
MSN Web portal.
</P>
<P>
   Ryon said he had determined in his discussions with cell phone
companies that the most popular wireless Web sites in the United
States are pretty much the type that Smith uses: financial
information, weather, sports and news headlines. That fits with
market research conducted by Nokia, said Haroon Alvi, director of
business development and emerging technologies at Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Alvi said, wireless Web users in the United States show
a practical streak. Among the services with potentially high
demand, Nokia found, is real-time traffic information from
commuters. Also near the top of the wish list, Alvi added, is
access to e-mail, personal schedules and contact information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a good example of an early adopter of the wireless Web.
Despite his phone's limitations, he has found a relatively
sophisticated way to use it as he travels. Shortly after getting
his new phone, Smith downloaded a wide variety of information about
his clients _ contact information, policy expiration dates _ into a
Web-based address book offered by Yahoo, a Web site offered in a
stripped-down, phone-friendly format by his cell phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it to access my database when I don't have a laptop,''
he said, ``or during times like when I'm in a restaurant and I
don't want to pull my laptop out and wait for it to boot up.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Smith does not do, however, is stray outside the
roughly 40 sites offered by Sprint's wireless menu. Looking at
pages not rewritten for Web phones usually involves scrolling
through several screens containing only the text for the various
navigation buttons and bars that surround the actual contents of a
page when it is viewed on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   WAP and its special standards are not the only answer to that
problem. Palm Inc. and others stick with traditional Web technical
standards by using scraping or clipping software that is designed
to lift out only the most important text on a page.
</P>
<P>
   Other wireless-site developers are looking to create material
aimed only at the wireless market. Lee Hancock, chief executive and
chairman of Go2 Online, a Web-based business directory, said the
company is altering and limiting the material it sends through its
wireless Web service. ``You might not be looking for a plumber from
your cell phone, but you might be looking for a hotel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Go2 also hopes to take advantage of technology that will
indicate future cell phones' physical locations (a feature that all
phones sold in the United States after Oct. 1, 2001, must contain
by law to aid 911 emergency operators) to automatically sort
wireless Web pages. With that, the service would be able to deliver
information on, say, restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the
user.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, many companies are hoping that the
wireless Web will become part of the world of e-commerce. The
wireless Web versions of online stores like Amazon.com and
Barnesandnoble.com are already being touted as comparison-shopping
tools. The theory is that shoppers will pause in store aisles to
check online prices before heading to the checkout.
</P>
<P>
   Ryon, at Media Metrix, has his doubts about the plan. ``I just
kind of roll my eyes when it comes up at conferences,'' he said.
But he also said that future generations of Web-enabled phones with
higher-speed modems might become part of another big Internet
trend: downloadable music.
</P>
<P>
   As Web-enabled phones improve, Hancock said he expects that many
users may even leave behind the wired Web, with its slow downloads
and overwhelming multimedia features, just as many cell phone users
have abandoned their land lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very good chance that in many cases the wireless
device becomes the primary entrance to the Web,'' Hancock said.
``But it will be very different than the Web as we now know it.
We'll have to create a user experience I don't believe can be met
by wired access.''

US RELAY TEAMS TRY TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ While it might not be fair to say the US relay teams
are in their typical disarry, neither are they exactly in array.
</P>
<P>
   A traditional hotbed of controversy (remember the 1996 should or
shouldn't Carl Lewis run saga?) spiced with a dropped baton or two,
the 4 x 100 men's relay this time around is a big favorite to win
gold, given the woes of rival Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean there are no . . . issues.
</P>
<P>
   US coach John Chaplin earlier this week announced he plans to
run Jon Drummond, Tim Montgomery, Bernard Williams, and Maurice
Greene in all rounds of the 4 x 100, assuming Greene, who would
anchor, has recovered enough from his 100-meter victory to run the
first round Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greene is a little sore,'' Chaplin said.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been talking about his attitude, because Greene is
reportedly annoyed that Montgomery has been named a starter instead
of Greene's Hudson-Smith International teammate Curtis Johnson, who
is not even in the final pool of six that includes Brian Lewis and
Ken Brokenburr. Last month, a relay team with Johnson instead of
Montgomery ran 37.65 seconds in Berlin, fifth-fastest of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Chaplin basically said at the (US) trials that he had
never heard of Curtis Johnson,'' said Emanuel Hudson of HSI, the
training group to which Greene, Williams, Drummond, and Johnson
belong. According to Hudson, Chaplin told everyone after the trials
they had to prove themselves, so the HSI athletes did.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Greene was so unhappy over the snub he would refuse
to run are untrue, said Hudson. ``Since Maurice Greene trains with
Curtis Johnson every day of the year, I'm sure you can understand
not being happy,'' he said. ``(But) Maurice is running because this
is so big, and he feels the United States is looking for him
despite the fact that the coaches are making decisions they may or
may not be able to live up to.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's 4 x 400 squad has not yet been named, but with
400-meter gold medalist Michael Johnson anchoring and 400-meter
hurdles gold medalist Angelo Taylor _ a Johnson favorite _ likely
to form half the team, there should be more talk about world
records than any internal squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   The women's relays face a different set of problems. In the 4 x
100, the good news is Inger Miller, who missed the 100 and 200
meters with a hamstring injury, is expected to be back for the
relay. The bad news is no sooner was Miller looking promising than
Gail Devers aggravated a hamstring strain in the semifinal of the
100-meter hurdles Wednesday night, failing to finish the race. Her
status is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Without Miller and Devers at full strength, Marion Jones's plan
for five gold medals could end right there, assuming she's still in
the hunt after the 200 and long jump finals. Chryste Gaines,
Carlette Guidry, Nanceen Perry, and Torri Edwards round out the
pool, but would be no match for a tough Bahamas squad that includes
Jones's training partner Chandra Sturrup, Sevatheda Fynes, Pauline
Davis-Thompson, and Debbie Ferguson. That's the same squad that won
the world championships last summer, leaving a Jones-less US team
to finish fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the women's 4 x 100 doesn't falter, the 4 x 400 might.
No US woman advanced to the final of the 400 here, and an ill Jearl
Miles-Clark failed to get to the final of the 800. The fastest
400-meter runner on the team is Jones, despite having run only one
race all season solely to make her case for being named to this
squad. Russia, meanwhile, has a deep team led by 400-meter hurdles
gold medalist Irina Privalova.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware that there are a bit of problems,'' said Jones after
winning the 100-meter gold medal. ``But I'm confident that when it
comes time to put the fastest four legs out there in the 4 x 1 and
the 4 x 4, that we'll be prepared.''

CHANGE MARKS YEAR FOR US WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ ``Did we ever look like that?'' Michelle Akers asked.
One of her shoulders was in a sling, and now she was doing
something new. She was observing the US women's soccer team rather
than playing for it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most familiar things appear to be different when you
trade in subjectivity for objectivity, so the injured Akers's
question Sunday was fair: Have the Americans ever played as if they
had message necklaces (Need First Cup of Coffee) draped around
their necks? Did they ever look so sluggish in 1999, when she was
with them and even nonfans knew their names?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Given that answer, Akers smiled. She knew even the great World
Cup team of 1999 had halves and entire games like Sunday's, a 1-0
win over Brazil. It was the kind of unremarkable win that sends
spectators to Before and After photos and This Year/Last Year
comparisons, reaching for better days. But after a year like '99,
the tendency is to romanticize yesterday while poking at today's
weaknesses _ which are perceived to be new.
</P>
<P>
   It's post-magical season syndrome. It happens in all sports.
There is always the mirage of a current crisis, even when final
results are favorable to those of the past. The women knew this was
coming. They won the World Cup last year at home, topping China in
a shootout. This year, they are in another country, preparing for
Thursday night's gold-medal game against Norway at Sydney Football
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Last season: The women played before a mostly loving Rose Bowl
crowd of 90,000-plus on the Fourth of July. They were on talk
shows. They were on editorial pages. Mia Hamm was doing commercials
with Michael Jordan and Brandi Chastain was on the tube with Kevin
Garnett. The defender took her shirt off for an ABC audience,
removed the rest of her clothes for a Gear magazine audience, and,
suddenly, the US women had buzz in all audiences.
</P>
<P>
   This Season: The women played their last game before a mostly
angry Bruce Stadium crowd of 11,000-plus. ``We're playing in front
of family and friends now,'' Chastain said. Some of them were
supporters Sunday. Most of the pro-Brazil fans booed the winners
off the pitch in Canberra, Australia. The only buzz came from
conversation, which generally ended with, ``Brazil outplayed them.
The Americans are washed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Both seasons: The women are involved in the match that will
determine the world's champion.
</P>
<P>
   Problem? What problem?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are differences. The reliable Akers, 34, is
gone from midfield. Her replacement is Lorrie Fair, 22, who
returned to school (North Carolina) after the '99 Cup and won
another championship there. Akers said Fair keeps in touch via
e-mail, and the recent graduate reports that people are always
asking if the midfielder of the past and present dislike each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a great kid,'' Akers said, laughing at the alleged rift.
Fair is a very good player, too. She helped change Sunday's game,
simply by making eye contact with Chastain. The defender had a free
kick. Her eyes met Fair's and ``sometimes you just know what
someone is thinking with the way they look,'' Chastain explained.
``She wanted the ball.'' Chastain got it to her, and Fair got it
toward the area where Hamm placed it in the net.
</P>
<P>
   The goalkeepers have changed. Where there was once a Bri, there
is now a Siri. Briana Scurry still is on the team, but Siri
Mullinix has been the regular keeper. Scurry, a UMass graduate, was
bothered by severe shin splints in the spring. She is healthy now;
she simply lost her job to Mullinix. Her replacement, nicknamed
SeerDog, played with Fair at North Carolina. She made a save Sunday
that was a classic from the Scurry archives, a full-body extension
and then a smother of the ball. If a less qualified keeper had been
playing, this would be a Brazil vs. Norway conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The team's collective wit and approachability have not changed.
This still is one of the most fun groups to be around in sports.
Chastain, who defends as well as she did last season, was recently
asked about Hamm. A reporter began to say that soccer could not
have a Jordan, but Chastain interrupted, ``I don't know. I think
Diego Maradonna did a damn good job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The team continues to receive loads of e-mail; young men and
women continue to come to the sport because they are intrigued by
the Americans' style.
</P>
<P>
   The coach has changed. The winning margins (closer) have
changed. The media requests have decreased. The crowds are smaller.
But when you compete in any sport, the essence of your happiness is
directly tied to what happens when you play. There will be a game
Thursday night involving the US women. They won the top prize last
year in Los Angeles. If they win it this year in Sydney, so be it.
That would be a change of scenery, and there's nothing wrong with
that.

BRITISH ARTS INSTITUTIONS FIND THEIR DONOR WALLS REINFORCED BY
AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago J. Paul Getty II gave the National Gallery in
London a $62.5 million grant, the largest since its founding in
1824. That any individual, let alone an American, would give so
generously to a British museum was unheard of. In those years, few
rich Britons ever wrote a substantial check to a cultural
institution. They didn't have to; the government provided ample
support. Besides, for British citizens, giving never had the tax
advantages that it does in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Getty, an Anglophile whose father was the founder of the Getty
oil fortune and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, lives in
England. His donation did not go unnoticed; in 1986 he received an
honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Sir Paul, who has since become a British citizen,
could be considered something of a pioneer. Today, as London is
seeing the greatest cultural expansion in its history _ a $600
million millennium effort financed partly by England's national
lottery and partly by private donations _ a list of many of the
largest donors reads like a Who's Who of American philanthropy. New
galleries, courtyards, libraries, reading rooms and additions are
being christened with names like Annenberg and Sackler.
</P>
<P>
   And though few American donors are likely to receive honorary
knighthoods, there are other perquisites. It costs far less to make
a splash in London than in New York, where a $15 million check
won't necessarily extract an invitation to join a board. And, of
course, there's always the possibility of hobnobbing with titled
folk and royals.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known Americans who have written big checks include
Maria-Theresa Heinz, the widow of Sen. John Heinz III; Jayne
Wrightsman, one of the New York Metropolitan Museum's most generous
trustees; Cynthia Polsky, another Met trustee; Jonathan H. Kagan, a
managing director of Lazard Freres; and Raymond Sackler, the
psychiatrist and collector. Each has given support to places like
the National Portrait Gallery, the Royal Academy, the British
Museum and Somerset House.
</P>
<P>
   American money accounted for nearly 30 percent of all the
individual financing for the $214 million Tate Modern in London,
the first new national museum in Britain in 100 years and its first
devoted solely to modern art. The donors' wall includes the names
of some of America's best-known contemporary art collectors _
Donald Fisher, founder of the Gap; Charles Schwab, the investment
magnate; Donald L. Bryant, the St. Louis collector; Mortimer and
Theresa Sackler.
</P>
<P>
   American corporations, too, have been generous. Bloomberg News,
whose founder, Michael R. Bloomberg, is a trustee of the Met, gave
the Tate Modern more than $1.5 million for a series of reading
rooms and for three audio guides.
</P>
<P>
   And depending on how the donations to British institutions are
made, they can be tax-deductible in the United States..
</P>
<P>
   ``We see ourselves as the 51st state in the union,'' said Colin
Tweedy, chief executive of Art and Business, a nonprofit
organization in England that promotes business investments in the
arts. ``The American government is effectively paying for many
projects here.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the phenomenon, Tweedy added, is simply that
``Americans understand how to give, what to give and how to get
something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Christensen III, a New York lawyer who is a trustee of the
American Fund for the Tate, has noticed that ``the idea of U.S.
fund-raising for foreign charities is more and more au courant.''
</P>
<P>
   One important factor has been the formation by British art
institutions of American fund-raising arms that have tax-exempt
status in the United States. Based in New York, these ``friends''
groups are independent charitable organizations with boards of
directors that decide how to spend the money. An American donor can
write a check to one of these groups and take the same tax
deduction that writing a check to the Met or the Modern brings.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just tax benefits that prompt Americans to support
English institutions. A small check in London goes a lot further
than in New York or Los Angeles and generally gets the donor's name
on the right party lists.
</P>
<P>
   Some donors are simply Anglophiles who enjoy the cachet that
comes with supporting a London arts group; others, like the scores
of American investment bankers who have been transferred to London
and have been living there for several years now, consider England
a second home. And for serious collectors who give, there is
instant access to some of the world's leading scholars and curators
as well as weekend excursions featuring tours given by experts
through some of Europe's greatest private art collections and
parties organized by the British museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``These institutions sort of belong to the world; they're
global,'' said Jill Sackler. She and her late husband, Arthur, were
the principal donors of a wing named after them at the Royal
Academy. Mrs. Sackler recalled that as the international chairwoman
of the Edinburgh Festival in the 1980s she met Sir Hugh Casson, who
was then president of the Royal Academy. Casson, who died last
year, invited the Sacklers for a tour of the academy, and a long
relationship was born.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Cramer, a television and theatrical producer who has
given not only money but also artworks to the Tate Modern, said
that Anglophilia was the main reason for his generosity. But he
added: ``When I first went to London, the Tate was the one place I
would go to see exhibitions. The other museums seemed so
excessively stuffy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Cramer moved from Los Angeles to New York and sold
or gave away much of an art collection that belonged in part to him
and in part to a foundation he established, he asked some of the
artists whose work he planned to donate where they wanted it to go
to. ``Roy and Dorothy Lichtenstein wanted an interior painting of
Roy's to go to the Tate because the Modern already had a comparable
one,'' he said. ``The Modern already had an early Richard Serra
which was similar to one I also gave the Tate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer recalled that during the years the museum was under
construction, ``there wasn't a collector who cared who didn't get a
personal tour.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt a part of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling has been carefully nurtured by the museum. Jacob
Rothschild, a philanthropist and the former chairman of the lottery
fund, said that clever marketing was one reason for the Tate
Modern's success. ``The Tate has projected itself as a very
non-British institution but a totally international one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Serota, the director, said he had been getting a lot of
American gifts, ranging from $750,000 to $2 million. ``Major
collectors of 1980s and '90s art come here to see shows,'' he said.
``For someone who's used to giving $5 million to their local
museum, to give $1 million to the Tate isn't that much, and it
gives them a foothold in Europe. They enjoy being here, and
relatively small sums make a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the families of American artists want to be included in the
Tate Modern. Candida and Rebecca Smith, the daughters of the
American sculptor David Smith, sold ``Wagon 2,'' one of their
father's works, to the American Fund for the Tate, which gave it to
the new museum.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing has become important to all of London's arts
institutions, since government financing has become scarcer and
lottery money often has to be matched by private donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans invented fund-raising, and we're running to catch
up,'' said Sukie Hemming, director of the British Museum
Development Trust. ``For so long, old money has been cash-light
because it is all tied up in land. Giving has never come from the
aristocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Hemming said, has a lot to do with what she calls ``the
English mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't grow up in the U.K. understanding ambition,'' she
said. ``We find it unsettling, whereas in the States it's endemic.
To have ambition and make money in America is applauded, and part
of establishing wealth is giving it away. That's changing here. The
dot-coms have helped. But it's slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Devine, director of the British Museum's six-year-old
American Friends office in New York, said that the museum's
world-class collections were her best sales tool. ``Our focus is
educational,'' she said. ``Collectors can use our curators and have
great access to them. We're a storehouse of information and
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Each institution has its own friends office, and each has a
sales pitch tailored to the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end there has to be something for Americans in it,''
said Danny Khosrovani, president of the American Friends of the
Royal Court Theater, which reopened in March after a $42 million
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money that Khosrovani has raised _ upwards of
$250,000 _ has gone into supporting American playwrights who have
had difficulty getting their plays produced in the United States.
Last year alone, seven Royal Court productions could be seen either
on or off Broadway. ``We help American voices in the theater,'' she
said. Playwrights like Rebecca Gilman, whose play ``Spinning Into
Butter'' closed at Lincoln Center last week, got her start at the
Royal Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Academy of Art was the first London art institution to
set up an American office. That was in 1983, and over the years it
has received gifts and pledges for about $30 million. When Paul
Mellon, the Washington philanthropist, died last year, he
bequeathed the academy $5 million. Unlike the British Museum or the
Tate, the Royal Academy gets no government subsidy. Nor is it a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were set up in 1768 by artists to be the first professional
association of artists,'' said John Nickson, director of the Royal
Academy Trust. ``Our links to the United States are strong; they go
back to the 18th century and have continued.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the founding members was the American painter
Benjamin West, who became the academy's second president. The
institution is in the final phase of the renovation of Burlington
House, its home on Piccadilly. The American associates expect to
raise about a third of the $30 million cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our donors are Anglophiles who are sophisticated enough to see
the art world as global,'' said Kathrine Ockenden, president and
executive director of the American Associates of the Royal Academy
Trust. ``Since we don't get government help, we run the ship
ourselves, which is something Americans admire and understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy organizes many symposiums and other events that
bring Americans to London. And sometimes it has organized
exhibitions that come to American museums, like ``Sensation: Young
British Artists from the Saatchi Collection,'' the controversial
show that opened at the Brooklyn Museum of Art last fall. Others
include ``1900: Art at the Crossroads,'' which was at the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum earlier this month; ``Chardin,'' which was at
the Met recently; and ``Art in the Age of Queen Victoria,'' which
ended a five-city American tour this week at the Cincinnati Art
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller London institutions, too, like the National Portrait
Gallery and the Dulwich Picture Gallery, rely heavily on American
support. ``The roll call of British patrons could be counted on
less than one hand,'' said Desmond Shore-Taylor, director of the
Dulwich. ``It's in the American mind-set that rich people support
the arts.''

WORLD QUICK TO POINT DOPING FINGER AT YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ It didn't have to be C.J. Hunter. It could have been a
swimmer, a rower, even a judoka. As long as it was an American. The
Lords of the Rings have been waiting to have just one US athlete
send the doping needle off the dial to turn the accusing finger
back on the Yanks and haul them up as hypocrites before the world.
</P>
<P>
   Having it be Mr. Marion Jones merely made the reversal more
delicious, especially when Hunter claimed it must have been those
nasty iron supplements he'd been swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the usual thing,'' cackled Dick Pound, the
International Olympic Committee member from Canada who has had
Americans up to here after having to play Dick Tracy during the
Salt Lake City bidding scandal. ``Athletes always say, `It's not
possible,' followed by, `There must be some mistake in the sample,'
followed by, `I must have got it from the toilet seat,' followed
by, `Here's a writ for $12 million from my lawyer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Johnnie Cochran gets Hunter off the hook (``If it's
something he ate, you must reinstate''). But for now, Hunter is
sitting in the stocks in the town square and the Lords are letting
fly with the tomatoes. It's all about payback.
</P>
<P>
   How far back do you want to go? Two years? Ten? Twenty? More?
Jimmy Carter leading the boycott that ravaged the 1980 Games in
Moscow. The US soiling Lillehammer's winter wonderland with its
sordid Nancy-Tonya soap opera. Atlanta turning the 1996 Games into
a street corner flea circus with a mad bomber (and Pound's wife
getting arrested amid a jaywalking beef).
</P>
<P>
   Then Salt Lake, whose sleazy story of scholarships and ski
vacations created the worst scandal in Olympic history and exposed
one-fifth of the Lords as shameless junketeers on the grab.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much the scandal, which IOC insiders knew was
possible given the host-city derby. It was how the Americans
climbed up into their moral pulpit and began finger-wagging,
howling for expulsions and reform.
</P>
<P>
   It was the FBI rummaging through boxes of records filled with
embarrassing personal dossiers on IOC members (does the Venezuelan
lady really like younger guys?). It was John Hancock pulling the
Olympic rings off its letterhead. It was the American congressmen,
who'd been slopping at the soft-money trough for years, making Juan
Antonio Samaranch raise his right hand, so help him God. ``What did
you know and when did you know it?'' Mr. Upton from Michigan
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw was the doping issue, which the IOC has been
wrestling with (and, it admits, losing) for three decades and more.
The athletes are always a quadrennium ahead of the labs. The
international federations can't agree on penalties. The national
Olympic committees cover up for their athletes.
</P>
<P>
   So when the IOC decided last year that it should create a global
anti-doping agency (and put Pound in charge), it was the Americans
who led the catcall chorus, saying the Lords have no credibility on
drugs. The same Americans who do all their own testing and always
seem to come up clean. And who's their point man? Bill Clinton's
guy. The Americans should put their own house in order before
playing prosecutor, IOC drug chief Prince Alexandre de Merode said
tartly.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the Americans weren't right. The new World
Anti-Doping Agency should be free of IOC influence if it's to have
global credibility. And didn't the IOC end up adopting most of the
reforms the Mitchell Commission recommended?
</P>
<P>
   The US Olympic Committee, which was also tarred by the Salt Lake
scandal, had its own shake-up and started an independent
anti-doping agency, which takes effect right after these Games.
</P>
<P>
   That's what irks the rest of the Olympic family. Now that the
Americans finally got religion, they're coming on like Elmer
Gantry. But why not, Gantry says? Who fills up the IOC's collection
plate, after all? Virtually all of the global Olympic sponsors,
like Hancock and Kodak and Xerox, are US companies.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy a T-shirt in Olympic Park, you pay with a Visa card.
If you buy a soda, Coke makes it. If you eat fast food in the
athletes' village, it's Mickey D's. NBC paid $3.5 billion for the
rights to the Games through 2008. Sydney is getting $700 million in
TV cash from the US alone, twice as much as all of Europe is
paying.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics run on the Yankee dollar, so if the Yankees want to
be evangelical about it, that's their privilege: You take our
money, you listen to our sermon. If you stand in the soup line with
your hand out, you sit through the salvation speech.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the IOC has to like it. The US may pay for these Games
and they may top the medal table by a mile. But, as Norwegian
speedskating deity (and IOC member) Johann Olav Koss said this
week, there shouldn't be one rule for the world and another for the
US.
</P>
<P>
   If the IOC is going to take a gold medal away from a Romanian
pixie for taking a couple of cold tablets, it's not going to wink
at an American shot putter. So when word came out this week that
Hunter tested positive for nandrolone on four different occasions
this summer, the IOC and the international track federation put
Elmer Gantry on the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   Five Americans, de Merode said, competed in Seoul in 1988
despite failing tests before the Games. And 15 others, the IAAF
claimed, tested positive before Sydney. Mr. Marion Jones may yet
slip off the hook, but he's already been spattered with foreign
tomatoes. Payback has many forms.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the nation will be rather tranquil Thursday as a large
high-pressure system moves into the eastern two-thirds of the
country. In the Northeast, some patches of clouds will linger along
the New England coast as moist breezes from the northeast combine
with a jet-stream disturbance to produce a band of clouds. Farther
inland, sunny skies will be dotted with many cumulus clouds.
</P>
<P>
   A weakening jet-stream disturbance will pass over a nearly
stationary front in Florida, promoting scattered showers and
thunderstorms. Some of these showers will contain locally heavy
rain. Meanwhile, the interior Southeast will be seasonably warm.
</P>
<P>
   A broken area of clouds and showers will move from the Southwest
into Wyoming and eastern Utah. Clouds will also arrive ahead of a
weak cold front in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HELPFUL HURRICANES
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Isaac, churning through the eastern Atlantic, is
expected to move north and eventually dissipate without threatening
land. But this storm, like most tropical storms and hurricanes is
performing the important task of moving heat from the tropics
toward the middle latitudes. In the cold season, powerful winter
storms transport frigid air toward the equator while drawing warmer
air toward the poles, helping to erase the natural global energy
imbalance. In the warm season, when midlatitude storms are weak,
tropical storms, both benign and destructive, help balance the
weather budget.

WORLD'S TOP GIANT IS NOW AN AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ For 13 years, the mammoth men with sequoia thighs and
refrigerator chests who populate the 130-kilogram class of
Greco-Roman wrestling have had two-tier competitions in which they
all compete for what's left over after the same truly legendary
figure takes home the gold.
</P>
<P>
   In towns you've heard of (Stockholm, Copenhagen, Seoul,
Barcelona) and towns you haven't (Kolbotn, Poznan, Tampere,
Gaevle), they have entered international competitions in their
weight class resigned to silvers, bronzes, and lesser numerical
placements. There has never been any question who would win.
Alexander Karelin, the sculpted 286-pound pride of Novosibirsk,
Siberia, last lost a match to (itals)anybody(unitals) in 1987, and
had come to Sydney undefeated in an estimated 300 international
matches during the last 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night, the three-time gold-medal winner and
nine-time world champion finally heard a new tune at the end of his
gold-medal match. It's called ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' The new
King of Gigantic People is an American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm numb to beat that guy,'' said 29-year-old Rulon Gardner.
``He's the best wrestler in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Karelin is actually the best wrestler of all time, but on
Wednesday he was beaten, fair and square, by a massive man from
Afton, Wyo., and the University of Nebraska who has never before
brought home a medal in major international competition. Now he's
got America's first nonboycott gold in this sport, and the
reverberations are sure to be felt around the entire Olympic
communuity, where the noble Russian is more commonly regarded as a
celestial envoy than as a mere human being.
</P>
<P>
   It was pretty much assumed that Karelin would never again lose.
Surely, no Russian ever thought the man who would end the winning
streak would be an (itals)American(unitals) who admits he had never
even heard of Karelin until the legend had already won two gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard there was some great Russian back around '92,'' said
Gardner, ``but I really didn't know exactly who it was until around
'95.''
</P>
<P>
   How appropriate that when the great man was finally brought down
after 13 long years it was by someone who could easily relate to
Karelin's own rural roots. Gardner, youngest of nine, was raised on
a dairy farm in Wyoming. Karelin is said to have trained by hauling
logs. Gardner spent many hard years doing every imaginable
distasteful farm chore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do I start?'' said Gardner, whose 1-0 victory will be
required study material for all those wrestlers who have tried and
failed to depose the Great Karelin. ``It's been a hard life. But
one thing I've always said to myself is not to quit. Just don't
ever quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Will is one thing, but mere will could not defeat Karelin, who
has always been able to overpower people. ``Go out on a dairy
farm,'' suggested Gardner. ``Get up against a cow and try to move
it. The only problem is Alexander is a little quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Karelin wasn't able to move the superbly conditioned
Gardner, who has a 54-inch chest. In their only previous meeting
three years ago, Gardner was thrown during a 5-0 overtime loss. But
this time, he was the more manly man. Karelin actually got tired
trying to shove Gardner around.
</P>
<P>
   The only point was the Greco-Roman equivalent of an unearned
run, and it came 30 seconds into the second three-minute period.
The wrestlers were placed in a standing clinch to start the period,
and Gardner received a point when Karelin broke his hold before a
full minute had elapsed. It took a sideline conference to decide
the matter, but the point was awarded, and it held up for the
remainder of the period and all through a three-minute overtime
session. (If neither man has 3 points after two periods, an
overtime follows. If someone is ahead after the additional three
minutes, he wins the match.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrestled a perfect match,'' shouted deliriously happy US
coach Dan Chandler. ``The idea was not to get turned and get
(Karelin) tired on his feet. I knew Rulon would wrestle him well,
but you don't know if he could win the match against the greatest
wrestler of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Karelin was thought to be vulnerable four years ago when he
arrived in Atlanta with a bad shoulder. He needed all his wiles to
win gold medal No. 3, defeating American Matt Ghafari in the
finals. But a lot has happened in the ensuing four years. For one
thing, he was elected to the Duma, the lower chamber of Russia's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting older,'' conceded Chandler, ``and he's heavy into
politics. You wonder when he finds time to train. You could see him
losing a little during the last four years. He was beatable.
Fortunately, it happened to us.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, he wasn't the wrestling machine who treated his six
Barcelona opponents, as we're told in David Wallechinsky's ``The
Complete Book of the Summer Olympics,'' like ``inanimate objects.''
But he was good enough to wrestle his way into a fourth Olympic
final, and he always carries with him a mystique. Going undefeated
for 13 years does give you an aura.
</P>
<P>
   But when he got to this match, he found himself involved with a
massive, determined, and intelligent opponent who simply wasn't
afraid. ``With him, I just had a certain type of calm,'' Gardner
explained. ``It was weird.''
</P>
<P>
   There were the requisite number of Americans waving their flags
and chanting their ``USAs!'' but the rest of the crowd was in the
big man's corner, and they were confident he would come through _
as always. But nothing the champ did worked against this wide-body
American who surely looks like one Tom Osborne let get away.
</P>
<P>
   With four seconds left, the champion knew it was over. He simply
stood up to accept his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to see him lose,'' said Chandler. ``I love him. He's
not just a great wrestler and one of the greatest Olympians of all
time, but he's also a great man. He's one of the greatest men of
the generation. And he reacted the way you knew he would. He came
over, shook my hand, and said, `Yeah, he did well.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said something to me in Russian, right at the end,''
confided Gardner. ``I don't know what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have been: ``How can I get a chest like yours?''

AMERICAN VOLLEYBALLERS DIGGING IN FOR A WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ They weren't supposed to be this far into their
Australian athletic vacation.
</P>
<P>
   America's female volleyballers, ranked 10th in the world headed
into the Olympics, were expected to make a polite showing here,
maintain their international integrity, and head home long before
things became serious, with suitcases loaded with little more than
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, they've got one foot up on the medal stand and they're
dreaming of winning their first gold medal in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incredible,'' said Stacy Sykora, the former Texas
A&AMP;M standout who fills the newly created ``libero'' position,
making her the club's key defensive force. ``When I woke up
(Wednesday) morning, I was still in awe over the whole thing. I
mean everything _ the fact that we're 5-1, the fact that we beat
Korea (Tuesday) in a five-set nailbiter. It's just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Yanks, seeded ninth, have beaten higher seeds
Croatia (8), China (4), and Korea (5) to get to the semifinals
against the Russians. Their only loss was to the mighty Brazilians,
the court queens who face archenemy Cuba in Thursday's other
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians' strength is in their size and offensive attack.
They have seven women who are 6 feet 3 inches or taller, topping
out with Ekaterina Gamova (6-7) and Olga Potachova (6-8). The
Russian Rockettes are now 6-0, following a 3-0 win over China, and
the Yanks figure they'll attack the way they always do, with a
strong, aggressive offensive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just huge,'' said the peppery Sykora, the most
animated of all the Americans, constantly chattering on the floor
and interacting with her teammates. ``The difference is, we're a
blocking and defensive team, and they are attack _ and attack some
more.''
</P>
<P>
   By definition _ the ``libero'' position literally written on the
back of her jersey _ the 5-foot-10-inch Sykora is center of the US
defense. The position was introduced to the sport only two years
ago, and this is its debut in the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The libero can't attack, can't block, can't serve. In fact, the
libero isn't allowed to set the ball with two hands unless she is
in the far backcourt. She is allowed to punch set the ball with her
two forearms when in the forecourt, but for the most part, liberos
are ``free'' only to dive and dig, do all the dirty work _
honorably, of course _ to keep the ball alive on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an offensive player in college,'' said Sykora. ``But I
always loved playing defense, too. And when the libero position
came around, my college coach (Laurie Corbelli) figured it would be
good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbelli, a member of the US silver-medal team in Los Angeles in
'84, knew it was Sykora's dream to play for the Americans. She also
knew the team would have enough big hitters. If Sykora could find a
niche on the national squad, it had to be in charge of putting some
bite in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be my senior year when she told me about it,''
Sykora said. ``And I figured right then, `That's for me.' I just
knew I'd do anything to be part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after college, Sykora had a two-day audition for the job,
won a sixth-month tryout, and now she's here with a chance to
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have just been coming together for us at the right
time,'' said Sykora, whose teammates, none bigger than 6-3
(Danielle Scott and Heather Brown), can match the Russians' jumping
power at the net. ``Now we've got to keep that going, and that will
mean getting a good defensive blocking game out there against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   From here, the 23-year-old Sykora will be headed to Europe,
where she will begin a pro career with Ravenna, in northern Italy.
Libero is Italian for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be known as one of the best passers in the world,''
Sykora has said. ``Or at least among the top three passers in the
world, and (best) defensive players . . . I want people to talk
about the girl from the USA who can really pass. I want to make a
name for myself. I want to be somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking down the Russian Federation would be a giant step toward
making a name, not just for Sykora but for all the Americans.
Getting a shot at the powerful Cubans or Brazilians (provided one
is left standing after their semifinal) would guarantee it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us right now are trying not to think about what all
this means for the program,'' she said. ``We know it's great, and
we honestly believe we can beat anyone, but it's like, oh my gosh,
this is so great, let's just focus on each game and not think about
the rest. I mean, USA volleyball wasn't still supposed to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But they're still around, looking for medals instead of
mementos.

 &HT;    ISRAEL'S NETANYAHU, CLEARED OF BRIBERY, READIES FOR EXPECTED
POLITICAL COMEBACK
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein
Wednesday said he would not indict former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on corruption charges. The move raised expectations of a
comeback for the charismatic politician known for his combative
style and hard line on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was in Atlanta Wednesday representing an Israeli
company at a telecommunications convention. His Jerusalem office
said he was to return Thursday, cutting short his trip.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared an end was coming to the ``time out'' from politics
that Netanyahu announced after being trounced in elections in May
of last year. The prospect of a return of ``Bibi,'' as Netanyahu is
known here, sent a sizzle through the political ranks and on
Israeli radio talkshows.
</P>
<P>
   His possible re-entry poses a threat to embattled Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, who may face a call for new elections amid a stalled
peace process and defections of political allies.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, 50, is a right-winger Israelis tend to either love or
love-to-hate, reflecting in part the deep left-wing, right-wing
divide among Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   His three-year-term was marked by hard bargaining with
Palestinians, which often brought him to loggerheads with the
Americans mediating the peace process. It also saw several cycles
of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost indicted in 1997 in a case revolving around
political cronyism. His infighting with presumed allies, and also
reportedly with his wife Sara, was constant grist for political
junkies. But, he cast himself as the defender of Israel's
underclass, and protector of Israeli land.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, opinion polls show Netanyahu even with Barak, who won
the election last year by 56 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Netanyahu fairing better than hawkish former Gen.
Ariel Sharon, current leader of Netanyahu's Likud Party. That
standing could be crucial, as Barak opponents vow to call for new
elections soon after the Israeli parliament reconvenes Oct. 29. The
elections could be held early next year.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Israel the possible revival of Netanyahu
opened up the old rifts between those who see the Palestinians as
possible peace partners and those who see them as eternal enemies.
The split was also between those who view Netanyahu as a persecuted
defender of the weak or a just corrupt politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good for Israel. He won't sell out the land,'' said
mini-bus driver Elisha Levy, 47. ``When he is prime minister again
(Palestinian President Yasser) Arafat will feel sick, and that is
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned he can go to jail,'' said paint
factory owner David Shullman, 50. ``Netanyahu is a specialist at
getting into trouble and a specialist at getting out of it. In any
other country he would be too embarrassed to try to get back into
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just the ongoing investigation that seemed to keep
Netanyahu's political prospects on hold. That ended Wednesday when
Rubinstein decided not to indict Netanyahu after a yearlong police
probe.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation included allegations of bribery and kickbacks.
It centered on $100,000 in home improvement work Netanyahu received
from a contractor, and official gifts received as prime minister
that police said Sara and Benjamin Netanyahu kept.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein, in a 22-page opinion, said there was insufficient
evidence to win a conviction in court against either Netanyahu or
his wife. But, he said Netanyahu's conduct was ``not a proper way
to run a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office issued a statement praising Rubinstein's work
and, with the start of the Jewish New Year Friday night, said ``we
understand Mr. and Mrs. Netanyahu's feeling of relief and wish them
a happy new year.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak ally, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, instead highlighted
the criticism in Rubinstein's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court will not decide the fate of Netanyahu, the public
will,'' he told Israeli television. ``A person such as this cannot
be the leader of a party in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Likud Party leader Sharon dismissed any worries that Netanyahu
will return with plans to capture the party leadership. He focused
attention on Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Benjamin Netanyahu will now have the time to join us in
our battle against the dangers that the Barak government brings,
and to bring down the government,'' he said, vowing to maintain the
party leadership.

HP CHIEF DEFENDS PRICE PAID FOR TECHNOLOGY CONSULTANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hewlett-Packard's chief executive, Carly Fiorina,
Wednesday defended the $18 billion offer her company has made for
the technology consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, calling it
``a fair price for everybody involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Boston College's Chief Executives Club, Fiorina said
she is optimistic the two companies will reach a merger agreement
in four to six weeks. If so, the world's second-largest computer
maker will be in the unique situation of absorbing 30,000
consultants into its 86,000-employee work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it would be a challenge,'' Fiorina said when asked
about combining firms from different industries with such varied
corporate cultures. ``But we are already alligned (with PwC) when
it comes to strategy and our view of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard first confirmed two weeks ago that it was in
merger talks with the consulting giant. The idea, Fiorina said, is
to create a single entity that can identify problems for companies
through its consulting unit and then solve them through its
products and services divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts have questioned the widsom of such a corporate
marriage, citing Cisco Systems' recent $1 billion investment in
KPMG Consulting as a sign of things to come. Sun Microsystems, a
Hewlett-Packard competitor, also has its own consulting arm.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag has come under fire in some quarters, though. In
the week after the merger talks became public knowledge,
Hewlett-Packard shares lost $18, or almost 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consulting division will have about $8 billion in revenues
in fiscal year 2001,'' Fiorina said. ``A multiple 2.2 to 2.3 times
that is certainly in the normal range for this type of deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the deal happens or not, Hewlett-Packard is in the
process of building its own technology-consulting business. It
hired 600 consultants in the latest quarter, boosting its total to
about 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting revenues grew 46 percent in the past year, helping
Hewlett-Packard boost overall revenues 15 percent. Wednesday,
Fiorina said the company will again report revenue gains of that
magnitude for the third quarter, which ends this week.

 &HT;    NURSING HOME QUALITY MAY BE GOING BACKWARDS
 &HT;    540&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after President Clinton launched a
crackdown on problem nursing homes, congressional investigators say
the nation may be losing ground in the battle against neglect and
abuse in its 17,000 nursing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 percent of those homes have been cited for harming
their residents or for putting them in immediate jeopardy, the U.S.
General Accounting Office said in a report to be issued
Thursday(cq).
</P>
<P>
   That figure marked an increase over the nearly 28 percent of
homes with serious deficiencies before the enforcement effort
began.
</P>
<P>
   The increase ``could be the result of better detection'' of
deficiencies, said the GAO, the non-partisan investigative arm of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, recent nursing personnel shortages ``raise concerns
that the actual proportion of homes with deficiencies may have
increased,'' the report warned.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, requested the study to review
progress of the nursing home initiative, which Clinton announced
two years ago in response to a scathing report on nursing care for
the 1.6 million Americans in long-term facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you that there's dramatic improvement, but
I can't,'' said Grassley, whose Special Committee on Aging will
hold a follow-up hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Grassley said, ``we had 30 percent of people in
California nursing homes that are in life-threatening situations. I
think it would be wrong for me to conclude that it's different
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley credited the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA),
which oversees most nursing homes, with giving ``more attention''
to the nursing home standards that were passed by Congress in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving the bureaucracy, but it's kind of like towing a
house,'' Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana, the
ranking Democrat on Grassley's panel. ``This nursing home
initiative began more than two years ago, and while we've made some
improvements, it still seems in many ways we've been stuck in the
same position since day one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA administrator Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, responding to the GAO
report, acknowledged that ``it is still too early to draw
definitive conclusions about the impact of various (1998 nursing
home initiative) provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings of the GAO study:
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite more weekend and off-hours inspections ordered by the
Clinton administration, inspections in some states ``continue to be
predictable, allowing facilities to mask certain deficiencies if
they chose to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Much of the federal government's stepped-up enforcement
program won't be ready to implement for two or three more years and
would require ``sustained'' efforts to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Clinton administration directive that states focus on their
worst nursing homes brought increased monitoring of 60 facilities
nationwide. Of these, a dozen dropped out of federal financing
programs. About half were fined, and 28 of the homes are now ``in
substantial compliance'' with federal standards, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office said the number of homes was too small to
have a significant impact nationwide and cited California's state
effort, which two years ago began to scrutinize 36 of its worst
homes.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The GAO also criticized federal regulators at HCFA for failing
to catch problems in Oklahoma, where the head of the agency that
inspects nursing homes was indicted for bribery last May.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA could have spotted irregularities by a simple review of
Oklahoma's inspection results, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Oklahoma's own reporting showed an exceptionally
high percentage (22 percent versus 16 percent nationwide) of homes
with no deficiencies. At the same time, the state failed to enter
some inspection results into the HCFA data system for two years.
</P>
<P>
   When federal officials conducted surveys of 16 Oklahoma homes
suspected of bribing the top inspector, they found that half the
homes had at least 20 deficiencies more than the state found. One
home had 37 health citations in the federal survey, whereas state
officials had found only one deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   In the GAO study, about 18 percent of Georgia's nursing homes
were cited for actual harm to residents or for putting them in
immediate jeopardy in the 1997-98 period before Clinton announced
his initiative. From 1999 through last July, the percentage jumped
to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The figures for other states include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida: 36 percent before the initiative, and just under 22
percent afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas: 22 percent before the initiative, and 25 percent
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ohio: 31 percent before the initiative, and just under 29
percent afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colorado: 11 percent before the initiative, and just under 17
percent afterwards.

percent afterwards.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In New York City, remodeling an entire kitchen for
less than $20,000 _ with new appliances in better locations, new
countertops, cabinets, floor and labor _ is the equivalent of
finding a two-bedroom apartment for $1,000 a month. It's possible,
but not very likely.
</P>
<P>
   To Michael McDonough, a New York architect, the $20,000
remodeled kitchen is an urban fairy tale. ``It's `the
brother-in-law kitchen,''' he said, meaning that it can be achieved
only if your brother-in-law is a licensed plumber, electrician and
general contractor, and utterly devoted to you.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen and bath are the most expensive rooms to redo
because they require appliances, cabinetry, countertops,
electricity, water and gas lines, plus the labor to install them.
Remodeling magazine pegs a minor American kitchen makeover (new
paint, new cabinet fronts, perhaps a new floor) for this year at
$8,655, and a major remodeling (the works) at an average of
$31,090. The appliances and materials are one-third of the cost;
the rest is labor. In New York, labor runs high.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the trades have to be involved,'' said Paul Deffenbaugh,
Remodeling's editor in chief. ``You'll do it once or twice in your
lifetime, kind of like getting married, and you'll want to do it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the $20,000 makeover is possible, especially if no
walls or fixtures have to be moved. Here are four kitchens to prove
it, from a modest $5,000 redo to a makeover that slightly topped
the budget because a wall was demolished. In addition, House &AMP; Home
asked three Manhattan design firms for budget ``concept'' kitchens.
Ikea cabinets, those affordable chameleons, turned up in kitchens
traditional and modern (with finishes from aluminum to laminate to
cherry).
</P>
<P>
   In realizing her vision, Helene Verin sacrificed custom
cabinetry _ but not style _ for Ikea's frosted-glass cabinets,
lighted from within to glow softly. The savings let her splurge on
walnut counters. Each kitchen, real or theoretical, offers
uncluttered counter space and invites a person to get busy and
cook.
</P>
<P>
   WHIMSICAL FEMINISM
</P>
<P>
   Verin is a designer of interiors, furniture and wallpaper who
lives in the Flatiron district, and her kitchen is a
tongue-in-cheek statement of feminism (she just got divorced and
she's happy). The pass-through from the kitchen to the dining room
is cut in the shape of an egg. The thick glowing curved walnut
counter for the pass-through? ``It's the shadow of the egg,'' Verin
said. Three ceiling lamps in the shape of milk bottles, designed by
Droog, complete the feminist symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Verin knew how to prioritize artfully. She loved the
voluptuousness of custom-cut solid walnut, made for the
pass-through and around the sink. It was a nod to the late George
Nakashima, one of America's foremost furniture craftsmen. She then
economized by using walnut veneer for below-the-counter cabinetry
and the front of the refrigerator. For a backsplash, she had glass
cut to fit, but she frosted it herself using a $4 tube of spray
frost, called Krylon Glass Interior Frosting Spray. The Magic Chef
stove, Bosch dishwasher and Franke sink are new; their chrome or
stainless steel finishes resemble those of higher-end appliances.
But she kept the old refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is 10 feet by 7 feet 3 inches, but ``the advantage
of this place is that the ceiling is 12 feet high,'' she said. So
she raised the height of the cut-out entrance to the kitchen from
7{ feet to its full 12 feet, and suddenly a small kitchen soared.
Total cost: $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   THE ENDLESS COUNTER
</P>
<P>
   Suzie Jackson wanted a kitchen with more than enough counter
space. Jackson is a food stylist who until last month lived with
her husband, James, and daughter, Edwina, in a TriBeCa loft. (They
have since moved to Australia.) Brad Zizmor, who designed the loft
with Dag Folger, his partner at A&AMP;I Design in Manhattan, obliged.
The kitchen is 18 feet long by 12 feet 9 inches wide; the counters,
one on each side, run the entire length.
</P>
<P>
   The efficient room is an austere homage to the loft's industrial
heritage, warmed with wood. The countertops are Fireslate, a
synthetic heat-resistant, laboratory countertop material
(800-523-5902), so Jackson could put hot pots directly on it.
Although Fireslate is only half an inch thick, the architects
attached it to the sides, so the counters appear to be ``big and
bulky and permanent,'' Folger said. They designed a storage system
of birch plywood shelves, drawers and cabinetry, framed with
Speed-Rail, a cast aluminum tubing system intended for scaffolding
or industrial handrails. The floor is trompe l'oeil: What appears
to be concrete is 4-by-4-foot squares of Ply-cem, half-inch thick
panels of concrete impregnated with wood fibers. ``It's used for
industrial roofing,'' Zizmor said, ``but it's lighter and more
stable than plain concrete, which can also crack.'' Total cost:
$17,450.
</P>
<P>
   MIDCENTURY MODERN FOR LESS
</P>
<P>
   David Colman's clutter-free, cozy (that's another word for
``small'') midcentury-modern kitchen cost only $5,000. ``I wanted a
nice, clean, white and green kitchen,'' said Colman, a freelance
writer who lives in the Wall Street district. ``The kitchen had an
awful ivory and wood laminate-accented cabinet with a hideous tile
floor and fluorescent light.''
</P>
<P>
   Out went everything except the refrigerator and stove.
</P>
<P>
   He installed an antique porcelain sink, a new pine floor,
butcher-block counters and those glass-fronted cabinets from Ikea
(to hold his red and white 1950s Paul McCobb dishes, found on
eBay). To economize, he gave up on the idea of $50 crystal knobs
and bought chrome ones at P.Guerin, a custom hardware house in
Greenwich Village, for $5 each, and painted the walls himself. ``My
knobs have pedigree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MINIMALIST, BARRIER-FREE, ZEN
</P>
<P>
   At age 89, Will Machado, an interior designer gave himself an
inspiring present: a minimalist Zen kitchen that is warm, serene
and efficient. He wanted a kitchen that was easy to walk around,
and he demolished a wall separating the kitchen from the living
room. ``I wanted to simplify my life,'' he said, but even with a
$30,000 budget (including demolition) he had to make trade-offs. He
loves wood for its warmth and tactility, and he hired Stephen Iino,
a cabinetmaker, to execute his design in ash and maple. (The old
appliances stayed _ Machado cooks some meals at home, or goes out
to Nick &AMP; Toni's Cafe a block away.) Machado eliminated the thing
that annoyed him most: overhead doors that swung out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why open doors and bang your head?'' Machado asked. ``All the
doors slide, the pulls are holes and drawers slide out.'' He pulled
out a drawer, and shut it with a bump of his hip. The cabinetry was
$20,000. The demolition, rubber floor, and other work cost an
additional $10,000. &QL;

In Hove, England, the administration of the Pussycats Club has
complained to local authorities that a licensing regulation
forbidding the touching of lap dancers discriminates against the
blind.
</P>
<P>
   Club director  &UR; Kenneth McGrath &LR;  told the London Telegraph that
when two blind men visited the club as part of a stag party, they
``said they very much enjoyed the dances and sensed highly the
proximity of the dancers and, in particular, enjoyed the smell of
their perfume. Given their disability, they felt controlled
touching ought to be permitted for registered blind persons only
and with the dancers' consent.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said 11 out of his 15 dancers said they would not mind
being touched, under regulated circumstances. A city council member
said the license variation request will be taken under
consideration.

   Art historian  &UR; Rhonda Roland Shearer &LR;  contends that some of the
items presented as ready-made by  &UR; Marcel Duchamp &LR;  _ a hat rack, for
example, or a reproduction of the Mona Lisa with mustache and beard
drawn on _ are actually items created especially for the art.
</P>
<P>
   This is a controversial contention to art historians, reports
Lingua Franca, which sent reporter  &UR; Daniel Berchenko &LR;  to Shearer's
laboratory to check out her research.
</P>
<P>
   She owns ``one of the world's largest collections of Duchampian
art and ephemera,'' says the magazine, including works she made
herself, such as ``a replica of Duchamp's urinal constructed
entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups.''
</P>
<P>
   The day Berchenko visited the lab, Shearer and nearly a dozen
researchers ``donned austere white lab coats, huddled around 3-D
models and scrawled equations on chalkboards in an absurdist
performance for this reporter's benefit.''
</P>

   ``The glass you sip from can greatly affect the degree of
enjoyment you experience,'' says the catalog listing. The class
will include ``a series of tastings as we learn the importance of
shape and design of a glass.'' Reidel is the name of a glass
manufacturing company; participants get four glasses to take home
``for continued enjoyment.''

saddened by this revelation.''
</P>

   A short time later, her office rescinded the statement, says
Roll Call, saying that the remarks were in a ``draft press release

NEW YORK: additional $10,000.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THREE KITCHEN SCHEMES
</P>
<P>
   House &AMP; Home asked three design firms to take an 8-by-10 foot
Manhattan galley kitchen and create a replacement kitchen for
$20,000, labor included. Their recipes included a mix of things
expensive (custom-cut walnut, a Garland stove) and modest (those
Ikea glass-fronted cabinets, or the fireproof composite Fireslate
for counters).
</P>
<P>
   PLAN I: PRET-A-PORTER
</P>
<P>
   ``We used off-the-shelf pieces that would require a minimum
amount of craft,'' said Robert Young, who did the design with his
partner, Shea Murdoch, in Murdoch Young Architects. . They were
inspired by industrial kitchens to use two under-the-counter
refrigerators and a freezer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it open to seem larger, and banished any big vertical
space hog, like a full-size refrigerator,'' he said. ``You reach
down and grab what you need,'' just as chefs do, he said. They used
only one closed cabinet. ``You have to be able to deal with putting
things in nice containers. But it's not for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The custom stainless steel counter has a built-in sink and
backsplash; stainless steel shelves are bolted onto painted plywood
panels. The planned appliances, like the Jenn-Air gas range and
dishwasher, Braun hood, Marvel refrigerators and freezer, are also
stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   Closed storage includes, yes, one Ikea glass-fronted cabinet
($148), but also Antonio Citterio's, cobalt blue plastic rolling
carts from Kartell ($800 each), custom-fitted with butcher block
tops.
</P>
<P>
   The rubber tile floor is from Flexco. ``It's easier on your feet
than a ceramic tile floor,'' Young said. Total cost: $19,586.
</P>
<P>
   PLAN II: SEE THROUGH
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Gans and Matt Jelacic, of Gans &AMP; Jelacic Architecture,
designed a glowing kitchen with sliding glass cabinet doors and
glass shelves. ``We wanted the transparency,'' Gans said, ``because
part of making the shoe box kitchen a great space is the quality of
the light, and the cleanliness of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The architects proposed industrial-grade steel brackets and
standards, and laminated glass doors made of two pieces of glass
with plastic film in between. ``You can go from opaque white to
clear just by choosing a different kind of film,'' Gans said. The
sliding doors are hung on a heavy-duty track. Cereal boxes can go
behind opaque doors, and Champagne flutes behind clear.
</P>
<P>
   An open shelf holds the computer, perhaps the kitchen tool of
the 21st century. They also proposed a poetic sheet of glass along
one wall, etched with measurement equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   The stainless steel counters have two holes cut into the top,
for nonrecyclable and recyclable garbage. Elsewhere, inexpensive
($146 each) wire cabinet-carts will roll out on wheels; they have
plywood fronts sprayed with durable auto body paint. ``You can get
a slick, personalized, color-coordinated finish,'' said Gans, who
likes the brilliant color palette of the Volkswagen Bug available
from Heavenly Bodyworks in Chelsea (212-691-1092). The walls and
floor are equally slick, and are made of Pergo, a washable
composite laminate that resembles wood. Total cost: $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   PLAN III: OPTICAL TRICKS
</P>
<P>
   Like Gans and Jelacic, Ronald Bricke, an interior designer,
created a kitchen with glass-fronted cabinets (Ikea again) and an
open shelf for appliances. His design differs, however, in his use
of tiles for texture and scale. For the counters and floor, he used
dusty green glass ceramic tiles 12 inches square, from Trans
Ceramica Ltd. in Pennsauken, N.J. They're ``the color of a dried
bay leaf,'' said Bricke, a great amateur cook. Total cost: $18,031.
</P>
<P>
   The tiles for the backsplash and the back half of the counters
are polished, and the ones in front of the counter are unpolished
to keep water from flowing freely over the edge. On the floor, he
alternated double rows of polished tile with double rows of
unpolished ones, for aesthetic and functional reasons. ``The
stripes give an impression of widening the room,'' Bricke said,
``and although it would be safest if you kept the whole floor
unpolished, the staggered pattern of polished and unpolished is
fairly safe.'' He's tried it on a client, who in three years has
never slipped, ``and still has all her teeth,'' he said.

   Working with natural stone can be a rewarding experience because
a project finished in stone has a rustic charm that is unmatched in
any other building material. Stone is easy to work with because it
requires minimal dressing and shaping, although gathering and
positioning stones calls for a lot of muscle and sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The novice stone builder can acquire the necessary skills for
stone construction by tackling a relatively simple project like
building stone steps up the side of a low hill. Such a project not
only enhances the landscape but it also can be functional if you
have property on two levels.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the first step is to acquire the stone. Where can you
get natural stone? If you have a large piece of property, you may
find that you have enough rocks in your own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Construction sites are another source of free stone. Builders
often collect rocks when they excavate the ground for a foundation.
If you ask the builder, he may give you the stones if you offer to
haul them away.
</P>
<P>
   You can also find stones and rocks in fields and woodlands
around your home. Do not, however, assume that stones are free for
the taking simply because they are lying in a vacant field. The
land belongs to somebody and so do the stones. Always ask
permission before attempting to gather stones from anyone's
property.
</P>
<P>
   Stones are heavy and even a small load can weigh enough to tax
the suspension system of a car; if possible rent a pickup . Before
loading the stones, lay down a sheet of plywood on the truck bed to
protect it from dents and abrasion.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good idea to carry along a pry bar and a shovel to help
you dislodge and uncover stones embedded in the dirt. And, if
possible, bring a wheelbarrow to help you move heavy rocks to the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few hazards involved in gathering stone in the wild.
Be wary when pulling any stone from a hill or a cliff. This could
start a landslide. Be sure of your footing as you move over rugged
terrain so you do not slip or fall. In addition to looking for
rocks, keep a sharp eye out for snakes, wasps and poison ivy.
Finally, enlist the aid of a helper. In addition to helping you
move heavy rocks, he can help you in the event of an accident or
injury.
</P>
<P>
   You can also purchase stone at a commercial stoneyard. Obviously
this costs more than gathering your own pieces, but it's a lot
easier because the dealer does all the heavy work, including
delivery. Even if you can get the bulk of your rocks from a free
source, it is well worth visiting a stone yard to find interesting
and colorful rocks that can highlight your project as a supplement
to those available in local fields.
</P>
<P>
   Once the stone is on site, you can begin construction. Use flat
stones that are at least 24-inches wide for the steps. You can use
two stones together to make the tread, but avoid, if possible,
using three or more stones for one step. This combination can make
the steps uneven and unsteady.
</P>
<P>
   Stone steps need more tread (the measure from the front lip to
the back of the step) than normal steps. Normal steps can have a
9-inch tread, but stone steps should be at least 12 inches from
front to back; 16 inches is even better.
</P>
<P>
   If the stones are too big or if their surfaces are too
irregular, you can dress them with a hammer and chisel. Place the
stone on soft ground and use a cold chisel and hammer _ either a
ball pein (also called a machinist's hammer) or a drilling hammer
(also called a hand sledge) _ to chip away at the lumps and high
spots on the rock surface. Work carefully because natural stone has
veins and cracks that could easily open up and split the rock when
struck with a hammer and chisel.
</P>
<P>
   Start at the bottom of the hill and dig out enough dirt to fit
the first step plus an additional six inches for a gravel bed. The
gravel bed is not essential, but it will provide a solid base for
the stone and a drainage path for ground water. Place the stone so
the front edge is slightly lower than the back. This incline will
allow rainwater to run off the steps.
</P>
<P>
   Once the bottom step is in place, excavate above it for the next
step and gravel bed. This step should overlap the lower one to keep
ground water from under cutting the stones. Use the same technique
to dig back into the slope for the remaining steps. &QL;

In Hove, England, the administration of the Pussycats Club has
complained to local authorities that a licensing regulation
forbidding the touching of lap dancers discriminates against the
blind.
</P>
<P>
   Club director  &UR; Kenneth McGrath &LR;  told the London Telegraph that
when two blind men visited the club as part of a stag party, they
``said they very much enjoyed the dances and sensed highly the
proximity of the dancers and, in particular, enjoyed the smell of
their perfume. Given their disability, they felt controlled
touching ought to be permitted for registered blind persons only
and with the dancers' consent.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said 11 out of his 15 dancers said they would not mind
being touched, under regulated circumstances. A city council member
said the license variation request will be taken under
consideration.

   Art historian  &UR; Rhonda Roland Shearer &LR;  contends that some of the
items presented as ready-made by  &UR; Marcel Duchamp &LR;  _ a hat rack, for
example, or a reproduction of the Mona Lisa with mustache and beard
drawn on _ are actually items created especially for the art.
</P>
<P>
   This is a controversial contention to art historians, reports
Lingua Franca, which sent reporter  &UR; Daniel Berchenko &LR;  to Shearer's
laboratory to check out her research.

<P>
   She owns ``one of the world's largest collections of Duchampian
art and ephemera,'' says the magazine, including works she made
herself, such as ``a replica of Duchamp's urinal constructed
entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups.''
</P>
<P>
   The day Berchenko visited the lab, Shearer and nearly a dozen
researchers ``donned austere white lab coats, huddled around 3-D
models and scrawled equations on chalkboards in an absurdist
performance for this reporter's benefit.''

EDUCATION COLUMN: A REALITY CHECK IS OVERDUE IN PREVENTING DRUG
ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Lessons)  
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Al Gore admits and George W. Bush implies youthful use of
marijuana or worse, should schools adopt a ``do as I say, not as I
do'' drug curriculum, or seek another approach?
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are dangerous, especially for youths whose families, peers
or neighborhoods do not create pressure for responsible choices.
And drugs are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But many successful adults used drugs casually. And
experimentation by adolescents, most of whom still turn out OK,
continues. The 1990s saw teen-age drug use grow while crime by
youths declined.
</P>
<P>
   Effective drug education is needed, but most programs exaggerate
dangers and condemn use so harshly that youths who fail at total
abstinence are not helped. This approach may not work.
</P>
<P>
   Some efforts to reduce teen-age drinking or early sex seem
smarter. Underage drinking is also illegal but colleges and a few
high schools have ``safe ride'' programs with ``no questions
asked.'' It is contradictory to offer trips home from alcoholic
parties while telling teen-agers not to drink, but the mixed
message can save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, health teachers urge sexual abstinence, yet some high
schools also distribute condoms. Delay sex, they say, but if you go
ahead, be safe. When AIDS seems to threaten, consistency is a lower
priority.
</P>
<P>
   But ``just say no'' dominates drug education. A common program
is DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), used in two-thirds of
all districts at a cost of nearly $1 billion. DARE is taught by
police officers, mostly in the fifth and sixth grades. The White
House drug policy director, Barry R. McCaffrey, calls it ``the
premier drug prevention program.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet researchers find it does not work. DARE gets children to
parrot responses about how terrible drugs are, but they then
apparently use drugs at the same rate as non-DARE students. Some
evidence suggests that DARE-trained adolescents use drugs even
more.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry that DARE uses such exaggeration that once
children realize they were misled, they may discount even true
messages. The DARE workbook says marijuana users ``are slow, are
dull, have little ambition.'' But 10-year-olds know of older
siblings, parents, even presidents, who used it without becoming
dull or ambitionless. Children must then choose between DARE and
their own observations. DARE is unlikely to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Other official warnings are also troubling. Advertising
sponsored by McCaffrey's office tells children, if you use
marijuana ``it will kill your mother.'' Official ``tips'' urge
parents to say, ``If you took drugs it would break my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents should think twice before heeding such advice.
</P>
<P>
   Although parents do not want children to try drugs, half of all
teen-agers do. Parents should insist that children have safe places
to go with friends and that they know not to drive when ``high.''
Parents should encourage teen-agers to call home for help. But
threats of parental suicide and heartbreak may lead to secret
experimentation in risky settings or with friends that parents
neither know nor approve.
</P>
<P>
   Official policy is puzzling because ``just say no'' has a long
history of failure. Before Prohibition, schools exaggerated
alcohol's dangers. A widely used textbook said that in adult beer
drinkers, ``a slight cold brings on a fatal pneumonia.'' Children
who saw parents drink beer and survive colds then ignored other
temperance messages.
</P>
<P>
   A 1930s Bureau of Narcotics campaign warned that marijuana would
cause teen-agers to commit vicious crimes. The bureau promoted a
1936 commercial film, ``Tell Your Children,'' warning that
marijuana caused teen-agers to rape, murder and commit suicide. The
film's claims were so excessive that it was later rereleased as a
satire and shown widely on college campuses, now titled ``Reefer
Madness.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1963 presidential commission also claimed that drug use would
``destroy'' teen-agers. But drug use has continued.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, found no evidence that ``just say no'' teaching was more
effective in reducing drug use than programs that recognized
teen-age behavior but tried to limit it. Neither Congress nor the
executive branch paid heed.
</P>
<P>
   Some curriculums may be more effective than DARE. Teachers can
give realistic information about the harm drugs do, and integrate
health with other lessons. But no programs have yet navigated the
problem of how to counsel against drugs while also supporting
youths who ignore the advice.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ross Anderson of Salt Lake City recently prohibited his
police force from taking part in DARE work. Schools should not
``moralize and exaggerate, but provide students with the basis for
making decisions to avoid drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also wants to emphasize harm reduction. ``Now,'' he
said of the current approach, ``if there is any drug involvement,
you are suspended or expelled. But if school administrators
discover a problem, they ought to work with parents and students in
a nonpunitive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City is not the only city to reconsider DARE. But in
most places, this ineffective and costly program still holds sway.

`THE GOLDEN AGE': THE WASHINGTON CROWD, GRAYING NOW, IS REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-three years after he began his series of interlocking
historical novels with ``Washington, D.C.,'' Gore Vidal has done
something curious: revisited the characters and events of that
first installment with a perspective now altered by age and time.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Golden Age,'' the seventh and concluding installment
(the others are ``Burr,'' ``Lincoln,'' ``1976,'' ``Empire'' and
``Hollywood''), Vidal returns to World War II and the McCarthy era.
He reimagines the ambitions and schemes of the same fictitious
people. And he veers so close to the narrative of ``Washington,
D.C.'' that both books even conclude with the same valedictory
passage, one that equates the fall of a republic or the rise of an
empire with the activities of bacteria on a microscope's slide.
</P>
<P>
   That's nice, but Vidal isn't actually one for false modesty,
national or otherwise. In a postscript, he maintains that he was
right about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings in ``Burr'' and that
he's right about Franklin D. Roosevelt's complicity in the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, along with the advent of the nuclear age, the Truman
Doctrine, the military-industrial complex, rampant anti-communism
and the Korean War, is one of the main historical matters to be
dissected _ and gossiped and speculated about _ here.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal's emphasis has changed, to the point where the fictional
characters who made a sharp-clawed story out of ``Washington,
D.C.'' have receded to the background. After all, they're older
now, and the author has already put most of them through the
wringer. Unfortunately, a forest of loose ends still dangle from
their past histories, and the most recent book, ``Hollywood'' (set
in the 1920s), is 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   So there is much page-clogging explaining to be done, along the
order of ``While Frederika dozed, Blaise went into the men's
section of the pool house, where Peter had observed his sister,
Enid, being made love to by Clay Overbury, now her husband, as well
as aide to Senator James Burden Day, whose daughter, Diana, was
becoming, more and more, the center of Peter's daydreams.''
</P>
<P>
   As Burr himself might have said to Jefferson (in a series where
ascribing made-up dialogue to real historical figures is standard
practice), ``Whew.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vidal's interest this time is less concentrated on his
characters' private vicissitudes. Like Orson Welles, who of course
turns up in a heavily name-dropping story that begins in 1939, he
is interested in deep focus.
</P>
<P>
   So the series' familiar figures, like the aging former actress,
newspaper publisher and illegitimate Burr descendant Caroline
Sanford Sanford (see a previous volume to learn why she married her
cousin), are integrated into an ambitious historical tableau.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, that means that Caroline is a house guest at
the White House while Franklin D. Roosevelt charts his course
around America's isolationists, and that another character is on
hand to watch H.L. Mencken, Walter Lippman, Joseph Alsop, Drew
Pearson and Walter Winchell cover the 1940 Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The nominee, Wendell Willkie, is also acquainted with Vidal's
fictitious characters and is enthusiastically analyzed by one and
all.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, ``The Golden Age'' spans the same period
(1939-54) that is captured far more zestily by another current
cameo-filled novel, Michael Chabon's ``Amazing Adventures of
Kavalier &AMP; Clay.''
</P>
<P>
   Both authors bring on assorted famous faces and signs of the
times, but Vidal's don't often escape the confines of a literary
puppet show. Politicians walk into the story, unburden themselves
of speechy position-paper dialogue or elaborate
self-justifications, and then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Even though, as Vidal points out in his postscript, he actually
knew many of the people he writes about, the book's politicians
sound like refugees from a different kind of dissertation on
midcentury American history.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural figures come alive more successfully, especially those
to whom Vidal can comfortably ascribe intimate banter. And even
Parker Tyler, the scarily intense film critic who loomed large in
the author's ``Myra Breckinridge,'' shows up.
</P>
<P>
   Through Peter Sanford, an observer and writer who is Vidal's
contemporary, the book gets a glimpse of Marlon Brando in ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' (two of Peter's friends find the play ``a
total realignment of the sexes''), meets the divine Dawn Powell
(who bristles at Hemingway's inflated reputation) and hears Paul
Bowles' catty assessment of Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new world, isn't it?'' says Peter, acknowledging the
creative homosexual culture that Vidal evokes with affection. ``Or
the old world,'' a friend tells him, ``better understood.''
</P>
<P>
   It should surprise no one that the tangential figure who is most
memorably summoned here is Vidal himself, in the midst of enjoying
a golden age of his own. The book postulates that the years between
1945 and 1950 were a hurricane's eye of promise and peacetime
between World War II and the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   They were also the years in which the author made his auspicious
arrival on the literary scene with ``Williwaw'' (1946) and
especially ``The City and the Pillar'' (1948), and he glides into
the proceedings with winking assurance. ``My mother insists that
Gore writes just like Shakespeare,'' says one character at a party.
And with this, ``Vidal shook his head sadly. `I could never manage
those rhyming couplets at the end of scenes.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a surprisingly deft and eloquent grace note to this true
magnum opus, Vidal suddenly fades forward to the millennium,
gliding past the success of his currently revived 1960 play ``The
Best Man'' and away to his home in Ravello, Italy, in a condition
that he characterizes as ``ancient.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes over the role of first-person narrator, holds forth on
such present-day forces of historical change as the Internet, and
otherwise contemplates a world of change. He settles some last
scores and offers a final assessment of Roosevelt's shrewdness: ``I
admired him quite as much as I deplored him.'' And he engages in a
conversation with Peter, who refers to this novel's version of
Truman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You made him up,'' says Peter. ``Then you made me up, too. How
does it feel to play god?'' This much is clear at the end of
Vidal's huge, defining seven-book undertaking: He knows the answer.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The publisher of the Loeb Classical Library,
the very proper series of Greek and Roman literature for
English-speaking readers, has been gradually putting back the
naughty bits it had been editing out of the books.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it no longer tiptoes around Plato's writings on
homoerotic love or cleans up Aristophanes' bathroom humor. But the
most recent translations are so faithful to the original ribald
words of their authors that some of them would make the Farrelly
brothers blush.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University Press here is the current caretaker and
publisher of the Loeb Classical Library, which now contains about
500 texts. When James Loeb, an American banker, financed the
publication of a classical literature series in 1910, he envisioned
an ``everyman'' version of the classics, with the Greek or Latin
text on one page and the English translation opposite. His vision
was also G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   The British and American translators he retained kept with the
manners of their age, replacing vulgarities and obscenities with
euphemisms or just omitting lines and scenes all together. Some
plays, like Aristophanes' ``Assembly Women,'' were so rife with
off-color jokes that major sections were untranslatable.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the great authors who inspired the Renaissance were
anything but prissy. ``But James Loeb himself, as a 19th-century
man and a promoter of the classics, had no intention of
disillusioning anyone,'' explained Jeffrey Henderson, who became
editor of the Loeb last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the books made mention of the ``coarse sense'' of a
word in footnotes, or translated the offending passages into
equally cryptic Latin (from Greek) or Italian (from Latin), which
was supposedly a bawdy language anyway. Benjamin Bickley Rogers
even apologized for his misleading doublespeak. Confronted with a
sexually explicit 22-line epic metaphor in Aristophanes' ``Peace,''
he did the verbal equivalent of throwing up his hands, writing in a
footnote: ``I have purposely confined my translation (if the vague
paraphrase I offer be worthy of the name).''
</P>
<P>
   As things loosened in the 1960s, the Loeb began updating its
collection. George P. Goold, an Englishman who became editor in
1973, was determined to use more accurate language, as with this
old passage from Catullus: ``Tis you I fear, you and your passions,
so fatal to the young, both good and bad alike.'' In Goold's
translation, it became: ``Tis you I fear, you and your penis, so
ready to molest good boys and bad alike.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a risque Roman like Catullus seems tame compared with
the Loeb's latest endeavor: A new translation of Aristophanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aristophanes is the worst,'' said Henderson, who translated
the two volumes of Aristophanes the Loeb reissued in 1998, and
another due out next month. The playwright used slang for all
manner of body parts and bodily functions.
</P>
<P>
   In Rogers' old translation, a passage reads: ``Now girls, now
girls, keep close to me: Our youngsters I know well are sore all
over for the love of you.'' Henderson translated the same line:
``This way, girls, follow me, and quickly; a great many horny men
await you.'' Where the Greek text calls for a vulgarity, Henderson
complies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four-letter Greek words, and we know what they
are,'' he said. ``The tone of them is very well documented.''
</P>
<P>
   Removing the offending language not only waters down the meaning
of the play, he argues, it drowns it. It would be akin to dubbing
vulgar language in ``Blue Velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a particular kind of comedy that was meant to be
transgressive,'' Henderson said. ``It was put on at a festival for
the wine god Dionysus. The characters wore outrageous costumes and
had big leather phalluses. The point of the comedy was to shake
people up. To expose what was normally hidden, to make fun of it,
to take the important people down a peg or two and speak up for the
ordinary man.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For years college professors have shared the earthiness of these
writers with their students, or at least challenged them to learn
their Latin and Greek and figure it out for themselves. More
precise English translations have been around for a while from
other publishers, and the less-squeamish French were doing accurate
translations as early as the 1920s. But the tidy Loeb volumes were
the last bastion of Anglo-American restraint, and their conversion
represents how the definition of what is mainstream has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great relief because the previous translations have
been so delicate about those things that they are really
confusing,' said Emily Katz Anhalt, who teaches classics at Trinity
College and gave last year's ``Greek Elegiac Poetry'' and ``Greek
Iambic Poetry'' a favorable critique in the Bryn Mawr Classical
Review. ``Most people don't read this material in the original
Greek, so they are getting a skewed version.''
</P>
<P>
   She points out that in the 1931 edition of ``Elegiac Poetry,'' a
man is told ``All the young are concerned for your beauty.'' In the
new version, the line becomes ``All the young men are obsessed with
your looks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for society to recognize that some of the norms
that we take as given in terms of civilized behavior are a bit
arbitrary,'' Anhalt added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plato was a great espouser of homoerotic love,'' Henderson
said. ``When he talks about men being in `love' or `lovers,' you
shouldn't translate it as `close friends _ wink, wink.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the ancients were so explicit, but even their texts
became silly in the hands of Victorian-era translators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would take a perfectly harmless text like Homer and they
would turn it into nearly incomprehensible English, because that to
them represented high-style epic,'' said Richard P. Martin, a
professor of classics at Stanford University. Trained on Milton and
Spenser, the translators used an abundance of ``ye's'' and verbs
ending in ``-eth'' that made the flowery texts read like Gilbert
and Sullivan librettos.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the know used to trade snickering jokes about the
particularly obvious gloss-overs, Martin said. ``It's one of those
little games that classicists play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new translations have helped change the Loeb's reputation
for unscholarly translations, unsuitable for classroom use
(although plenty of undergraduates used them as clandestine study
aids). It has reissued about four books a year for the last decade,
and most large bookstores carry some of them.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has heard no complaints from offended readers,
although he does receive e-mail asking, ``Is this stuff really in
there?''

TEXAS BAPTISTS MAY STRIP NATIONAL FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARY McMULLEN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ In the first blow of what could become a new
round of discord in the Southern Baptist Convention, the executive
board of the Baptist General Convention of Texas has voted to strip
Southern Baptist seminaries and agencies of $5.3 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts are contained in a proposed budget for 2001 that must
be ratified at the state convention's annual meeting Oct. 30-31.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas board left intact more than $17 million in funding for
two Southern Baptist missions agencies, but Tuesday's vote would
eliminate funding the convention's moral-concerns agency, end
funding of five of the convention's six seminaries and give only
token support to the convention's administrative arm, the executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Martin, a spokesman for the Baptist General Convention of
Texas, said the board approved the cuts because Texas Baptists are
unhappy with the theological direction of the Southern Baptist
Convention and are concerned that Southern Baptist leaders were not
allowing other views to be heard, especially in seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a continuing dissent on the part of Texas
Baptists. We have not moved. We're still traditional Baptists,''
Martin said. ``It's the SBC that's moved _ they've moved away from
us.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one observer says the action could portend a split in
the country's largest Protestant church, which claims 15.8 million
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a state convention that's denominationalizing itself.
It's potentially the ninth largest denomination in the nation,''
said Bill Leonard, dean of the divinity school at Wake Forest
University in Winston-Salem, N.C., and a Baptist historian.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist General Convention of Texas is the largest of the
state conventions affiliated with the Southern Baptists, claiming
about 2.8 million members and 5,000 churches. It contributed $22
million to the Southern Baptist Convention in 1999, more than any
other state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist leaders denounced the proposed cuts as an
effort by out-of-touch Texas Baptist leaders to create their own
denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Land, president of the ethics and religious
liberty commission, the SBC's moral-concerns agency, said the board
is composed of Texas leaders who lost out in the denomination's
internal struggles 15 to 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their festering discontent is beginning to take organizational
form,'' he said. ``They're trying to build their own kingdom. We'll
see if they can persuade a majority of Baptist churches to go along
with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paige Patterson, president of Southeastern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C. and past president of the
Southern Baptist Convention, said if the budget is ratified, the
Baptist General Convention of Texas would lose a number of large
and influential churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a revolting development,'' Patterson said. ``The only
thing that surprises me is that they have misread their own
churches. If they believe that 5,000 churches are going to go along
with them, they're badly mistaken. They're going to find out these
churches consider themselves Southern Baptists first and Texas
Baptists second.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and Land _ both native Texans _ expressed confidence
rank-and-file congregations in Texas would make up any shortfall by
giving funds directly to the national headquarters, bypassing the
state convention, which retains 67 percent of contributions from
local churches.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended cuts range from $345,000 for the ethics and
religious liberty commission to almost $1 million for the Southern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky. Southwestern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth would still receive
about $875,000 from the state convention, but that is almost half
the $1.5 million the Texas group budgeted for the school this year.
The schools and agencies face losses in operating revenue ranging
from 6 to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas executive board recommended reallocating the money to
``Texas missions priorities.'' The $4.3 million diverted from
seminaries would go instead to three theological schools run by the
Baptist General Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While the action by the Texas executive board was not a
surprise, both sides agree that it represents a new eruption of a
20-year-old battle in the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Theological conservatives took control of the convention and its
agencies in the mid-1980s, claiming that biblical authority was
being undermined in Southern Baptist seminaries due to modern
methods of historical research. Opponents, generally identified as
``moderates,'' argued that conservatives' insistence on biblical
inerrancy robbed individuals of the traditional Baptist principle
of freedom to interpret the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Baptists have distanced themselves from the national
convention in recent years. After the disputes of the 1980s, the
state convention voted to reduce the funds it forwarded from
congregations to the Southern Baptist Convention. And last November
the Texas convention rejected an amendment to the Baptist Faith and
Message, a statement of beliefs, that stated in part ``a wife is to
submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Texas Baptists feuded with national leaders over
questions of doctrine and whether those doctrines should be
enforced in the agencies and organizations of the Southern
Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   At the Southern Baptist Convention's annual meeting in June in
Orlando, the convention approved revisions to the Baptist Faith and
Message. Several Texas Baptists argued against the revisions,
saying they made the statement inflexible and similar to a creed,
something Baptists have traditionally rejected.
</P>
<P>
   While not binding on individuals or local churches, the Baptist
Faith and Message has been used by Southern Baptist seminaries and
agencies as a loyalty test and a condition of employment. A study
committee formed last year by the Baptist General Convention of
Texas reported Sept. 13 that faculty members at one seminary were
prohibited from criticizing the statement, even in private.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, of Wake Forest Divinity School, said theology may have
been the cause of the crisis 20 years ago but has become secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about liberal theology,'' he said. ``There are
pretty conservative churches in Texas. It's about how theology is
enforced. The revisions to the Baptist Faith and Message looked
like enforced theology. Texans have this independent streak, and
they've resisted this for 20 years.'' Leonard noted that another
state convention, the Baptist General Association of Virginia, took
a similar action to the one proposed in Texas several years ago,
but less money was less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is under huge stress. It's still intact, but every
year it's a little less intact,'' he said. ``This is not to say the
Southern Baptist Convention is going to disappear, but it's
increasingly more a clearinghouse than the tightly connected
convention it once was.''

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS FAIL TO ADVANCE RESIDENCY BILL FOR IMMIGRANTS
 &HT;    260&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a vote along party lines, the Senate on
Wednesday rejected Democratic efforts to consider allowing more
undocumented Central American and Haitian immigrants to apply for
legal residency.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-43 vote came on a motion by Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., to let the Senate attach the Latino and Immigrant Fairness
Act as part of a bill to expand the number of H-1B visas for
foreign workers with high-tech skills.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would allow undocumented immigrants who arrived in
the United States between 1972 and 1985 to apply for permanent
residency status. It also would grant refugees from Haiti,
Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras the same rights as Cuban and
Nicaraguan refugees in applying for permanent residency status.
</P>
<P>
   A third provision would have allowed immigrants living with
their families in the United States to remain in this country while
awaiting a decision on their residency status.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, with support from President Clinton, have vowed to
try adding the measure to other legislation, such as a pending
appropriations bill to finance the Commerce, Justice and State
departments, beginning next week.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech industry, which strongly backs the popular bill to
create tens of thousands of new H-1B visa slots, did not want the
bill to include the controversial amendment on undocumented
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had earlier used his
leadership powers to keep the Fairness Act separate from the visa
bill, and Daschle failed Wednesday to get the Senate to overrule
that move.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., crossed party lines on the vote.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   On another immigration-related matter, a group of Democratic
senators introduced a bill Wednesday that would allow legal
immigrants convicted of minor crimes to avoid mandatory
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would overturn provisions of the 1996
Immigration Act that require mandatory deportation of any legal
immigrant convicted of a crime that carried a potential sentence of
one-year or more, even if the person never spent a day in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Under that law, ``homicide and bouncing a check are
indistinguishable,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., the bill's
primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called the 1996 law ``a major
blot on the American legal system'' and noted that judges do not
have any discretion to avoid deportation of legal residents who may
have committed very minor crimes decades ago and have since turned
their lives around and married American citizens and have
American-born children.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he hoped to attach the legislation to other
immigration-related measures pending in the Senate. The House has
passed a more restrictive version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would restore the legal situation for
deportation based on prior criminal activity to the way it existed
prior to enactment of the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   Persons would be liable for deportation only if that was a
penalty at the time the crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would allow those people who already have been
deported to apply for re-admission to the United States.

U.S. CONCEDES ON U.N. POLICY TOWARD IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a concession to nations seeking to soften
restrictions on Iraq, the Clinton administration agreed on
Wednesday to reduce the amount of money being set aside to
compensate victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In return,
Russia and France will allow a disputed reparations claim of $15.9
billion to be paid to the Kuwait Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus agreement, to go into effect in December, is to be
announced on Thursday at a meeting of the Iraq compensation
commission. The deal allows Washington to avoid a showdown vote in
the commission that would further divide the Security Council's
permanent members, with the United States and Britain on one side
and France, Russia and possibly China on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi compensation commission has the same membership as the
15-nation Security Council, where the United States has lost broad
support for its overall Iraq policy and is now seeing it being
whittled away on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.N. officials and diplomats in Geneva, where the
commission is based, say that the United States had the votes to
win the battle on the Kuwait claim, as U.S. diplomats were
predicting it would. But both sides decided to go for a political
compromise instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were willing to go to a vote if we had to,'' said James B.
Cunningham, deputy chief representative of the United States here
and the envoy who handles the Iraq issue in the Security Council.
``But this is one of the remaining processes that works well that
was set up under the sanctions and compensation regime. Going to a
vote after a long period of taking decisions by consensus would in
a way open up the process to a spirit of contention that hasn't
existed up until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Decisions in the commission have been made by experts in
international law, Cunningham said in an interview, adding that the
panel ``should just get on doing its work without dragging in the
political differences that we know we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the oil-sales program went into effect in 1996, 30 percent
of the money Iraq makes from its supervised exports has been
earmarked for reparations, and more than $8 billion has been paid
in claims. Under the agreement Wednesday, the money set aside will
be reduced to 25 percent in December, when a new phase of the oil
for food program begins. The level will be reviewed again in six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1995 Iraq rejected the oil-sales plan, and the only money
available for reparations was in Iraqi funds frozen abroad, most of
them inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   Because of high oil prices and the removal last year of all
restrictions on how much oil Iraq can sell, there is now much more
money available to the fund. Coincidentally the compensation
commission, having disposed of many smaller claims, is now dealing
with the largest ones, among them those from oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France had objected to the payment of large claims to
Kuwait while Iraqi civilians were still suffering the effects of
sanctions. Under the agreement on Wednesday, money saved from the
reduction in the compensation commission's share will be funneled
into relief or rehabilitation projects for Iraq, a U.S. diplomat
said. The specific nature of the projects is still to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was struck just as more nations were preparing to send
flights to Baghdad in contravention of a longstanding air embargo
on Iraq. Jordan on Wednesday became the first Arab country in more
than a decade to send a passenger airliner to Baghdad's newly
reopened airport. Iceland has approved a flight, and France and
Russia plan to send more planes after initial flights over the last
two weeks. India is also thinking of joining the movement to force
open the skies over Iraq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For most of these flights, including the one from Jordan,
governments have followed the rules and notified the Security
Council, saying that the intention is to deliver relief goods,
which are permitted to enter Iraq with council approval. But the
notification process has been reduced to something of a fiction in
recent days, with multiple flights carrying avowedly antisanctions
delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats here seem to accept the end of the air embargo,
which until this month had always been honored, though frequently
disputed because of differing readings of the legalistic language
governing it.
</P>
<P>
   But this acceptance is not to U.S. liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about this, and we've been very vocal
about it,'' Cunningham said on Wednesday. ``We think this is a very
unfortunate development and it's not in keeping with the
resolution, and we'll have to go back and try to re-establish some
degree of coherence in how we go about implementing the
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, with only four months to go in
office, is fighting to salvage its Iraqi policy here with Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, absent from
the fray. Other council members say that Holbrooke may not want to
associate himself with a policy that was inflexible and may be
doomed in the face of worldwide criticism because of its effects on
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has said repeatedly that he has other crucial jobs to
do, first among them to win agreement for a reduction in U.S. dues
to the United Nations. In Washington, administration officials,
including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, say Iraq's
leaders, not sanctions, are largely to blame for Iraqi suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on air travel, one of a host of restrictions imposed on
Iraq, was a major irritant for Iraqi officials, who had to travel
in and out of the country overland through Jordan. U.N. officials
and diplomats also had to make the daylong desert trek from Amman
to Baghdad and back. Rare exceptions were made by the Security
Council for U.N. arms inspectors, who could fly in from Bahrain,
and for Secretary-General Kofi Annan, when he flew to Baghdad on a
plane belonging to the president of France in February 1998.

COURT ORDERS REVIEW OF DECISION IN SALE OF GUCCI 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Reviving a battle between two of Europe's biggest
luxury-goods groups that had seemed resolved, a Dutch court on
Wednesday ordered a review of a decision last year that had allowed
the sale of a $3 billion controlling stake in Gucci Group to
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute of France.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci, which is based in the Netherlands for tax reasons, but
operates out of Italy, had agreed to the deal with Pinault to
thwart a hostile bid by the luxury-goods maker LVMH-Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton, which had earlier acquired a sizable stake in Gucci.
The decision last year diluted the LVMH stake to about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision last year, a lower Dutch court criticized
Gucci's management for its handling of the battle against LVMH,
controlled by the French billionaire Bernard Arnault, but refused
to stop the deal with Pinault or to order an investigation of
Gucci's management procedures, as LVMH had demanded.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH had protested that Gucci's deal with Pinault diluted LVMH's
share in Gucci and denied it a seat on the Gucci board, something
LVMH had sought. By contrast, Pinault secured the right to nominate
four of Gucci's nine board members.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision opened the door for LVMH to refile its case
against Gucci and Pinault, which is controlled by Arnault's
archrival, the French billionaire Francois Pinault.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, LVMH said it would seek a full court
investigation of Gucci's handling of the LVMH bid, the annulment of
the deal with Pinault, and ``appropriate measures to remedy the
harm caused by the improper conduct of Gucci's management.'' But
the possibility of appeals and counterappeals made any early
solution to the smoldering conflict unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish with LVMH, which pits two of France's richest and
most powerful businessmen against each other, has cost Gucci's
management time and money. Still, the decision Wednesday nudged
Gucci's share price up 3 percent, to 117.70 euros, on speculation
that Gucci, already a darling of investors, might again have its
share price driven up as the target in a revived bidding war
between LVMH and Pinault.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in LVMH, which has already amassed about 1 billion euros,
or $880 million, in capital gains from the appreciation of its
Gucci shares, rose by more than 2 percent, to 85 euros. Shares in
Pinault, which controls one of France's biggest department-store
chains, fell almost 3 percent, to 198 euros.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH has always insisted it would do nothing to harass Gucci, so
as not to jeopardize the value of its Gucci stake. Yet LVMH has
three other legal challenges pending in the Netherlands, one
demanding annulment of the Pinault deal and another seeking damages
or a court order requiring that Pinault bid for all Gucci shares. A
third case seeks the annulment of decisions taken at a Gucci
shareholder meeting last year approving the Pinault deal.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH, in its statement, said that if fresh hearings led to a
cancellation of the Pinault deal, it would seek a solution ``in the
interest of all shareholders that would enable Gucci to continue to
execute its strategy, while remaining entirely independent.'' It
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Weinberg, Pinault's chief executive, said that nothing in
Wednesday's decision ``posed an obstacle to the pursuit of the
development of the Gucci group.'' He added, ``We are extremely
confident.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TESTAVERDE AND GROH HAVE SCORE TO SETTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (On Pro Football)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It should come as no surprise that New York Jets
quarterback Vinny Testaverde rather uncharacteristically spoke out
about his benching by coach Al Groh in the game against the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers. Because for months now, rather quietly, the
relationship between the two men has become quite chilly.
</P>
<P>
   Groh and Testaverde did not hit it off right from the beginning,
said several Jets players, and they have grown further apart.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons has nothing to do with Groh. Testaverde was
close to Bill Parcells and remains so. Testaverde always respected
how Parcells treated veteran players by not abusing their bodies
with tough, physical practices.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where the tensions between Groh and Testaverde have
their origin, said players. Groh's training camp practices were
brutal, and Testaverde went to Groh early in the summer, suggesting
that he ease up. The practices remained extremely physical.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, some players went to Parcells to
complain about Groh's practices. Parcells stayed out of the
dispute, players said, because Parcells felt it would be unfair to
Groh to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is among the veterans who believe Groh was running
difficult practices so he could establish himself as a tough coach,
several Jets said. Perhaps Groh was trying to grab the attention of
the players away from Parcells, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Groh's intentions, those harsh training camps seem to
be paying off. The Jets have been a tremendous fourth-quarter team
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, who has struggled early in games this season, ranks
second in the National Football League with a 122.7 rating in the
fourth quarter. The Jets' late comeback against the Buccaneers on
Sunday marked only the second time in 30 years that a team has won
a game after trailing by at least 10 points with less than two
minutes remaining. John Elway and the Denver Broncos did it against
the Kansas City Chiefs in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ignoring players can be dangerous. When Dick
Vermeil coached the St. Louis Rams, some veteran players complained
about harsh practices. Vermeil changed his ways, and in doing so
unified the team.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jets are 4-0 and have completed only a quarter of
their regular-season schedule, Testaverde has already been taking
heat from the fans and the news media for his overall play, which
has been poor at times.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off an Achilles' tendon injury and the departure of
Keyshawn Johnson, a top wide receiver, Testaverde has a 49.7
completion percentage and a dismal 64.7 quarterback rating.
</P>
<P>
   What irks Testaverde is that he believes he is getting the blame
for much of the Jets' offensive woes when some of the problems are
not his fault, Jets players said. Testaverde also wishes that Groh
would publicly back him.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Testaverde said of his one-series benching: ``I just
kept saying to myself, he's making a big mistake taking me out.
Because I really believe the fourth quarter belongs to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Jets said that sometimes the coaching staff had made
mistakes by putting the wrong personnel on the field in certain
situations. Wide receivers have sometimes run the wrong routes. But
most of the blame for the offense's struggles goes to Testaverde.
The quarterback believes he is being hung out to dry by Groh, the
players said, when Groh could make it clear that Testaverde is
often not to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The players said, for example, that wide receivers had run poor
routes several times in the Tampa Bay game. But most fans would not
know that the receivers were to blame when Testaverde lofted an
errant pass. They would assume that the bad pass was the
quarterback's fault.
</P>
<P>
   When he played for six years in Tampa Bay at the beginning of
his professional career, Testaverde thought he was often blamed for
mistakes that were not his doing. He did not discuss this in
public. But he intends to make his feelings known now, several Jets
said, which explains why he spoke up after Groh benched him for a
series against the Buccaneers. Make no mistake about it: Testaverde
wanted to do well in front of the Buccaneers fans, in a stadium
where he had often been booed.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's main beef with Groh? Testaverde wants everyone to
be accountable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Groh wanted to trade wide receiver Johnson
was that Groh feared the kind of public display that Testaverde put
on this week. But if what Jets players say is true, then Testaverde
has a right to be upset.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed now is one of those smart-mouthed Parcells
tirades. There were times when reporters would ask Parcells
questions about a struggling player, and Parcells would get nasty
with the reporters in support of the player. Those eruptions were
sometimes contrived, but they worked, because the player felt
Parcells was backing him up in public.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between Groh and Testaverde do not seem to have
reached a critical point. There will likely be a meeting between
the two men soon to work out their differences. If the team keeps
winning, Testaverde's remarks will be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a reconciliation is needed. The Jets are 4-0 for the
first time in their history. The Jets have a bye this week, and
after they play Pittsburgh next week, they will probably be 5-0.
Things are going too well for Testaverde and Groh not to patch up
their differences. They need each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get some things resolved,'' Testaverde said this
week of the entire team. ``I'd like to share some of these things
with you, but it's probably better that I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Just share them with the man who matters: the head coach. &QL;

TAKING A HIP-HOP ROUTE TO TEACHING A LOVE OF LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NINA SIEGAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A green and white circus tent at the edge of a country pond was
pulsing with a bass beat last week, as Toni Blackman and FreeStyle
Union, a group of rap artists, weaved back and forth on stage,
microphones pressed to their lips.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman asked the audience of high school students and teachers
to provide her with themes for the group's next impromptu rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowling,'' yelled one teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirituality,'' shouted another.
</P>
<P>
   The D.J. cranked an insistent funk beat, and the rappers began
rhyming, telling a story of a young woman searching for her soul in
all the wrong places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Sally from the Valley at the bowling alley,'' began
Ghost, another rapper in FreeStyle Union, waving a hand along with
the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman continued, ``She got baptized, got lost, got water in
her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance was not part of a rap show, but was the
highlight of a conference promoting the use of hip-hop culture in
the classroom that took place at the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry
Festival last week at Waterloo Village in Stanhope, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman's group demonstrated several ways to improvise rhymes,
or freestyle _ by telling a story, solving a riddle or arguing
opposing points _ to music. But the underlying goal is to get
students in touch with impromptu expression and thereby encourage
them to read, write and think more deeply about language. Judging
from the audience response under the tent, that approach is wildly
popular among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way that some teachers in the 1960s used the
lyrics of popular folk musicians like Joan Baez and Bob Dylan to
interest students in lyricism and rhyme schemes, many English
teachers today are embracing rap lyrics as a means of drawing
students into poetry and literature and connecting to them in a way
that traditional poetry might not at first.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, teachers at the conference said, many schools
shunned rap, because of its reputation for crude language, its
derogatory messages about women and its association with violence.
But as hip-hop has become more ingrained in popular culture, and as
educators have put a greater emphasis on the positive aspects of
rap _ like its wordplay, rhyme schemes and focus on contemporary
social issues _ using rap music to teach classical poetry has
become an increasingly familiar strategy in the classroom, poets
and teachers at the conference said. (There are no statistics that
track the prevalence of such programs in schools.)
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kunitz, 95, the nation's newly appointed poet laureate
and a featured speaker at the Dodge Festival, which drew 15,000
people, said he embraced the use of rap in the classroom because it
helped excite young people about language and the creative act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rap is part of that spoken tradition,'' he said, ``and
representative of the spontaneity of invention, and is associated
with the broad base of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, rap is not an end in itself. ``I think the
important aspect of introducing any populist speech pattern is to
link it with other manifestations,'' he said, ``such as nursery
rhymes and even popular songs and other forms of speech that have a
different kind of energy from utilitarian speech.''
</P>
<P>
   And he cautioned that using rap in the classroom could be
``dangerous territory,'' because of the crude or violent nature of
some of its lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman, 30, a bright-eyed singer with a smoky voice, and other
members of FreeStyle Union, based in Brooklyn, N.Y., regularly
travel to schools across New York, Washington and South Africa,
conducting workshops for teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   She said they were often invited by teachers, particularly older
teachers, who believe they have lost touch with their students and
are eager to find a way to excite them about the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's giving the kids another way of thinking about writing and
literacy,'' Blackman said. ``In order to improvise well and
freestyle well, you have to have vocabulary, you have to have a
knowledge base to draw upon. So, it's a back-door way of getting
kids excited about language.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tony Medina, a professor of English at Long Island University's
Brooklyn campus, and the author of the book of poetry ``Sermons
From the Smell of a Carcass Condemned to Begging'' (Long Shot
Productions, 1998), said he recently used lyrics from a song by
Nas, a popular rap artist, during a poetry workshop in a high
school classroom in New York. The song is written from the
perspective of a gun being used to commit a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   After reading Nas' lyrics, Medina asked his students to write
their own poems, drawing on their experiences, but looking at them
from an atypical perspective. For example, if a student wanted to
write about police brutality, Medina might suggest writing it from
the officer's vantage point. He said that after students were able
to look at their own lives through the prism of the poetic craft,
they would consider poetry from different time periods, or
different countries, more sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can introduce rap to them and then go to poets who come
from their background, like poets who come from the 'hood,'' Medina
said. ``Then they say, `Wow, the stuff that comes from our
background really matters,' and that appeals to them. From there,
you will open the kids up to Robert Frost or Shakespeare or Emily
Dickinson.''
</P>
<P>
   But many educators and school administrators are still wary of
rap in the classroom. Medina and Blackman said they were sometimes
criticized for allowing students to read crude language or use it,
or for studying politically controversial material. Medina said he
was not afraid of allowing students to read crass words, though he
pushes them to explore more sophisticated language in their own
work. Blackman does not allow cursing or derogatory terms in her
freestyling workshops.
</P>
<P>
   Others are skeptical about rap's value as a teaching tool.
Robert Pinsky, whom Kunitz is succeeding as poet laureate, said
using rap to get students interested in poetry might be ``a valid
way to start.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, it may lead students off on the wrong tangent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, it's starting from show biz and mass culture,''
he said. ``The most important thing about poetry is that it is not
mass culture, and the medium of poetry is the opposite of a mass
medium. It is anyone who says the poem aloud. The idea is that
words sound excellent no matter who speaks them, even if it's not
Sir John Gielgud, not a rapper, not a performer by nature.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also concerned that using popular culture to draw students
to poetry may be a form of pandering to the lowest common
denominator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be too bad to underestimate students, or to assume
that they are only capable of understanding things that mass
culture has already trained them to appreciate,'' Pinsky said.
``Kids like lots of different things, and you can't predict what
kids are going to like based on their age or ethnicity or anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   After her performance, Blackman asked audience members to give
free-styling a shot. Four young men, two black and two white, took
the microphones and wowed the crowd with off-the-cuff rapping.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Joe Freeman, an 18-year-old senior at the
Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia, elicited rousing
applause from the audience with an impromptu rhyme about homework.
Although he said he appreciated contemporary poets like Mark Doty
and Saul Williams, and writes verse on paper, he said he also
valued what rapping teaches him about self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an obvious difference between classical poetry and
hip-hop, because rap is about the streets and about yourself,
whereas classical poetry is about being beautiful, and looking at
things from a different angle,'' Freeman said. ``I don't feel like
it's about the person's life, but hip-hop and rap is. It's a
message right in your face; you can't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students who attended Blackman's workshop said they were
disappointed that their schools had not embraced contemporary
musical styles to help them think about self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't let us express our feelings or introduce it in a
way that would make it more fun for us,'' said Tashawyna
Richardson, 15, a junior at Binghamton High School in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Her classmate D'Asia Grace said she started writing
rap-influenced poetry on her own and found that reading the work of
other poets, like Langston Hughes, Robert Frost and Shakespeare, in
school added to her appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever poetry you read, you have to have an open mind,''
said Grace, 16, ``and not put blockades on it, like saying what you
have to learn. That helps you like it.''

ILLEGAL OPERATIONS AND COMPUTER PORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is an AGP port, and what are PCI slots used for in a
computer?
</P>
<P>
   A. AGP stands for Accelerated Graphics Port, and it is a place
on your computer's motherboard for the system's videocard. PCI
stands for Peripheral Component Interconnect, and it refers to a
different type of slot on the motherboard for things like network
cards or cards to connect photo scanners.
</P>
<P>
   Videocards are also sometimes installed in PCI slots, but many
computers manufactured within the past few years are using the AGP
option. That is because the AGP can communicate directly with the
computer's main memory, while a videocard that is plugged into a
PCI slot shares time with other cards plugged into adjacent PCI
slots.
</P>
<P>
   Cards that plug into PCI slots can help you expand your
computer's capabilities, like the ability to connect to an Ethernet
network. PCI slots enable ``plug and play'' installation.
</P>
<P>
   Industry Standard Architecture slots are an older type of card
slot, but most computers are still made to include ISA slots on
their motherboards. They are commonly used for adding parallel or
serial port expansion cards, and sometimes sound cards or internal
modems.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the meaning of the Windows error message ``This
program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down''?
Am I doing something wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. You're not doing anything wrong or against the law, despite
what the error message says. The message means that the program in
question is having a problem. The ``illegal operation'' designation
covers a wide range of errors, and it may take some time, patience
and troubleshooting to pinpoint the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The most common causes of an illegal operation include a problem
between that program and a software driver in your operating system
or a memory-management problem between the program and one open in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   Problems and conflicts with different dynamic-link library
files, or DLLs, that are added to your system when you install
software programs can also cause illegal operation errors. Hardware
conflicts, defective RAM chips and program bugs can also cause the
error.
</P>
<P>
   To pinpoint the cause, ask yourself some questions: Has this
program always worked but is now crashing out of the blue? Has
anything, like new hardware devices or software, been added lately?
If you can trace the advent of the problem to a specific event, it
may help narrow down the likely suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The System File Checker, Version Conflict Manager and Dr. Watson
utilities included in Windows 98 might help you track the source of
your problem.
</P>
<P>
   To find these programs, go to the Start menu, then to Programs,
Accessories and System Tools. Open the System Information program
and look under the Tools menu to find the utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The System File Checker can restore damaged system files, while
Dr. Watson records what your computer was doing when it crashed and
may offer suggestions as to why. The Verson Conflict Manager keeps
a tab on which system files were updated or replaced during a
software or hardware installation.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft keeps a vast library of technical articles on its Web
site at support.microsoft.com/search. You can search the site for
``illegal operation,'' along with the names of your suspect
software or hardware, and you might find the solution to your
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Solutions will vary depending on the combination of factors, but
you may have to do things like uninstalling and reinstalling
programs or downloading and installing software patches for your
system to put a stop to the illegal-operation errors.

THE COLLEGE SEARCH GAME, COMPLETE WITH SPAM

   Thomas Lipsmeyer, a high-school senior with a talent for the
tenor sax, plays in every instrumental ensemble in his school and
practices nearly five hours a day. So when he decided that he
wanted to go to a college with a strong music program, he applied
the same discipline to the college-search process.
</P>
<P>
   He logged on to the Internet, searched online databases for
colleges with music majors and came up with 30 that seemed to match
his criteria. He visited the colleges' Web sites, scanning for
photos or news stories that would show devotion to the subject he
loved. He pored over online statistics of placement rates, data
that told him how often a college's graduates found jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After months of research, he narrowed his choices to three,
including two colleges he had never heard of when he started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could have done it without the Web,'' said
Lipsmeyer, who attends Parkersburg South High School in West
Virginia. ``I probably would have selected West Virginia University
and just gone there. I wouldn't have heard anything about other
colleges because they were out of state.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everything about the process worked to his liking. As he
did his online research, some sites asked him to fill out
registration forms and disclose his e-mail and home addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I did that,'' he said, sounding annoyed, ``I've
been getting an awful lot of mail about opportunities to join the
Army, Navy and Air Force.'' Was this something he was interested
in? ``No,'' he said without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   College-bound students across the country, and in some cases
around the world, are experiencing the same mix of euphoria and
frustration. Many rave about how the Web is making the search for a
college easier than ever. Using online software, students looking
for a college can highlight preferences like location, cost or size
on an online questionnaire and instantly receive lists of colleges
tailored to their criteria. Of the several Web sites that offer
search software _ including Embark.com, Collegeboard.com and
CollegeQuest.com _ many even enable students to conduct
side-by-side comparisons of college data, store that information in
personalized online lockers and click on a few buttons to send
e-mail requests to the colleges of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   On their Web sites, colleges often provide an in-depth look at
academic departments and student clubs. Many offer e-mail chats
with professors and students. College newspapers maintain their own
Web sites with archives of stories about life on campus. Articles,
rankings and virtual tours abound _ and all are free.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do students have to sit in a library flipping through
college guidebooks (most of which are usually in the reference
section, where they cannot be checked out). No longer are they
dependent on their parents and guidance counselors to point them to
a particular university.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power has shifted to the student when it comes to
research,'' said Phil Dunkelberger, chief executive and president
of Embark.com.
</P>
<P>
   But in coursing through the online terrain, students are also
finding its pitfalls. In many cases, the Web sites are free because
they are supported by advertising and e-commerce partners,
companies that provide commissions to Web sites that help them sell
products to students.
</P>
<P>
   And if free Web sites do not display much advertising, they make
money another way: They collect contact information by using
registration forms and then sell the students' addresses to
colleges and sometimes to commercial entities like banks,
long-distance companies and textbook shops.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the registration forms allow students to opt out
of such marketing instead of allowing them to request only the
material they are interested in. To avoid unsolicited marketing
messages, a student must erase a check mark next to a statement
like ``Yes. Please pass my name to companies that can provide me
with information that can help.'' In many cases, students will not
even realize that by leaving those boxes checked, they may be
opening the floodgates of print or e-mail advertising.
</P>
<P>
   CollegeQuest.com, a site run by Peterson's, a large educational
publishing company, says it may disclose a student's contact
information to ``carefully selected partners'' unless the student
says otherwise. CollegeLink.com, a site that offers search services
and electronic college applications, does the same. (Offline, the
same ``opt out'' marketing technique is used by the College Board;
anyone who registers for the SAT is also signing up to receive
marketing materials from colleges. Officials at the College Board
stress, however, that they do not give or sell those students'
names to commercial enterprises.)
</P>
<P>
   With the Web's outpouring of college information comes another
problem: the outpouring of college information. Unless students
search for colleges using very specific criteria, for example,
online software programs will list hundreds of matches. Several
guidance counselors have said that they are finding themselves in
more demand, not less, as students and parents troop into their
offices asking about colleges they had never heard of before they
saw them online.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Web has made medical patients both more informed and
more confused about health-care options, some high-school guidance
counselors say it has done the same for students and parents who
are shopping for a college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk to parents who start by saying, `Well, I've been
researching this on the Internet,''' said Diane Bower, Lipsmeyer's
guidance counselor. ``They are much more knowledgeable,'' she said,
but they are still looking for advice.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cris Maloney, senior vice president for marketing at
Peterson's, is not convinced that the surge in Web-based
information has yet made a difference in helping students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tools have changed but the process hasn't changed,'' he
said. Until the data becomes more meaningful, he said, too many
students will discover after arriving on campus that they would
rather be somewhere else. Simply learning that a college enrolls,
say, 15,000 students, offers a botany major and features a low
teacher-to-student ratio, he said, is not enough.

   Next month, he said, Peterson's will provide online access to a
new set of data. The service, called Best College Picks, is based
on research from the Institute for Research on Higher Education,
which has surveyed nearly 40,000 people about their jobs, their
values and how they spend their time. The new service will ask
students what kind of people they want to be and will then retrieve
names of colleges that have already turned out graduates that match
those types.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will, I hope, make the student a more informed shopper,''
said Robert Zemsky, director of the institute and leader of the
research project, which was financed by the federal Education
Department and other organizations. ``The smarter the shopper, the
better the product range.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, colleges are trying to offer students as many online
opportunities as possible to dig beyond statistics and glossy
photographs. California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo,
for example, has sent prospective students who indicated an
interest in agriculture e-mail invitations to an annual preview day
for the college of agriculture in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Even the in-depth information offered on the college Web sites
is making a difference. Leah Welsh, a freshman at Earlham College,
a small liberal-arts college in Indiana, said that last year she
visited Earlham's Web site to look at the syllabuses of courses she
might be interested in. And Lipsmeyer, the musician at Parkersburg
South High School, said he had gained an appreciation for Michigan
State University after reading the university's online articles
about its music department.
</P>
<P>
   For students too far away to visit a college, online resources
are a critical lifeline. Jing Chen, a first-year graduate student
at Rutgers University, lived in China before arriving in the United
States last month. She found Rutgers by searching the annual
rankings posted on the Web site of U.S. News &AMP; World Report and
looking for universities with a large proportion of international
students. She clicked to the Rutgers site and sent off an e-mail
message to its admissions office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was no Web,'' she said, ``how would I have found them
and gotten in touch?'' Before the Internet, she said, Chinese
students would search through photocopies of outdated American
guidebooks and send letters to some colleges, but the process was
expensive and it took weeks, if not months, to get a reply.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can take heart, however, in knowing that while the
Internet may be the chosen medium for research on colleges, Mom and
Dad still have an impact on students' decisions about which
colleges to attend. A recent survey called StudentPoll, which
queried more than 400 college-bound students, showed that
information from parents, current students and college admissions
staff exerted more influence than Web sites over college choice.
And nearly 70 percent of respondents said that actually stepping
foot on campus was most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the Web is a good way to get a basic feel for the
college,'' said Welsh, who decided to enroll at Earlham after
spending a day touring its small campus and noticing the diversity
of students there. ``But you have to go visit it to really
decide.''

   Internet Appliance Eliminates Hard Drive
</P>
<P>
   Imagine upgrading your computer's operating system by simply
popping out a CD-ROM and replacing it with a new one: no muss, no
fuss, no scrambled software drivers and bald spots from pulling out
hair.
</P>
<P>
   This is the idea behind a new kind of Internet appliance called
the New Internet Computer, or NIC. The basic model is priced at
$199 and is aimed at schools and consumers that would like to add
Internet access around the house without nicking too much from the
family budget.
</P>
<P>
   Although it lacks an internal hard drive and isn't a
full-fledged computer, the NIC has enough hardware under the hood
to make it more robust than a simplified Internet appliance. (It is
made by New Internet Computer Co., which was started by Larry
Ellison, chief executive of Oracle Corp.; Gina Smith, a former
technology columnist and television host, is New Internet Computer
Co.'s chief executive.)
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet appliances will allow users to send e-mail only
with the maker's designated provider and do basic Web browsing, but
the NIC allows the use of existing e-mail accounts and includes the
latest version of Netscape Navigator and common browser plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Since it doesn't have a hard drive for storage, the NIC will
allow users to log on to shared application servers and do things
like word processing over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The NIC's Linux-based operating system runs from a CD-ROM inside
a computer with a 266-MHz Pentium-class processor, 64 megabytes of
RAM and a 56-kilobits-per-second modem. The NIC can also connect to
the Internet with an Ethernet card and comes with two USB ports.
The $199 computer doesn't come with a monitor, but a 15-inch
display can be bought from the company for $129 and everything is
available at www.thinknic.com.
</P>
<P>
   While it may not be able to replace a regular desktop computer
system, the NIC's lower price and its potential to free users from
the technical-support hot line make the middle ground look like an
awfully nice place to explore.
</P>
<P>
   You've Got Mail (cc: the Mario Brothers)
</P>
<P>
   The problem with 10-year-olds is that they're disorganized,
they're constantly late and they've always got their heads buried
in some video game when they should be doing homework.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a new cartridge for the GameBoy, they've run out
of excuses for their poor behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Shark MX from Interact Accessories is an application that
enables the GameBoy to send and receive electronic messages to and
from any other e-mail account.
</P>
<P>
   The Shark MX also comes with an address book, a calendar and a
calculator so that owners can figure out how much of their day is
devoted to Donkey Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Not much larger than a typical game cartridge, the Shark MX can
connect to Interact's servers through any regular phone line.
</P>
<P>
   After setting up an e-mail account at Gamesharker.com, players
can use their well-muscled thumbs to compose e-mail messages on an
onscreen keypad.
</P>
<P>
   The device is $39.99 and comes with 30 free minutes of
connection time. Each 60 minutes of additional time is $6, and the
calls to Interact's servers are toll free _ cheaper than a
BlackBerry pager or a Palm VII and a lot less likely to be lost.

   A Study of the Wired World Finds Dropouts and No-Shows
</P>
<P>
   If the Internet is the information superhighway, a substantial
number of American adults are avoiding the on-ramp, according to a
recent survey sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which is based on random telephone interviews with
about 2,000 adults, shows that half of American adults do not have
Internet access and that 57 percent of those people have no
interest in going online.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people over 50 with no Internet access, 74 percent say
they have no plans to get access. Cost is not the major stumbling
block, according to the survey. Instead, many older Americans say
they simply do not see the value in logging on. By contrast, 65
percent of those under 50 say they plan to go online someday but
that they worry about the costs of computers and access.
</P>
<P>
   About 13 percent of all nonusers are what the researchers call
Internet dropouts. They were once online, but no longer have
access. ``It's a mystery in some cases, because they don't want to
say why they dropped out,'' said Lee Raine, director of the
research. But some respondents said that a significant event, like
losing a job, had caused them to give up Web access.
</P>
<P>
   The survey results are part of the Pew Internet and American
Life Project, an effort to collect, analyze and publish data on
Internet use. The results are available at www.pewinternet.org.

   Color Choices for Headphones Make Them iMacs for the Ears
</P>
<P>
   How far is all this Macintosh-inspired translucence going to go?
Apparently the design folks at Sony believe that the iMac look
should be extended to their latest offering in lightweight
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Called W.EAR (no, the period between the W and the E is not a
typo), these cleverly crafted headphones, ideal for use with
portable music devices, come with interchangeable shells in 12
translucent colors. Beneath their skins, the headphones, which cost
$30 each and come with two sets of shells (extra shells cost $6 a
pair), sport some impressive engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Sony spokesmen said that W.EAR headphones used highly efficient
Neodymium magnets that help pump out 104 decibels of sound pressure
from a single watt of input power. The W.EAR headphones also have a
gold-plated plug at the end of the copper cord to reduce electrical
resistance so the headphones can take advantage of whatever music
player they happen to be plugged into.

 &HT;    Hunter controversy adds more interest to Jones' performance
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the doping controversy surrounding C.J. Hunter
is unfortunate for the Games in general, and track and field in
particular, a side effect for NBC could be even more interest in
the pursuit of five gold medals by his wife Marion Jones, whose
efforts in the qualifying rounds of the 200 meters and the long
jump will be featured on tonight's prime-time telecast. Australian
heroine Cathy Freeman, fresh off her gold medal in the 400 meters,
is also running in the 200; while Gail Devers' attempt to get that
elusive gold medal in the 100-meter hurdles will be shown as well.
Two-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong will get some air
time, too, as the American cyclist seeks his first medal in his
third Olympics, while Georgian Teresa Edwards and a host of players
from the WNBA will anchor the late-night telecast with the U.S.
women's basketball game against Slovakia. On MSNBC, Venus Williams'
gold-medal women's tennis match against Russia's Elena Dementieva
will share the spotlight with the United States-Cuba rematch for
the gold medal in baseball.

   RUSSIA: AMERICAN CHARGED AS SPY
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors formally filed espionage charges against Edmond
Pope, the 54-year-old former U.S. Navy captain arrested in April
while buying plans for a Russian torpedo propulsion system. A trial
was set for next month. A lawyer for Pope, who runs a company
specializing in foreign marine equipment, said the system is a
decade old and had previously been exported. Pope faces 20 years in
prison if convicted.

   RUSSIA: NORWEGIANS TO DIVE TO KURSK
</P>
<P>
   Russia plans to hire Norwegian divers this week to recover the
bodies of 118 crewmen from the nuclear submarine Kursk, which sank
last month, said Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov. Recovery work
could start by Oct. 10, he added. But in a letter, 78 relatives of
the crewmen urged the government to proceed slowly, lest the
recovery work claim still more lives.

<P>
   GERMANY: KOHL LASHES OUT
</P>
<P>
   A tearful Helmut Kohl addressed a ceremony marking next week's
10th anniversary of German reunification, attacking Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer for
``betraying'' Germans by having given up on the move. Kohl, in a
speech to a conservative research group, read out remarks made by
the two men against reunification in the months before the Berlin
Wall fell. Kohl, disgraced after a campaign fund scandal last year,
has not been invited to speak at an official Unity Day event in
Dresden on Oct. 3.

   GREECE: FERRY TOLL RISES
</P>
<P>
   The death toll rose to 63 in the sinking of a ferry that ran
aground near the island of Paros in the Aegean Sea on Tuesday
night. Rescue teams continued to search for at least nine missing
passengers from ferry, which had more than 500 people aboard. The
government called the tragedy inexplicable, and the ship's captain
was held pending a criminal investigation.

   VOTE BEING CONSIDERED
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien is considering calling an election
in November, a few days after the U.S. elections. Chretien, whose
term expires in 2002, reportedly feels his chances of winning a
third term were bolstered by an internal Liberal Party poll
indicating that many Tory voters in Ontario are migrating to the
Liberals, shunning the nation's new conservative party, the
Canadian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SWITCH TO LIBERALS
</P>
<P>
   In the latest erosion of Canada's small parties, the Liberals
gained another opposition member as Rick Laliberte, a New
Democratic Party legislator from Saskatchewan, switched allegiance
to the ruling party. This month, two Tory Conservative legislators
joined the Liberals. In Parliament the Conservatives have 15 seats,
the New Democrats 19, the Bloc Quebecois 44, the Canadian Alliance
58, and the Liberals 160.

   KIDNAPPED STAR'S PLEA
</P>
<P>
   The movie idol Rajkumar, 72, who was kidnapped eight weeks ago
by the notorious bandit Veerappan, has asked his fans in the
southern state of Karnataka not to shut down the state and its
capital, Bangalore, on Thursday, according to an emissary who has
been negotiating for his release. In a statement, the emissary said
that Rajkumar had said that a general strike ``will inconvenience
the general public, and I do not want you to cause any trouble to
either the government or the people.''

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Oct. 1.
It includes a Part 2 on television.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Moving in `e' category) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-ESSAY (Undated) _ Watching television is thought to be
cultural anthropology, mindless escapism, emotional solace or a
source of news, sports and occasionally art. But it is rarely
embraced for doing all these things at once. Yet that variety, and
the way the parts feed one another, is where television gets its
immense social power. Caryn James defends the medium, lambastes
people who regard it with condescension and criticizes it expertly.
``Even at its worst it can be dreadful in a fascinating way,'' she
writes. 1700 words. By Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   TV-SEASON-ROCKEFELLER (Undated) _ The new season's crop of
television shows is transmitting a puritanical message: the pursuit
of wealth breeds immorality _ or, at the least, extreme vulgarity.
On ``Bull,'' the new TNT series, the founder of an investment
banking firm is a schemer. The hotshot stockbrokers in ``The
Street'' on Fox break up their day with quickies. On NBC's
``Titans,'' an heir to an aeronautics fortune discovers that his
former lover is about to become his stepmother _ and she's pregnant
with his baby. None of these fictional concoctions, however,
compete in the morality and melodrama department with ``The
Rockefellers,'' PBS' juicy series on American capitalism's royal
family. This two-part program, which begins Oct. 16, serves up
money lust, religion fervor, philanthropic penance, sexual
impropriety and bigamy. By Julie Salamon.
</P>
<P>
   TV-JAZZ-BURNS (Undated) _ ``Jazz,'' due on PBS on Jan. 8, is one
of the most highly anticipated programs of the new television
season. It took six years for Ken Burns, veteran of ``Civil War''
and ``Baseball,'' to assemble 2,400 stills, 2,000 film clips, 75
interviews and 500 pieces of recorded music. But it was impromptu
details _ an interviewee snapping his fingers or singing _ that
Peter Watrous finds the most exciting. Then, he writes, the
original recording wafts onto the soundtrack, in time with the
talking head. What might have been merely nostalgia or scholarship
becomes history. By Peter Watrous. With photograph.
</P>
<P>
   TV-WOLF (Los Angeles) _ Dick Wolf is the busiest producer on
television. He has four series running, including ``Law and
Order,'' it's spinoff, ``Law and Order: Special Victims Unit,'' the
new ``Deadline,'' a show about a crusading newspaper columnist and
``Arrest and Trial,'' which starts on the same night as
``Deadline.'' Another spinoff of ``Law and Order'' is in the works.
``I'm a crime junkie,'' Wolf said in an interview with Bernard
Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   With photograph.
</P>
<P>
   TV-GIDEON-BRAUGHER (Los Angeles) _ Actresses inspire Andre
Braugher more than actors, because he believes weakness is almost
bred out of men. That's why he has never seen Hamlet played as the
coward he believes he is. Braugher is starring in his second
television series, ``Gideon's Crossing,'' a hospital drama on ABC.
He plays Dr. Ben Gideon, a character based on Dr. Jerome Groopman,
a Boston physician who chronicled his clinical experiences in the
1997 book ``The Measure of Our Days.'' While the role isn't exactly
Hamlet, the character appears to be complex enough to keep
Braugher's fires fed for now. By Terrence Rafferty. With
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ORSON-WELLES-COMEBACK (New York) _ Fifteen years after his
death, Orson Welles _ boy genius, film pioneer, theatrical
innovator and portly outcast _ is experiencing a comeback. ``RKO
281,'' a documentary about the making of ``Citizen Kane'' is out on
video. ``The Cradle Will Rock,'' a movie by Tim Robbins tells the
story of Welles' production of a pro-union musical in the 1930s.
``The Big Brass Ring,'' a screenplay he wrote years ago, was made
into a movie starring William Hurt. Even the U.S. Postal Service
has issued a stamp in his honor. Amazon.com lists 45 different
titles about him. (It lists 34 about William Randolph Hearst.) Now
comes ``War of the Worlds,'' a new play at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music. ``It's kind of artistic necrophilia,'' said a former
collaborator. By Jonathan Mandell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-EVE (New York) _ Fifty years ago, the movie ``All About
Eve,'' starring Bette Davis as Margo Channing opened at the Roxy in
New York and became an instant classic. The film won six Academy
Awards. In a newly restored 50th-anniversary print, the movie will
be shown for one week, starting Oct. 6 at Film Forum in Manhattan.
Mel Gussow, who over the years has interviewed Davis; Joe
Mankiewicz, the films writer and director, and Darryl Zanuck, its
producer, tells all about ``All About Eve.'' By Mel Gussow.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-YANG (Undated) _ ``Yi Yi,'' which will be shown on
Wednesday at the New York Film Festival, is the first of Edward
Yang's seven features to reach American theaters. Set, like all his
films, in middle-class Taipei, ``Yi Yi'' provides an engaging
introduction to Yang's fictional universe, in part because of its
bemused approach to family life. He has been compared with
Michelangelo Antonioni and Jean-Luc Godard and his 1991 film ``A
Brighter Summer Day'' is considered one of the modern era's
greatest Chinese-language films. By Godfrey Cheshire. With
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-GIRLFIGHT (New York ) _ Like more traditional boxing movies
before it, ``Girlfight'' is about ``an outsider who enters a world
where she does not belong and finds a place for herself,'' said the
director Karyn Kusama. The film, which opened Friday, is the story
of a sullen, gum chewing, muscular girl from the underclass, played
by Michelle Rodriguez, who literally fights her way into the ring.
It could be a metaphor for Kusama's bout with studios as she tried
to get financing. John Sayles came up with $1 million for Kusama,
his former baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PHOTOGRAPHY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PHOTOGRAPHY-JAPAN-FUKUHARA (New York) _ ``Shinzo and Roso
Fukuhara: Photographs by Ginza Modern Boys, 1913-41,'' at Sepia
International presents for the first time in New York the work of
two brothers who played early roles in the formation of Japanese
modernist photography. Shinzo and Roso Fukuhara's father founded
Shiseido, the cosmetics company and Shinzo was obligated to follow
his father as company president. He pursued photography only as a
sideline yet still found time to found a photography magazine and
to promote the use of photography in advertisements for his
company. Roso Fukuhara's work was not published in his lifetime,
yet he was a pioneer of photographic modernism: a rather startling
combination. By Vicki Goldberg.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-CONNER (San Francisco) _ For more than four decades Bruce
Conner has been concerned with undermining everything you ever
thought you knew about who or what it is to be an artist. Museum
curators and critics describe him as ``paranoiac'' and
``impossible.'' The work in his traveling exhibit opening at the
Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art next Sunday is so disparate
that one critic called it a ``group show.'' Amei Wallach finds him
polite and outspoken. ``Some people are visual illiterates and they
work in museums,'' he says. By Amei Wallach.
</P>
<P>
   PORTRAIT-WASHINGTON (New York) _ Many people have seen the
large, heroic portraits of George Washington, but few have seen the
miniature that will go on auction at Christie's in New York in
January. The watercolor in a gold locket depicts Washington, not as
a man of authority, but as Martha Washington's husband. It has
impeccable provenance. All its past owners are known and Washington
himself recorded the sitting in his journal on a Saturday in 1789:
``Sat for Mr. Ramage near two hours to-day who was drawing a
miniature Picture of me for Mrs. Washington.'' It is expected to
sell for $600,000 to $900,000
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-SIMON-N'DOUR (Undated) _ Paul Simon and Youssou N'Dour
have racked up ample mileage and countless collaborators over the
last decades as they made their musical reflexes grapple with
foreign stimuli. On their new albums, they are back on home ground,
but irrevocably changed. ``If you don't know where you're heading
anymore/Go back to where you come from,'' N'Dour sings on his new
album, ``Joko (The Link).'' ``Carry me home, my teacher, carry me
home,'' Simon sings on his new ``You're the One.'' By Jon Pareles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-LINDBERG (Undated) _ ``Cantigas,'' a work by Magnus
Lindberg will be played by the Cleveland Orchestra next week at
Carnegie Hall and Deutsche Grammophon has released a CD of his
``Aura'' and ``Engine.'' This activity puts the spotlight on the
42-year-old Finnish composer. By Paul Griffiths. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPERA-GRAHAM-DEADMAN (San Francisco) The American mezzo-soprano
Susan Graham, fresh from John Harbison's ``Great Gatsby'' at the
Metropolitan Opera, opens Saturday in Jake Heggie's ``Dead Man
Walking'' at the San Francisco Opera. The opera, with a libretto by
the playwright Terrence McNally, is based on Sister Helen Prejean's
book of the same name, which also inspired a movie. It tells of
Prejean's attempts to save the soul of a murderer sentenced to
death. The opera `` makes you go places you might not ordinarily
go,'' says Graham in an interview with David Mermelstein.

<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Coded `t') &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This weeks Travel Section is devoted to fall and winter cruises.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-CRUISE-TRENDS (Undated) _ This year is shaping up as a
record for the cruise industry with the number of passengers
possibly exceeding 7 million. A major reason is the many low fares.
The reason for such bargains is not a mystery: Almost 80 new ships
joined the North American fleet during the 1990s, and 52 more are
scheduled by 2005. To offset the low fare, some lines have added
more charges on board and have come up with even more competitive
cruises. Coming up is a floating health club from Canyon Ranch and
nearly 2,000 short cruises. By Edwin McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER-CRUISE-REFUNDS (Undated) _ On Sept. 14, with
2,800 passengers aboard five vessels in the Bahamas, Cozumel,
Mexico, and Nova Scotia, Premier Cruises was shut down, seized by
creditors. For Betsy Wade, this was more than a news story. In June
she was a Premier passenger when the air conditioning failed on the
Big Red Boat en route to Nova Scotia. Passengers were put on a bus
and sent back to New York. Ever since then she had been trying to
get a refund. Now she finds she is in a really big boat _ 7,000
passengers are due refunds. By Betsy Wade.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-CRUISE-SENIORS (Undated) _ In her youth, Barbara
Delatiner confesses to a bias against
if-this-is-Tuesday-it-must-be-Copenhagen trips. As for a cruise,
for ``mature'' travelers, she was concerned it would resemble a
floating retirement home. Twelve days after boarding the Norwegian
Dream, she disembarked with mixed feelings. She enjoyed the
pampering aboard ship, preferred having a cabin to living out of a
suitcase on a land tour and had some memories that will last a
lifetime. But she found the time on shore rushed to the point she
figured out she had about five seconds per painting at the
Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. By Barbara Delatiner.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-STEAMBOAT (UNDATED) _ One blast of the American Queen's
whistle is all it took to evoke the romance of the paddleboat.
Glenn Collins said the trip exceeded his expectations in almost
every respect. There were nightly entertainments, day trips to
plantations, and most of all the mighty Mississippi itself. By
Glenn Collins
</P>
<P>
   CRUISE-CARIBBEAN-FAMILY (Undated) _ The Ocean Princess bills
itself as ``the Love Boat,'' but for 19 members of one clan it was
the family boat. By Christopher Hall.
</P>
<P>
   CRUISE-PANAMA (Undated) _ Starting in October, vacationers who
would have seen Panama only from a ship's railing will be able to
go ashore when Panama inaugurates Colon 2000, a $45 million cruise
ship port on the Caribbean entrance to the canal. Backers of Colon
2000 hope to lure tourists ashore with the promise of duty-free
shopping, music and folk dancing at a two-story,
190,000-square-foot mall, scheduled to open in June. By David
Gonzalez. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BARGAINS (Undated) - Deals on travel to Scotland, Quebec
and Morocco. By Joseph Siano.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Answers to questions about Outward Bound
Courses for Women; dance lessons in Dublin and geneaology research
in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Items on the fuel surcharge in the
U.S.; an art noureau show at the National Gallery of Art in
Washington; and a new resort in Frisco, Texas.

THE HEART KNOWS RACISM BEFORE THE HEAD
</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of white people are slow. We don't get it right away. Our
antenna doesn't work as well as non-whites on some matters.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Jewish and have experienced anti-Semitism, you might
understand it. But WASP-style whites, the white-bread kind, don't
generally live with knowledge that we could be bullied just because
of our color or ethnicity. We're not on guard ourselves, so we're
often slow to make a fuss when something happens to a non-white.
</P>
<P>
   It's not because we don't see a wrong's been committed. We get
it when we think about it, but we don't recognize it right away.
And we never see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   I guess if you don't live with a certain fear in your gut, you
have to rely on your head and that takes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no excuses, we were slow on the Wen Ho Lee case. It took
a long time for the public and the media to get outraged about the
unfairness of locking up an American scientist for being a possible
Chinese spy, holding him for nine months in solitary and in leg
irons, threatening him with death for espionage and then dropping
58 counts against him, after he pleaded guilty to one.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lee is a martyr to government bungling and big-time racial
profiling. Some whites don't get racial profiling, which is really
old-fashioned bigotry. Usually we learn it in a secondhand way.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican-born Georgina, who has lived half of her life in
California, tells about buying mascara at a Sacramento drugstore,
getting home to realize it was the wrong color and returning to
make an exchange.
</P>
<P>
   This is a simple annoyance but no problem, you would think. But
if you look like Georgina, which means you are lovely,
well-dressed, look like you can afford mascara but you are not
white, nothing can be assumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I know you bought this here?'' the clerk asked.
Georgina produced the receipt. ``How do I know you didn't find it
on the floor and are pretending it's yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Georgina returned with her husband, the European-American
professor, and got her mascara exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's racial profiling,'' Georgina says.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican-American teen-ager who lives in a small Sonoma County
town has been on edge since he was in middle school. People assume
he's a troublemaker, he says. Why? Look at me, he says. He's brown.
Now he's also big and tall. Store clerks follow him with their
eyes. Security cops walk behind him at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   A white woman married to an African-American is learning about
racial profiling through their older son. He attends a prestigious
East Coast university in a large city, where he's studying pre-med
and Spanish; but when he comes back to his hometown in Sonoma
County, he has to be careful.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas he parked at the junior college intending to take
a run on the track course, when an officer stopped him and asked
what he was doing. Going for a run, he said. The officer said OK,
but would he first pull up his shirt for him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you know why he asked that. I didn't. I asked his mother,
and she said the cop was looking for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   I'm stupid on these things. Maybe it's because I have daughters
and no one in my family, that I know of, has ever been stopped and
made to prove he or she wasn't armed. Maybe, too, it's because I so
admire the young man in question and remember when he was a little
boy, resisting bedtime, playing his violin at the top of the
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   How dare that cop?
</P>
<P>
   His mother was ready to file a report. ``As a white person, I
wanted to make a stink.'' But her son said it wasn't worth it.
Besides, he had only a few days before he went back to the city,
where there are lots of African-Americans. Still, he purposely
stayed away from First Night activities to avoid any potential
hassles.
</P>
<P>
   The college student has learned to be compliant and real polite
when stopped by police. When asked for his ID, he knows to avoid
sudden movements and makes a point of saying he is only reaching in
his pocket for his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids have to deal with something that could never happen to
me,'' says their mother. Is it fair that they could be stopped for
no apparent reason and that they have to use more caution than
other people? ``All I know is that it's a fact of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   I've heard of grade school teachers who help students understand
how prejudice works by having the class divide up by hair and eye
color. Then they are treated differently _ how often they're called
on, how they're disciplined _ solely because of their black hair or
green eyes. Maybe we adults should try that.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing as how we're living in a state and a nation that is
rapidly changing its looks, we'd better start getting it.
</P>

`THE IMMIGRANT': A WELCOME TO AMERICA THAT TOUCHES ALL BASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A deeply satisfying new musical, with much on its
mind about history, humanity, man and God and the American Dream,
is beckoning to theatergoers with a taste for rich characters in a
tale that touches the heart, glows with humor and soothes the ear.
</P>
<P>
   Its title is ``The Immigrant,'' and with its splendid cast of
four and its sensitive direction by Randal Myler (a Tony Award
nominee for ``It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues''), this show marks an
auspicious beginning for CAP21, a nonprofit artistic project
development company, at its theater at 15 W. 28th St.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Immigrant'' is at once a tale of the bereavement and
beauty of immigration, of a struggle for personal survival
paralleled by the struggle to maintain religious tradition in a
land of assimilation, and of a long, initially unlikely friendship
colored by love and conflict in a world where bigotry, pogroms and
genocide know no borders. Most of all, it is a story of faith and
hope.
</P>
<P>
   With a book by Mark Harelik, based on his widely produced play
of the same title, ``The Immigrant'' revisits the life of his
grandfather, Haskell Harelik, a young Jew who fled the pogroms of
old Russia and reached the United States in 1909 as part of a
little-known chapter in the story of migration from the Old World
to the New.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell Harelik did not arrive as one of the hordes who passed
through the terrifying examinations at Ellis Island and became part
of the teeming masses of Manhattan's Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he was part of the Galveston Movement, conceived and
financed by the philanthropist Jacob Henry Schiff, which routed
10,000 Eastern European Jews from Bremen, Germany, through
Galveston, Texas, and into the labor-needy industrialized West
between 1907 and 1914.
</P>
<P>
   So, at the outset of ``The Immigrant,'' Haskell Harelik, parched
and near collapse, is wheeling his heavy barrow of bananas (a penny
each) through his new hometown, Hamilton, Texas, population 1,203,
not yet counting Haskell, its only Jew.
</P>
<P>
   As pivotal moments in life go, Haskell (played by Evan Pappas)
has the good fortune to be overcome outside the home of Milton
Perry (Walter Charles), the local banker, and his wife, Ima (Cass
Morgan).
</P>
<P>
   Milton is not exactly overjoyed to encounter the dirt-streaked
Haskell, who is still more at home in Yiddish than English. But as
Milton's churchgoing, crucifix-wearing Baptist wife, Ima (Cass
Morgan), counsels him, ``Now behave like a Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long Haskell not only has some water and a clean face but
also a room in the Perry home, for which he proffers a dollar from
the sock where he also keeps his papers. Milton refuses. ``Ten,''
he thunders. Haskell is astonished until Milton makes clear that he
means 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   And so as the years from 1909 to 1942 pass, the lives of the
Hareliks and the Perrys intertwine. Milton, as banker, adviser and
friend, fosters the growth of Haskell's business, from pushcart to
vegetable store to dry goods establishment to department store.
Haskell saves enough money to bring over his wife, Leah (Jacqueline
Antaramian), who is racked by loneliness and fears the loss of her
Jewish traditions. Ima wishes Milton would be baptized. As Haskell
prospers, Leah bears him three sons, the arrival of each marked by
the planting of a tree.
</P>
<P>
   And as World War II looms ever nearer, the long relationship
between Haskell and Milton reaches a crisis over a Sabbath dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasure of the show's music, with Sarah Knapp as lyricist

 &HT;    Bush campaign calls focus of FBI debate tape theory
'ridiculous'By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The George W. Bush presidential campaign,
dissatisfied with the FBI investigation of the debate preparation
tape that was shipped to the opposition, believes the feds suspect
a Bush scheme to sabotage the upcoming presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McKinnon, whose firm Maverick Media does Bush's TV ads,
said Wednesday that questions asked of his staff by FBI agents show
``they had a theory that somebody mailed this as a way to blow up
the debates, which is a ridiculous notion.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvette Lozano, a Maverick Media employee questioned by the FBI,
said the two agents who quizzed her for 90 minutes posited the
sabotage theory based on the notion that a stolen tape might
provide a convenient out for a candidate not eager to debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the agents said, 'It could be that you sent this
information because you didn't want the debates to happen,''' said
Lozano, who denied having anything to do with the clandestine
mailing of the debate preparation materials to the Al Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Carole Florman on
Wednesday offered no response.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ongoing investigation and we just aren't talking
about the investigation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first presidential debate between Bush and Democratic foe
Gore is Tuesday in Boston. Two other debates are set for later in
the month.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, Bush debate preparation material _ including a
videotape of a mock debate session _ showed up in the mail at the
office of former U.S. Rep. Tom Downey of New York. At the time,
Downey's role in the Gore campaign included portraying Bush in mock
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Downey turned the material over to the FBI. Last Thursday and
Friday, five people at Maverick Media, including McKinnon, were
interviewed by federal agents. McKinnon said the line of
questioning made it clear the agents are operating under the theory
that the Bush campaign orchestrated the mailing of the debate
materials as part of a scheme to delay or cancel the debates.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which initially favored a different debate
schedule other than the one that eventually prevailed, has made no
such efforts, spokeswoman Mindy Tucker noted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous and people in politics know the only people
who'd be interested in getting this kind of information to the Al
Gore camp would be somebody who supports Al Gore's campaign,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a Tuesday interview on ``Larry King Live,'' supported
that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you it's not one of my supporters,'' he said.
``Somebody who is for me is not going to be sending tapes to the
Gore campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lozano, an administrator at Maverick Media, said her interview
with the FBI included questions about a downtown Post Office
videotape that the FBI agents said showed her mailing a package two
days before the debate materials showed up at Downey's office.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano said she did not immediately recall what she had sent
that day. After some thought, she recalled it was pants being
returned to The Gap by McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said something along the lines of, 'We don't think it was
pants. You were not mailing pants.'''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon said Wednesday it was his pants that were in the
package.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano, 30, offered to be fingerprinted and take a polygraph
exam. The agents returned last Friday for the fingerprints and a
few more questions. No polygraph exam has been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was horrified,'' McKinnon said of the questioning of
Lozano by the FBI. ``They flat out asked her if she did it and
said, `What if we found your fingerprints on the package?' and
asked her to confess. It was really an unpleasant experience for
her and for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After initially expressing confidence that the FBI would get to
the bottom of the matter, Bush officials now are questioning the
progress of the probe. Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director
has wondered aloud about why the FBI hasn't paid some attention to
Gore headquarters in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Gore campaign suspended a junior staffer, Michael
Doyne, who had told a friend that the Democrats might have a
``mole'' at Bush headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the FBI and the federal law enforcement agencies would
follow up on that boast by looking at computer hard drives (at Gore
headquarters) to determine whether in fact there is any substance
to those comments,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani said Wednesday that the FBI has not
contacted Doyne. Fabiani has said the Gore campaign is confident
the FBI will figure out how the tape wound up at Downey's office.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon's firm has been a natural subject of questions because
of his former ties to the Democratic Party. McKinnon never worked
for a GOP candidate until he signed on for Bush's gubernatorial
re-election bid in 19998. He previously had worked for Democratic
Govs. Mark White and Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon met Lozano when she worked as a Richards volunteer in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon said he offered to take a polygraph exam after federal
investigators asked him if he mailed the package or instructed
anyone else to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more anxious that anybody for the FBI to resolve this
because they have, through this leak, cast a horrible cloud over
innocent people,'' he said.

 &HT;    ISRAEL'S NETANYAHU, CLEARED OF BRIBERY, READIES FOR EXPECTED
POLITICAL COMEBACK
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein
Wednesday said he would not indict former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on corruption charges. The move raised expectations of a
comeback for the charismatic politician known for his combative
style and hard line on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was in Atlanta Wednesday representing an Israeli
company at a telecommunications convention. His Jerusalem office
said he was to return Thursday, cutting short his trip.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared an end was coming to the ``time out'' from politics
that Netanyahu announced after being trounced in elections in May
of last year. The prospect of a return of ``Bibi,'' as Netanyahu is
known here, sent a sizzle through the political ranks and on
Israeli radio talkshows.
</P>
<P>
   His possible re-entry poses a threat to embattled Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, who may face a call for new elections amid a stalled
peace process and defections of political allies.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, 50, is a right-winger Israelis tend to either love or
love-to-hate, reflecting in part the deep left-wing, right-wing
divide among Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   His three-year-term was marked by hard bargaining with
Palestinians, which often brought him to loggerheads with the
Americans mediating the peace process. It also saw several cycles
of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost indicted in 1997 in a case revolving around
political cronyism. His infighting with presumed allies, and also
reportedly with his wife Sara, was constant grist for political
junkies. But, he cast himself as the defender of Israel's
underclass, and protector of Israeli land.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, opinion polls show Netanyahu even with Barak, who won
the election last year by 56 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Netanyahu fairing better than hawkish former Gen.
Ariel Sharon, current leader of Netanyahu's Likud Party. That
standing could be crucial, as Barak opponents vow to call for new
elections soon after the Israeli parliament reconvenes Oct. 29. The
elections could be held early next year.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Israel the possible revival of Netanyahu
opened up the old rifts between those who see the Palestinians as
possible peace partners and those who see them as eternal enemies.
The split was also between those who view Netanyahu as a persecuted
defender of the weak or a just corrupt politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good for Israel. He won't sell out the land,'' said
mini-bus driver Elisha Levy, 47. ``When he is prime minister again
(Palestinian President Yasser) Arafat will feel sick, and that is
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned he can go to jail,'' said paint
factory owner David Shullman, 50. ``Netanyahu is a specialist at
getting into trouble and a specialist at getting out of it. In any
other country he would be too embarrassed to try to get back into
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just the ongoing investigation that seemed to keep
Netanyahu's political prospects on hold. That ended Wednesday when
Rubinstein decided not to indict Netanyahu after a yearlong police
probe.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation included allegations of bribery and kickbacks.
It centered on $100,000 in home improvement work Netanyahu received
from a contractor, and official gifts received as prime minister
that police said Sara and Benjamin Netanyahu kept.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein, in a 22-page opinion, said there was insufficient
evidence to win a conviction in court against either Netanyahu or
his wife. But, he said Netanyahu's conduct was ``not a proper way
to run a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office issued a statement praising Rubinstein's work
and, with the start of the Jewish New Year Friday night, said ``we
understand Mr. and Mrs. Netanyahu's feeling of relief and wish them
a happy new year.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak ally, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, instead highlighted
the criticism in Rubinstein's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court will not decide the fate of Netanyahu, the public
will,'' he told Israeli television. ``A person such as this cannot
be the leader of a party in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Likud Party leader Sharon dismissed any worries that Netanyahu
will return with plans to capture the party leadership. He focused
attention on Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Benjamin Netanyahu will now have the time to join us in
our battle against the dangers that the Barak government brings,
and to bring down the government,'' he said, vowing to maintain the
party leadership.

`UNDERMINE' IS BRUCE CONNER'S PET WORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Kan., Calif., Minn.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By AMEI WALLACH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Artists all over the world, in the late 1950s
and early 1960s, began scouring the streets and newsstands of
Tokyo, Duesseldorf, Paris, Moscow, New York and San Francisco for
junk materials or pop motifs. Everything that the stringent rules
of Modernism had pronounced unworthy of artmaking seemed newly
alluring: comic books, trash, a tarnished spoon, a stuffed goat,
words on a page. Artists and critics called this work anti-art,
Fluxus, neo-Dada, Beat, Nouveau Realisme, Gutai. The artists' aim
was to sabotage any accepted definition of art and vandalize its
boundaries. As Robert Rauschenberg once put it, they wanted to work
in the gap between art and life.
</P>
<P>
   For Bruce Conner, though, debunking the meaning of art was never
enough. His fixation for more than four decades has been with
undermining everything you ever thought you knew about who or what
it is to be an artist. Anyone who thinks he knows who Conner is
from his assemblages in the Whitney Museum's ``Beat Culture'' show
in 1995 will be flummoxed by the traveling exhibition ``2000 B.C.:
The Bruce Conner Story, Part II,'' organized by the Walker Art
Center in Minneapolis. It opens at the Los Angeles Museum of
Contemporary Art next Sunday and remains on view through Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Part II is ``Not a Retrospective,'' as the impossible-to-read
medallion embossed on the first page of the catalog informs you,
with Conner's customary barbed tomfoolery. After all, the
exhibition is missing all but one of the more than 300 paintings
Conner has made and all of the photographs. Those might find their
way into a Part I, if there ever is one, or maybe some future Part
VII.
</P>
<P>
   The current Part II is an installation of 174 sculptures,
assemblages, films, collages, prints, drawings and photograms so
disparate that David Bonetti, reviewing the exhibition's San
Francisco stop at the M.H. de Young Museum for The San Francisco
Examiner this summer, likened it to ``a group show.''
</P>
<P>
   This pleases Conner. ``I never wanted to get locked into a style
of work that I would be identified with to the point that I
couldn't do anything else,'' he said one recent morning as we sat
in the dining area of his tiny and tidy house, in front of a window
overlooking rooftops of this city where he arrived from Wichita,
Kan., more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that his films are required viewing in film
schools and his assemblages place him as a pivotal figure in the
San Francisco renaissance of the 1960s. ``I've already been
typecast as a filmmaker and sculptor,'' he complains. ``What I want
to do is change.''
</P>
<P>
   I have been warned about Bruce Conner by curators and critics
who know him. They say he is ``paranoiac,'' ``difficult'' and
``impossible to deal with.'' They regale me with stories of nasty
scenes and aborted retrospectives. Even curators who are unabashed
fans of the work and consider it shamefully underestimated told me
he was apt to throw me out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Conner, it is true, has hardly a charitable word to say about
museum personnel, with the exception of Peter Boswell, the primary
organizer of ``2000 B.C.'' He has even more choleric _ and
sometimes more believable _ stories about curators, critics and
printmakers than they have about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are visual illiterates and they work in museums,''
he says. (At the moment, the museum Conner is in disagreement with
is New York's Museum of Modern Art, over its handling of his
assemblage sculptures ``Child'' and ``The Box.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the man in front of me is as courteous and contained as the
farmer in ``American Gothic,'' whom he resembles in the severity of
his blue eyes, even when he's being funny, and the thinness of his
nose. Conner is 67, but his stamina and hours have been drastically
limited since 1984, when he was discovered to have a liver ailment
that could have killed him within a matter of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of these constraints,'' he says, ``because of what it
takes to cajole, threaten and try to coerce museums and galleries
to present my work in the way I want it to be,'' he declared
himself an Anonymous Artist a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   When he can, between bed rest and the demands of a traveling
exhibition, he makes collages at his 35-by-40-inch drawing table in
the front room that serves as his studio. He doesn't sign them, he
doesn't claim them, which means he doesn't have to photograph,
measure, mat, frame or label them. He sends them to friends. If a
friend calls to thank him for the work, he denies he had anything
to do with it, according to his ``12-step program for Anonymous
Artists.''
</P>
<P>
   This is only the latest act of subterfuge in Conner's ongoing
confrontation with artistic identity. He sees his role as similar
to that of an experimental novelist _ not to expose his soul but to
create and undercut narratives through absurdity and surprise.
Toward this end, like the Soviet-born artist Ilya Kabakov, he has
invented fictional characters to make his work. He created an
artist stuck in the vocabulary of the Surrealist artist Max Ernst
and gave him the name of his movie star friend Dennis Hopper for
the etchings that constituted ``The Dennis Hopper One Man Show'' in
the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He has signed prints with thumbprints and imprinted
photosensitive paper with his body in his stunning series of
``Angel'' photograms. But a signature is something else. ``For me
looking at a painting with a big signature on it was like a big
commercial,'' he says. So he signed his work only on the back.
</P>
<P>
   When his New York dealer, Charles Alan, objected, he signed with
the finest pen he could find, in as tiny letters as he could
manage, on the most obscure area of the painting. Then he would
send his dealer a map with which to find the signature. Twice
during the 1960s he put a moratorium on signing altogether. He told
Alan to forge his signature but didn't get any cooperation. Then
Conner sent him a signature stamp, which Alan declined to use and
returned to Conner. So Conner made an assemblage out of the stamp
and presented it to Marcel Duchamp at a lecture, with the request
that Duchamp return it to Alan. Months later, Duchamp's wife took
it to Alan in the middle of a blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   For Conner, as for other artists of his generation, a great many
ideas descended from Duchamp's readymades of 1915 _ objects easily
found in everyday life, like a shovel or a urinal, which the artist
declared to be art by signing them. Conner was frustrated, however,
in his attempts at persuading Alan to organize a two-person show
with Duchamp. Conner's idea was to paint the walls and sculpture
stands in the same white as they were before he repainted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be my contribution, and I would not sign it,''
Conner tells me. ``So I would make this work that I didn't sign,
and, on the walls and sculpture stands, Marcel Duchamp would show
the work that he did sign but didn't make.''
</P>
<P>
   This antic sensibility, laced with apocalyptic dread, informs
the first and most celebrated of Conner's films, the 12-minute
black-and-white ``A Movie'' of 1958. Born in 1933 in Kansas, Conner
was 12 when Hiroshima was bombed, and draft age when the Korean War
brought the bomb scare and bomb shelters home to a complacent
America.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb is the protagonist of ``A Movie,'' which takes its
inspiration from the Marx Brothers' ``Duck Soup'' and from Conner's
childhood passion for making adult secrets visible. In movies, the
viewer is not supposed to see the flashing numbers leading to the
beginning of the film. But Conner spliced this countdown leader
with girlie footage that a friend had found in Kansas, of a nude
taking off her stockings. To this he added discarded footage from a
camera store of a submarine captain spying through a periscope then
firing away, ostensibly at the nude. Before long an underwater
atomic bomb explodes and waves capsize surfers, sailors, fish, a
battleship. Then ``The End'' flashes intermittently on screen, with
its double meaning of the end of the film and the end of the world.
The bomb dematerializes in light. The words ``Bruce Conner'' flash
large, long and often, the ego of the creator as big as the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Movie'' and the films that followed have been credited with
influencing MTV. ``Not my fault,'' Conner says when asked.
</P>
<P>
   Such political savagery became a mark of the horrific, erotic
assemblages he made out of debris left behind by the poor blacks
displaced by San Francisco's urban renewal. He studded the
assemblages with Salvation Army jewelry and throttled them with
nylon stockings.
</P>
<P>
   The relationships are intimate, if not always apparent, between
the films, the assemblages, the dense black-and-white felt-tip pen
drawings of the late 1960s and the compulsively ordered ink-blot
drawings of the 1990s. The common thread is conflict: between black
and white, light and shadow, flesh and spirit, the object and the
reason for making it. In every medium Conner wants the eye to be in
constant movement and so misled by the next thing it sees that,
when it returns to the first, it sees something altogether
different.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is never to be pinned down. Never to give in
to that dread signature style. It has been worth the struggle. In
his youth, Bruce Conner might not have been the artist Robert
Rauschenberg was, but it has served Conner's long career to keep
things small, vagrant and aberrant.

ECONOMIC SCENE: FEAR OF BIG GOVERNMENT NOT JUSTIFIED BY U.S.
HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JEFF MADRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush has finally made government the issue of the
presidential campaign. After wasting months focusing on Al Gore's
character, he returned to what was always the Republicans' meat and
potatoes. As president, Gore would give you big government, Bush
now emphasizes. But if voters elect him instead, Bush says, he
would continue to tame Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is picking up, of course, from the legacy of President
Reagan, who was determined to bench government as long as he could.
Reagan helped make entrepreneurialism and profits respectable
again, which was no small achievement. And some deflation of
government was no doubt deserved. In the 1960s and '70s, advocates
of progressive actions underestimated how difficult such tasks as
reducing poverty and revitalizing the inner cities really were, and
did not take sufficient care to develop new policies that would be
effective. Americans also overestimated the nation's potential
affluence. Remember guns and butter?
</P>
<P>
   But the oversimplified fear of big government has been damaging
and does not accurately reflect American history. On the crucial
role of government in the nation's economic success, our past is
unambiguous. Beginning with Jefferson's presidency, the federal
government may have resisted building a national system of roads,
but by the 1820s the states picked up the ball. Led by New York,
the states invested millions of dollars, which was big money then,
in new canals, and New York even made loans to business. Where
would the early economy have been without these canals?
</P>
<P>
   In those same years, federal laws were passed to protect the
rights to the ownership of property for millions of Americans,
including squatters, even though it violated the sanctity of the
contracts the nation's rich landowners held. To Hernando de Soto, a
Peruvian development specialist and author of ``The Mystery of
Capital'' (Basic Books), America's far-seeing protection of
property rights was a key to economic success.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Civil War, there was a pitched battle over whether
primary education should remain private, but public education
thankfully prevailed, and America became the best-educated nation
in the world. Now, economists believe educational attainment is the
foremost economic resource of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1800s, the federal government aggressively
subsidized the building of the railroads. After a couple of decades
of a simplistic Social Darwinian ideology of ``survival of the
fittest'' at the end of the 19th century, the progressives
established regulations that made competition fairer and protected
workers from abusive hours and labor conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, local governments built much-needed high
schools. In the 1930s, Social Security and unemployment insurance
were introduced over the vehement objections of conservatives. And
after World War II, the federal government was responsible for the
highway system, the GI Bill of Rights, the Pentagon-sponsored
research that resulted in the Internet, and civil rights
legislation that helped bring African-Americans into the economic
fold.
</P>
<P>
   The record is plain: government has done many things awfully
well. And beyond the historical evidence, there is also strong
statistical support for the idea that government investment has
produced substantial returns. Professor Ishaq Nadiri, an economist
at New York University, has developed with colleagues a provocative
model of public investment that is widely accepted. Their research
shows that the return on federal transportation investment, for
example, has been every bit as strong as the returns on private
investment in recent years (and even stronger in the past) because
such investment benefits society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Economic theory is consistent with Nadiri's findings. Private
investors will systematically underinvest in areas in which such
social returns exceed private returns because the individual
companies themselves will not enjoy all the benefits. Good theory,
then, tells us that investments in public goods, from roads, sewers
and airports to research and education, cannot be completely
entrusted to private markets.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Reagan era began, America has largely neglected many
of these areas. Of course, government will make mistakes (so does
business). But consider that federal investment in transportation,
research and development and education and training has fallen to
only 1.7 percent of GDP, 30 percent lower than it was in 1970. At
former levels, it would have been roughly an additional $100
billion of spending a year.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy is also creating new needs that are going unmet.
Paying down the nation's debt is apparently our priority, but
two-worker families desperately need quality day care. The
information age requires even better education, but according to
Richard Rothstein and Karen Hawley Miles, schools have increased
spending per pupil since the late 1960s at a rate only 1 percent a
year above inflation, behind the previous pace and not enough to
keep up with spending elsewhere in the economy. What does the low
level of teachers' salaries say about our society? Nancy Folbre, an
economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, argues
that such caring professions, including nursing and caring for the
elderly, are themselves public goods that require serious
government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   And, although deregulation and privatization have been useful,
regulatory vigilance cannot simply be relaxed across the board as
the economy changes. What are we to make of deregulation in a time
when tire companies neglect safety standards, and the number of
product recalls continues to set records? Despite the dangerous
collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Investment Capital two years
ago, no new requirements for public disclosure of financial
information are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Both business and government have vital roles in the economy,
and always have. But for many people, government has become an
us-vs.-them issue. For the sake of the nation's economy, the next
president should realize that the government is us. &QL;

going straight to listeners.
</P>
<P>
   _ Major recording artists are releasing new songs on the
Internet in advance of new CDs to spur interest.
</P>
<P>

in lawsuits against Napster. The Canadian band Barenaked Ladies
released fake songs on the Internet to thwart music pirates.
</P>
<P>
   RECORD COMPANIES
</P>
<P>
   _ Virtually every major label is working on an Internet
subscription or delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies are working together to develop encryption
technology that makes it harder to download copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   _ Labels are starting to license their music more freely to big
Web companies.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET COMPANIES
</P>

 &HT;    NAPSTER, MP3 LAWSUITS CAN'T STOP A MUSIC INDUSTRY REVOLUTION
 &HT;    With ONLINE-CHANGE and ONLINE-TIMELINE. Moving in (f) financial
and (e) entertainment categories for release Sunday, Oct. 1.
 &HT;    By BOB KEEFE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ When Napster Inc. goes back to court this week,
singer-guitarist Nial McGaughey won't be among the many musicians
cheering for the judges to put the online music site out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey and his heavy-metal band, 3D House of Beef, estimate
they reach thousands of listeners each day through Napster and
similar Internet sites, people they wouldn't be able to reach any
other way.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Oakland, Calif., band doesn't make any money letting
online listeners swap songs such as ``White Hog Slaughter'' and
``Heard You Were Dead'' for free, but the exposure certainly
results in some CD sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``When music gets played on the radio, isn't (that) giving it
away?'' McGaughey, 31, wrote in an e-mail interview. ``What about
when it gets played at clubs?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course that's not what other, more established musicians and
the major record labels behind them say. Backed by the powerful
Recording Industry Artists Association (RIAA) and musicians such as
Metallica and rapper Dr. Dre, major record labels have sued Napster
and competitor MP3.com Inc., claiming the companies' infringement
of music copyrights cost them billions in lost profits.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco is scheduled to hear Napster's appeal of an injunction
that would put it out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of this case and similar lawsuits, the
business of making, distributing and buying music is going to be
different in many ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for musicians. Little-known bands like
McGaughey's can distribute their music over the Internet _ with or
without Napster and MP3.com _ on their own, bypassing record
companies that have traditionally been the mainstay of the music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Better-known musicians have to operate in the knowledge that any
fan with a computer and Internet access no longer has to pay to
hear their music. Some are taking the offensive. To thwart piracy,
the Canadian band Barenaked Ladies recently flooded the Internet
with fake songs that contained little more than marketing pitches
for its newest album.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for the record companies. Not long ago, artists
who wanted to make it big had to sign with a major label, and
listeners had to buy it from the label. Now recording companies,
their grip on artists loosening, are scrambling to implement their
own Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for listeners. Last year, ``MP3,'' the format
used to compress and move music files on line, replaced ``sex'' as
the most searched-for term on the Internet. Even if Napster and
MP3.com disappear, other software programs _ Gnutella and Rapster
are two of the most popular _ will let people go on exchanging
music easily.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't downloaded any music yet, you probably will when
faster Internet connections make it much easier. And even if you
can't imagine listening to listen to music on your computer instead
of your stereo, you may have already heard some music over the
Internet. Some retailers and radio stations use downloaded music in
their stores and on their late-night broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for the Internet companies. Once a small band of
self-professed renegades, online music companies are getting
legitimate or changing the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   When Walmart.com launches a downloadable music service early
next year, it will do so with licensing agreements in hand from
major record labels. Even MP3.Com, which once slammed the major
labels as irrelevant, now has licensing deals with four of them.
Like other online music companies, MP3.com also is pushing into new
markets, such as selling monthly subscriptions to non-stop music
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there's a lot of controversy, but the controversy is
about different legal issues, it's not about the opportunities,''
MP3.com Chairman Michael Roberston said in a recent interview.
``The bottom line is that delivering music digitally is so
efficient that it's going to revolutionize everything.''
</P>
<P>
   History replays itself
</P>
<P>
   Of course, technology has been revolutionizing the music
industry almost since the first recording. And usually, there has
been plenty of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s, in radio's heyday, many record companies
refused to allow stations to broadcast their music. That's why some
radio networks started their own shows and did live broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies ``were afraid people wouldn't buy records any
more if they could hear the music for free,'' explained Emory
University sociology professor Tim Dowd, echoing the complaints of
modern-day recording executives about Napster and MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Recording companies continued to be stingy with their music up
until 1942, when Capitol Records broke from the pack and declared
that radio play actually helped its sales, Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   Later home recording drew the ire of the big labels _ first
cassettes, then digital audio tapes, and now CD ``burners.'' The
industry says it loses $1.5 billion or more a year to home taping.
</P>
<P>
   At least when it came to cassettes, the record labels were
right. ``The record companies went into a big slump'' in late
1970s, Dowd said. ``One of the things that pulled them out was the
CD, which gave them a new form of recording that cassettes couldn't
rival.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with MP3 is that the masses, with the help of the
Internet, learned how to use it before the recording companies did.
</P>
<P>
   The technology actually has its roots not in music, but in
television. In 1992, a contract research group in Germany that was
searching for ways improve the sound of high-definition television
broadcasts discovered how to compress audio files. The technology
became a standard of the Moving Picture Experts Group known as MPEG
1 Layer 3, or later, MP3.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Robertson, a former computer advice columnist who
had started several other companies with little success, founded
MP3.com Inc. here in March 1998, computer and music enthusiasts
around the world were already swapping MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford University, in a harbinger of what was to come, a
student put more than 100 songs on a Web server and an estimated
2,000 people a day logged on to download free tunes, clogging the
university's Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's company was the first to make a sizeable business
out of housing and downloading songs. But even though MP3.com had
thousands of songs available on line (today it claims more than
600,000), big record labels paid little public attention to the
company, largely because most of the artists were little-known
bands.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, MP3 technology got the recording industry's
attention in a big way. Diamond Multimedia Inc. introduced a
portable MP3 player that could play downloaded music like a
Walkman. The RIAA filed suit seeking to keep Diamond from releasing
its Rio player, but it failed. Rio's popularity soared.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months later, the RIAA would try again to stop the
spread of MP3 music. This time, they focused on a 19-year-old
Northeastern University dropout named Shawn Fanning.
</P>
<P>
   Buying time
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, Fanning moved to the heart of technology,
Silicon Valley, to commercialize a revolutionary new file exchange
software program he wrote to help him and his friends exchange MP3
files. The nappy-haired teen reportedly used one of his own
nicknames in calling his company Napster Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is a file-sharing site that lets users find and download
music that's stored on other users' computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   It dramatically widened the sources for music files beyond those
on the MP3.com site. MP3.com says visitors to its site are simply
accessing music from CDs they already own, but record companies
claim the music files are illegal copies that MP3.com made and
stored on its servers, and that many of its users are otherwise
sharing music that they don't own.
</P>
<P>
   Napster became an overnight sensation. With it, anybody with
Internet access and a CD-ROM drive can exchange digitized music,
whether it's copyrighted or not. The file trading software became
so popular at colleges and universities that it clogged Internet
systems and shut down servers. Fanning became something of a pop
idol, even getting a spot on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies got angry.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, the RIAA and 17 major labels filed suit
against Napster, claiming its 20 million users cost them more than
$700 million in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the recording industry's five biggest labels also
sued MP3.com. All but one of those has settled, but damages from
the still-pending suit by Universal Music Group could cost MP3.com
$118 million or more. A judge is scheduled to decide final damages
in the MP3.com case next month.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the record labels claimed the companies violated
copyrights held by them and their artists.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason why the record companies filed suit,
according to some critics. They simply wanted to buy some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about trying to slow it down,'' said Heath Terry, who
follows Internet trends for the Credit Suisse First Boston
investment banking firm, which was the lead underwriter in
MP3.com's July 1999 initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recording industry right now is terrified,'' he said.
``They just want everybody to stop and give them time to figure it
out, and they're going to throw up whatever roadblock they can to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes, fast and slow
</P>
<P>
   So far, the roadblocks seem to be working, and the record
companies have used their time wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Since filing their suits against Napster and MP3.com, nearly
every major record label has started a major Internet initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group
announced they would develop an online subscription-based music
service. In July, EMI Group started offering 100 digital albums for
sale through online retailers. In September, Warner Music Group
announced plans to put more than 1,000 albums for sale on the
Internet beginning in November.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Napster and MP3.com, where thousands of tunes can
be downloaded daily (and for free), the music industry's offerings
are paltry. And industry executives admit they have been slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated process,'' said RIAA spokesman Doug Curry.
``It's much easier for someone to upload thousands of CDs and put
them online for free as opposed to changing 60 years of a large
industry's practices overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians and Internet companies are changing virtually
overnight, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rock bands Primitive Radio Gods and Arrested Development
recently agreed to pre-release songs from upcoming CDs on Napster
to generate interest in the new discs. Popular California punk band
Offspring last month announced it would post its entire new CD on
the Internet, but later reneged under pressure from their recording
label, Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists may soon start using the recording labels'
newfound vulnerability as leverage when negotiating contracts or
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will in fact kind of create a free agency for the artist if
the Internet becomes a safer place for the artist to be,'' said
talent agent Ron Stone, who represents musicians including Bonnie
Raitt, Ziggy Marley and Tracy Chapman. ``There are going to be some
artists ... who will use the Internet to create new relationships
with record companies.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the organizers of a group called Artists Against
Piracy, Stone detests Napster and other online companies that don't
pay royalties to musicians. But he, and many of the musicians he
represents, aren't opposed to digital distribution of music _ as
long as they get paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not opposed to Napster technology, we're opposed to the
Napster business model,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Some online music companies are, in fact, changing their
business models.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com recently launched subscription channels that let
subscribers listen to nonstop classical or children's tunes, much
like digital cable music channels, for a monthly fee. Its new
retail business already has about 100 stores and restaurants as
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to pay, we'll write the check and we'll move on,''
MP3.com's Robertson said, referring to the possibility of costly
damages in its lawsuit. ``Technology marches forward. And as we're
a technology company, we must seize the opportunities as they come
along.''
</P>
<P>
   None of what the companies are doing really matters to music
fans like 21-year-old Juan Pieterse, a third-year college student
in South Africa. Pieterse claims he hasn't bought a CD in two
years, but he has downloaded countless tunes over the Internet
using Napster and other services.
</P>
<P>
   If Napster gets shut down this week, he'll likely just go to
another file-sharing system, such as Gnutella, to get free copies
of songs from favorite bands like Metallica, REM and Offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, one does not need to be a rocket scientist to
download or upload illegal copies of songs,'' Pieterse wrote in an
e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pieterse is the kind of music listener that the major record
labels fear most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who will purchase CDs in the future,'' he
wrote, ``are people who don't have portable MP3 players or PCs.''

   HOW THE ONLINE MUSIC CONTROVERSY MUSHROOMED
</P>
<P>
   1992
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the Fraunhofer Institute, a contract research group,
creates a new technology for compressing sound files. Originally
developed for high-definition television transmissions, the
technology would become a standard of the Moving Pictures Experts
Group. It would later become known as MPEG 1 Layer 3, or MP3. That
same year, U.S. lawmakers pass the Digital Audio Home Recording
Act, which would later become the center of controversy over
copyrighted music and video.
</P>
<P>
   1997
</P>
<P>
   Still little known outside the realm of techies, MP3 starts to
create controversy. In California, a computer science student puts
more than 100 songs on a Web server connected to Stanford
University's computer system. An estimated 2,000 people a day visit
the site, substantially slowing the school's Internet connection.
Recording industry executives start to express concern over the
format and its uses, but say they don't see it as competition.
</P>
<P>
   March 1998
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robertson, a San Diego consultant who once wrote a local
computer magazine column called Mr. Mac, starts MP3.com Inc.,
capitalizing on the growing interest in MP3 music files.
</P>
<P>
   October 1998
</P>
<P>
   As Diamond Multimedia Inc. prepares to release its Rio portable
MP3 player, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)
files suit to try to stop it. The suit fails, and the Rio soars in
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   July 1999
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com Inc. goes public at $28 per share. It reaches $105
before ending the first day's trading at $63.31. (Currently, it
trades at less than $4 a share.)
</P>
<P>
   August 1999
</P>
<P>
   College student Shawn Fanning drops out of Northeastern
University in Massachusetts and moves to Silicon Valley to try and
make a business out of a revolutionary new file-exchange software
program he wrote. He calls the company Napster Inc.
</P>
<P>
   December 1999
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen record companies and the Recording Industry Artists
Association sue Napster, claiming that the company and its 20
million users have violated music copyrights, costing the companies
more than $700 million in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 21, 2000
</P>
<P>
   Five major record labels file suit against MP3.com in New York,
claiming the company infringed on their copyrights with its
MyMP3.com service, which lets users post their CDs in online
``music lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   April 28
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in New York rules that MP3.com has violated
music companies' copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   May 1
</P>
<P>
   Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group announce a
joint venture to develop a subscription-based downloadable music
program, the biggest move yet by record labels to get into the
online game.
</P>
<P>
   May 3
</P>
<P>
   The copyright fight turns personal. Metallica drummer Lars
Ulrich helps deliver to Napster the screen names of 335,000 users
he claims is stealing the band's music. Napster later blocks access
of the users.
</P>
<P>
   May 5
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com announces it has reached a licensing agreement with BMI,
one of the five labels that had sued. Under the agreement, MP3.com
will pay royalties to the label for songs that are downloaded from
its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   May 23
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by litigation, venture capitalists pump $15 million
into Napster. Hank Berry, a partner in the lead VC firm, Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners, becomes acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
   May 30
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com launches a retail music division to sell music to
stores, restaurants and other retailers over the Internet. The move
is one of several by MP3.com to diversify.
</P>
<P>
   June 9
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com reaches licensing agreements with two other record
labels that had sued, Warner Music Group and BMG Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   July 11
</P>
<P>
   Congress holds hearings on digital music. Chief executives of
Napster and MP3.com testify, as do recording industry executives
and musicians such as Ulrich and Byrds co-founder Roger McGuinn.
The Senate Judiciary Committee later opts not to take any
substantial action.
</P>
<P>
   July 26
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in San Francisco approves the RIAA's request for
an injunction and orders Napster to shut down in two days. The
company's site is flooded with users seeking to download thousands
of free songs before its scheduled closing.
</P>
<P>
   July 28
</P>
<P>
   Napster surprisingly is granted a temporary reprieve from the
injunction. In New York, MP3.com reaches a licensing agreement with
EMI. The settlement leaves Universal Music Group as the lone
holdout among record labels that had sued in January.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 1
</P>
<P>
   Universal Music Group begins testing ``bluematter,'' a program
it hopes will supply digital music, video and photograph technology
to paying Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 6
</P>
<P>
   A New York judge finds that MP3.com ``willfully'' violated
Universal's copyrights, setting the stage for what could be $118
million or more in damages. MP3 says it will appeal and also steps
up settlement talks with Universal. The judge is expected to decide
the final amount of damages in November.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 11
</P>
<P>
   Research firm Media Metrix Inc. says Napster is the Internet's
fastest-growing software application. Also, Warner Music Group
announces plans to team up with Internet company RealNetworks Inc.
to put more than 1,000 of its artists' albums and singles on the
Internet beginning in November.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 2
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel in San Francisco is scheduled to begin
hearing Napster's appeal of the injunction and decide whether the
company can stay in business.

   YUGO-ELECTIONS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ A vast crowd of at least
200,000 converged on central Belgrade Wednesday for a rally to show
support for opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica. (Summary from

<P>
   ISRAEL-NETANYAHU (Jerusalem) _ After deliberating for six

to prosecute former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption
charges, clearing the way for a possible political comeback by the

   VIOLENCE-KIDS-PARENTS (Westland, Mich.) _ As they shopped for
milk at Kroger's, ate ice cream at the Westland Mall or sat in the
bleachers at the Westland Sports Arena, most of the parents
interviewed here agreed that it was their responsibility _ and not
that of the president, Congress or even Hollywood _ to filter what
reaches their children. The candidates, they suggested, should save
their breath for the economy and health care. Yet all of the
parents conceded that they regularly crossed or blurred the borders
between acceptable and unacceptable content. By Jacques Steinberg.

<P>
   PARTIES-SOFTMONEY (Undated) _ The national Republican and
Democratic party organizations are outspending both special
interest groups and the Bush and Gore campaigns on television in
the presidential election, a trend that political analysts say is
transforming the parties this year from supporting players into the
chief advertising agents for the candidates. In fact, this this
year, if the trend continues, the advertising campaigns will have
been financed largely by the unregulated soft money donated to the
parties by corporations and wealthy individuals. By Peter Marks.

<P>
   NY-NEW-TEACHER (New York) _ In July, Donna Moffett abandoned her
comfortable longtime job as a legal secretary near Wall Street to
be one of 320 ``teaching fellows'' _ people with little or no
teaching experience, hired by Schools Chancellor Harold Levy to
fill chronic vacancies in the system's most troubled schools. In
her first weeks of school, Moffett is learning that teaching is
only part of her job description _ for now, an achingly small part.
Already she is grappling with tardiness and discipline problems,
often spending far more time on ``classroom management,'' as
veteran teachers call it, than lessons. By Abby Goodnough.

<P>
   GAS-PIPELINE (Inuvik, Northwest Territories) _ For three
decades, geologists probing beneath the Arctic Ocean near here and
offshore Alaska have mapped the largest known untapped reserves of
natural gas in North America _ 165 trillion cubic feet, seven times
as much as the United States will consume this year. But, with gas
prices low, indigenous opposition high and environmental issues
looming, energy companies never sought to build pipelines to send
the gas south to heat homes and to generate electricity. This is
changing as fast as it takes to read a home heating bill. By James
Brooke.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola hints at better things
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Coca-Cola appears to be delivering on some Wall Street
expectations that business will improve globally later this year,
although growth at home remains a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest soft drink company said Wednesday that case
volume, a key indicator of the amount of product moved to retailers
and other customers, is expected to rise about 4 percent in the
third quarter. That compares with 7 percent in the second quarter
and 3.5 percent during the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The results this time around are in line with Wall Street
estimates, and that was reflected in another gain for Coke's stock.
The company's shares, which are up 10 percent over the past five
trading days, closed Wednesday at $55.63, up 69 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But in North America, which accounts for 38 percent of the
company's operating revenue, there was practically no growth in
case sales. By comparison, volume was up 1 percent in the second
quarter and 2 percent in the third quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   The region, which includes the United States and Canada, has
suffered fallout from a series of price increases that retailers
and consumers have found hard to swallow. The company also faces
the challenge of lackluster growth in its core cola brands as
consumers embrace more noncarbonated alternatives such as juices,
teas, sports drinks and water.
</P>
<P>
   But President and Chief Operating Officer Jack Stahl indicated
Wednesday that North America's overall case sales results belie the
fact that performance is improving in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite volume softness earlier in the quarter, the company's
North American business has improved in the latter part of the
quarter based on our marketing activities,'' Stahl said. Analyst
Bill Pecoriello of Sanford C. Bernstein also said U.S. beverage
volume growth improved in September, for both Coca-Cola and rival
Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's 26 directors worldwide are rewarded for innovative
marketing campaigns that connect with local consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Beverage Digest analyst John Sicher said the industry should
expect ``a lot more activity'' from Coke in product innovation,
advertising and marketing, which should help its performance in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would anticipate North American volume beginning to show
signs of improvement in the fourth quarter and into next year,''
Sicher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But on CNBC, beverage analyst Caroline Levy of UBS Warburg said
she remains ``cautious'' about the company because of its North
America performance.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the world, case sales rose and estimated 7 to
8 percent in its Asia Pacific region; 3 to 4 percent in the Africa
and Middle East group; and 4 to 5 percent in both the Latin America
and Europe/Eurasia groups.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch acknowledged that the weak euro
``obviously has put some pressure'' on business in the company's
second-largest market. But he added that stronger currencies
elsewhere have helped offset any negative currency impact in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Coca-Cola said it expects global case sales to grow 5
percent for this year _ although it had earlier projected 5 to 6
percent growth _ and 6 to 7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company will report third-quarter earnings in mid-October.
Wall Street expects Coca-Cola to report per-share results of 41
cents, compared with 32 cents in the third quarter last year.

   How the music business and its customers are adjusting to
Internet-driven change:
</P>
<P>
   MUSICIANS
</P>
<P>
   _ Little-known artists are bypassing major record labels and
going straight to listeners.
</P>
<P>
   _ Major recording artists are releasing new songs on the
Internet in advance of new CDs to spur interest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some artists are fighting back. Metallica and Dr. Dre joined
in lawsuits against Napster. The Canadian band Barenaked Ladies
released fake songs on the Internet to thwart music pirates.

<P>
   RECORD COMPANIES
</P>
<P>
   _ Virtually every major label is working on an Internet
subscription or delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies are working together to develop encryption
technology that makes it harder to download copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   _ Labels are starting to license their music more freely to big
Web companies.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET COMPANIES
</P>
<P>
   _ New music download sites, ranging from corporate giant
walmart.com to upstart clickradio.com, are striking deals with
major record labels before they launch services.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some existing music sites, such as MP3.com, are reaching
agreements with labels and branching into new, less-controversial
lines of business, such as subscription services.
</P>
<P>
   _ Big Web portals and streaming media companies, such as Yahoo
and RealNetworks, are reaching licensing deals with record labels
and others to broadcast live concert videos and music over the
Internet.
</P>

   LISTENERS
</P>
<P>
   _ More and more are going to the Internet for tunes, making
Napster the fastest-growing Internet software application in
history.
</P>

 &HT;    NAPSTER, MP3 LAWSUITS CAN'T STOP A MUSIC INDUSTRY REVOLUTION
 &HT;    With ONLINE-CHANGE and ONLINE-TIMELINE. Moving in (f) financial
and (e) entertainment categories for release Sunday, Oct. 1.
 &HT;    By BOB KEEFE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ When Napster Inc. goes back to court this week,
singer-guitarist Nial McGaughey won't be among the many musicians
cheering for the judges to put the online music site out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey and his heavy-metal band, 3D House of Beef, estimate
they reach thousands of listeners each day through Napster and
similar Internet sites, people they wouldn't be able to reach any
other way.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Oakland, Calif., band doesn't make any money letting
online listeners swap songs such as ``White Hog Slaughter'' and
``Heard You Were Dead'' for free, but the exposure certainly
results in some CD sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``When music gets played on the radio, isn't (that) giving it
away?'' McGaughey, 31, wrote in an e-mail interview. ``What about
when it gets played at clubs?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course that's not what other, more established musicians and
the major record labels behind them say. Backed by the powerful
Recording Industry Artists Association (RIAA) and musicians such as
Metallica and rapper Dr. Dre, major record labels have sued Napster
and competitor MP3.com Inc., claiming the companies' infringement
of music copyrights cost them billions in lost profits.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco is scheduled to hear Napster's appeal of an injunction
that would put it out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of this case and similar lawsuits, the
business of making, distributing and buying music is going to be
different in many ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for musicians. Little-known bands like
McGaughey's can distribute their music over the Internet _ with or
without Napster and MP3.com _ on their own, bypassing record
companies that have traditionally been the mainstay of the music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Better-known musicians have to operate in the knowledge that any
fan with a computer and Internet access no longer has to pay to
hear their music. Some are taking the offensive. To thwart piracy,
the Canadian band Barenaked Ladies recently flooded the Internet
with fake songs that contained little more than marketing pitches
for its newest album.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for the record companies. Not long ago, artists
who wanted to make it big had to sign with a major label, and
listeners had to buy it from the label. Now recording companies,
their grip on artists loosening, are scrambling to implement their
own Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for listeners. Last year, ``MP3,'' the format
used to compress and move music files on line, replaced ``sex'' as
the most searched-for term on the Internet. Even if Napster and
MP3.com disappear, other software programs _ Gnutella and Rapster
are two of the most popular _ will let people go on exchanging
music easily.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't downloaded any music yet, you probably will when
faster Internet connections make it much easier. And even if you
can't imagine listening to listen to music on your computer instead
of your stereo, you may have already heard some music over the
Internet. Some retailers and radio stations use downloaded music in
their stores and on their late-night broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's changing for the Internet companies. Once a small band of
self-professed renegades, online music companies are getting
legitimate or changing the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   When Walmart.com launches a downloadable music service early
next year, it will do so with licensing agreements in hand from
major record labels. Even MP3.Com, which once slammed the major
labels as irrelevant, now has licensing deals with four of them.
Like other online music companies, MP3.com also is pushing into new
markets, such as selling monthly subscriptions to non-stop music
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there's a lot of controversy, but the controversy is
about different legal issues, it's not about the opportunities,''
MP3.com Chairman Michael Roberston said in a recent interview.
``The bottom line is that delivering music digitally is so
efficient that it's going to revolutionize everything.''
</P>
<P>
   History replays itself
</P>
<P>
   Of course, technology has been revolutionizing the music
industry almost since the first recording. And usually, there has
been plenty of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s, in radio's heyday, many record companies
refused to allow stations to broadcast their music. That's why some
radio networks started their own shows and did live broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies ``were afraid people wouldn't buy records any
more if they could hear the music for free,'' explained Emory
University sociology professor Tim Dowd, echoing the complaints of
modern-day recording executives about Napster and MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Recording companies continued to be stingy with their music up
until 1942, when Capitol Records broke from the pack and declared
that radio play actually helped its sales, Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   Later home recording drew the ire of the big labels _ first
cassettes, then digital audio tapes, and now CD ``burners.'' The
industry says it loses $1.5 billion or more a year to home taping.
</P>
<P>
   At least when it came to cassettes, the record labels were
right. ``The record companies went into a big slump'' in late
1970s, Dowd said. ``One of the things that pulled them out was the
CD, which gave them a new form of recording that cassettes couldn't
rival.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with MP3 is that the masses, with the help of the
Internet, learned how to use it before the recording companies did.
</P>
<P>
   The technology actually has its roots not in music, but in
television. In 1992, a contract research group in Germany that was
searching for ways improve the sound of high-definition television
broadcasts discovered how to compress audio files. The technology
became a standard of the Moving Picture Experts Group known as MPEG
1 Layer 3, or later, MP3.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Robertson, a former computer advice columnist who
had started several other companies with little success, founded
MP3.com Inc. here in March 1998, computer and music enthusiasts
around the world were already swapping MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford University, in a harbinger of what was to come, a
student put more than 100 songs on a Web server and an estimated
2,000 people a day logged on to download free tunes, clogging the
university's Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's company was the first to make a sizeable business
out of housing and downloading songs. But even though MP3.com had
thousands of songs available on line (today it claims more than
600,000), big record labels paid little public attention to the
company, largely because most of the artists were little-known
bands.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, MP3 technology got the recording industry's
attention in a big way. Diamond Multimedia Inc. introduced a
portable MP3 player that could play downloaded music like a
Walkman. The RIAA filed suit seeking to keep Diamond from releasing
its Rio player, but it failed. Rio's popularity soared.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months later, the RIAA would try again to stop the
spread of MP3 music. This time, they focused on a 19-year-old
Northeastern University dropout named Shawn Fanning.
</P>
<P>
   Buying time
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, Fanning moved to the heart of technology,
Silicon Valley, to commercialize a revolutionary new file exchange
software program he wrote to help him and his friends exchange MP3
files. The nappy-haired teen reportedly used one of his own
nicknames in calling his company Napster Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is a file-sharing site that lets users find and download
music that's stored on other users' computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   It dramatically widened the sources for music files beyond those
on the MP3.com site. MP3.com says visitors to its site are simply
accessing music from CDs they already own, but record companies
claim the music files are illegal copies that MP3.com made and
stored on its servers, and that many of its users are otherwise
sharing music that they don't own.
</P>
<P>
   Napster became an overnight sensation. With it, anybody with
Internet access and a CD-ROM drive can exchange digitized music,
whether it's copyrighted or not. The file trading software became
so popular at colleges and universities that it clogged Internet
systems and shut down servers. Fanning became something of a pop
idol, even getting a spot on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies got angry.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, the RIAA and 17 major labels filed suit
against Napster, claiming its 20 million users cost them more than
$700 million in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the recording industry's five biggest labels also
sued MP3.com. All but one of those has settled, but damages from
the still-pending suit by Universal Music Group could cost MP3.com
$118 million or more. A judge is scheduled to decide final damages
in the MP3.com case next month.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the record labels claimed the companies violated
copyrights held by them and their artists.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason why the record companies filed suit,
according to some critics. They simply wanted to buy some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about trying to slow it down,'' said Heath Terry, who
follows Internet trends for the Credit Suisse First Boston
investment banking firm, which was the lead underwriter in
MP3.com's July 1999 initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recording industry right now is terrified,'' he said.
``They just want everybody to stop and give them time to figure it
out, and they're going to throw up whatever roadblock they can to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes, fast and slow
</P>
<P>
   So far, the roadblocks seem to be working, and the record
companies have used their time wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Since filing their suits against Napster and MP3.com, nearly
every major record label has started a major Internet initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group
announced they would develop an online subscription-based music
service. In July, EMI Group started offering 100 digital albums for
sale through online retailers. In September, Warner Music Group
announced plans to put more than 1,000 albums for sale on the
Internet beginning in November.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Napster and MP3.com, where thousands of tunes can
be downloaded daily (and for free), the music industry's offerings
are paltry. And industry executives admit they have been slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated process,'' said RIAA spokesman Doug Curry.
``It's much easier for someone to upload thousands of CDs and put
them online for free as opposed to changing 60 years of a large
industry's practices overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians and Internet companies are changing virtually
overnight, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rock bands Primitive Radio Gods and Arrested Development
recently agreed to pre-release songs from upcoming CDs on Napster
to generate interest in the new discs. Popular California punk band
Offspring last month announced it would post its entire new CD on
the Internet, but later reneged under pressure from their recording
label, Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists may soon start using the recording labels'
newfound vulnerability as leverage when negotiating contracts or
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will in fact kind of create a free agency for the artist if
the Internet becomes a safer place for the artist to be,'' said
talent agent Ron Stone, who represents musicians including Bonnie
Raitt, Ziggy Marley and Tracy Chapman. ``There are going to be some
artists ... who will use the Internet to create new relationships
with record companies.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the organizers of a group called Artists Against
Piracy, Stone detests Napster and other online companies that don't
pay royalties to musicians. But he, and many of the musicians he
represents, aren't opposed to digital distribution of music _ as
long as they get paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not opposed to Napster technology, we're opposed to the
Napster business model,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Some online music companies are, in fact, changing their
business models.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com recently launched subscription channels that let
subscribers listen to nonstop classical or children's tunes, much
like digital cable music channels, for a monthly fee. Its new
retail business already has about 100 stores and restaurants as
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to pay, we'll write the check and we'll move on,''
MP3.com's Robertson said, referring to the possibility of costly
damages in its lawsuit. ``Technology marches forward. And as we're
a technology company, we must seize the opportunities as they come
along.''
</P>
<P>
   None of what the companies are doing really matters to music
fans like 21-year-old Juan Pieterse, a third-year college student
in South Africa. Pieterse claims he hasn't bought a CD in two
years, but he has downloaded countless tunes over the Internet
using Napster and other services.
</P>
<P>
   If Napster gets shut down this week, he'll likely just go to
another file-sharing system, such as Gnutella, to get free copies
of songs from favorite bands like Metallica, REM and Offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, one does not need to be a rocket scientist to
download or upload illegal copies of songs,'' Pieterse wrote in an
e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pieterse is the kind of music listener that the major record
labels fear most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who will purchase CDs in the future,'' he
wrote, ``are people who don't have portable MP3 players or PCs.''

   HOW THE ONLINE MUSIC CONTROVERSY MUSHROOMED
</P>
<P>
   1992
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the Fraunhofer Institute, a contract research group,
creates a new technology for compressing sound files. Originally
developed for high-definition television transmissions, the
technology would become a standard of the Moving Pictures Experts
Group. It would later become known as MPEG 1 Layer 3, or MP3. That
same year, U.S. lawmakers pass the Digital Audio Home Recording
Act, which would later become the center of controversy over
copyrighted music and video.

   1997
</P>
<P>
   Still little known outside the realm of techies, MP3 starts to
create controversy. In California, a computer science student puts
more than 100 songs on a Web server connected to Stanford
University's computer system. An estimated 2,000 people a day visit
the site, substantially slowing the school's Internet connection.
Recording industry executives start to express concern over the
format and its uses, but say they don't see it as competition.

   December 1999
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen record companies and the Recording Industry Artists

</P>
<P>
   The copyright fight turns personal. Metallica drummer Lars

   Congress holds hearings on digital music. Chief executives of
Napster and MP3.com testify, as do recording industry executives
and musicians such as Ulrich and Byrds co-founder Roger McGuinn.
The Senate Judiciary Committee later opts not to take any
substantial action.
</P>
<P>
   July 26
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in San Francisco approves the RIAA's request for
an injunction and orders Napster to shut down in two days. The
company's site is flooded with users seeking to download thousands
of free songs before its scheduled closing.
</P>
<P>
   July 28
</P>
<P>
   Napster surprisingly is granted a temporary reprieve from the

<P>
   Sept. 6
</P>
<P>
   A New York judge finds that MP3.com ``willfully'' violated
Universal's copyrights, setting the stage for what could be $118
million or more in damages. MP3 says it will appeal and also steps
up settlement talks with Universal. The judge is expected to decide
the final amount of damages in November.

 &HT;    Debate could be pivotal to vice-presidential candidates -
big-time
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sense, both major-party candidates for vice president are
hedging their bets this year.
</P>
<P>
   After the special circumstances of his retirement package from
Halliburton Co. became an embarrassment to the campaign, Republican
Dick Cheney announced this month he will forgo stock options,
recently worth $3.6 million, whose value could be affected by the
next administration. He will also sell and transfer into a blind
trust the remainder of the stocks and options in the package,
recently worth $13.6 million - if he's elected.
</P>
<P>
   His action was a response to potential charges of direct
conflict of interest, but Cheney will still benefit from the
Halliburton board's decision to waive its right to penalize him for
retiring early, and the former oil industry executive will be well
set, no matter what happens in November.
</P>
<P>
   Along similar lines, Sen. Joe Lieberman is having difficulty
severing ties to his old job. In fact, unlike Cheney, he hasn't
retired from it.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman remains on the ballot as a U.S. Senate candidate in
Connecticut, and a swing through his home state last weekend was
officially designated a Senate campaign trip. With the majority in
the Senate now thought to be in play, Lieberman's Democratic
colleagues are becoming increasingly vocal about their desire for
him to step aside for another Democrat, so the state's Republican
Gov. John Rowland doesn't get the chance to appoint Lieberman's
successor if he's elected vice president. Lieberman has said folks
back home are telling him they want a special election next year,
but Rowland has already nixed that idea.
</P>
<P>
   There's a debate on the calendar in the Connecticut race, two
weeks after Lieberman's Oct. 5 debate with Cheney in Danville, Ky.
If Lieberman opts to skip it -- and if he has not by then stepped
out of the race -- his long-shot Republican opponent, Waterbury
Mayor Philip Giordano, will have the right to say Lieberman isn't
giving Connecticut voters a fair chance to compare them.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Lieberman is more focused at the moment on his forum
next week. Vice-presidential debates, though they never been
decisive, have produced some of the more memorable lines of recent
elections. There was Bob Dole's condemnation of ``Democrat wars''
in 1976, Lloyd Bentsen's dismissive ``Senator, you're no Jack
Kennedy,'' in 1988, Adm. James Stockdale's plaintive ``Why am I
here?'' at the 1992 debate in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Coming two days after the first presidential debate, in a race
that is a dead heat, the Cheney-Lieberman debate potentially could
matter more than previous vice-presidential face-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who followed Dan Quayle knows the loneliness of the
less-favored running mate, even on a ticket that is doing well.
Cheney arrived on an airport tarmac in Detroit this week to find no
reporters had shown up for his stop, which bespeaks how literally
he is in that position.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman has been held up as a brilliant selection,
Cheney has repeatedly struggled. Even his innocuous response to
George W. Bush's on-mike comment about a reporter, ``Oh yeah...big
time,'' may have done more subliminal damage than Bush's off-color
remark. It typed Cheney as a yes-man, compared to Lieberman's
reputation for independence.
</P>
<P>
   That gives the Republicans the potential advantage of a double
set of reduced expectations going into next week's debates: Bush
isn't expected to be as knowledgeable as Al Gore, and Cheney isn't
expected to be as obviously an asset to his ticket as Lieberman.
Bush will get two more chances with Gore, but for Cheney, next week
is the contest. Big time.

 &HT;    Third time not a charm as injured Devers pulls up lame in
100-meter hurdles
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - If you thought she'd break down in tears, forget about
it. Not in public with the cameras running, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   No, Gail Devers was as stoic as palace guard after she was
denied for a third time an Olympic medal, let alone gold, in the
100-meter hurdles. Devers, an overwhelming favorite, pulled up
coming off the fourth hurdle in the semifinals Wednesday and
crashed violently through the fifth barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old was brought to a halt by a torn left hamstring,
just the latest in an injury-plagued career. Devers went to the
start line nursing hamstring and sciatic nerve injuries sustained
during an Aug. 25 meet in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep asking me, `Is my dream over? You're 34,''' said
Devers, who relocated to Atlanta after the 1996 Olympics. ``It
doesn't mean that. It's just one day, one race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each hurdle I went through I felt it more, end of story. End
of Olympics this year for Gail Devers. You guys want me to give you
some kind of big sob story or drama. There isn't any.''
</P>
<P>
   What her injury did do, though, is further weaken an already
shaky 400-meter relay squad, which earlier saw Inger Miller
withdraw from the 100 and 200 with a tender hamstring. It's
significant because of Marion Jones' quest for five gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   In Devers' absence from the hurdles' final, Olga Shishigina won
the gold and Glory Alozie of Nigeria, whose boyfriend was struck
and killed by a car while on a training run three weeks ago, took
home the silver
</P>
<P>
   That's real life. What happened to her on the track pales by
comparison, Devers said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is just the latest in a string of adversities that have
shadowed her career, starting with a well-documented bout with
Graves' disease. At the 1992 Barcelona Games, she was en route to
gold when she stumbled over the final hurdle. A horrific start cost
her a medal in Atlanta, where she was nosed out for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Devers has two Olympic gold medals in the 100-meter sprint, but
she's without a medal in her signature event, the hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   After her latest disappointment, Devers walked matter-of-factly
off the track. No pained grimace on her face. No words of anger or
doom.
</P>
<P>
   Snake-bitten? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luck had nothing to do with it,'' Devers said. ``It's fate.
It's simply somebody else's turn to shine. That's why I'm not
sitting up here crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end. I know if I weather the storm the sun is
going to shine again.''
</P>
<P>
   An MRI detected the muscle tear after the meet in Brussels, and
Devers said a subsequent MRI revealed the tear had worsened after
she ran two rounds of the hurdles Monday. She felt the pain coming
out of the blocks in the semis and it became more severe with each
passing hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could make it through this,'' she said. ``I
thought I was tougher than tough. That I could make the final and
run till my leg fell off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Couch, another local hurdler, went out in the other
semifinal race after finishing sixth. Couch has been bothered by an
abdominal strain and spent more time receiving treatment than
training since the Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Couch didn't react well to the starter's gun, and spent the race
playing catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I panicked over the first hurdle and stood up,'' said Couch, a
Stone Mountain resident. ``Instead of getting out and pushing and
pushing, I was trying to catch people. You can't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of my injury, we didn't train and I took a gamble. I
took a good gamble, but it didn't work out.''

VOILA, AND MORE: BLACK READERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the epiphanies that have smitten book publishing lately,
the most interesting is not the future of the e-book or
print-on-demand or online publishing. Rather it is that there is a
large and growing citizenry of black people who buy books and are
greedy for reading material relevant to them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's column was about a small, new publishing house that
next month will start selling a series of short, provocative pulp
fiction paperbacks, violent and sexual, aimed at black urban
youths, the literary equivalent of hip-hop videos. A captivating
and roguish idea. But something far more extraordinary is happening
in book publishing. Suddenly there are five imprints in major book
publishing companies committed to publishing new lines of fiction
(not romances) and nonfiction by black writers on black subjects,
and three of them have started up this year. Of course, this is
about money, not the sudden awakening of social consciousness in a
business in which African-Americans as editors and writers haven't
counted, with only the occasional exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite that touch of realism, Anita Diggs, the
African-American director of One World Books, a Random House Inc.
imprint, said, ``It's extraordinary, it's great, it's wonderful and
it's book publishing history.'' One World was founded in 1992 to
publish books by and about African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians,
though most of its books are about blacks. ``There's a lot of money
in this area,'' Diggs said. ``We can't write them and publish them
fast enough. Blacks are buying fiction at a rate we just can't keep
up with. What we need now is more black sales reps, more blacks in
marketing.'' One World publishes hardcover and trade and mass
market paperbacks. It produces about 10 books a year but expects to
go to 15 to 20 by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   I would posit that the idea that African-Americans, other than
perhaps those who were college professors, would buy books in great
numbers penetrated the thinking of book publishers only relatively
recently. The voila came in 1992 with the publication of ``Waiting
to Exhale'' (Viking), Terry McMillan's irreverent, rollicking novel
about the friendship of four black women in Phoenix. The book
became a huge best seller in hardcover and paperback, with more
than three million copies sold worldwide, and then was a hit movie.
</P>
<P>
   Karen R. Thomas, executive editor of the new Dafina Books
imprint at the Kensington Publishing Corp., said, ``I think there
was a lot of suspicion that `Waiting to Exhale' was a fluke, maybe
it was one book people wanted to read, but it was so successful
that publishers began to realize that it wasn't a fluke; that there
was a craving out there by blacks for quality books that speak to
them.'' Dafina will publish books in all formats and most genres,
although not romance. Its first two books, in trade paperback, came
out this month. They are ``Souls of My Sisters: Black Women Break
Their Silence, Tell Their Stories and Heal Their Spirits,'' written
and edited by Dawn Marie Daniels and Candace Sandy, and a novel,
``Lookin' For Luv'' by Carol Weber.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five imprints, only Amistad Press was started before
McMillan's novel. Its founder and publisher, Charles Harris,
created a publishing program that included books by Arthur Ashe,
the late tennis star who invested in the company, and Susan Taylor,
the editor of Essence magazine. Harris also started the Amistad
Literary Series, which did literary studies of Langston Hughes,
Richard Wright, Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, among others,
edited by Henry Louis Gates Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Last year HarperCollins acquired Amistad, and Harris remained as
the imprint's editorial director. ``Book publishers lagged behind
the rest of the entertainment industry in its interest in black
Americans,'' Harris said. ``I think there's now a realization that
to a great extent African-Americans are purchasing books, and are
important consumers for publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a real increase in the purchasing or simply a new
awareness that African-Americans buy books in greater numbers than
was supposed? Although it's inferential, it's probably a real
increase. If so, why? One reason is that even before the new
imprints, in recent years there have been more books written and
published for black Americans. Furthermore, Opra Winfrey's book
club has noticeably increased the sales of books not only by and to
whites, but by and to blacks also. Moreover, there is an ever
growing black middle class, and it's the middle class that supports
the book industry.
</P>
<P>
   Random House Inc. has three of the black imprints. Besides One
World Books, it has two new black imprints:, Strivers Row, headed
by Melody Guy, which will publish its first three novels in
January, and Harlem Moon, headed by Janet Hill, which will continue
to acquire and edit hardcover African-American books for Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   Harlem Moon will specialize in black fiction and nonfiction
trade paper originals, with the first ones scheduled for next fall.
``I also want to do a line of classics, with introductions, to get
that work to larger audiences,'' Hill said. This year, too, Denise
Stinson, a black literary agent, founded an imprint with Warner
Books called Walk Worthy Press, which will specialize in hardcover
Christian commercial fiction and nonfiction, starting with three
novels to be published next year.
</P>
<P>
   Now if all this sounds promising, there are, within publishing,
African-Americans who point out that many black authors in recent
years started out in self-publishing and had to hawk their own
novels not only in black bookstores but also in beauty parlors and
other places where books are not usually sold. The fear is that
because so many of the books that will be published by these five
imprints will be paperbacks, the publishers are getting a good buy
at bargain prices. That is because paperbacks traditionally mean
smaller author advances and smaller marketing and advertising
budgets and smaller book tours, if any. In essence, the critics say
that the authors will be doing much of the same heavy hauling they
did when they were self-published. One African-American in
publishing said, ``This is boot camp for black writers.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside, of course, is the commitment of major mainstream
publishers to black writers and to African-Americans who want to
read books that connect to their lives. ``Black is beautiful'' was
a slogan in full glory in the 1960s. It's taken book publishers
about 40 years to catch on. Well, at least they've gotten as far as
``Black is pretty.''

TALE TOLD BY AN INGENUE: THEATER SHOWCASE RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE McKINLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An Eisenhower-era mother with a penchant for eating
cat food. Her daughter, who is so obsessed with getting a puppy
that she simply barks as an introduction. And the mysterious Dr.
Phallus, an erudite quipster whose sole mission in life is to
educate the hero about his true sexual desires (as if the Judy
Garland poster was not signal enough).
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the dramatic inventions on display during this
month's Young Playwrights Festival, which has returned after a
three-year hiatus to stage the work of a clutch of precocious
playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   This year's slate, which runs through Saturday at the Cherry
Lane Alternative Theater, at 38 Commerce St. in Greenwich Village,
includes four one-acts in a range of genres, from Caroline Noble
Whitbeck's absurdist comedy ``Woof,'' to Gemma Cooper-Novack's
story of young love, and death, ``I'm Coming In Soon.'' Also
represented are a coming-of-age tale (Adam Feldman's ``A Mind of
Its Own'') and Sherry Ou-yang's sweetly surreal family comedy
``Fish-Eye View.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival was founded in 1981 by Stephen Sondheim as a means
of developing new voices for the theater. In its first 15 years it
produced the early works of writers like Kenneth Lonergan (``The
Rennings Children''), Jonathan Marc Sherman (``Women &AMP; Wallace''),
and Rebecca Gilman (``Always Open'').
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997 the festival ran into financial trouble and was
forced to cancel that year's series of productions planned for the
Joseph Papp Public Theater. Now, after three years of fund-raising
and with the help of supporting grants from Universal Pictures and
the Douglas Cramer Foundation, the festival has returned, with a
slimmed-down budget and at a new location.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winners were culled from submissions received during
the festival's lengthy hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd forgotten I'd submitted it,'' said Whitbeck, a 21-year-old
Harvard senior, who submitted ``Woof'' when she was 18. ``I'd
assumed I'd never hear from them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the chosen writers Whitbeck says she began writing
when she was very young, scribbling poetry and short stories while
still in grade school. Cooper-Novack says she first submitted a
play to the festival when she was 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a theater brat,'' said Cooper-Novack, now 18. She said
her fascination with plays began when her mother, a theatrical
casting agent, was explaining what various show people did.
</P>
<P>
   ``She mentioned the director,'' she recalled. ``And I said, `Is
he the one who makes up the story?' And she said, `No, that's the
playwright.' And I thought, `Wow.'''
</P>
<P>
   The others said they came to writing slightly later. Ou-yang,
22, who was born on Taiwan and grew up in Honolulu, said that her
play developed out of a single scene written when she was 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the attention span for more than 30 pages,'' she
said, laughing. ``But this just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitbeck began work on ``Woof,'' about that cat-food-nibbling
mother and dog-crazy daughter, as part of a playwriting class in
her freshman year of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher wanted us to do a student-teacher play, but I
couldn't,'' she said. ``But mother and daughter? I went off.'' Her
teacher gave her a B, but the festival gave her this year's opening
slot.
</P>
<P>
   Each play receives a complete production cycle, including a
professional director and dramaturge, an audition process,
production meetings, weeks of rehearsal, a preview period and of
course an opening night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really gives you a feeling of being omnipotent,'' said
Feldman, 21, a drama writing student at Purchase College of the
State University of New York. ``I mean when you see actors you've
seen on Broadway coming into audition for you _ a little
21-year-old _ that's as about as omnipotent as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their early success, only Feldman seems completely sold
on the idea of a theater career. Ou-Yang is studying international
relations at Boston University, and Whitbeck is majoring in
classics at Harvard. Cooper-Novack, meanwhile, is pursuing a double
major of anthropology and linguistics at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their eventual destinies, Sheri Goldhirsch, the
festival's artistic director, says the experience is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A poem or short story you can do alone, and it's done,'' she
said. ``A play really isn't finished until it's onstage.''

 &HT;    Panel discussion on race a hot topic
 &HT;    By Erik Clark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Ohio _ ``Race is a sensitive issue to talk about,''
Ohio Civil Rights Commission
</P>
<P>
   Director Melanie Mitchell said. ``But we must be able to talk
about it to have progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was the keynote speaker yesterday at the fourth meeting
of ``Racial Legacies and Learning: How to Talk about Race,'' a
series of public discussion sessions at Miami University Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effective communication doesn't happen overnight,'' Mitchell
told an audience of educators, business leaders and government
officials at the Harry T. Wilks Conference Center. ``It takes a
little tact, a little training, but most of all, a little effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell suggested ways to breach the subject of race and
discrimination in communities, at work, and in schools. She said
peer study circles are a way to tie personal experiences with
racial discrimination to larger
</P>
<P>
   community-wide issues that can then be tackled together.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses _ especially those undergoing significant racial
change _ can use ``cultural assessments'' that carefully study the
true occupational culture in a workplace and identify ways to make
it more accepting of diversity, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often things are done a certain way simply because that's
the way it has always been done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For educators, Mitchell said, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission
developed a
</P>
<P>
   curriculum that incorporates diversity acceptance training into
preparation
</P>
<P>
   for proficiency tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the curriculum is to reach children at a time when
their
</P>
<P>
   opinions and values are still being formed,'' she said. ``We
firmly believe
</P>
<P>
   that children are not born to be bigots.'' But to teach
acceptance to children, teachers must often come to terms with
their own racial biases, Mitchell cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   As minority populations boom, Mitchell said, ``there's no time
like the
</P>
<P>
   present for people to try to reach out and connect with people
who are
</P>
<P>
   different than themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the panel discussion that followed centered around how
to best serve Hamilton's own growing minority population.
</P>
<P>
   Panelist Mary Jacobs, principal of Jefferson Elementary School
in Hamilton, said she's seen the Hispanic population at her school
jump in the last few years from one or two children to nearly 25
percent of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a great deal of difference, but then again it
doesn't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus is still the same. Every child that comes through
the door has to
</P>
<P>
   be prepared to pass proficiency at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Sparks, owner of The Station, a Hamilton convenience
store, said she's noticed more Spanish-speaking customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (English speakers) are going to have to learn how to speak
Spanish as
</P>
<P>
   well,'' she said. ``When a community changes, you have to change
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Ivy Price, a student at Miami University Hamilton and
president of the university's Minority Action Committee, who got
the loudest applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go out into the community,'' she said, ``instead of
just sitting up here and talking about it.''

 TV-SEASON-ROCKEFELLER- $ ADV01-900&AMP;ADD-NYT   (ATTN: Ohio)  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new season's crop of television shows is transmitting an
oddly puritanical message: The pursuit of wealth breeds immorality
_ or, at the very least, extreme vulgarity. On ``Bull,'' the new
TNT series, the founder of a prosperous investment banking firm is
a manipulative, coldhearted schemer who doesn't flinch from
organizing an illegal trade _ and then foisting responsibility on
somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   The young hotshot stockbrokers in ``The Street'' on Fox break up
their day with quickies in the bathrooms and amuse themselves by
urinating prankishly in coffee cups. On NBC's ``Titans,'' the
latest nighttime soap opera from Aaron Spelling, an heir to an
aeronautics fortune discovers that his former lover is about to
become his stepmother _ and she's pregnant with his baby.
</P>
<P>
   None of these fictional concoctions, however, can hope to
compete in the dubious morality department _ or even as melodrama _
with ``The Rockefellers,'' PBS's juicy (albeit soberly juicy)
multigenerational biographical study of American capitalism's royal
family. This engrossing two-part program, which begins Oct. 16 _
and marks the 13th season of PBS's ``American Experience'' _ serves
up a lavish spread of money lust, religious fervor, philanthropic
penance, sexual impropriety and even bigamy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rockefellers'' addresses head-on the ethical question that
runs subliminally through those other programs: Can you do what it
takes to become rich and be thought of as good? This was also the
irresistible theme of ``Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller
Sr.'' by Ron Chernow, a consultant to the PBS program and one of
its expert commentators, who in his book described Rockefeller as
``an implausible blend of sin and sanctity.''
</P>
<P>
   All these shows come hot on the heels of ``Survivor,'' and the
attendant commentary lamenting the nation's deplorable celebration
of greed, as if this were something new. But Americans have always
chased money with what Europeans used to consider unseemly ardor.
In 1835, in ``Democracy in America,'' Alexis de Tocqueville
observed, ``I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money
has taken a stronger hold on the affection of men.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what's wrong with that? The question may be especially
relevant now, with a clear-cut financial distinction between the
(very wealthy) Republican and (merely comfortable) Democratic
presidential and vice-presidential candidates. Or maybe not. Most
prospective contestants for ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' seem
more worried about paying their bills than the unanticipated
ethical quandaries that might attach to their newly fat cash
balances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the responsibility that accrues to the very rich has not
been an incidental concern for the country's actual titans. Andrew
Carnegie believed that wealthy people should enrich society, not
their heirs, and to that end gave away almost his entire fortune
before he died. He once warned his fellow robber barons that ``the
man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefellers, however, took a less apologetic stance. ``The
growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest,''
John D. Rockefeller Jr. once noted, sounding a little like a
Victorian-age antecedent of Richard Hatch, the triumphant survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller elaborated: ``The American Beauty rose can be
produced in the splendor and fragrance which brings cheer to its
beholder only by sacrificing the early buds which grow around it.
This is not an evil tendency in business. It is merely the working
out of a law of nature and a law of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this same Rockefeller, who also had to bear the burden of
being called Junior, devoted much of his life to giving his
family's money away, investing in medicine, science, education, the
arts and foreign policy (a practice that would provide another
target for the family's critics). He was merely continuing the
tradition established by his father, who said his course was set by
a Baptist preacher who encouraged him to make as much money as he
could, and then give away as much as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Though the senior Rockefeller didn't seem to feel guilty at all
about being rich, his heirs did grapple with their family's
unsavory legacy _ which went beyond the founder's predatory
business practices. The family was spawned by a bigamist and
alleged rapist: John D. Sr.'s father, William Avery ``Devil Bill''
Rockefeller, a traveling salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Generations later, after decades of cleansing philanthropy on an
enormous scale, the family's hard-won respectability would be
challenged again. Its golden son, Nelson Rockefeller, who had
become a national political figure, died at 70 while in the company
of a young woman in what his speechwriter Joseph Persico delicately
described as ``undeniably intimate circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The PBS documentary underscores the impression that the
Rockefeller family has always wanted (but has not always been able)
to have it both ways: To be rich and good, to be powerful and
beneficent, humble and lordly _ to be carrying out God's will while
living well. Emblematic of the family's historic struggle was John
D. Rockefeller Sr.'s decision to house his family in a mansion near
Cleveland with a grand facade and a threadbare interior. His wife
once told a neighbor, ``I am so glad my son has told me what he
wants for Christmas, so now it can be denied him.'' When he grew
up, Junior wasn't quite so harsh, though after he distributed
allowances to his children he urged them not only to keep accounts
but also to save 10 percent and to give away 10 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the sort of unmitigated greed we usually see on
television, a surprising number of Americans follow the Rockefeller
model as best they can. At the top is Bill Gates, who transferred
$17 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and then
there is everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently there is a feeling that if you can't be as rich as
Rockefeller, or even Richard Hatch, you can at least try to be good
(in charity if not in personal behavior). The share of households
contributing to charity has remained relatively constant between
1987 and 1998, about 70 percent, according to the most recent data
from Independent Sector, a collection of voluntary organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Those stuck in the middle class can take comfort in the
documentary's assurance that they may be lucky not to be fabulously
rich. For Junior, being a Rockefeller was often agonizing,
especially after a bitter union strike at a Rockefeller-owned coal
mine that left 45 people dead. He suffered debilitating headaches
and ultimately had to take refuge in a sanitarium.
</P>
<P>
   He instructed his children from the Bible, ``Unto he who much is
given, much is required,'' and once wrote: ``I did not choose or
seek to be the recipient of such wealth. It has not been the
greatest happiness.''

&HT;     HILLARY CLINTON TOPS 50 PERCENT IN NEW YORK POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton has pulled farther ahead of Republican
Rep. Rick Lazio in the New York Senate race, reaching the 50
percent support level for the first time, according to a poll
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in
Hamden, Conn., showed Clinton, the Democratic candidate, leading
Lazio 50 percent to 43 percent. The numbers represent a small gain
for Clinton from the last Quinnipiac poll on Sept. 12, which put
her ahead of Lazio 49-44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the 50-percent mark provided a psychological boost for
Clinton, who evokes strong positive and negative feelings among New
York voters _ both for her controversial role as first lady and her
taking up residence in New York just before announcing her
candidacy for Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this race is going to be close, but it's nice to hit
the big five-oh,'' Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan said: ``Polls have been all over
the place, so we don't pay much attention to them. Essentially,
there's no change from the last Quinnipiac poll.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton holds a commanding lead in New York City, 67-29 percent,
while Lazio leads 53-40 percent in the suburbs, the poll found.
Lazio represents a district on Long Island in suburban Suffolk
County.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the race may be in normally Republican upstate New
York, where Lazio leads Clinton 46-44 percent, a statistical tie.
New York pollster John Zogby has said that in order to win, Lazio
has to beat Clinton upstate by 10 percentage points or more.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 889 likely voters in New York was conducted from
Sept. 20-25. The poll has a margin or error of 3.3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac poll showed that although voters trust Lazio more
and harbor suspicions about Clinton, they prefer the first lady on
the issues. Asked which candidate is trustworthy and honest, 61
percent said Lazio and 45 percent said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But by a 67-29 margin, voters said a candidate's stand on issues
is more important than personal qualities. On the issues, 59
percent said that Clinton shares their views. And 51 percent said
Lazio shares their views.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton leads Lazio by a 61-34 margin on the health care issue,
and by a 58-38 margin on education, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, much less well known than Clinton, had hoped to score a
convincing blow against the first lady earlier this month in a
televised debate. Lazio was aggressive, walking up to Clinton's
podium at the end of the debate to get her to sign a pledge to not
accept television ads financed by political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   But the Quinnipiac poll suggested the strategy had not succeeded
in swaying voters. Respondents who said they had watched the debate
declared Clinton the winner by a margin of 44-34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``manages to excite people for or against her,'' said
Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac institute.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll pointed to poll results showing 52 percent of likely
Clinton voters strongly favoring her and nine percent supporting
her because they dislike Lazio. Among likely Lazio supporters, 46
percent were strongly enthusiastic and 28 percent said their
support was based on dislike of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Commission on Presidential Debates announced that only
Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush would appear
in three debates scheduled for next month. The announcement was a
blow to Green Party candidate Ralph Nader and Patrick Buchanan of
the Reform Party, who have been fighting for a place in the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   _ New surveys showed Bush, the Republican candidate, reversing
his slide in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of likely voters gave Bush a 46-44
edge over Gore, a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll of likely voters gave Bush a six-point
lead, 48-42 percent. The margin of error is four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The polls represented good news for the Bush, who has struggled
since the Democratic convention in Los Angeles last month gave Gore
an edge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gore stumped in Iowa, telling senior citizens in the town of
Altoona that while his prescription drug plan would cover all of
the nearly 40 million Medicare beneficiaries, Bush's plan would
leave seniors at the mercy of health insurers and managed care
companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Winifred Skinner, 79, told Gore she searches
roadside ditches for soft drink cans. She collects the five-cent
deposit to help pay her prescription costs.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore asked her how much she money she collected, Skinner
responded: ``You're not going to tell the government, are you?''
Gore hugged her.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush spent Wednesday in California, visiting a Catholic
elementary school in south-central Los Angeles to ward off
Democrats' characterizations that he favors the wealthy. The
Republican candidate told teachers and students at the Ascension
Catholic School that their institution was a ``beacon of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had spent part of Tuesday courting wealthy donors at
fund-raisers in California. His appearances raised $1.4 million for
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Washington, the chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, said a victory
by Gore would not necessarily spell doom for the Republican
majority in Congress. Davis pointed to the 1988 election, where
then-Vice President George Bush won the White House but the
Democratic majority grew in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you re-elect a regime, you tend to re-elect all the
elements of that including Congress,'' Davis said, explaining that
voters seeking continuity in a Gore administration would feel
comfortable also voting to keep the Congress in Republican hands.
</P>
<P>
   John Del Cecato, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, pointed to statements Davis made earlier this
year that Bush's coattails would enable the Republicans to retain
their slim 12-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like the toughest job Tom Davis has is convincing
himself,'' Del Cecato said. ``They're charging toward an election
in reverse.''

HEAVYWEIGHTS MAKE A MOVIE THEY CAN BE PROUD OF

c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard left Los Angeles four years
ago after selling a script about the life of boxer Muhammad Ali to
Columbia Pictures. (It still hasn't been made.) Howard wanted to
escape Los Angeles and its racial tensions and find a place that
was not only racially integrated, but residentially integrated as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't riot against your neighbor,'' Howard, an
African-American, says.
</P>
<P>
   Howard moved to Alexandria, Va., a small city near Washington,
D.C., where he has a number of relatives. Howard, 38, says he was
immediately struck by the city's complete integration. It wasn't
Utopia, but Howard found the sense of racial harmony ``highly
unusual.'' In getting to know his new neighbors, he asked them
about the source of the city's unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me it was a high school football team that brought
the city together, the 1971 T.C. Williams Titans,'' Howard says.
``And that reminded me of something a neighbor of (civil rights
leader) Andrew Young once said, that high school football did more
to integrate America than the civil rights movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard loved the story and wrote a screenplay, ``Remember the
Titans,'' that celebrates (and sometimes overstates and sometimes
outright fictionalizes) the team's achievements in unifying
Alexandria. The movie hits theaters today and is notable for a
couple of reasons that go beyond its source material. ``Remember
the Titans'' marks a rare foray by big-bang producer Jerry
Bruckheimer into the realm of social issues, and it's also a
continued attempt by Disney to redefine what their Walt Disney
Pictures label will represent to audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer bought the script after nearly every other studio
and television network had rejected it. Howard initially pitched
the idea, and when he failed to find any takers, he went ahead and
wrote the script, spending several months interviewing the coaches,
team members and acquiring the life rights of those involved. There
were still no takers until Chad Oman, production president of Jerry
Bruckheimer Films, called.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's in the hands of Jerry Bruckheimer, this
action-adventure guy, who I figured was going to hate it,'' Howard
says. ``I mean, the movie didn't have any explosions; it didn't
have any asteroids. So I was shocked when he called and said he
loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Explains Bruckheimer: ``I'm a sucker for anything that shows the
triumph of the spirit and grabs at your heartstrings. I know people
look to me to make the 'Pearl Harbors' and 'Armageddons,' but I
like to get explosions of emotion on the screen, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titans'' has plenty of that. The movie, directed by indie
filmmaker Boaz Yakin (``Fresh,'' ``A Price Above Rubies'') bears
Bruckheimer's distinct stamp in its crowd-pleasing emotionalism,
melodrama and soundtrack, which seems to feature just about every
Top-40 Motown hit ever written. But then, as star Denzel Washington
notes, ``this is a positive story about people who came through
hard circumstances with flying colors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Washington plays Coach Herman Boone, who, as a
result of state immigration, is selected to run T.C. Williams'
successful high school football program, replacing the team's
popular white coach, Bill Yoast (Will Patton). The community is
outraged, and the team's white players threaten to boycott. Yoast
initially resigns, but returns to the program to prevent a team
walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Boone must somehow integrate the team's new African-American
players with the incumbent white athletes. And even if he can
manage that, he must then win over parents, school board members
and, most importantly, Yoast, still stinging from his sudden
demotion. That he succeeded is a given -- otherwise, this movie
wouldn't exist. That the events didn't quite happen as shown in the
movie is also a given. This is Hollywood history after all.
</P>
<P>
   What remains true is this: The real-life coaches have stayed
friends to this day, and their good-natured banter suggests an old
married couple who respect each other despite their significant
personality differences. When Boone remarks that Washington has
coached his sons in football (his oldest son now plays for Campbell
Hall High School in North Hollywood) and ``secretly wants to be a
full-time coach,'' Yoast retorts: ``I think he'd make a lot better
coach than you would an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the genial Yoast, a true Southern gentleman in every sense
of the word, becomes serious when speaking of Boone's
accomplishment with the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone could have had a heyday with the football side
of it, given the talent we had there,'' says Yoast, who like Boone,
is retired. ``But you can have the best talent in the world and not
win. He brought the team together. He taught them the meaning of
respecting each other's differences.''
</P>
<P>
   And those are the kinds of life lessons that Disney chairman
Peter Schneider would like to see characterize movies that bear the
Walt Disney Pictures imprint. Howard's original ``Titans'' script
featured the kind of locker room language one would expect in a
high school football movie (see ``Varsity Blues''). Schneider asked
Bruckheimer to nix the profanity, along with several racial
epithets, mandating that the film come in with a PG rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were adamant about that,'' director Yakin says. ``They
were looking for a definite upbeat quality, a certain sensibility.
That's a challenge that I enjoyed. When you have a story that has
intense racism and violence, how do you make it a film for all ages
and still keep the emotions strong? How do you make it a genuine
family film, but in the best sense, where the it will be
interesting enough for adults?''
</P>
<P>
   Yakin, though, says he isn't in any hurry to ``become a poster
boy for Gore-Liebermann.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a pretty colorful vocabulary myself,'' Yakin says. ``My
parents usually cringe when I walk in the door. So I don't want to
say that movies shouldn't have profanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' he adds, with a laugh, ``my next movie is going to
be filled with four-letter words.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, though, loves that he has finally made a movie that
he can show to all four of his kids. (Washington has four children,
ages 17, 13 and 9-year-old twins.) ``They've been on me to make
something like this for years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Bruckheimer, a man whose career has been made at divining
moviegoers' tastes (``Top Gun,'' ``Beverly Hills Cop,''
``Flashdance,'' ``ConAir,'' etc., etc.), believes the PG rating is
not only appropriate given the material, but will enhance the
movie's commercial prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was always looking for movies I could take my
daughter to on a Saturday morning,'' Bruckheimer says. ``And this
one, I think, will have a great impact on children. It goes to show
that even with all the politicians' talk, maybe Hollywood can do
some good, too.'' &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``So far, we've had kidney cancer, breast cancer,
prostate cancer, leukemia and myelofibrosis,'' says Andre Braugher,
reciting the dire list with remarkable equanimity. He is referring,
fortunately, not to his personal medical history but to the ordeals
undergone weekly by the patients of Dr. Ben Gideon, the hero of the
new ABC hospital drama ``Gideon's Crossing,'' which has its
premiere on Oct. 10. Playing Gideon, he says, involves ``a steep
learning curve,'' and, judging by the professional coolness with
which he is now rattling off the names of life-threatening diseases
and risky, radical therapies, it appears that he's negotiating that
daunting curve with ease: Six weeks into production of ``Gideon's
Crossing,'' Braugher sounds uncannily like a real doctor, able to
speak the unspeakable trippingly on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Braugher's fluency with medical terminology is a product of his
own scrupulous professionalism: Immersing himself in the language,
techniques and manner of a high-powered, research-oriented
physician so that he can approximate (for the viewer and for
himself) the experience of seeing the world through Gideon's eyes
is his job, for as long as the series stays on the air. And, he
says, ``I'm a lover of this profession.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like getting out of bed and going to work _ going to
rehearsals when I'm doing a play, or going to the set every day
when I'm shooting a movie or a series,'' he says. ``Not every day,
maybe, but essentially I like the challenge of discovering the
truth of the behavior and the inner lives of all these
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   I meet Braugher at the poolside restaurant of a West Hollywood
hotel on one of his rare days off from filming ``Gideon's
Crossing,'' and I'm immediately struck by how relaxed and
unpretentious he is. (He actually introduces himself _ as if I
might not recognize him otherwise _ and then, very considerately,
suggests moving the table so my New York skin won't get burnt to a
crisp by the midday L.A. sun.) Over lunch, the conversation flows
smoothly enough that I never have to consult the questions I've
prepared. Because Braugher, whose acting style is invariably
described by journalists as ``intense,'' has been so successful at
portraying wary, tightly wound, uncompromising characters _ notably
Frank Pembleton, the implacable Baltimore police detective he
played for six years on ``Homicide: Life on the Streets'' _ I'm
pleasantly surprised by his looseness and amiability.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   (I didn't really expect Pembletonian disdain from him, but the
relationship between an actor and a journalist can be
uncomfortable; I'm always relieved not to be treated like a suspect
in a senseless killing.)
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Homicide'' was never a ratings colossus, Pembleton is
the role most people identify Andre Braugher with; he won a couple
of Emmys for it, and his departure in 1998 (a year before the show
went off the air) made entertainment-page news. He points out to me
that his six seasons of ``Homicide'' represent half of his working
life: He completed his studies at Juilliard only a dozen years ago.
When Braugher auditioned for the series, he had already appeared in
an important supporting role in the film ``Glory'' (1989), and had
begun to make a name for himself in the theater, but his reading
took the executive producers, Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana, by
surprise; they were, Fontana remembers, ``blown away by his
presence.'' Fontana also vividly recalls the power of the first
episode in which Braugher and Kyle Secor (as Pembleton's partner,
Tim Bayliss) grilled a suspect in the homicide division's stark,
cheerless interrogation room. ``I was so inspired by the chemistry
between Andre and Kyle that I went off and wrote an episode in
which the whole hour was an interrogation,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pembleton's crafty, systematic demolitions of suspects'
defenses quickly became the signature scenes of ``Homicide,'' and
Braugher _ one of the lesser-known members of the series' initial
ensemble, which included Ned Beatty, Yaphet Kotto, Jon Polito and
Richard Belzer _ became, as if by a process of natural selection,
the show's undisputed star. He knows that Pembleton was a great
part. ``You couldn't figure out whether he was a villain or a
hero,'' Braugher says. ``Even his partner could never quite
decide.'' But he got restless. Fontana recalls: ``At a certain
point Andre said to me, `I feel like I've done the interrogation
room. The character's too smart, too on his game.' So I said, `What
if he had a stroke?' And he said, `Let's do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The diminishment of the ace detective's intellectual acuity and
verbal dexterity _ his proudest possessions _ gave the actor the
sort of challenge he needed to keep him on the show a while longer.
(He played Pembleton's affliction and recovery with a subtlety
uncommon in dramatic portrayals of disability.) Eventually, though,
as ``Homicide'' approached its 100th episode, Braugher decided that
``we'd told all the stories we possibly could, and it was time for
me to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, however, he would spend just two months of the
next year at home with his wife, Ami Brabson (who played
Pembleton's wife on ``Homicide''), and their two small sons. ``I
was afraid of being too closely associated with a single
character,'' says Braugher, who is 37. ``I'd seen it happen before,
and to people I thought were admirable actors. I felt I was in a
race to get as much material out there as I could that was
different from Frank Pembleton; I didn't want to play another
aggressive, manipulative, self-absorbed prima donna for a while.''
To implement his ``I'm not Pembleton'' program, Braugher in rapid
succession took on film roles as a sweet-natured karaoke-singing
drifter (in the recently released ``Duets''), a thoughtful hit man
(in ``A Better Way to Die''), an elegant gangster (in ``Thick as
Thieves''), a secretive, sexually confused lawyer (in ``It's the
Rage'') and an idealistic priest coaching a black high school
basketball team in the segregated South of the early '60s (in the
made-for-cable movie ``Passing Glory''). He also found time to
direct a segment of the Showtime anthology ``Love Songs.'' All that
furious activity must have helped him distance himself from
Pembleton _ enough, at least, to allow him to play another homicide
detective (albeit a conspicuously less fearsome one) in Gregory
Hoblit's ingenious time-travel movie ``Frequency.''

   Howard moved to Alexandria, Va., a small city near Washington,
D.C., where he has a number of relatives. Howard, 38, says he was
immediately struck by the city's complete integration. It wasn't
Utopia, but Howard found the sense of racial harmony ``highly
unusual.'' In getting to know his new neighbors, he asked them
about the source of the city's unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me it was a high school football team that brought
the city together, the 1971 T.C. Williams Titans,'' Howard says.
``And that reminded me of something a neighbor of (civil rights
leader) Andrew Young once said, that high school football did more
to integrate America than the civil rights movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard loved the story and wrote a screenplay, ``Remember the
Titans,'' that celebrates (and sometimes overstates and sometimes
outright fictionalizes) the team's achievements in unifying
Alexandria. The movie hits theaters today and is notable for a
couple of reasons that go beyond its source material. ``Remember
the Titans'' marks a rare foray by big-bang producer Jerry
Bruckheimer into the realm of social issues, and it's also a
continued attempt by Disney to redefine what their Walt Disney
Pictures label will represent to audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer bought the script after nearly every other studio
and television network had rejected it. Howard initially pitched
the idea, and when he failed to find any takers, he went ahead and
wrote the script, spending several months interviewing the coaches,
team members and acquiring the life rights of those involved. There
were still no takers until Chad Oman, production president of Jerry
Bruckheimer Films, called.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's in the hands of Jerry Bruckheimer, this
action-adventure guy, who I figured was going to hate it,'' Howard
says. ``I mean, the movie didn't have any explosions; it didn't
have any asteroids. So I was shocked when he called and said he
loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Explains Bruckheimer: ``I'm a sucker for anything that shows the
triumph of the spirit and grabs at your heartstrings. I know people
look to me to make the 'Pearl Harbors' and 'Armageddons,' but I
like to get explosions of emotion on the screen, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titans'' has plenty of that. The movie, directed by indie
filmmaker Boaz Yakin (``Fresh,'' ``A Price Above Rubies'') bears
Bruckheimer's distinct stamp in its crowd-pleasing emotionalism,
melodrama and soundtrack, which seems to feature just about every
Top-40 Motown hit ever written. But then, as star Denzel Washington
notes, ``this is a positive story about people who came through
hard circumstances with flying colors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Washington plays Coach Herman Boone, who, as a
result of state immigration, is selected to run T.C. Williams'
successful high school football program, replacing the team's
popular white coach, Bill Yoast (Will Patton). The community s
outraged, and the team's white players threaten to boycott. Yoast
initially resigns, but returns to the program to prevent a team
walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Boone must somehow integrate the team's new African-American
players with the incumbent white athletes. And even if he can
manage that, he must then win over parents, school board members
and, most importantly, Yoast, still stinging from his sudden
demotion. That he succeeded is a given -- otherwise, this movie
wouldn't exist. That the events didn't quite happen as shown in the
movie is also a given. This is Hollywood history after all.
</P>
<P>
   What remains true is this: The real-life coaches have stayed
friends to this day, and their good-natured banter suggests an old
married couple who respect each other despite their significant
personality differences. When Boone remarks that Washington has
coached his sons in football (his oldest son now plays for Campbell
Hall High School in North Hollywood) and ``secretly wants to be a
full-time coach,'' Yoast retorts: ``I think he'd make a lot better
coach than you would an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the genial Yoast, a true Southern gentleman in every sense
of the word, becomes serious when speaking of Boone's
accomplishment with the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone could have had a heyday with the football side
of it, given the talent we had there,'' says Yoast, who like Boone,
is retired. ``But you can have the best talent in the world and not
win. He brought the team together. He taught them the meaning of
respecting each other's differences.''
</P>
<P>
   And those are the kinds of life lessons that Disney chairman
Peter Schneider would like to see characterize movies that bear the
Walt Disney Pictures imprint. Howard's original ``Titans'' script
featured the kind of locker room language one would expect in a
high school football movie (see ``Varsity Blues''). Schneider asked
Bruckheimer to nix the profanity, along with several racial
epithets, mandating that the film come in with a PG rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were adamant about that,'' director Yakin says. ``They
were looking for a definite upbeat quality, a certain sensibility.
That's a challenge that I enjoyed. When you have a story that has
intense racism and violence, how do you make it a film for all ages
and still keep the emotions strong? How do you make it a genuine
family film, but in the best sense, where the it will be
interesting enough for adults?''
</P>
<P>
   Yakin, though, says he isn't in any hurry to ``become a poster
boy for Gore-Liebermann.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a pretty colorful vocabulary myself,'' Yakin says. ``My
parents usually cringe when I walk in the door. So I don't want to
say that movies shouldn't have profanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' he adds, with a laugh, ``my next movie is going to
be filled with four-letter words.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, though, loves that he has finally made a movie that
he can show to all four of his kids. (Washington has four children,
ages 17, 13 and 9-year-old twins.) ``They've been on me to make
something like this for years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Bruckheimer, a man whose career has been made at divining
moviegoers' tastes (``Top Gun,'' ``Beverly Hills Cop,''
``Flashdance,'' ``ConAir,'' etc., etc.), believes the PG rating is
not only appropriate given the material, but will enhance the
movie's commercial prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was always looking for movies I could take my
daughter to on a Saturday morning,'' Bruckheimer says. ``And this
one, I think, will have a great impact on children. It goes to show
that even with all the politicians' talk, maybe Hollywood can do
some good, too.'' &QL;

 UNDATED: ``Frequency.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Braugher probably didn't need to run quite so grueling a race in
order to re-establish his versatility. Everybody knew already.
Fontana, Hoblit and Paul Attanasio, the creator of both
``Homicide'' and ``Gideon's Crossing,'' each at some point uttered
the words ``He can do anything.'' Attanasio went further: ``He's
also game to do pretty much anything. You can throw any acting task
at him. He's like one of those ninja masters, taking on seven guys
at once and dispatching them all.''
</P>
<P>
   I suspect, in fact, that the frenzy of Braugher's
post-``Homicide'' career has less to do with proving something to
producers and directors than with proving something to himself.
Between the six-year grind of the series and his duties as a
husband and father _ which he takes extremely seriously _ he has
had to scale down an enormous creative ambition. When I ask him
what roles he dreams of playing, he says: ``Every one of
Shakespeare's heroes, and eventually every one of Shakespeare's
clowns.'' We spend quite a lot of our long poolside lunch,
actually, talking not about television or movies, but about
``Macbeth,'' ``Coriolanus,'' ``Henry V'' and, especially,
``Hamlet,'' which was the play that got Braugher into the acting
business in the first place. He was only marginally involved in
theater during his high school years in Chicago. But in his
freshman year at Stanford, he was persuaded by a friend to try out
for a production of ``Hamlet'' that had just lost its Claudius. He
got the part, and, he says, ``It was the most fun I'd had lately.
And at the end of the evening the audience applauded _ I mean, I
don't think we were very good, but they applauded. I was
electrified.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of our meeting, Braugher launches into a theory
about how the Prince of Denmark should be played, complete with
detailed refutations of several scholarly interpretations of the
character. A couple of hours later he returns to the theme again,
while he's explaining to me why actresses like Alfre Woodard and
Meryl Streep inspire him more than male actors do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actresses are vastly more interesting to me,'' he says. ``What
happens with men is that there's a code of behavior that crushes
various aspects of the masculine personality. There's behavior
that's forbidden: Weakness is despised, absolutely. For example _
to get back to my fixation on `Hamlet' _ I've never seen an actor
playing Hamlet who has dared to be a coward. And I say `dared'
because cowardice is something that people recoil from, and you
risk losing the sympathy of the audience. But if you don't deal
with the issue of cowardice, the character can't make sense.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clearly this is an actor with intellectual and emotional energy
to burn, and the role of Ben Gideon, while it isn't exactly Hamlet,
appears to be complex enough to keep Braugher's fires fed for now.
(And for whatever reasons, the movies have so far failed to provide
him with a role commensurate with his talent.) The character is
based on Dr. Jerome Groopman, a Boston physician who chronicled his
clinical experiences in the 1997 book ``The Measure of Our Days.''
``We were looking for an actor who could combine strength and
command and toughness with real emotional depth and warmth,''
Attanasio says. ``Andre is one of the few who could do that. I
wrote the character as a white, Jewish man, like Groopman, and cast
an African-American actor _ and the character never changed.'' If
the author of ``Henry V'' had seen Braugher's performance of that
title role in Central Park in 1996, he might have said something
similar.
</P>
<P>
   Braugher says, ``This is a role that I felt I had to rise to
meet; it's quite a challenge.'' The script, he says, was exciting
enough to make him do something he profoundly did not want to do _
leave his new home in New Jersey and commit himself to several
months of shooting in Southern California. It probably helps,
though, that the role not only stimulates his creative imagination
but also satisfies a personal ambition: ``I want to show my sons
images of black men in America who are fundamentally intelligent,
articulate, decent men. Sometimes I feel as if I have a duty to
combat the ritual demonization of African-American males.''
</P>
<P>
   That Braugher can deliver such a high-minded declaration without
sounding the least bit sanctimonious augurs well for his portrayal
of Gideon: It's likely that the actor will rise to meet this noble
character without allowing his feet to leave the ground. The role
might even lay to rest the uneasy ghost of Frank Pembleton. In
``Gideon's Crossing,'' Andre Braugher is once again playing a
tenacious and sharp-witted investigator, but this character is
searching for more elusive truths than Pembleton ever did, and
confronting destructive forces that can't be cajoled or browbeaten
into giving up their secrets.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, this part should have enough depth and variety
to keep Braugher's restless imagination occupied while he readies
himself for the Macbeth, the Coriolanus, perhaps the Hamlet in his
future. As he obviously understands, in an actor's life the
readiness is all.

`DEAD MAN WALKING':   A STAR MEZZO ROLE FINDS A STAR MEZZO TO SING
IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Calif., N. Mex., Texas, France) 
(For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
David Mermelstein writes about music for The New Criterion.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The American mezzo-soprano Susan Graham has for
the better part of a decade impressed audiences with her creamy
singing and chiseled characterizations, sharing the stage with
stars like Renee Fleming, Thomas Hampson and Dawn Upshaw, and
consistently earning reviews as strong as theirs. In December,
Graham gained new prominence in John Harbison's ``Great Gatsby'' at
the Metropolitan Opera. Now she is ready for her close-up, at the
center of another new work, Jake Heggie's ``Dead Man Walking,''
which opens on Saturday at the San Francisco Opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead Man Walking,'' with a libretto by the playwright Terrence
McNally, is based on Sister Helen Prejean's book of the same name,
which also inspired a 1995 movie that earned the actress Susan
Sarandon an Oscar. It tells of Prejean's attempts to save the soul
of a murderer sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   The opera is confrontational, Graham said last month, during
rehearsals here at the War Memorial Opera House. ``It makes you go
places you might not ordinarily go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead Man Walking'' is the first opera by Heggie, who has
mostly written art songs for reigning divas, especially the
mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade. Graham, who had never sung any
of his songs, said she was surprised when Heggie approached her
about his opera, and daunted by the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jake told me of the project over a cup of coffee in the
summer of 1997, I dissolved in tears,'' she recalled. ``I said, `I
can't do it.' But Jake persuaded me otherwise. He told me that
because of my reaction to the description, I'd be perfect for the
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Heggie had his heart set on Graham nearly from the start. ``I
originally offered the role to Flicka,'' Heggie said, referring to
von Stade, ``but she declined in favor of someone younger. And so
Terrence and Patrick Summers, who will conduct, and I immediately
thought of Susan. We were after a Janet Baker type.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Stade will sing the supporting role of the killer's mother
and has only kind words for Graham, whose career echoes her own.
``I think the world of Susan,'' she said. ``Everybody does. She has
a terrifically warm voice, but it's also incredibly clear.'' Von
Stade describes Graham as ``sano,'' Italian for ``healthy'' or
``wholesome,'' a term not often applied to opera singers.
</P>
<P>
   For McNally, a longtime opera enthusiast, Graham's naturalism is
an asset. ``She is one of those opera singers who don't sound like
opera singers,'' he said. McNally collaborated with the composer
Robert Beaser on one act of the trilogy ``Central Park,'' which had
its debut last year, but ``Dead Man Walking'' represents his first
full-scale libretto. ``When Susan sings, it's like she's talking,''
he added. ``Her expression is so unforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 40, speaks excitedly of playing the protagonist in a new
opera, an honor seldom accorded a mezzo. ``I normally play Eve
Arden,'' she said. ``I don't usually get to play Bette Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   There are hurdles. ``To portray a living person is a special
challenge,'' Graham said. ``And the music is not as simple as it
sounds. Part of it is very middle range, speech rhythms and the
like. But it is never on a beat, and was very hard to learn,
because it goes against what you hear in the orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the incendiary issues at the heart of the opera.
``Dead Man Walking'' deals with the death penalty, and debates
forgiveness and redemption for killers. Its themes are the stuff of
heated arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both positions are represented with great intensity,''
Graham said. ``But Sister Helen is decidedly against the death
penalty, and she gets more air time, so there is a slant in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who was born in Roswell, N.M., moved to Midland, Texas,
when she was 13. She attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock and
earned a master's degree in opera performance at the Manhattan
School of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice is light for a mezzo, her lyric timbre possessing
something of a soprano's brightness; she could never be mistaken
for a contralto. Her signature roles include Cherubino in Mozart's
``Nozze di Figaro,'' Octavian in Strauss' ``Rosenkavalier,''
Charlotte in Massenet's ``Werther'' and, recently, Iphigenie in
Gluck's ``Iphigenie en Tauride.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's performances in ``Rosenkavalier'' have won special
praise, as at the Met in January. ``It was as if suddenly everyone
had discovered that Octavian is the title character in this
opera,'' Graham said. Bernard Holland, in The New York Times,
praised her ``clear, assertive voice,'' adding that she ``looked
the perfect Octavian.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Graham's physique received mention. A
handsome woman who stands 5 feet 10 inches (not 6 feet, as
sometimes reported), she cuts an excellent figure on stage.
Although artists can take little credit for what nature bestows,
Graham has used her stature to enrich her portrayals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that matters most to me is realism,'' she said. ``I
don't care if I'm playing a 17-year-old boy, an unhappily married
woman or a nun.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham first gained wide recognition three years ago, with her
debut solo recording, a Berlioz recital from Sony Classical, which
included ``Les Nuits d'Ete.'' The Sunday Telegraph of London called
it ``one of the finest recorded performances of Berlioz's evocative
and haunting song cycle.'' Graham acknowledged that ``it was some
sort of turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Sony issued her collection of perfumed songs by
Reynaldo Hahn, also well received. Von Stade termed the record ``my
idea of sensational singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham is now under exclusive contract to the French label
Erato, which recently released her CD of songs by Ned Rorem. Erato
has also issued a live recording of Handel's ``Alcina'' at the
Paris Opera with Graham, Fleming and the soprano Natalie Dessay.
Future discs will offer opera arias by Mozart and Gluck, and
selections from French operettas.
</P>
<P>
   As Graham looks beyond ``Dead Man Walking,'' she sees, among
other things, the challenging role of Dido in a production of
Berlioz's ``Troyens'' at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris in 2004.
``That's the goal, the Everest,'' she said. ``It's the closest you
get to singing Wagner without singing Wagner. It contains lyricism,
vulnerability, pain and nobility.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about the recent proliferation of
high-profile mezzos, a list that always starts with Cecilia Bartoli
and includes singers like Vesselina Kasarova, Jennifer Larmore and
Anne Sofie von Otter. Never, surely, have more of them
simultaneously occupied a place in the public consciousness. Yet
Graham is unfazed by what some might consider competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of mezzos throughout my career,'' she
said. ``But everyone has her own specialty. Only Vesselina and Anne
Sofie overlap somewhat with me, and so much neglected material has
been rediscovered.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Graham is probably right. Changing conditions require
recalibrated expectations. With new operas like ``Dead Man
Walking'' favoring mezzos over sopranos, this voice type has
obviously attained increased status. As Graham put it, ``I guess
we're Eve Arden no more.''

MANY PARENTS SAY ISSUE OF VIOLENCE IN MEDIA WILL NOT INFLUENCE
THEIR VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich.)   By JACQUES STEINBERG  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAND, Mich. _ Overwhelmed by the competing proposals in a
tight presidential race, Michael Horst grabbed a sheet of paper
during the evening news the other night and drew a line down the
middle. He wrote ``Gore'' on the left, ``Bush'' on the right, and
then rated the candidates' positions, drawing a plus sign in the
Bush column next to capital punishment and a minus sign next to the
Texas governor's education record.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere did he mention an issue that has been the focus of
much moralizing on the campaign trail: sex and violence in movies
and popular music, and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Though Horst, 39, said he had agonized over how his 11-year-old
daughter and 8-year-old son were being affected by the seepage of
nudity and mayhem into what they watch and hear, he stressed that
he wasn't looking to politicians for answers. It was, he said,
something he could best grapple with on his own, however
imperfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't feel anything they say on this is going to
influence me one way or the other,'' said Horst, a theft prevention
manager for the Rite Aid chain of drugstores. ``What decision they
make is not going to affect what my children see.''
</P>
<P>
   Horst's sentiments echoed through more than a dozen other
interviews with parents of adolescents in Westland, a solidly
middle-class suburb of Detroit that, like the rest of this state,
is considered a battleground in the presidential race. Neither
Republicans nor Democrats dominate here _ Westlanders supported
President Clinton, a Democrat, in 1992 and 1996, and Gov. John
Engler, a Republican, in 1994 and 1998 _ and nearly everyone
interviewed said that they had not decided who they would vote for
in November.
</P>
<P>
   But as they shopped for milk at Kroger's, ate ice cream at the
Westland Mall, sat in the bleachers at the Westland Sports Arena or
even waited for an adjustment at Shunkwiler Chiropractic, most
parents agreed that it was their responsibility _ and not that of
the president, Congress or even Hollywood _ to filter what reaches
their children. The candidates, they suggested, should save their
breath for the economy and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all of the parents conceded that they regularly crossed or
blurred the borders between acceptable and unacceptable content.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Palise, 44, a homemaker whose husband is a tool-and-die
maker at the Ford plant in Rawnsonville, said that she tried to
shield her son Anthony, 12, from nudity and bad language in movies.
But the other day, after skimming a review of ``The Watcher'' to
gauge its appropriateness for her son, she decided to take him to
see the R-rated film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was about a serial killer,'' she said,
loading groceries into her customized van. ``I thought it was about
a stalker.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Palise regretted asking Anthony to come along, he was
ambivalent. ``I fell asleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That even the sturdiest dams erected by parents can occasionally
spring holes was obvious as Phyllis Blackman shopped for gospel
records at Record Town in the Westland Mall with her 16-year-old
daughter, La Toya Hamilton. Blackman said she had a zero-tolerance
policy against rap _ unless it was the feel-good rap of the
Hollywood star Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't play the stupid stuff in the house,'' the mother
said.
</P>
<P>
   But as La Toya sought out a compact disc by the gospel singer
Yolanda Adams, an artist whom both mother and daughter adore, the
daughter said she also enjoyed the music of the slain rapper Tupac
Shakur, which, she admitted, is layered with references to ``sex,
bad-mouthing of some females, violence and killing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she had it,'' the mother said. ``It's not something she
continues to listen to on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Horst, the Rite Aid manager, said he ``blew my cork''
when he discovered that his 8-year-old son had seen a PG-rated
``Austin Powers'' video at a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything with Austin Powers has a sexual connotation, and I
got hit with a lot of questions an 8-year-old shouldn't be
asking,'' Horst said, watching from a bench at the arena as the boy
scrimmaged with his ice hockey team, the Westland Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Horst said he doesn't hesitate to allow his son to watch
the explosion-laden ``Terminator'' movies, which star Arnold
Schwarzenegger, and he took the boy and his 11-year-old sister to
see ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That had a moderately explicit scene,'' Horst said. ``My
daughter asked me, Dad, what are they doing? I said, He's an
artist. He's painting her. They're not actually doing any intimate
acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Horst, a self-described conservative who is a registered
Republican, and Palise and Blackman, both Democrats, said they
considered themselves ``strict.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost none of those interviewed here said that they wanted
Washington to censor Hollywood, or even Hollywood to censor itself.
The one pledge that they hoped Hollywood would make would be to
swear off marketing violent fare directly to teen-agers, the
subject of a congressional hearing Wednesday, and a Federal Trade
Commission report earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking against more regulation of Hollywood, the parents
repeatedly cited their belief in freedom of speech, and said they
themselves often enjoyed material that they'd prefer their children
not see.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Obsniuk, 48, a mail carrier whose children are 12, 14 and
16, said that any attempt by Washington to rein in Hollywood would
be ``a waste of time.'' As his youngest child, Jenna, twirled on
the ice during a skating lesson, Obsniuk described how he and his
wife, Debbie, an elementary school secretary, enjoyed watching
programs like ``The Sopranos,'' the bloody and often sexually
charged mob drama on HBO. But he said that they were careful to
change the channel whenever their children entered the room.
</P>
<P>
   Having voted for President Clinton in 1996 and 1992, and George
Bush in 1988, Obsniuk said he was undecided between Al Gore and
George W. Bush. But he said that his assessment of the economy, and
of which candidate presented the best chance for continued
prosperity, would drive his thinking.

<P>
   Sitting in the bleachers nearby, Kevin Beahon, 47, a quality
control inspector at the Ford national parts depot in Livonia, said
that he was eminently qualified to screen what reaches the eyes and
ears of his 13- and 16-year-old sons, and 7-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Beahon, a likely Bush voter who has barred his two younger
children from watching adult-oriented cartoons like ``The
Simpsons'' and ``South Park,'' said he had gotten pretty good at
navigating the music Web site Napster. When someone left a note on
the front door for his 13-year-old son, Stephen, imploring him to,
``Get Your Roll On,'' Beahon was puzzled. Stephen told his dad that
his friend was using the title of a song by a rap act called Big
Tymers to urge him to get going to a party.
</P>
<P>
   Beahon went straight to the Internet to retrieve the song, and
after listening to its rapid-fire references to oral sex, male
genitalia, adultery and prostitution, he concluded: ``This is the
crudest thing I've ever heard.'' Though he admits he can't control
what his son hears outside the home, he told the boy: ``I don't
want to ever hear that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he added: ``I don't think a president should be
delving into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Westland residents are fairly well educated, with many
working in the skilled trades or middle management at auto plants
in surrounding communities, few of those interviewed said they
recognized the name of Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore's running mate.
And fewer still were aware that, among the candidates on the two
national tickets, Lieberman has waged the loudest campaign against
what he describes as Hollywood's shrinking mores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me the name again, because I'm good with names and I'll
be sure to remember it,'' said one undecided voter and parent, a
saleswoman at a furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   Another parent, Tracy Hart, 34, whose presidential vote seesawed
from Michael Dukakis, a Democrat, in 1988, to George Bush in 1992
and then to President Clinton in 1996, was one of the only people
interviewed here who lamented that the issue of sex and violence in
Hollywood was ``not one of the major issues on the forefront, in
terms of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   As they loaded their car outside Kroger's, her daughter,
Hillary, 11, quickly corrected her mother, invoking the name of
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that?'' said Hart, a single mother who is an
administrator at a physical therapy and rehabilitation clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, citing an article in the Time magazine spinoff
``Time for Kids,'' responded: ``He doesn't think kids should be
able to go to R-rated movies and he thinks bad music is bad. He
wants to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the mother: ``Well, maybe we know who we're voting for
now.''

WARS WILL BLOCK MOVE TO ERASE POLIO, SUMMIT TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Starting a clock to count down what is hoped to be
the last few years of polio on Earth, global health leaders said
Wednesday the job to eradicate the virus depended upon political
will, access to children trapped in war _ and $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At the global summit on polio, leaders applauded efforts that
have shrunk the annual number of victims from an estimated 350,000
in 1988 to 20,000 last year. But the organizers said the truly
difficult task lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this year, it is estimated, polio will be
transmitted in only 20 countries, 16 in Africa and four in Asia. In
several African nations and Afghanistan, war hinders vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   But health leaders were careful not to point fingers at problem
countries. That time may come, UNICEF's executive director, Carol
Bellamy, said in an interview. ``I do think eventually we have to
identify those places that are the most difficult,'' she said. ``I
think access is shaping up to be the toughest issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Goa Zoumanigui, a representative for Guinea at the United
Nations, told the leaders that they should begin pressuring UNITA,
the Angolan rebel group, to allow immunizations. ``When you think
about armed groups there, with no access to children, you really
need a follow-up program to this summit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The summit was full of self-congratulatory remarks for what
Bellamy termed ``an undertaking of truly Olympian proportions'' _
vaccinating every child under age 5 worldwide. But all speakers
said efforts must now be stepped up. One major need was $450
million in new funds over five years, toward a $1 billion goal.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan reminded summit participants
that the ``last phase of polio eradication is a race to reach the
last child,'' an effort that is expected to take until 2005, or
166,624,816 minutes, according to the 11 1/2-foot-high clock that
was started Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Try to picture that last child, Annan said. ``He or she is
probably under 5, probably living in Africa, possibly in the midst
of hunger, poverty or armed conflict. Our race to reach this child
is a race against time. If we do not seize the chance now, the
virus will regain its grip, and the opportunity will elude us
forever _ or at least for a very long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polio, an ancient disease, caused mass panic in the United
States in the summers of the 1940s and 1950s, spreading through
infected feces in water or by the hands of a carrier.
</P>
<P>
   But with the introduction of two vaccines, one injectable and
one oral, the disease began to die out, country by country, Cuba
being the first to report eradication in 1961. The United States
recorded its last case in 1979, and it was declared eliminated from
the Americas in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Polio still flourishes in many developing countries. At the
summit, though, participants spoke of upcoming initiatives, such as
national immunization days for 17 West African countries for one
week in October and one week in November. Planners hope to
vaccinate 70 million children in that campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the savvy shown by Marie-Irene Richmond Ahoua, a
representative of Rotary International in the Ivory Coast. Rotary
International, along with the World Health Organization, the US
Centers for Disease Control and UNICEF, are the major partners in
polio eradication.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a military coup toppled the Ivory Coast government,
and one of the effects was the cancellation of immunization that
month. About 20 Rotarians from Massachusetts and New Hampshire had
planned to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Ahoua approached the health minister, Bamba Norifere, about
setting a new date, but ``he told us he had other priorities.'' So
she decided to visit the new first lady, Rose Doudou Guei, wife of
the military leader, General Robert Guei.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told her, `First Lady, you are a wife, you are a mother,
you know how essential it is to organize this.' That night, she
talked to her husband _ and it was organized the next day,'' Ahoua
said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Ivory Coast held the immunization days, and
Guei helped to vaccinate children.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this shows you that political will is key,'' Ahoua said.
``Tremendous progress has been made in my continent, Africa. . . .
But where there's armed conflicts, it's essential that the
combatants put down their arms and allow us to vaccinate the
children.''

 &HT;    Overhaul Cowboys from the top down
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ So where do the Cowboys go from here other than
the obvious?
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, that's the only relevant question that
remains after a 1-3 start has them bunking with the Bengals and
Bears and Patriots and Chargers of the NFL. Division cellar
dwellers all.
</P>
<P>
   The future is a scary proposition, and we're not talking
October. It's a won't-fill-Bill Romanowski's-prescriptions kind of
scary. As anyone can see, the Cowboys do not have the next Troy
Aikman or the next Emmitt Smith or the next Michael Irvin in place.
They don't even have the current Joey Galloway in place, and they
might not have the next head coach in place. It's not unthinkable
that Jerry Jones will pull the plug on Dave Campo and hire his
fifth head coach in his 13 seasons as Dallas' owner.
</P>
<P>
   Actually dating from Barry Switzer's final season in 1997, if he
makes a change, the next Dallas head coach would be No. 4 in five
years. That's a heckuva track record. Wonder who made all those
coaching decisions. The two men Jones has fired since Jimmy Johnson
haven't been in demand for other head coaching vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   With all the apparent errors and without heirs apparent to the
three franchise players that brought Dallas three Super Bowl
championships, Jones is worse than hamstrung. Without a first-round
draft pick next spring, he is downright destitute. When you throw
in the fact he's already $20 million over the salary cap, his club
might not compete for another Super Bowl before, say, 2005. The
Houston Texans might get there before Jones' Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Stoerner, I'm sorry, is not the next Aikman. Michael Wiley
makes you long for Sherman Williams. Raghib Ismail is too brittle
to be considered a future All-Pro receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are searching for answers. Some of Campo's staff
were at work at 3 a.m. Monday. That always sounds impressive, but
maybe they need more sleep. Have any of you done your best work in
the dead of night?
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the Cowboys are, they could hope Michael Vick, a
sophomore, stays in school one more season so they can draft the
multi-dimensional Virginia Tech quarterback in 2002. The Cowboys
look as though they would hold up their end of the bargain and be
first-draft-pick-bad again next year because Aikman will be another
year older and, sadly, several brain cells lighter; Smith will be
running behind Grandpas Erik Williams and Mark Stepnoski; and no
one can predict Galloway's post-knee injury ability, not that we
saw much of his pre-knee injury ability.
</P>
<P>
   Wane McGarity, bless his heart, can get hurt in the shower.
Dexter Coakley is having a miserable year after inking a big
contract, practically the only Dallas linebacker to ever be so
rewarded. Phillippi Sparks seems like a colossal waste of $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   As former Cowboys and current San Francisco 49ers linebacker Ken
Norton Jr. said Sunday, ``That's a very proud organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowed and proud.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the only workable plan that I can see. Bite the
bullet, Jerry, and fire . . . yourself. Hey, Daniel Snyder would
fire you.
</P>
<P>
   Get a real live 24/7 general manager who knows the league, who
knows talent, who will be more concerned with building a real NFL
team and not just pacifying Aikman and doing his bidding at every
turn. That way, the Cowboys might actually improve and Jerry can go
about the business of being the team spokesman, the one role he
clearly loves.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is the only owner in the league who also is his team's
president and general manager, although there's Oakland's Al ``Just
sue, baby'' Davis. Since he's been in charge of the draft without
Johnson, three of Dallas' first seven picks are no longer with the
team. Of the others, one is non-factor, third-string cornerback
Dwayne Goodrich. Defensive ends Greg Ellis and Ebenezer Ekuban are
good, but they're part of the line that has been overrun by, uh,
future Hall of Famers Duce Staley and Charlie Garner. The other
first pick was tight end David LaFleur, Aikman's personal choice
and largely ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Jones should seriously evaluate removing Larry Lacewell, his
director of scouting. With his input starting with the 1993 draft,
43 of Dallas' 52 picks made the team but the only stars are
offensive tackle Larry Allen and linebacker Dexter Coakley. There
are some players like Randall Godfrey, Flozell Adams and Eric
Bjornson sprinkled in, but there are far too many players like
Stepfret Williams and Sherman Williams, Shante Carver and Edward
Hervey. Allen is the only player drafted during the Lacewell era
who has played in a Pro Bowl. That's one player out of 52
selections.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at Jimmy's drafts between 1989 and 1993, you're
blinded by the Aikmans, Letts, Woodsons, Johnstons, Stepnoskis,
Tolberts, Marylands and Emmitt, Kevin and and Darrin Smiths. Ain't
hardly a miss in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   What other options are there for Dallas? Whom can you trade?
Emmitt? Maybe. Aikman? No way. Safety Darren Woodson? Certainly,
but Dallas wouldn't get a first-round pick for him. You'd get value
for value with Allen, but losing the best tackle in the game
wouldn't help Dallas any. Pro Bowl left tackles don't grow on trees
or in Dallas any more. In reality, probably only Allen, Woodson,
Coakley and Ellis have legitimate trade value.
</P>
<P>
   No, there's only one concrete solution that could start to patch
up the Cowboys, and it starts at the top. Overhaul is long overdue.

OLD, YOUNG TELL GORE OF THEIR NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTOONA, Iowa _ They sat on opposite sides of the aisle
Wednesday: a young woman who works with poor children and an
elderly woman who fears poverty for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Both want the next president to pay attention to their issues,
their needs. One wants money for schools, afterschool programs, and
programs to guarantee that no child goes to bed hungry. The other,
a retired factory supervisor who collects aluminum cans to
supplement her Social Security, wants to be able to afford her
medicines and have enough left over to put food on her own table.
</P>
<P>
   The younger called the older ``a bit selfish.'' The older said
she didn't mean to be and that she hoped there is enough to go
around. Then they sat back to hear Vice President Al Gore outline
his plans for Medicare and prescription drugs for at least the
third time this week
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much attention on the elderly at the expense of
children, especially the poor children we work with,'' said Amber
Peterson, 22, a Vista America volunteer from nearby Des Moines.
``Yes, the elderly have worked hard. But they seem to forget that
there's another generation that needs the support of
government-funded programs.''
</P>
<P>
   But from her spot at the Greater Altoona Community Service
Campus, a nonprofit facility where local residents can work out,
grab a meal or send their children to summer camp, 79-year-old
Winifred Skinner said she needs support, too _ not handouts, but
some help for the first time in her life. She said it hurts her
even to ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud; I want to make it on my own, but this old body is
wearing out,'' said Skinner, who pays about $250 a month for her
prescription medicines, and who walks as far as three hours a day,
seven days a week, to gather her cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want them to give me the prescriptions,'' she added,
``but I want them to do something so I will be able to afford
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign promises aside, of course, the country can't afford to
fix everyone's problems or pay for every social program all at
once. But the emphasis on the elderly has, intentionally or not,
pitted the generations against one another again. Many young people
say they feel ignored. Many elderly appear to feel entitled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We older citizens need all the attention we can get,'' said
Vee Rehor, 76, a retired school secretary from Altoona. ``We're
just trying to get what we hope we earned. I guess in a way, I can
see maybe how young people would feel that way, but I'm sure it's
not going to be that way forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Rehor, seniors who came out to hear the Democratic
presidential nominee said they themselves have already paid for
Social Security and have already come to count on Medicare. All
they want, they said, is their due and to keep their dignity.
Citing Skinner by name, Gore said he would see to it.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherry Ford, who works the counter at the community center,
said she fears she will never see the money deducted from her
paycheck. Even as a married mother of two teenagers _ making her
one of the 2000 election's most coveted voters _ she said she feels
ignored by both candidates, that she is too young and her children
are too old to be the focus of either campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they need to pay attention to older people, I do,''
said Ford, 39, a registered Republican who is undecided between
Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush. ``But I feel like only the
really old and the really young are getting any attention. Being in
the middle, I don't feel anyone's talking to me or about my
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Odland, a 44-year-old mother of three from Newton, Mass.,
who backs Gore for president, said she has been pleased with both
candidates' emphasis on education. She also noted that Iowa has a
high population of elderly, making Wednesday's talk apt. Gore, she
said, ``talks about what he needs to talk about. There's something
for each generation that needs to be addressed, and I think he's
speaking to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she's only 25, Tricia Phipps said she, too, understands
the importance of making prescription drugs affordable, especially
for the elderly. She noted that she has a grandmother who is often
in pain, and that these issues should matter to anyone whose family
spans several generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our state, which has an aging population, this is a really
pressing issue,'' said Phipps, an economic development executive
for greater Des Moines. ``For campaigning here, it's right on. And
I don't feel ignored. I just don't think young people weigh issues
as heavily as people who are more mature.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gore spoke _ and after Skinner told her story to him and
his audience _ William O'Brien said he would like to hear even more
from the candidates on issues concerning the elderly. O'Brien, 79
and a retired civil service worker from Runnells, said he and his
wife pay $2,400 a quarter for insurance, a payment that is becoming
more difficult to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to and should be done,'' O'Brien said. ``They
should focus on prescription drugs and Social Security, and
</P>
<P>
   young people should care because otherwise one day it's going to
be their problem as well.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Taiwanese director Edward Yang, who accompanied his film
``Yi Yi'' (``A One and a Two'') to the Telluride Film Festival last
month, was almost through answering questions after a screening
when a middle-aged woman took the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know your previous work, and I wasn't sure I wanted
to sit through a three-hour movie,'' she told him. ``But I was
completely swept away by it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was not the first to say so. Yang, 53, has heard many
variations on this compliment since May, when he won the best
director prize at the Cannes International Film Festival for ``Yi
Yi.'' But at Telluride, the praise seemed charged with an unspoken
question: Given the power and mastery of Yang's work, why is his
name unfamiliar to American moviegoers?
</P>
<P>
   The answer has to do in part with money. Since the mid-1980s,
Yang and a contemporary, Hou Hsiao-hsien, have been regarded as
leaders of the New Taiwanese Cinema, their films earning acclaim on
the international festival circuit. Yet the movies' critical
success sometimes led the producers to set prices for American
rights at levels that distributors considered too high to be
commercially viable. Thus few Americans saw them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, with the Taiwanese film industry in trouble, the
situation has changed, with prices falling in the last couple of
years. Last year, most of Hou's films were released, and the
response from critics and cinephiles alike was exultant. Now it is
Yang's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yi Yi,'' which will be shown on Wednesday at the New York Film
Festival at Lincoln Center and then open at the Film Forum on
Friday, is the first of Yang's seven features to reach American
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Set, like all his films, in middle-class Taipei, ``Yi Yi''
provides an engaging introduction to Yang's fictional universe, in
part because of its warm, bemused approach to the daunting flux of
family life. Opening with a wedding and closing with a funeral, the
story follows the wavering paths of a middle-aged couple, their two
children and assorted problematic relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yang wryly describes N.J. Jian (Wu Nienjen), the tale's
businessman paterfamilias, as resembling ``Taiwan at the present
moment: high-tech, hard-working and sometimes depressed.'' While
N.J. deals with professional difficulties at his computer company
and the surprise reappearance of his first love, his wife, Min-Min
(Elaine Jin), takes up with a religious cult.
</P>
<P>
   Distracted by their separate concerns, the couple interact only
glancingly with their children, a 12-year-old (Kelly Lee) on the
brink of her first serious crush, and a mischievous,
proto-philosophical 8-year-old (Jonathan Chang), who gives people
photos of the backs of their heads so they can glimpse ``the half
they don't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang's filmmaking does something similar. With its elegantly
distanced compositions and quiet gravity, his style heightens the
stillness that frames every action, the silence that gives meaning
to words. In fact, the film's narrative is built around the mute,
motionless figure of Min-Min's mother, who early in the story
suffers an accident that puts her in a coma. When doctors advise
the family members to talk to her as often as possible, they are
obliged to examine their own lives for subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   The lanky, youthful-looking Yang notes that the film's narrative
kernel was inspired by an incident in the 1980s, when a friend's
father was similarly incapacitated. ``We went and saw him,'' he
said, ``and I was overwhelmed by the idea that the doctors said the
family had to talk to the father. Because in that situation, you
have to be honest. I went home with the structure of a story about
family, in which everyone has to confess.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took nearly 15 years before Yang felt he was
emotionally ready to tell the story. By then, the concern with
family had merged with a complementary interest: he also wanted to
speak about the many lives of one individual, about the stages of
``life itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of telling a story about someone from birth, through
growing up, getting to middle age and then dying, ``a linear
process,'' he continued, ``this structure represents every age with
a different character.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang's own life has been as variegated as that suggested by his
characters. Born in China, he moved to Taiwan with his parents when
he was a child. He said his earliest memory was of trying to draw
the figure of a man and wondering why his efforts were so crude.
Though an inspiring college teacher gave him the idea of a career
in the arts, his parents, who now live in the United States, urged
a more practical course. So he earned a graduate degree in
electrical engineering from the University of Florida. After a
brief stint studying film at the University of Southern California,
Yang _ who peppers his conversation with references to Michael
Jordan and other basketball heroes _ moved to Seattle and worked in
a lab that designed computers for undersea vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   On his 30th birthday, he said, he woke up and decided it was
time to change his life. Inspired by Werner Herzog's film
``Aguirre, the Wrath of God,'' he moved back to Taiwan and began
working as a screenwriter. After directing a successful short film,
he made the first of three intricately ambitious features that
critics labeled the Urban Trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   With their complex, probing visions of a society struggling with
urban anomie and the lures of money and success, the films _ ``That
Day on the Beach'' (1983), ``Taipei Story'' (1985) and ``The
Terrorizers'' (1986) _ earned him comparisons to Michelangelo
Antonioni and Jean-Luc Godard. In the following decade, Yang gave
the same themes a comic spin in two idiosyncratic satires, ``A
Confucian Confusion'' (1994) and ``Mahjong'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1991, however, with his fourth film, that he secured
his place in international cinema. Drawn from Yang's own memories
of adolescence and of a famous crime of the early '60s, the film,
``A Brighter Summer Day,'' titled after an Elvis Presley lyric,
paints a startlingly grave picture of teen-agers roiled by sex,
imported rock 'n' roll and gang warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Often cited in critical compilations of the best films of the
1990s, ``A Bright Summer Day,'' at four hours Yang's most
expansive, is considered one of the modern era's greatest
Chinese-language films.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the film never made it beyond occasional festival
appearances in the United States. Finally, with ``Yi Yi,'' a more
intimate, open-hearted epic, Yang's meditations on time and Taiwan
will have their day in American theaters.

BUSH PUTS PRIORITY ON CALIFORNIA DESPITE POOR CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1992 President George Bush took stock of his
poll numbers and made a mid-campaign decision: Admit defeat early
in California and devote time and money to states where he stood a
better chance.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later Bob Dole came to the same conclusion. And now,
with every indicator suggesting that George W. Bush is likely to
lose here, many analysts, and some Republicans, are voicing
bewilderment that the Texas governor has not followed predecessors'
footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, locked in a dead heat nationally with Vice President Al
Gore, is refusing to give up in California. Although his campaign
has diverted most of its money to five key states in the Midwest
and the East, the Texas governor spent two days in California this
week, insisting that he can win.
</P>
<P>
   And although his California schedule included more fund-raisers
than rallies, suggesting that he was not primarily here to win
votes, Bush appears to recognize what his father did not:
California is much more than its 54 electoral votes. It is a
symbolic political battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Now home to one-eighth of the population of the United States,
the state sends more people to Congress than any other. This year,
the stakes are especially high: Five of the most hotly contested
congressional seats are here, and those five could determine
control of the entire US House.
</P>
<P>
   To help their cause, California Republican Party officials have
made this a mandatory stop on the campaign trail, raising millions
for the GOP candidate. And Bush, conscious of the message he would
send if he were to avoid California, has played along, well past
the date many people thought he would stop coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the question is: Is he using his time wisely trying to win
California? Then the answer is no,'' said Bruce Cain, director of
the Institute of Government Studies at the University of California
at Berkeley. ``By any logic, if it was purely an electoral
consideration, he would be spending zero here. . . . If the
question is: Is he doing the right thing by the state party? The
answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also stands to benefit from the relationship. And not just
in campaign donations, including the estimated $1.4 million he
received this week. By keeping hope alive in California, Bush also
continues to look like a national candidate, rather than one trying
to cobble together an electoral majority from historically
conservative states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, California is a symbolic state for the rest of the
nation,'' said Scott Reed, who ran the campaign of Dole, the former
Senate majority leader, in 1996. ``Remember back to the '92 lesson,
in August, where the Bush campaign bragged about pulling out of
California? That was a devastating move.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaigning this week in Western states that
traditionally favor Democrats raised eyebrows in Republican circles
and among political analysts. After stops in suburban Portland,
Ore., and Spokane, Wash., Bush spent 36 hours in California before
returning to Texas Wednesday night. He is to leave for the Midwest
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd be better spending time in the Midwest,'' a Republican
strategist said on condition of not being named. ``You don't run a
40-state strategy. You have to hunt ducks where the ducks are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has promised not to follow in the footsteps of Republican
candidates who abandoned California early on. After the GOP
convention, Bush took a train trip up the California coast,
signaling that he would fight for the state.
</P>
<P>
   In that August visit, Bush stopped in several Republican
strongholds and in swing districts such as Orange County and San
Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   This week he went to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, two of the
most liberal areas of the country, places where Bush has no chance
of winning, political analysts said. Cain called the stops
``electorally wasted areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have suggested that the entire state will be an
uphill battle for Bush. The latest, conducted by the San Francisco
Examiner and KTVU-TV, and released Sunday, found Gore leading Bush,
50 percent to 38 percent. That was an increase for Gore, who had
led by 7 percentage points in July.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently thinking of earlier polls, Bush has expressed
optimism of late about his chances. ``I'm going to win California.
I am. Please don't fall out of your chair,'' Bush said Tuesday
night on CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm six points down in the polls, but who pays attention,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's communications director, Karen Hughes, played down the
poll results. ``I know that some of the polls a couple of weeks ago
showed us behind in double digits, but we've also seen in the last
couple weeks how quickly polls change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The California Republican Party, hurt in recent years by a
backlash against former Governor Pete Wilson and by shifting
demographics, sorely needs support, some strategists said. And
Bush, in turn, appears to need their success. ``Bush has no chance
of winning California, but one in eight House members lives in
California,'' said Dane Strother, a Democratic strategist and
consultant. ``George Bush's worst nightmare is that he loses and
the House turns Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Another nightmare, Cain said, is that the Republican Party in
California collapses entirely, after the recent years of decay.
Moreover, the Texas governor has reason to feel a debt of gratitude
to the vocal minority that has tried to help him here. ``For all
those Republicans who traipsed on down in the early months to kiss
his ring, the least the guy can do,'' Cain said, ``is spend some
time here.''

HILLARY CLINTON EVEN WITH OPPONENT, NEW POLL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- For the first time since her Senate campaign began,
Hillary Rodham Clinton crossed the Rubicon Wednesday, as a
statewide poll showed her receiving 50 percent of the vote _ the
much-vaunted ``magic number'' that thrusts victory into view.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 889 likely voters, taken by the Quinnipiac College
Polling Institute, has the first lady leading her opponent, Rep.
Rick Lazio, 50-43.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the new poll _ taken Sept. 20-25 and released
Wednesday _ is as much a psychological landmark as anything else.
But psy-warfare is a key component of any election campaign and, in
that realm, the poll marks a setback for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, Lazio and his spokesmen have derided Clinton as
an outsider who has no solid appeal to New Yorkers _ and, as
evidence, have noted that she has never climbed out of the 40s in
any opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has. As Maurice Carroll, the institute's director, said,
``What a difference a point makes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the poll before this one, taken Sept. 12, Clinton led Lazio,
49-44 _ a mere one-point difference from Wednesday's.
</P>
<P>
   However, this one point is not merely symbolic. Given that both
polls have a statistical margin of error of 3 percent, the earlier
outcome was technically still a tie. Clinton's 49 percent might
have really been as low as 46 percent, and Lazio's 44 might have
been as high as 47.
</P>
<P>
   With a spread of 50-43, on the other hand, Clinton stays ahead,
even at the outer boundaries of probability _ assuming the poll is
accurate and measures more than fleeting voter sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been sinking in several polls ever since the Sept. 13
candidates' debate in Buffalo. Several pundits, surprised at
Lazio's aggressiveness and Clinton's relative meekness, gave Lazio
the nod in that match. However, most voters, for the same reason,
thought the exact opposite.
</P>
<P>
   By 44-34, the Quinnipiac respondents gave Clinton the win. More
significantly, nearly half _ 48 percent _ came away from the debate
with a less favorable view of Lazio. Only 18 percent had a less
favorable view of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The debate seems to have had its deepest impact in upstate New
York and among voters who consider themselves independents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has had a hard time winning over these groups. But now
she leads Lazio among independents, 49-42 _ a stunning reversal
from before the debate, when Lazio led her, 53-42.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, she trails upstate by only 46-44 _ a
statistical tie. Before the debate, Lazio had a clear lead there,
50-42.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate _ defined as every place outside New York City and its
immediate suburbs _ is generally the state's most conservative and
Republican region.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the best Lazio can do upstate,'' Carroll said, ``he
ought to start looking into setting up a private law practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the contest is far from over. One-quarter of
Clinton's supporters say they might change their mind between now
and election day. The same is true for one-sixth of Lazio's
supporters.

ON A PATH TROD BY SIBELIUS AND MAYBE EVEN HAYDN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Ohio, Calif., Finland, France)  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the great crowd of composers working at the moment, the
spotlight of current events falls just now on the brilliantly
accomplished Magnus Lindberg.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evening at Carnegie Hall, the Cleveland Orchestra,
conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi, will play the new orchestral
piece it commissioned from him, ``Cantigas.'' Deutsche Grammophon,
meanwhile, has released a CD offering ``Aura,'' an earlier piece of
his for big orchestra, and ``Engine,'' for a smaller ensemble, both
in performances conducted by Oliver Knussen.
</P>
<P>
   Lindberg, who was born 42 years ago in Helsinki, has played a
central role in the renaissance of Finnish music that came along a
century after Sibelius. Among his student friends was Esa-Pekka
Salonen, now the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic,
and the two gained a lot of their important early musical
experiences performing in Ears Open, an exploratory ensemble, with
other young musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Lindberg is also a contemporary of the Finnish composer Kaija
Saariaho, and like her, he went to Paris in the 1980s to work at
Ircam, Pierre Boulez's electronic music institute, and meet the
French composers, notably Gerard Grisey and Tristan Murail, who
were associated with ``spectral'' music: music with extreme, dense
and rich harmonies composed on the model of the overtones in
natural resonances.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lindberg belongs to a wider community of
composers. Like such American colleagues as John Adams, Augusta
Read Thomas, Peter Lieberson and Gerald Levinson, he has been
finding ways to recapture the drive, colorfulness and amplitude of
music just before modernism. This has been one of the strongest
tendencies in the music of the last 20 years, to join hands with
Mahler, with early Stravinsky, with Ravel or _ in Lindberg's case,
especially _ with Sibelius.
</P>
<P>
   The link with Sibelius seems to irk Lindberg a little, no doubt
because he does not want to be defined as a Finnish composer,
working within a narrow national tradition. Yet the connection is
unmistakable. There are points in ``Aura'' and ``Engine'' where one
feels, as powerfully as in Sibelius, the swell of harmony striving
to erupt from underneath, to break through to a point of
culmination. And it is in speaking about Sibelius that Lindberg is
most eloquent about his own music.
</P>
<P>
   ``While his language was far from modern, his thinking, as far
as form and the treatment of materials is concerned, was ahead of
its time,'' Lindberg has said. ``In his last symphonic works the
development and thematic work are particularly interesting. Each
theme gives rise to another, according to genuine cycles of
metamorphosis. The work _ the whole work _ is in perpetual
evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like ``Aura,'' or like the new ``Cantigas.''
Lindberg does not use themes; he remains too committed to his
modernist background for that, too unwilling to abandon altogether
his student enthusiasm for Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio and
Milton Babbitt. But his music conveys a feeling of continuous,
urgent movement onward, thanks in particular to the way each
emphatic harmony presses forward into the next. The music is filled
with strong arrows of direction and gleaming points of arrival. It
also draws at times on the dynamo of pulsation and reiteration,
inherited from Minimalism, and, more rarely now, on the force of
flung blocks of tone, of strident dissonances, reminiscent of
Edgard Varese.
</P>
<P>
   Varese was a more prominent model in the work that made
Lindberg's reputation when he was still in his mid-20s: ``Kraft''
(1983-85), a piece of heavy metal for symphony orchestra with
percussion soloists. From there Lindberg turned to investigating
the softer substances in his musical makeup _ the sea foams and the
thick carpets _ and developing a virtuosity in orchestral writing
that few of his contemporaries can rival.
</P>
<P>
   He also turned out to have a rare sense of humor. Though his
music will often suggest immense machines in sound, what those
machines are prone to produce is pure comedy. Like Stravinsky,
Lindberg appreciates the clowning capabilities of bassoons _ in the
first movement of ``Aura,'' for example _ and the big climax of
that work's second movement comes with Oriental gong crashes that
sound at once weird and jokey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aura,'' in four movements, both is and is not a symphony. ``I
believe the overall form of `Aura' would make it appropriate to
call the piece a symphony,'' Lindberg has written. ``Still it is
not a symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of its playfulness and its luminous high color.
For symphonies that are such fun, one has to look back to Haydn;
for symphonies so gorgeous, to Scriabin. Lindberg _ who likes to
think of himself as a classicist, and whose music cheerfully
overturns all notions of musical history as progressive _ stands
somewhere between those composers, or to the side, with Sibelius
and Stravinsky flanking him.
</P>
<P>
   With him, as with other contemporary artists, the magic window
into the past is the computer, and what it shows has a glowing
unreality. His father was a computer engineer, and Lindberg grew up
with computers in the house, able to program with as much facility
as he could play the piano. Though he has now and again used
computer techniques of electronic sound synthesis _ whether in
preparing music on tape or in making instrumental parts to be
played on keyboard synthesizers _ his most regular recourse to the
digital world has been to help him in handling harmonic
progressions.
</P>
<P>
   A personal harmonic labyrinth, built up over the years, has
given him the means to parallel what Haydn and Scriabin could
accomplish with the language of tonality that had stored itself in
their internal hard drives. The computer provides a cleaner memory.
Diving into it, Lindberg can come up with the athletic and assured
strategies of music performed entirely on traditional instruments.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Cantigas,'' the labyrinth is entered at the
door of one of the most elementary intervals: the perfect fifth _
the bare fifth that was the basic concord of medieval music. The
title alludes to this, to the ``cantigas,'' or songs, of medieval
Spain, but it also suggests that the work is composed of songs
happening now, in the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In half a minute, at the start, the music has zoomed from the
simple fifth of the 12th century, sung by a solo oboe, to a
piling-up of fifths that make a modern 10-note chord, swung forward
as the first marker in the harmonic journey.
</P>
<P>
   From that point the music is off, careering with Lindberg's
characteristic ebullience and propulsion, often at the energetic
high speeds that are also typical of his music. There are moments
for reflection, too, and for perhaps a new and firmer melodic
definition. By the end, the oboe, now playing with its companion,
has learned to sing a far more extravagant kind of song: the kind
of song, maybe, that will come in the opera Lindberg has long been
promising.

TEENS AND THE INTERNET: NOT NECESSARILY A 'LOVE' MATCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   You might get the impression that teens find the World Wide Web
to be as essential as oxygen. But a recent study conducted by Youth
Intelligence of 350 14- to 18-year-olds from around the country
revealed that they prefer human interaction and communication.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong; teen-agers like the Internet. They can talk
to six friends at once, never bother with a library and download
tunes rather than harass their parents to drive them to the local
music store.
</P>
<P>
   However, 71 percent of the teens we surveyed said that the
Internet was overrated. As one 15-year-old girl from New York
commented, ``I go to all these sites and they say I don't have the
right programs so I can't see anything on the screen; then I try to
download the program and it crashes my computer. The way I look at
it, get back to me when it really works!''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with the Internet is that most American
households don't have fast enough connections to download complex
programs. As one 16-year-old male from Dallas explained, ``I try to
look at movie trailers and stuff, but it takes like 40 minutes to
download one, and half the time it doesn't work anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   And until every household has the luxury of two phone lines or
DSL, chatter-happy teens may not find that digital dialogue can
replace the real thing. Almost three-quarters of the teens in our
survey said they would rather talk on the phone than use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, what teens do like about the Internet is that it makes
it easier for them to keep in touch with friends and get
information. When asked if this technology makes their life easier,
91 percent said yes. This doesn't mean that they necessarily find
the Internet ``fun.'' As one 18-year-old male college student in
North Carolina explained, ``I see the Internet as my generation's
combination Encyclopaedia Britannica and stationery. It makes
finding out information so easy and I can keep in touch with people
more often. But is it like the coolest thing I've ever seen? No
way. It's still got a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And while e-tailers are trying to convince investors that teens
are the Internet's shopping gold mine, it was no surprise to us to
hear that 91 percent of those surveyed would still rather shop at
the mall than on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Many teens view the Internet as a sort of constantly updated
catalog. They scour sites for sneakers, clothing, album release
dates and other hot items, but often still want to lay their hands
on the goods before putting their cash on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the Internet might cast a wider net than the
average teen's mall, the wait time may be a drawback. As one
15-year-old female from Minneapolis confessed, ``I like to check
out what's new and hot on-line, but I want to go to the mall and
get it right then, not wait like a week for it to arrive. The only
time I buy stuff on-line is if I know I can't get it in my area.''
</P>
<P>
   The one aspect of the Internet where teens find that the reality
does seem to live up to the hype is in music. Teens love the access
they have to lyrics, songs, tour dates and every piece of
information they can find about their preferred tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers have always been passionate about music, but the
Internet allows them to pursue their interest even if their
favorite group hasn't made it to the Hot 100. Although the Napster
controversy will undoubtedly change the future of music on the Web,
it may not mean the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study that Youth Intelligence conducted for MTV of
300 Gen Xers and Whyers, age 14-30, who have trendsetting taste in
music, 25 percent stated that being able to download music has
increased the number of CDs they've purchased, while 63 percent
said that this had had no effect on their buying. The ability to
download may be the easier way of simply sampling music.
</P>
<P>
   So though teens like the Internet, they don't love it. It may
not be until the computer is fully integrated into their world with
one box for their TV, phone and Web access, that they will fully
accept this technology. Even then, given what we know about teens
and their social behavior, it's more likely to be a necessity than
what they consider to be a nifty distraction.

   When the documentary filmmaker Ken Burns announced his plans for
a series on jazz, Matt Glaser, a violinist who had played on the
soundtracks of Burns' ``Civil War'' and ``Baseball,'' started
pestering him about being included in the new film. Burns ignored
him. Glaser insisted. Finally he came to Burns' apartment one night
and pressured him into hearing his spiel about one of Louis
Armstrong's recordings of ``Lazy River.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and did this extraordinary thing, talking and
singing while the music was going,'' Burns said, ``and immediately
I knew that we were on to something new, something that had never
been filmed before.'' Burns asked if Glaser could repeat his
performance in front of a camera for ``Jazz.'' Remembering the
evening, Burns said, ``He's making it come alive and I was jumping
around in ecstasy and Matt's saying, `I told you so, I told you
so.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz,'' a 10-night, 19-hour documentary that is one of the
most highly anticipated programs of the new television season, is
full of moments like Glaser's, striking concatenations of word,
music and image. One of the film's commentators will be citing a
piece of music, maybe snapping his fingers to mark off the time and
singing the melody and part of a solo to underscore a point. It can
seem a bit goofy: seeing and hearing someone sing alone before the
camera, a weirdly intimate and separate experience from the way the
piece is usually heard. Then the original recording wafts onto the
soundtrack, in time with the talking head. What might have been
merely nostalgia or scholarship becomes history.
</P>
<P>
   These convergences might seem serendipitous. But as with jazz,
in which years of study are required to reach a level where a
performance feels natural and unstudied, Burns' moments are the
product of planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new level of filmmaking, and I had to hold off using it
too much,'' he said. ``We're making room for the music and
listening to it on a level we haven't before. There are two
parallel tracks, and we're performing a quantum act by merging
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, which took six years to complete _ and which is
already a subject of controversy in the provincial world of jazz _
will be broadcast on PBS beginning Jan. 8. Burns is calling it the
final chapter of an American trilogy that began with ``The Civil
War'' and continued with ``Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he had heard jazz _ he ran a record store in the late
1960s, and his father had been a jazz fan _ he was always more
interested in popular music, rock and rhythm and blues. But once he
began working on the film, he often found jazz and all of its
ramifications overwhelming. ``On a larger level, I began to
understand that an instinct I had had about jazz was right, that it
was a very accurate prism through which you could see refracted
tendencies of my country,'' he said. ``I found what I wanted, but I
didn't expect jazz's story to be so rich. On every level _
mythological, sensual, political and social _ it informed me about
who we are as a people. I didn't expect to learn so much.''
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly touched by Louis Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed my life, he made me a better person,'' Burns said.
``I had a popular view of Armstrong, but I had no idea how central
he was to American music, and simply how great he was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz,'' reflecting the propensities of Burns and his writer,
Geoffrey C. Ward, subscribes solidly to the Great Man theory of
history. The film investigates in some depth the lives of
Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Jelly Roll Morton, Sidney Bechet, Bix
Biederbecke, Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and John
Coltrane, among others. The biographical stories circle around,
repeating and commenting on one another in a cycle leading from the
turn of the last century to the present. More than anything, the
stories keep leading back to race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this film because I'm interested in race,'' Burns
said. ``Race is the soul of the country, and nowhere is it more
evident than in jazz, where a music came out of the black community
and with great generosity was shared with the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the documentary, race and heroism intersect. For
black musicians, heroism was a matter of maintaining elegance and
creativity under the constant pressure of demeaning and dangerous
laws and practices that could reduce them to the status of
children. A commentator quotes Duke Ellington as saying, after an
insult, ``I put the energy I would have used in pouting and went
off and wrote some blues.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers have been extraordinarily generous to white
musicians, trying to show exactly how difficult it was for them to
renounce mainstream white culture and ally themselves aesthetically
and emotionally with black culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ken asked me about Paul Whiteman,'' said Gerald Early,
the black essayist and scholar whose commentary is a major part of
the documentary, ``I was a bit stunned, because I didn't want to
reduce the argument to `Well, whites stole everything,' which has
already been said. So it forced me to think a bit more about the
subject, to look at what sort of work Whiteman had done to get
where he was, and the sort of honesty with which he approached his
study. Then you find something essentially American in the position
of white musicians also.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward, a longtime colleague of Burns' who was a co-writer of
``The Civil War'' and ``Baseball,'' said that he dived into the
project in part to erase a series of myths that he feels have
infected jazz since its inception. ``I hope that the notion that
all jazz musicians are the same, human, comes across in what we
made,'' Ward said. ``I try to make these musicians people, black
and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns mixes filmed performances and interviews with stills,
moving from generalizations about the intersection of culture,
music and the American community to specific personal anecdotes.
Prominent among the commentators are the critics Stanley Crouch,
Gary Giddins and Gene Lees, the historians James Lincoln Collier,
Albert Murray and Phil Schaap and the musicians Dave Brubeck,
Charlie Haden, Jon Hendricks, Arvell Shaw, Clark Terry and,
particularly, Wynton Marsalis.
</P>
<P>
   One commentator tells a story about Ellington's ability to
provoke fights between his sidemen, then put them together in a
duet, where their anger would bring out an intense performance. As
the anecdote is being told, stills show what looks like Ellington
doing exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   In the six years Burns and his crew spent working on the film,
they assembled 2,400 stills, 2,000 film clips, 75 interviews and
500 pieces of recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It took literally millions of decisions,'' Burns said. ``This
whole documentary is a detective story. We'd go to an archival
source and find 40 shots we could use, though we'd only have the
place for one. Or we'd hear about some stills and spend months
looking for them, only to find nothing. Or we'd find something and
the owners would want a ransom, hundreds of times more than we
normally pay for things, which was often heartbreaking. Or we'd
have to convince somebody. For instance, I pestered Norman Granz,
who owns some rare footage of Charlie Parker, and finally he
relented and was generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard work, and you never know if you're asking a source
the right questions, or if they're holding a gem back for whatever
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Burns had to face the cantankerous world of jazz, where critics,
academics and musicians are divided into hostile camps that can
make the Balkans seem like a cradle of good will. It's a world that
can divide along any number of lines: the relative virtues of white
and black musicians; whether swing and blues are central to the
music; whether the term ``jazz'' has any real meaning. Some critics
can't stand jazz that doesn't subscribe to rules; others feel music
that doesn't break rules is worthless. Among these experts there is
an almost pathological lack of generosity. Burns waded right into
the middle of all this, choosing which advice to take and which to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had assembled all our advisers and put them into one
room, a fight would have broken out,'' Ward said. ``It's not a
documentary that will make jazz experts particularly happy. There's
something missing for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   For Early, what was missing was soul jazz: Burns ignored his
suggestion to include this '50s movement that merged elements of
black popular music and church culture with jazz, one of the last
moments when jazz maintained a large black audience. For Marsalis,
the trumpeter and artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, who
is the documentary's primary talking head, what was missing was an
attack on fusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why he treated fusion and the avant-garde the way
he did,'' Marsalis said. ``He let the interviewers deal with it.
But if it were up to me I would have taken the movements on.''
</P>
<P>
   In what is likely to be Burns' most controversial choice, the
documentary dwells on the first 60 years of the music, leaving the
years from 1960 to the present to be covered in the final two
hours, a fact that is already bouncing around the jazz world and
angering many. Jazz has exploded with new movements in those 40
years, and if it lost its footing as a popular music, it did not
become any less prolific. But the decision, right or wrong, was the
result of careful consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have used another 12 hours to cover from 1960 to the
present,'' Ward said. ``We chose to focus on the earlier years and
not follow all of jazz's later tributaries. With Ellington and
Armstrong and Bix Biederbecke you have titanic figures, terribly
important figures. You have to give them their due.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he saw the modern era, and the definition of a
contemporary pantheon, as the province of current critics. ``That
being said, I'd hold the final episode as an honorable view of
what's gone on,'' he said. ``But I'm not in the business of making
judgments about the present. I simply don't know if there are
contemporary figures as important as Armstrong or Miles Davis, who
belong in the Mount Rushmore of jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to the chagrin of many in the jazz world who see him as
contentious and narrow-minded, Marsalis is, in Early's words, the
documentary's Virgil, guiding the audience through the labyrinth of
jazz history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Wynton after a speech I gave at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in 1991,'' said Burns. ``It was a meeting of the minds.
Later, when he heard that I was doing a documentary on jazz, he
told me, `I'll do anything you need.' In one way he's the backbone
of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he didn't worry that Marsalis' viewpoint would
dominate the documentary. ``I choose these influences, but I'm a
very strong filmmaker and I want to borrow from all these stories.
And finally I make the decisions about what goes into the
documentary.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marsalis sees the documentary as yet another way of advancing
jazz's cause in its birthplace. ``I just hope the nation embraces
the music after watching the documentary,'' he said. ``I would hope
that the nation developed a deeper relationship with the music,
with something that we all have in common. I hope young people
embrace it. Jazz doesn't need to be exaggerated about. The lives of
Miles Davis and Louis Armstrong were real; these are great figures.
There's a lot to learn there about ourselves.''

`SAMSON ET DALILA': LOINCLOTHS, LONG LOCKS AND LUST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Metropolitan Opera's 1998 production of
Saint-Saens' ``Samson et Dalila'' returned to the house on Tuesday
night, having already acquired the feel of a dusty and familiar old
show.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the producer, Elijah Moshinsky, and the
set and costume designer, Richard Hudson, have not tried to capture
the licentious and exotic aspects of this proudly conservative
French composer's take on the Old Testament tale. The stage is
filled with hanging scrims and sliding panels brush-stroked with
lurid reds and oranges, like Abstract Expressionist paintings.
Huge, spiky pinkish cones, weird-looking things, are meant to
represent temples and palaces in ancient Gaza. And the Met must
have sent audition notices to every gym and actors' studio in town
to recruit the roster of muscled male extras who portray the Nubian
slaves in loincloths.
</P>
<P>
   But injecting vitality into this second-rate opera is a
director's challenge. Despite a couple of disarming arias and some
crowd-pleasing music in the bacchanalian dance scene, the score is
mostly a tepid, awkward melodrama. For all their efforts, Moshinsky
and Hudson manage only to put a theatrical gloss on an essentially
inert work.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the opera contains two vocally juicy roles, and the Met has
brought back two veterans from the production's premiere to sing
them: the tenor Placido Domingo and the mezzo-soprano Denyce
Graves. Domingo, nearing 60, is singing better than opera buffs
have any right to expect. He has to work more audibly than before
to sustain his voice, and his softened legato passages sometimes
have a leathery quality. But he seems to be responding to the
understandable diminishing of his vocal resources with heightened
intensity. The poignant timbre of his sound is unchanged, and his
notes are fearlessly dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's hard to deepen Saint-Saens' one-dimensional
characterization, Domingo tried his best to project Samson's crisis
of realization: as he loses his physical strength and berates
himself for so foolishly succumbing to Dalila's allure, he regains
the faith that has grounded his life.
</P>
<P>
   Graves is surely one of the loveliest Dalilas ever, and the
dusky richness and vibrancy of her voice were essentially present.
But she seemed to be singing somewhat tentatively. There were dry
patches in her phrasing, and notes not placed quite as she wanted
them. Perhaps she was having a slightly off night; she should
rebound fully later in the run.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast was strong. The robust-voiced Russian
baritone Sergei Leiferkus was the menacing High Priest of Dagon;
the German bass Rene Pape brought his stentorian voice to the role
of the Old Hebrew. And the sturdy German bass-baritone Falk
Struckmann portrayed the hectoring Philistine Abimelech.
</P>
<P>
   The admirable conductor Mark Elder tried to draw from the score
every bit of delicacy and nuance to be found in it. The opening
chorus for the oppressed Israelites is a pointlessly academic
fugatto, but under Elder the orchestra and chorus certainly let you
hear the intertwining lines clearly. And he brought dash and color
to the bacchanalian scene. Though with all those scantily clad male
and female dancers gyrating about the stage and simulating
copulation, who was listening?

   EUROPE-TAX (Paris) _ Europe is rushing to tear down borders, but
the Internet is toppling some of them even faster, making life
distinctly uncomfortable for European policy-makers. A big source
of that discomfort is the threat of lost tax revenue, because
European nations depend far more on taxes on consumption than the
United States does. So in contrast to the United States, European
officials are pushing hard to adopt a seemingly narrow but
potentially far-reaching proposal to ensure that digital products
bought in Europe over the Internet do not escape taxation. By John

<P>
   Back in the '20s, an invitation to a barbecue at Charles
Toberman's Hollywood manse was no paper-plate picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Mr. Hollywood,'' the developer of 36 major Hollywood
landmarks -- including the Egyptian, Chinese and El Capitan
theaters, as well as the Roosevelt Hotel and the Hollywood Athletic
Club -- threw lavish parties that perpetuated the glitz and glamour
of Hollywood's golden era. At his 15,000-square-foot estate, Villa
Las Colinas, guests were known to play golf on his nine-hole
course, frolic in the indoor pool (a miniature version of the
Hearst Castle pool), and play billiards before dining on tables
decorated with swan-shaped ice sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Invitations to those private soirees behind iron gates were
rare, but now through Oct. 29, the public can catch a glimpse of
Hollywood's heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen as Design House 2000 by the Assistance League of Southern
California, the Toberman estate -- designed by architects George
Vernon Russell and Norman W. Alpaugh in 1924 -- represents the
grandeur of the city's best homes. For the tour, the grounds and 29
rooms have been renovated and redecorated to reflect its original
spirit by a team of more than 30 area interior designers working
around the clock for several months with the cooperation of the
home's current owner, movie producer Kenny Griswold.
</P>
<P>
   Every room -- the eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms, four
kitchens, wine cellar, billiard room, cigar room, breakfast nook
that sports a mural inspired by Pompeii, private phone booths and
music room, to name a few -- graciously re-create a vintage '20s
feel.
</P>
<P>
   And to top it off, Los Angeles designers Peggy McClennan and
Chris Tourney added a room by turning an old garage on the terraced
grounds into a theater where guests watch the stars on the screen
while sitting under the stars above.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the owner's concept,'' they say, ``to create a true
'Cinema Paradiso' film effect that includes remote lighting that
allows the lights to dim and the drapes to open as the movie
begins.'' And to help carry out the theme, the designers added
leather ``smooch booths'' and scratch-coat plaster walls for
guests' signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the main house, where the tour actually begins, guests
meander on the front terrace with its Italian pottery and fountain,
then enter through heavy wooden doors into the foyer noted for a
grand spiral staircase with the 12 signs of the zodiac painted by
Dale Zimmerman on the ceiling, inspired by a 17th-century map of
Johann Bayer.
</P>
<P>
   To the left is the living room, where Los Angeles designers
Tiffany Farha and Joy Stowell have created a romantic young
Hollywood ambience. Using the assigned Design Home color palette of
soft shades of sage, olive, ochre and amber, Farha says she and
Stowell focused on the yellow hues for the room. They used tufted
sofas to represent Old Hollywood and slipper sofas to represent the
new, and then covered them with an assortment of round and envelope
pillows trimmed with beads and handmade tassels with a Middle
Eastern motif.
</P>
<P>
   As the pair put the finishing touches on the room, Farha
explains, ``We made a conscious effort to design the room with
glamour but enough energy for a young person, so we used four
ottomans pushed together to work as a coffee table. It's a new idea
that also provides additional seating that can be moved if
necessary. And if it seems spare, that's the idea, as the
decorating theory that less is more is back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Key accessories, say Farha and Stowell, are large trays that
create one important area by holding a group of collectibles. ``The
tray we used is wooden, but a piece of glass, a big silver or
copper tray or even a sushi tray will work. And speaking of Asian
accessories, there's something very relaxing about them, so we used
several classic Asian accents such as a jade water buffalo and a
Buddha head,'' Farha adds.
</P>
<P>
   Past the living room, guests can enter the spacious music room
facing yet another fireplace with a huge bar at the left and a
grand piano at the right. Designers Holly Higbee-Jansen of
Camarillo and Helene Lotto of Westlake Village have kept the colors
here as soft as Italian clay, with glints of gold and Old World
art, and French doors framed by chenille fabric also seen in the
sofa. ``It's my favorite room in the house because it's so
inviting. 'Come sit with me and talk' is the feeling I get here,''
says Assistance League President Katie Osterloh.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the music room with its view of Hollywood, is the ladies
retreat covered in toile de Jouy fabric, a type of French fabric
with printed pastoral scenes. The fabric from Pierre Deux of
Beverly Hills, was applied to the walls, as well as bed coverings
and curtains by Gail LeVine to create a tiny jewel of a room
accented with an antique French dressing table covered with crystal
perfume bottles and a sterling hair brush set.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the library that speaks volumes about design
integrity. Here, at the end of the foyer, and up a few steps, is a
regal retreat that's lacquered in deep jade over woven raffia. The
color, says designer Jill Kollmar of Beverly Hills, was inspired by
Casa Guidi, the home of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning in
Florence, Italy, and it plus the soft flickering sconces and
candelabras set the mood for this somewhat sensual room that houses
nearly 1,000 vintage leather-bound books.
</P>
<P>
   Adding more Florentine flavor is a massive gilt horse's head, a
vividly colored Persian rug, an eclectic combination of chintz and
leather chairs, and stained-glass windows adorned with toile de
Jouy swags.
</P>
<P>
   After touring the many rooms, guests will no doubt be ready to
relax and reminisce in the tented Alfresco Cafe in the
English-themed gardens of the villa.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. __ An appeals court in London has made a
Solomonic ruling, deciding that 8-week-old twins joined at the
pelvis must be separated. In effect, one twin, known as Mary, is to
be sacrificed to save the other, known as Jodie, in an operation
the babies' parents oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The judges invoked a utilitarian rationale, justified on the
basis of medical testimony. The specialists agreed that there is an
80 percent to 90 percent chance that the strong and alert Jodie
could not survive more than a few months if she continued to
support the weak heart and lungs of Mary, whose brain is
underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   This is a heartbreaking case, and the decision of the court was
not arrived at lightly. But even the best of intentions, on the
part of the state or the parents, is no substitute for sound moral
reasoning. Utilitarian considerations like Mary's quality of life
are not the issue. Nor should doctors' expert testimony, which is
subject to error, be considered decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as in the case of abortion, one simple principle applies:
There is no justification for deliberately destroying innocent
life. In this case, the court has turned its back on a tenet that
the West has stood by: Life, no matter how limited, should be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   While this case is so far unique, there are guidelines that must
be followed. No human being, for instance, can be coerced into
donating an organ _ even if the individual donating the organ is
unlikely to be harmed and the individual receiving the organ could
be saved. In principle, no person should ever be forced to
volunteer his own body to save another's life, even if that
individual is a newborn baby.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the gravity of the court's error, consider the
parents' point of view. They are from Gozo, an island in Malta.
After being told of their daughters' condition, while the twins
were in utero, they went to Manchester, England, seeking out the
best possible medical care. Yet, after the birth on Aug. 8, the
parents were told that they needed to separate the twins, which
would be fatal for Mary.
</P>
<P>
   They protested, telling the court: ``We cannot begin to accept
or contemplate that one of our children should die to enable the
other one to survive. That is not God's will. Everyone has a right
to life, so why should we kill one of our daughters to enable the
other one to survive?''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, a court in a country in which they sought refuge has
overruled their wishes. This is a clear evil: coercion against the
parents and coercion against their child, justified in the name of
a speculative medical calculus.
</P>
<P>
   The parents' phrase ``God's will'' is easily caricatured, as if
they believed divine revelation were guiding them to ignore
science. In fact, they believe in the merit of science, or they
would not have gone to Britain for help in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But utilitarian rationality has overtaken their case. The lawyer
appointed by the court to represent Jodie insisted that Mary's was
``a futile life.'' That is a dangerous statement _ sending us down
a slippery slope where lives can be measured for their supposed
value and discarded if deemed not useful enough.
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue that in thinking about the twins, we should
apply the philosophical principle known as ``double effect,''
which, in some circumstances, permits the loss of a life when it is
an unintended consequence of saving another. But in this case,
ending Mary's life would be a deliberate decision, not an
unintended effect.
</P>
<P>
   Can we ever take one life in favor of another? No, not even in
this case, however fateful the consequences.

GENETIC DIFFERENCES DETAILED, A STEP TOWARD DISEASE CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers have catalogued about 800,000 genetic differences
among humans, tiny hereditary variations that make people tall or
squat, black or white, fat or slim, and may also reveal the
underlying causes of the diseases that plague them.
</P>
<P>
   The development marks a significant step in the mammoth effort
to take the newly-mapped human genome and translate the 3
billion-letter Book of Life into concrete medical advances.
</P>
<P>
   But where the genome project essentially identified the 99.9
percent of the genetic code that all humans share, the new effort
is ferreting out the slight differences that not only give rise to
unique traits but determine, in great part, what diseases they may
face.
</P>
<P>
   And implicit in this search for differences, said scientists, is
the fact that humans are, genetically speaking, quite similar,
rendering notions of race and ethnicity moot.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper in the current Nature, researchers at the Whitehead
Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research in Cambridge, Mass. detail
the innovative approach they used to identify these genetic
differences, called single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs for
short. And they report that they have identified about a tenth of
all suspected SNPs (pronounced ``snips''), enough that scientists
and biomedical companies will be busy for years using the data to
pinpoint the genetic roots of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying these roots is expected to cause a sea change in
medicine, shifting its focus from ameliorating the effects of
diseases to altogether shutting them off by striking at their
genetic cores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now we've been treating symptoms. SNPs will help shed
light on the basic mechanisms of disease,'' said Eric Lander, head
of the Whitehead Institute.
</P>
<P>
   All of the SNP data will be available free on-line to
researchers. The work was the product of the SNP Consortium, a
group of pharmaceutical companies and universities. The
federally-funded Human Genome Project has also identified about a
half-million SNPs.
</P>
<P>
   The SNP data has been flowing out of these institutions for
months, and already has produced fruit. In a breakthrough announced
Tuesday, researchers in Chicago and Houston identified a gene
associated with Type 2 diabetes, which affects 14 million
Americans. The researchers examined a group of Mexican-Americans
from Texas that have a high incidence of Type 2 diabtetes, and
noticed most shared the same SNPs. Using the SNPs as guideposts,
they zeroed in on the guilty gene.
</P>
<P>
   At the Whitehead Institute alone, SNP-based research into the
genetic roots of several mental illnesses, asthma, heart disease
and inflammatory bowel disease is ongoing. Almost every major
disease is being approached similarly at laboratories worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Isolating the genes behind a disease does not guarantee a cure.
The gene for cystic fibrosis has been known for a decade but no
treatment has been forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 million suspected SNPs, the Whitehead Institute-led
effort is likely to stop its work once about a fifth have been
identified. Individual researchers and companies will work on the
rest, as they seek to better understand specific diseases. The
current SNP data gives them a general idea of where on the vast
genome to look.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Variagenics Inc., just a stone's throw from the
Whitehead Institute in Kendall Square, is using the SNP method to
research cancer, cardiovascular disease and other diseases
associated with aging. Using the SNP Consortium data as a starting
point, they identified thousands of other SNPs on the narrower
portions of the genome their work is focused on.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Dykes, vice president for research at Variagenics, noted
that SNP-based science is in its infancy: most companies and
researchers have the capability to do studies that examine only a
handful of SNPs but the majority of diseases are suspected to
involve hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to predict which will bear fruit first,'' said
Dykes.

EARLY TREATMENT CAN SHORTEN AIDS DRUG REGIMEN, RESEARCHERS FIND 
</HEADLINE>

 By LARRY TYE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ HIV-infected patients who begin drug treatment early
enough can restore their own disease-fighting systems to the point
where they can at least temporarily stop taking the life-saving
drugs, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That finding offers dramatic hope to those vigilant enough to
catch the disease at its beginning stages, making it more essential
than ever for individuals at risk to watch for telltale signs. And
it offers critical clues to rebuilding the shattered immune systems
of those with full-blown AIDS, suggesting they someday might mount
their own defense against the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
   All eight patients in the study were able to suppress the virus
for at least a few months after they went off the drug therapy, and
five of the eight still are off after more than eight months. The
research was spurred by hopes raised by four men who have survived
HIV for more than 20 years, including Robert Massie, an Episcopal
priest who was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first definitive evidence that the immune system
can work against this virus. . .it offers an incredible hope,''
says Dr. Eric Rosenberg, an infectious disease specialist at
Massachusetts General and lead author of the study published the
current journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bigger hope is that we can get smart enough to figure out
how to translate these findings into effective therapy for those
with chronic infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading AIDS researchers around the world responded
enthusiastically to the Massachusetts findings. ``It's extremely
logical and very encouraging, it looks like this approach is
working,'' said Dr. Andrew McMichael, professor of immunology at
the University of Oxford. ``The hope is that with a little
assistance the immune system might be able to control the infection
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's subjects are even more enthused, saying it is a
psychological relief to know their body is battling the virus on
its own and a physical relief to be off drugs whose side effects
range from nausea to nightmares. ``Now my body is controlling
this,'' says Mike Burns, a 38-year-old Boston executive who has
been off his anti-AIDS drug cocktail for nearly a year now as part
of the Massachusetts General experiment and has barely any virus
detectable in his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeroing in on the immune system is attacking the heart of the
disease, which as its name _ human ``immunodeficiency virus,'' _
suggests works by undermining the body's disease-fighting network.
The Massachusetets General researchers use military models to
explain how they have approached their task.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a virus invades the body, whether it's measles, flu or
HIV, the immune system generates a set of ``T helper cells''
programmed to respond to that virus. The cells act like an army
general, orchestrating the body's counterattack. What makes HIV an
especially ferocious enemy, however, is that it kills off the
AIDS-specific generals before they can launch their defense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Massie and other long-term survivors the generals not
only were alive and well, they were there is large numbers beating
back the virus, a fact that intrigued the Massachusetts General
researchers and encouraged them to find ways of rescuing generals
in other HIV patients. In a paper published in 1997 they reported
that they had done just that in six patients. All were detected at
an early stage, and all used the three-drug cocktail for AIDS to
build a shield over the generals so they could effectively lead an
attack against the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years the scientists have taken their
research a step further, weaning a group of patients from the drugs
to see if the generals really can fight off the disease on their
own. Results on a preliminary patient were encouraging enough that
doctors enrolled eight others. While the virus initially spiked in
all eight, requiring most to resume their drugs, all eventually
were able to control the virus on their own. One later had to go
back on drugs and two others opted to, but the remaining five are
approaching a year without drugs and with very low levels of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed you can manipulate the immune system to get control
of the virus, at least transiently. We don't know yet whether these
subjects who are off the therapy will do well over the next 20
years but they appear to be doing great now,'' said Dr. Bruce
Walker, senior author of the study and director of the Partners
AIDS research center at Massachusetts General.
</P>
<P>
   This study makes even clearer how important it is for anyone who
might be exposed to HIV to watch for early symptoms, since it is
vital that drug treatment be launched before their immune systems
are badly damaged. Early signs of infection often mirror those of
mononucleosis or the flu, and include fever, sore throats, swollen
glands, and splotchy red rashes. The collection of symptoms
generally is serious enough to require patients to miss work,
although they all disappear relatively quickly and further signs of
AIDS may not turn up for as long as 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone does have symptoms like those and is at any risk at
all of HIV, they should alert their health care provider and that
provider should always think of HIV,'' warned Rosenberg. ``I can't
begin to tell you how many patients have come to us after seeing
two or three other providers who never thought of this diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings offer immediate hope to a limited group of HIV
patients, suggesting they may someday be able to stop taking the
potent drugs that can produce diarrhea, fatigue, tingling around
the mouth, nausea and, in some cases, protruding bellies, humped
backs and rising levels of a dangerous form of cholesterol. The
Massachusetts General researchers warn, however, that the drugs are
life-saving and no one should go off them until further research is
done and their doctors say it is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The study also raises other longer-term hopes _ that, for
instance, a new generation of ``generals'' can be trained in people
who have been infected for long enough that their current T helper
cells have been wiped out. It also it teaches scientists enough
about the level of immunity needed to battle the virus that they
have a more precise target to aim for in trying to develop a
vaccine against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Still, huge leaps will be required to help those Americans with
long-term infection, not to mention the 95 percent of infected
individuals who live in poor countries where drug therapies are too
expensive and early detection is even tougher to realize. Even in
the developed world, larger studies will be needed that compare
this treatment approach to others and to see how long patients can
stay off the drugs without the virus coming back, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those limits, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ``this still
is an important proof of the concept that you can indeed enhance
the immune response to HIV in a selected group of people. It's an
important observation.''

FORGET MAKEUP; THE ``NOW WOMAN'' WANTS MORE _ NOW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trend-spotters, soothsayers and pundits take note: Paula McClure
and her Mood Spa just may be the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, no. This isn't a story about the luxurious
soak-away-your-troubles spot that the former Emmy-winning co-host
of ``Good Morning Texas'' opened almost two years ago in the heart
of Dallas' tony Uptown district. It isn't about that spa's high-end
massages and exfoliations and oxygen-boosting facials and seaweed
body wraps that have attracted the likes of Sharon Stone, Erykah
Badu and Charley Pride. This isn't even about the line of mood
candles (dubbed Balance, Creativity and Uninhibited) and other
take-home spa products that the aromatherapy-schooled McClure
developed for her clientele.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of a smart, thirtysomething businesswoman and
what she realized as she sat at the front door of that spa every
day for a year and became, as she says, ``everyone's best
girlfriend.'' What she understood is this: The women seeking refuge
in Texas Pecan Peppermint Sugar Scrubs wanted more. Way more than
quick-fix, feel-good pampering. They wanted a feeling of control
over their lives. They wanted to feel empowered.
</P>
<P>
   So busy spa owner McClure got busier. And one year and two weeks
later, she had A Plan. This is the story of that Plan, which, if it
succeeds, would make McClure the Mary Kay-meets-Oprah of the
millennium. This is the story of McClure and her vision and why her
new personal growth company, also called Mood Spa, just may be the
Next Big Thing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This begins like many interviews. Two women, wearing suits, face
each other across a modern, clean-lined desk. The office is simply
decorated. The desk holds a laptop on one end, a phone, a few
well-organized papers and a ``Wall Street Journal Weekend Journal''
article on ``The New-Economy Family.'' The simple shelves on one
wall display photos and awards (some for McClure's television work,
one from the Justice Department commending her for her outstanding
participation this spring in Women's History Month). There's also a
collection of books, not so well-organized and giving the
impression of being in use. ``Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. The
Complete Book of Essential Oils and Aromatherapy. Low-fat Lies. The
Joy of Simple Living.''
</P>
<P>
   McClure is polite. Very professional and TV-personality poised.
I'm set to go over the basic background information on her life.
She grew up in Dallas and went to Southern Methodist University.
She began her career as an anchor and weather reporter for Fox,
then became a celebrity correspondent on ``Entertainment Tonight.''
Then it was six years on the fashion and beauty beat for ABC's
``The Home Show.'' Then more TV in LA. Gigs on ``Lifestyles of the
Rich and Famous'' and ESPN's ``Lifestyle Magazine.'' Appearances on
``Murphy Brown'' and ``The Garry Shandling Show.'' Movie roles,
including the news anchor in ``Total Recall.'' Check. Check. Check.
Nod. Nod. Nod. A lifetime in television that ended in 1998 when
McClure married retired Army Maj. Gen. Hugh G. Robinson,
megabusinessman and A.H. Belo Corp. board member, and left her
position at WFAA's ``Good Morning Texas'' to open the spa. (Belo is
WFAA's parent company.)
</P>
<P>
   But then McClure's assistant comes in the room with a videotape
_ and the mood at the Mood Spa corporate office shifts
dramatically. He has McClure's demo tape, the one that she'll send
around the country to prove to news producers and other television
big shots that McClure is good on camera, that she'll be a good
interview as she promotes her Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaaaaaah!'' McClure wails as the tape begins to roll on her
office television, showing snippets of McClure with Oprah Winfrey
(who raves about the Mood Spa concept) and McClure with Barbara
Walters (the ``GMT'' interview that led to McClure's Emmy).
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate seeing myself on TV!'' McClure screams, covering her
face and laughing, and suddenly she's not a big-shot TV
personality, she's someone just like, well, me.
</P>
<P>
   And the interview takes its first surprising step toward
becoming a girlfriends' chat.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, McClure is painting a picture for me. It's a
team of thousands upon thousands of strong, happy women across the
country, driving the black Range Rovers they've earned through
their success in Mood Spa System sales. They are the Mary Kay
ladies of the millennium, getting women together to talk about
moods, talk about mood spa products _ and, most of all, talk about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They are Mood Spa party hostesses, the front line in the Mood
Spa empowerment network that McClure has envisioned and made
happen.
</P>
<P>
   They are the big-dream part of the Plan.
</P>
<P>
   And how will she get there?
</P>
<P>
   McClure's got a product: a 30-day plan with a mood journal and
four inspirational tapes that takes women step by step through the
process of creating what she calls ``a mood of balance.'' She's got
a high-powered president. Barbara Hyder was most recently CEO of
e-commerce giant Gloss.com and a former regional president at Mary
Kay known for her ability to drive sales and profits. McClure's
also got an infomercial and an interactive Web site (''It's my
beeebeee!'' McClure says, as she calls up the site on her laptop)
and has begun to take the mood show on the road with the Paula
McClure Life Balance Seminar Series.
</P>
<P>
   But all this is just the necessary skeletal frame for McClure's
new creation. What will give it life _ propel the Mood Spa System
beyond the quotidian sea of inspirational chatter in which America
is swimming _ is that McClure is plugged squarely into the
zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   Self-help is, of course, in. Home parties a la Pampered Chef are
in. Balance is in. And life makeovers are way, way in. (Personal
coach Cheryl Richardson, author of the 1998 bestseller ``Take Time
for Your Life'' (Broadway Books, $13) appeared this week on ``The
Oprah Winfrey Show'' pitching her newest offering: ``Life
Makeovers'' (Broadway Books, $21.95). Richardson is also the head
of Winfrey's dream team charged with producing a new series for
Oprah called ``Lifestyle Makeovers.'') And heaven knows that Oprah
is as in as you can get, assuring success to most everything she
touches. And McClure is onto all of these things, including, of
course, Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. Home spas are also in. Faith Popcorn,
guru of business and personal trends, assures us in her new book
``EVEolution: The Eight Truths About Marketing to Women''
(Hyperion, $24.95) that such pampering products are in for women of
the future, using this formula: X (more stress) and Y (more cash)
equals Z (more ways to relax). The savvy millennial marketer,
Popcorn writes, will anticipate what women want before they have to
ask. And women, she says, want to relax. And connect. Connection is
in.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-coms (ivillage, oxygen, chickclick _ and now moodspa) where
women share their ideas are in. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As McClure explains her Plan, I begin to understand that events
in the cosmos may indeed be lined up to assure her success. But a
funnier thing happens in our two-hour, two-woman forum.
</P>
<P>
   We get off-topic. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   We discover we're two 38-year-old working women with a lot in
common. We talk about dumping toxic friends, pleasing our fathers,
overworking, men, taking career chances, learning to say no, men,
mutual friends, her former elementary school that my kids now
attend, a mutual literary agent friend, interracial relationships _
and did I say men? We're talking about the things that try to knock
us off balance in our personal lives _ and the solutions we've
found for keeping our own selves intact.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's been by design and McClure is the ultimate
saleswoman or simply because McClure is ``onto something,'' she has
proven her point.
</P>
<P>
   She does know what women want.
</P>
<P>
   Women want to connect.
</P>
<P>
   And when I leave the interview, carrying my new black Mood Spa
bag and feeling almost as energized as if I've been through the spa
itself, which is visible across the street through McClure's office
window, I know it's more than the effect of the Creativity candle
we've had burning during our girlfriendy chat. I feel empowered.
</P>
<P>
   What can the Mood Spa System give women?
</P>
<P>
   A chance to connect with each other, to chat about life and love
and relationships and whatnot, away from the planned PTA meetings
and soccer-game sidelines and Bible studies and book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Kay can give women blue eye shadow,'' McClure says with a
laugh. ``I can give them no blue days!''
</P>
<P>
   And if that's true, I don't need to be the one to tell you.
</P>
<P>
   McClure's Mood Spa will be the Next Big Thing.

STUDY OF PANIC HOPES TO PREVENT TRAGEDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GARETH COOK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Around the world, wherever large groups gather, people have
witnessed the mysterious power of panic.
</P>
<P>
   In July 12 people died at a soccer match in Zimbabwe. A month
earlier, nine fans were crushed to death at a Pearl Jam concert in
Denmark. And several times in the last decade, Muslim pilgrims
making the holy journey to Mecca have metamorphosed into sprawling,
deadly human stampedes _ all seemingly without reason.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a team of scientists say they have built a powerful
computer program that, for the first time, solves the mystery of
how crowds move under pressure, a program that will help architects
and emergency planners prevent panics in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past studies, which tried to understand the mentality of
the mob, the new simulation suggests that human traffic jams are
almost as predictable as the motion of the planets. The human
tendency to follow the crowd, and to push when stressed, can
unleash forces powerful enough to bend steel or topple brick walls,
the authors say, unless architects redesign public spaces to create
a smooth flow of people even when they panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an elegant and important study,'' said Seth Lloyd, an
associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. ``It will
even save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As the world grows more crowded and connected, scientists are
increasingly confronted with complex phenomenon _ stock market
crashes, traffic jams that arise for no clear reason _ which emerge
when large numbers of individuals interact. The crowd study is part
of an ambitious attempt undertaken over the last decade to harness
cheap computing power to decipher the forces that drive these
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest surprise is that panic and human behavior can be
understood in terms of a physics model,'' said Dirk Helbing, one of
the researchers who developed the program, which is described in
current journal Nature. ``Before people believed that interactions
in crowds could only be understood in psychological terms.''
</P>
<P>
   In one famous example, after 11 fans were crushed to death at a
1979 Who concert in Cincinnati, the incident was blamed on ``mob
psychology,'' on mind-altering drugs, and even on a strong vein of
uncaring in the youth of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But the new research argues that the blame lies elsewhere.
Researchers know that, if people are brought close together, they
tend to push on each other. They also know that people have a
tendency, especially in emergencies, to follow others near them, on
the assumption that those around them know more.
</P>
<P>
   When Helbing programmed these kinds of pedestrian forces into a
computer, the result is a flowing dance of flickering dots, each
representing a person trying to make their way.
</P>
<P>
   In one scenario, as people in a room start to push too hard at
an exit, the screen shows a kind of human turbulence develop, and
it takes more time for the dots to escape. In another simulation,
Helbing reported that the number of people able to leave a ``smoky
room'' dropped from 74 to 58 as the tendency to herd, called the
``panic parameter,'' increased.
</P>
<P>
   An even more unexpected result, Helbing said, was that a
well-placed narrow column in front of an exit allowed more people
to escape because people in the back of a crowd could not place as
much pressure on those trying to get out. It's an architectural
concept, he said, that he hopes to patent.
</P>
<P>
   Helbing, a professor at the Dresden University of Technology in
Dresden, Germany, built the simulation in cooperation with two
Hungarian researchers, Illes Farkas and Tamas Vicsek.
</P>
<P>
   One scientist criticized the study for not refining the model
with more precise observations of how pedestrians interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``These parameters need to be calibrated against data,'' said
Moshe E. Ben-Akiva, an MIT professor who has spent years gathering
that kind of information on Boston drivers for a simulation of
traffic flows through the Central Artery. Gathering that data, he
said, ``is the really hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ben-Akiva said that one of his colleagues, an
analyst with the New York state government, has set up a video
camera to record the streams of people that form in Grand Central
station during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers, said MIT's Lloyd, are exploring how herding
phenomenon _ where information is limited, and people follow the
decisions of others _ could help explain everything from the flow
of Internet traffic to the sudden popularity of Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   For fires, though, the theoretical work has produced a piece of
practical advice. The mistake most people make is to follow the
biggest group, Helbing said, which can draw them into dangerous
traffic jams. But it would also be a mistake to completely ignore
what others are doing, because someone else might discover a good
exit before you do. Instead, he said, the best thing to do is to
``follow small groups.''
</P>
<P>
   That is advice, he said, which could work just as well for
picking movies, or cars, or a place to live. The biggest rewards,
he said, come to those who watch trends closely, but aren't afraid
to buck them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INUVIK, Northwest Territories _ For three decades, geologists
probing beneath the Arctic Ocean near here and in offshore Alaska
have mapped the largest known untapped reserves of natural gas in
North America: 165 trillion cubic feet, seven times as much as the
United States will consume this year.
</P>
<P>
   But with gas prices low, indigenous opposition high and
environmental issues looming, energy companies never found a way to
build pipelines to send the gas south to heat homes and to generate
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   This is changing as fast as it takes to read a home heating
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale prices for natural gas have doubled over the last
year, and industry analysts expect that the 55 million Americans
who heat their homes with gas will pay 25 percent to 40 percent
more than they did last winter. And with the Department of Energy
forecasting that demand for natural gas in the United States will
rise by 40 percent in the next two decades, prices may go higher
still.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, native groups that once opposed development of
the big gas fields near here now see chances for economic
development, and are campaigning for royalties and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After a winter of planning and politicking, energy companies,
pipeline operators and Indian tribes expect to announce next spring
plans to build a subterranean pipeline, or possibly two, to carry
Arctic gas to North America's pipeline grid.
</P>
<P>
   Building two pipelines, one from Alaska along the Trans-Alaska
oil pipeline and Alaska-Canada Highway, and the other from Canada's
Northwest Territories, along the Mackenzie River valley, would cost
$10 billion and take seven years.
</P>
<P>
   While pipeline company executives say they are confident they
can finance and engineer the projects, environmental problems
remain unresolved and some conservation groups vow to oppose the
plans. Development also portends radical change for isolated places
like this one-stoplight town, where sled dogs' barks herald the
long arctic night and the northernmost road in North America trails
off into tundra.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments in favor of tapping the gas fields echo those heard
three decades ago, when the United States debated building the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline to move crude oil south from Prudhoe Bay. The
theme is self-reliance in energy in a world buffeted by higher oil
prices orchestrated by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't dependent on OPEC for gas,'' said K. Terry Koonce,
president of Exxon Mobil Production Co. ``Gas is up to us Americans
to bring about.''
</P>
<P>
   Often called a ``continental commodity,'' natural gas consumed
in the United States comes from North America and is delivered by
pipelines. Canada, which doubled its exports to the United States
in the 1990s, now supplies 16 percent of U.S. consumption, and
Canadian executives expect exports to the United States to grow by
50 percent this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, as brownouts hit California and electricity bills
jumped in New York, consumers and politicians started demanding new
power plants. But with natural gas the fuel of choice for 90
percent of power plants now built in the United States, few people
asked the follow-up question: With demand already outstripping
supply, where is this gas for these plants going to come from?
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy predicts that consumption will increase
to 31.5 trillion cubic feet a year by 2020, largely because it is a
relatively clean fuel. Gas, when burned, produces only one-third
the carbon dioxide for each unit of energy of coal, and two-thirds
as much as oil.
</P>
<P>
   While high prices led energy companies to double their
exploration efforts in the United States over the last year,
industry executives do not expect production in the lower 48 states
to pace consumption. Energy companies and consumer groups see
arctic reserves as crucial to meet future needs.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, who bitterly opposed the Trans-Alaska oil
pipeline in the 1970s, are split over building gas pipelines in the
Arctic. Greenpeace opposes them, saying Americans should wean
themselves off fossil fuels and invest the billions of dollars it
would take to build pipelines in alternative energy sources like
solar and wind.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups, recognizing that gas pollutes less than oil, plan
to focus on reducing the environmental impact of the lines by
pushing to have them follow the existing Alaska oil pipeline and
the Alaska-Canada highway.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada and the United States, federal and local authorities
will have to approve drilling plans and pipeline construction, but
industry executives said the rising price of gas makes their case
for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, consumers are going to make a lot of
pressure to have this gas flow to the lower 48,'' said Michael E.
Phelps, president of WestCoast Energy Inc. WestCoast is working
with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. to build a gas pipeline from Alaska
to Alberta, Canada, where it would tie into existing lines south to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some development has already begun, particularly in Alaska,
where companies have been pumping oil from under Prudhoe Bay for
over two decades and sending it south through the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, too, has moved ahead. Chasing what Canadians call
``frontier gas,'' the first pipeline nosed ``North of 60'' in May.
This small link, connecting gas fields in Fort Liard, Northwest
Territories, to the continent's pipeline grid, crossed a
psychological barrier, the 60th Parallel, a line on maps that
separates the settled southern provinces from frontier northern
territories.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada's first commercial gas development north of the Arctic
Circle, Inuvik Gas Ltd. started pumping natural gas one year ago to
houses in this town of 3,500 people on the banks of the Mackenzie
River.
</P>
<P>
   The company is jointly owned by Enbridge Inc. and AltaGas
Services Inc. of Calgary and Inuvialuit Petroleum Corp. The
Inuvialuit company is wholly owned by the Inuvialuit people, one of
two main native groups in this corner of the Canadian Arctic. Their
participation represents an about-face in native attitudes about
energy development here.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, tribal chiefs up and down the Mackenzie River
Valley spoke out against any gas or oil development and obtained a
court-imposed 10-year moratorium that stopped work during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no offices for our chiefs, no telephones,'' recalled
Stephen Kakfwi, a member of the Dene tribe who fought the pipelines
25 years ago. ``Of our people, 75 percent were trappers. They
weren't involved in the process. We had no understanding of the way
that the government of Canada worked. We had no business
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, the federal and territorial
governments settled virtually all native land claims in the valley,
giving tribes legal standing to negotiate rents and royalties.
Today, tribes own drilling companies and negotiate exploration
royalty payments with multinational companies. Kakfwi is now
premier of the Territory.
</P>
<P>
   In January, chiefs of all 30 tribes in the region unanimously
approved a joint statement ``to build a business partnership to
maximize ownership and benefit of a Mackenzie Valley pipeline.''

</P>
<P>
   Their representatives, the Aboriginal Working Group, which is
seeking a majority stake in a pipeline, has hired the aboriginal
banking unit of the Bank of Montreal to secure job guarantees, job
training, service contracts and rent payments from pipeline
companies. In May, Kakfwi flew to Calgary, Alberta, where he
pitched the pipeline to the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed? We are now in control, the majority of the
territorial legislature is aboriginal,'' Kakfwi said in
Yellowknife, the territorial capital. ``The nations have got their
own land back. They have businesses. They have money.''
</P>
<P>
   With energy company engineers studying three possible routes
from the Arctic Ocean to existing pipelines in Alberta, some
environmentalists question spending billions of dollars to
perpetuate North America's dependency on fossil fuels. They stress
that arctic gas would only feed U.S. needs for less than one
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drilling for new oil, or putting in natural gas pipelines, is
not how we are going to get energy security,'' said Melanie Duchin,
a member of Greenpeace. ``Rather than opening up a fossil-fuel
frontier, such as trying to drill for these immense natural gas
reserves, the money should go for developing renewable energy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Canadian Arctic, however, Greenpeace has little
credibility with aboriginal leaders. They say the group's anti-fur
campaigns destroyed their traditional hunting and trapping
economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people were Stone Age people 30 years ago,'' Kakfwi said.
``We have embarked on a journey and we can't turn back. To say,
`You should be a happy little tree hugger, choking rabbits, while
everyone else exploits your diamonds and gas' _ no, I don't think
so.''
</P>
<P>
   In her office a block from Inuvik's stoplight, Nellie J.
Cournoyea, chairman of the Inuvialuit Regional Corp., dismissed
environmentalists' objections. ``If these people want to be useful,
they should start cleaning up the south, stop the pollution that is
damaging to the arctic wildlife and environment,'' she said,
referring to windborne soot and smog.
</P>
<P>
   With northern native support solid and southern consumer support
expected to solidify after this winter's home heating bills go out,
the race is now on to to see who builds an arctic gas pipeline
first.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14, rival companies presented proposals in Washington
for a pipeline through Alaska to the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, which is run by Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
Forrest Hoglund, chairman of Arctic Resources Co. of Houston, said
the multibillion-dollar race to build a gas line out of the Arctic
was the 21st-century ``equivalent of the first railroad to
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Alaskans are eager to see a gas pipeline built, because oil
production on the North Slope near Prudhoe Bay dropped by half in
the 1990s. As royalties dwindle, Alaskans face big tax increases in
five years if there is no gas development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska is extremely interested in getting the gas out,''
Koonce, the Exxon Mobil executive, said after testifying in
Washington. ``Frankly, we are, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker Eskew, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, said
the Republican presidential candidate did not have a position on
the pipeline proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of an Alaskan route said they could start pumping gas
south in six years. They said they could work so quickly because
permits and an international regulatory framework have existed
since the late 1970s to place a gas pipeline parallel to the
Trans-Alaska oil pipeline, and then east, along the Alaska-Canada
Highway.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, improved telecommunications, high-speed
mechanized welding and the use of rock saws to cut permafrost have
combined to make pipeline building faster and cheaper than ever,
said Phelps, the executive at WestCoast, one of the companies
planning to build a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The route using the Alaska pipeline and highway makes sense,
because you are not dividing the wilderness any further; you are
using existing corridors,'' said Charles M. Clusen, an Alaska
policy analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New
York-based environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Executives for BP Amoco, one of the largest gas owners in
Alaska, have said they expect to make a decision on building a gas
pipeline by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1,700-mile Alaska-Yukon route, with a price tag around
$8 billion, would leave the Canadian arctic gas reserves stranded.
</P>
<P>
   To link the two reserves, other companies have proposed a
second, $3 billion pipeline up the Mackenzie River valley and 300
miles west to Prudhoe, 15 feet below the floor of the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Although this route could provide cheaper gas to consumers,
environmentalists oppose a submerged line, saying it could endanger
caribou and polar bear populations. Many Alaskans oppose a
submarine pipeline because it would deprive their towns and cities
of piped natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   In March, four major companies that own gas in the Canadian
Arctic _ Imperial Oil Ltd., Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., Shell
Canada Ltd. and Mobil Oil Canada Ltd. _ plan to release results of
a feasibility study for a Mackenzie Valley pipeline.

ANALYSTS SAY FLEETBOSTON-SUMMIT BANCORP DEAL IN THE WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Terrence Murray, the shopaholic chief executive of
FleetBoston Financial Corp., has reportedly settled on his next big
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Fleet is in acquisition talks with New Jersey's
Summit Bancorp swirled in banking cirles Wednesday, sending Fleet
shares lower but giving Summit's a boost for the second day in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies declined to fuel the speculation with any
comments, but analysts who cover the industry were happy to stoke
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies are being very quiet about this, almost
strangely so, which suggests to me a high probability that the
talks are serious,'' said Steven Wharton, who covers Fleet for
Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co. ``Besides, it's a deal that would make sense
for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Summit's 500 branches and $39 billion in assets are scattered
throughout Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. That fits
nicely with Fleet's 1,200 branches and $180 billion in assets in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   There is some overlap between the two companies in New Jersey,
which would give Fleet a chance to save money by consolidating
operations. UBS Warburg analyst Mike Poldwick figures that a
combined Fleet/Summit could operate in the state with costs 20
percent lower than the two manage separately.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, the largest bank in New England, would also become the
biggest bank in New Jersey with the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fleet likes to be the big player in a market, and it's almost
at a point where it needs to fish or cut bait in New Jersey,''
Poldwick said. ``That problem would be instantly solved if this
deal goes through.''
</P>
<P>
   Summit has also made far less money from bank fees than most of
its competitors, which has weighed on its stock price for years.
Analysts said they expect Fleet, which drew protests locally when
it increased fees after taking over BankBoston Corp. last year, to
similarly boost fee revenues if it acquires Summit.
</P>
<P>
   From Summit's side of the coin, the advantages of a potential
deal are easier to see and quicker to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Since word of the negotiations leaked Monday, Summit has seen
its stock price jump from $27.75 to $34.31 _ a 24 percent increase.
Jason Goldberg, who covers Summit for Lehman Brothers, said Fleet
would probably have to pay $37 to $39 per share to acquire its
smaller rival, giving shareholders yet another pop.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldberg cautioned that the deal could still fall through if
the companies can't agree on price. A decade of consolidation in
the banking industry came to a screeching halt in the past couple
of years, he said, primarily because too many banks paid too much
money to make deals happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are a lot more careful these days about the
numbers,'' Goldberg said. ``This deal makes sense at the right
price, but I certainly wouldn't count it as a sure thing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet shares fell nearly 5 percent Tuesday, but recovered
Wednesday to close at $39, up 31 cents.

   WASHINGTON _ ``Why, you live like a queen, don't you?'' was the
comment of Queen Maude of Norway to Marjorie Merriweather Post.
Post did indeed, and she filled Hillwood, her home-museum at 4155
Linnean Avenue NW, which has just reopened, with a battalion of
royal objects. Her collection of imperial Russian art from the 18th
and 19th centuries is the greatest in the world outside Russia, and
she had one of the leading U.S. collections of Sevres porcelain,
much of it commissioned by Catherine the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Her 19th-century red Aubusson rug was a gift from Emperor
Napoleon III of France to the ill-fated Emperor Maximilian of
Mexico. Post lore has William Randolph Hearst (another American
with a castle complex) as a onetime owner of the rug. But somehow
it ``never got to San Simeon,'' said Ann Odom, the chief curator
and deputy director of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Hillwood, which Post bought in 1955, after her third divorce,
sits on 25 acres at the edge of Rock Creek Park. Half the grounds
are wooded and half are formal gardens. Besides the main house,
which was shut for a three-year, $9 million renovation including
some of the grounds, there are a dacha with Russian artifacts and
an Adirondacks lodge with American Indian material.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great party house,'' said Frederick J. Fisher,
director of what is now the Hillwood Museum. ``She was a great
entertainer in Washington, with one room designed for movies and
dances.''
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Merriweather Post was born into a family that became
wealthy from Postum, Grape-Nuts and Post Toasties. She married and
divorced, in succession, a New York lawyer named Edward Close; E.F.
Hutton, the stockbroker (and father of her daughter Dina Merrill,
the actress); Joseph E. Davies, a Washington lawyer; and Herbert A.
May, a Pittsburgh industrialist. She took back her maiden name
after the last divorce, but kept the ``Mrs.'' When she died in
1973, her fortune was estimated at $200 million, the equivalent of
$769 million today.
</P>
<P>
   After husband No. 3, Davies, was appointed ambassador to the
Soviet Union, Post's collection of Russian furnishings and objets
d'art grew. Hillwood's two-story entrance hall is lined with
Russian portraits. ``They are almost all of the czars and czarinas,
talking to each other, having nice conversations,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Odum said, ``She had a fascination for porcelain and had
collected Sevres.'' Bulk purchases were needed: Post hauled out the
Sevres for her frequent dinner parties for 30.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the Post collection are its 90 works by Faberge,
especially Easter eggs, but also boxes, clocks, a walking-stick
handle made of gold, nephrite, diamonds and rubies and an ashtray
of silver, enamel and quartz that does not seem ever to have felt
the stub of a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   In the Icon Room is a large pink Faberge egg given by the last
czar, Nicholas II, to his mother in 1914. It is made of gold,
diamonds and pearls and decorated with enamel. Inside pearl-lined
frames are allegorical paintings, after Francois Boucher, depicting
the arts and the sciences. Fisher calls it ``the last of the really
beautiful eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of Hillwood, there is a present from Polina S.
Zhemchuzhina, the wife of Prime Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov and
a Soviet official herself. As a parting gift, she allowed the
couple to choose from the Kuskovo ceramics museum. What they liked
were two vases made in 1836 at the Imperial Porcelain Factory in
St. Petersburg. They are 27 inches high and gilded to imitate gilt
bronze, with painted landscapes on their sides. Soviet officials
were probably sorry to see the couple leave, since Post bought much
imperial porcelain for her collection.
</P>
<P>
   Her divorce from Davies in 1955 forced her to split her Russian
collection with him, so she began buying replacements. After Davies
died in 1958, she bought pieces from his estate.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of her life, Post decided that her collection
should some day be made available to the public in a museum of the
decorative arts, and Hillwood was renovated with that in mind. She
consolidated pieces that had been at her 54-room triplex at 92nd
Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which was described in the
1920s as the largest apartment ever built, and at her Mar-a-Lago
estate in Palm Beach, Fla., (now in Donald Trump's hands), and put
them in Hillwood.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds around Hillwood are as carefully laid out as the
public spaces inside the main house. A formal Japanese garden (as
yet unrestored) was designed by Shogo Myaida, a Japanese-born
landscape architect, who designed the gardens at the 1939-40 New
York World's Fair, Jones Beach and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. At
Hillwood, he deployed stone lanterns, tiny wooden bridges and a
stone pagoda. A parterre garden has also been rejuvenated with a
new fountain.
</P>
<P>
   Another garden, in the formal French style, has a ring of rose
bushes surrounding wax begonias and boxwood, which set off a 3-foot
pink stone pedestal topped by a 10-foot column. It is Post's
memorial, and her ashes are there.
</P>
<P>
   Those ashes are near a putting green (she had one at each of her
residences) and a planting of ivy. Even that has a claim to
grandeur. A nearby sign states, ``This ivy is from Buckingham
Palace, London, England.''
</P>
<P>
   Tours of the house and garden are by reservation only
(refundable deposit required: $10; those over 65, $8; students and
those under 18, $5). Only 250 people a day are allowed to visit the
museum, which is in a residential neighborhood; (202) 686-5807.

HEATING OIL STOCKS IN NEW ENGLAND PLUMMET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Inventories of heating oil have plummeted in New
England, approaching lows reminiscent of the 1970s and exposing
consumers to further price spikes as winter demand increases.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Energy Information Administration said Wednesday
that stocks of heating oil shrank by another 300,000 barrels over
the past week to 4.3 million barrels now available to retail
distributors in New England. Current stocks are less than one-third
of the heating oil available in the region at this time last year,
when stocks were 14.2 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Falling stocks in September are an alarming trend for consumers
in a year in which gasoline prices have already surged to
astronomical levels. Energy analysts attribute the low inventories
of heating oil to the bizarre dynamics of oil supply, demand, and
distribution, as well as a volatile spot market for crude oil and
refined products.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line, for consumers, is sharply higher heating
oil prices. Retail prices are rising to between $1.30 and $1.40 a
gallon this winter, up from $1 last winter and 80 cents in the
winter of 1998. Analysts warn prices may rise further if supplies
are not replenished or if the winter is particularly cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will have enough (oil supply), but it's a price
gouging going on,'' said John Patterson, co-owner of Star Five Oil
Co. Inc. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said his wholesale supplier, which he would not name,
``cut us off.'' Star Five has been able to purchase only 500,000
gallons of heating oil this fall in preparation for winter _ half
of what he needs. As a result, he said he was forced in July to
start turning away customers seeking to buy oil on contract and
lock in a budgeted monthly price. ``I feel for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Cogan, a spokesman for the Energy Information
Administration of the US Department of Energy, said that low
inventories put customers at greater risk of price shocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inventories supply cushions and provide time for the
market to react to changes in demand,'' Cogan said. ``The more
cushion you have, the less pressure there is on prices going up
when there is increased demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil is responding to crude prices on world markets that
surged to a 10-year high of $37.80 per barrel last week but have
fallen slightly since then.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in an effort to boost oil supplies and
counteract soaring world prices, announced last week that his
administration would release 30 million barrels of crude oil from
the federal government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said it would take weeks, even months, for that
crude to be refined and find its way into heating oil tankers. Phil
Flynn, senior market analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago,
said the low inventory levels being reported ``bring home the fact
that even if we tap the reserve, it isn't going to help with
heating oil for a while.'' Since inventories are low, ``there is
not much that anyone can do about it at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or
OPEC, has much control over the price of petroleum on world
markets, the price is also influenced during distribution. Middle
Eastern or Venezuelan oil producers sell to refiners in Europe and
along the Gulf Coast in Lousiana and Texas, who then sell to
wholesalers around the country. Wholesalers, in turn, sell to the
retailers who fill customers' tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Oil can always be purchased, if the price is high enough. The
problem this winter, analysts say, is that wholesalers are not
stocking up. They have no incentive to purchase oil early, when
prices are extremely high, only to see prices fall during the
winter months. Indeed, prices being traded in oil futures markets
indicate dealers are betting prices will decline later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inventory levels are behaving like a downward spiral,
continuing to pressure prices customers pay to refill oil tanks.
New Englanders are more dependent on heating oil than most regions
of the country. In Massachusetts, about 1 million of the state's
2.5 million households us oil heating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, heating oil stocks also fell last week by 600,000
barrels, to 47.5 million barrels, said the Energy Information
Administration. Last year, US inventories were 72.5 million
barrels. Inventories are measured at the refinery and wholesale
level and do not include stocks held by heating oil delivery firms.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a brief drop in 1996, inventories haven't been this
low since the 1970s when OPEC quadrupled oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The looming heating-oil crisis demonstrates the urgency of
placing requirements for minimum inventory levels on wholesalers,
said Joseph Kennedy, a former Massachusetts congressman who now is
chief executive of Citizens Energy Corp. Citizens provides
subsidized heating oil to Masschusetts residents on fixed or low
incomes who are especially vulnerable to high home heating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said a national inventory of heating oil, built up
during the summer months, would avert supply crunches that often
hit New England residents in the fall. A run-up in heating oil
prices last January cost Massachusetts residents an additional $150
million in heating costs, he said, while the cost of storing
heating oil would have been only about $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm saying is, `Why don't we buy ourselves a little
insurance?,' '' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is pessimistic about oil costs. Some argue that
prices can only go down in coming months as refiners get more
product into the pipelines. ``I believe the prices have peaked
already,'' said Alfred Slifka, president of Global Petroleum, one
of the largest heating oil wholesalers in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   But Energy Department figures show that US inventories are
shrinking even though there was a small rise in the amount of
petroleum being refined into heating oil. Analysts said this is
another indication wholesalers are holding back from replenishing
their stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Sullivan, chief executive of the New England Fuel
Institute, whose members are mainly heating oil retailers, said
stocks are low due to a booming economy and high demand by truckers
for diesel fuel, a sister refined product to heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said Americans now consume 4.1 million barrels of
heating oil per day but only 3.8 million barrels are being refined.
``We've got a shortfall of 300,000 barrels a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Record low inventories of natural gas this winter could,
indirectly, drive up demand for heating oil. During the coldest
months, gas suppliers typically cut off big users of natural gas,
such as hospitals and universities, and divert supplies to
homeowners who pay higher prices. Massachusetts utilities have
requested a 22.7 percent increase this year in natural gas prices,
effective in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gas company interrupts their service so they go directly
to heating oil,'' Sullivan said. This winter, he predicted, ``it
will happen and my speculation is it will happen sooner than
before.''

`THAT'S LIFE' NEEDS MORE APPEAL TO BE A MUST-SEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``That's Life,'' a rare foray into musical comedy, lasted a
single season on ABC in the late '60s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a more conventional blue-collar sitcom by the same name
tanked after a few episodes and the star of the show, Gerry Red
Wilson, died later that year.
</P>
<P>
   If the third time is indeed a charm, the latest series to be
titled ``That's Life'' should bring CBS untold acclaim and fabulous
riches. If, on the other hand, the third time is merely
confirmation of a never-ending pattern, the players on ``That's
Life'' might want to be sure their resumes are updated and their
insurance premiums paid.
</P>
<P>
   One good sign: Lydia DeLucca isn't one to embrace
predestination. She has spent most of her 32 years fulfilling
expectations that weren't necessarily hers, and now she has decided
it's time to take control and make life happen on her own terms,
not her parents' or anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia is the main character in ``That's Life.'' A spunky woman
from a working-class Italian-American family, she has been dating
the same loser for eight years, works in a New Jersey barroom
pouring drinks for other losers, and desperately wants to avoid
ending up in the loser line herself. Her solution is to dump her
fiance and enroll in college on the theory that her mind is a
terrible thing to waste on a guy named Lou Buttafucco (Sonny
Marinelli), who only asked her to marry him after his microwave
went on the fritz and he figured he might score a new one if he got
engaged to Lydia and her friends threw her a bridal shower.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Paige Kent (``Jenny,'' ``Stark Raving Mad'') makes Lydia
accessible and likable, yet ``That's Life'' has the arm's-length
appeal of someone you enjoy seeing occasionally but wouldn't want
to pal around with.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia would probably blame her parents in such a situation. So
would I. Not that Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino are bad actors.
Heaven knows the TV schedule could use more performers of their
caliber. But the pilot script has Burstyn and Sorvino firing blanks
into the scenery, creating characters that are like those life-size
cardboard cutouts you find in party-supply stores: good for one
laugh and then relegated to a far corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Life'' is more successful when Lydia is in school,
coping with the incredulous students who figure she must be a
divorcee on the make, or sparring with a prickly professor (Peter
Firth) over whom she holds enormous sway because of his
indiscriminate drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Lydia's moments with her confused but supportive best
friends will resonate with anyone who's ever been the family
iconoclast struggling to make her own way. (They also may cause
viewers to wonder why Debi Mazar, who plays beautician Jackie
O'Grady, wasn't cast in the lead role. She's much more convincing
as a girl from the Jersey suburbs.)
</P>
<P>
   CBS is giving ``That's Life'' a nice launch this Sunday, right
after the season premiere of ``60 Minutes,'' probably because its
regular day and time _ Saturday at 8 _ is the TV equivalent of a
poke in the eye. If all those ``60 Minutes'' viewers who are
expecting to see ``Touched by an Angel'' at 8 o'clock aren't too
annoyed to find something else in its place, the thinking goes that
perhaps they'll sit back and enjoy ``That's Life'' and make plans
to tune in again on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, well, that's life in the suburbs, where the third
time is a charm only if the neighbors bother to tune in.
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S LIFE
</P>
<P>
   WHAT: Series premiere of hourlong comedy/ drama about a
32-year-old woman who flouts convention and family tradition to
enroll in college
</P>
<P>
   CAST: Heather Paige Kent, Ellen Burstyn, Kristin Bauer, Peter
Firth, Kevin Dillon, Sonny Marinelli, Paul Sorvino and Debi Mazar
</P>
<P>

FLEET TRYING A CLICKS-AND-MORTAR APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ FleetBoston Financial Corp. is seeking to expand in the
investment advice business.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston banking group has merged the 215 investment brokers
from its branches into its Quick &AMP; Reilly discount brokerage unit.
Quick &AMP; Reilly has 118 walk-in investor centers nationwide and 460
sales representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet said none of its brokers, who provide full-service
financial advice, will lose a job.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Fleet said, is to appeal both to investors who want
personal advice and to do-it-yourself investors who prefer to trade
online or over the phone, without input from a broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to this, we were a transaction-driven discount broker,''
said Don Froude, president of Quick &AMP; Reilly. ``We are looking to
be a much more advice- and judgment-driven firm.''
</P>
<P>
   With its new approach, Fleet is looking to exploit two sweeping
trends in the investment arena: the boom in online trading and the
rising demand for advice by wealthy investors.
</P>
<P>
   The company is embracing the clicks and bricks strategy that has
propelled industry giants, such as Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., Fidelity
Investments, and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. Under
that strategy, the company will offer investors stocks, bonds,
mutual funds, and annuities, both remotely or in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online brokerage space has evolved beyond simple, cheap
trades,'' said Matt Carrick, an analyst with Gomez Advisors. ``The
firms with the physical branches, the firms that can provide the
added planning and advice element, are one step ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet is not the only company moving to expand its physical
presence in the era of the Internet. DLJ Direct recently opened a
walk-in center in Florida. E-Trade, which stepped up competition in
the online trading arena, this month opened its first office in a
Target department store in Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Quick &AMP; Reilly is the nation's fourth-largest discount broker,
behind Schwab, Fidelity, and TD Waterhouse. It has $41 billion of
assets in 1.3 million customer accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Not all investment firms have found walk-in centers to be
profitable. Dreyfus Corp. last year closed some 25 investor centers
to focus on broker sales of its funds instead of direct sales.
</P>
<P>
   Froude said profits aren't at issue in the Quick &AMP; Reilly branch
operation. ``We know it's a profitable strategy,'' he said.
``Very.''

RAISING A NEW FASHION FLAG ON THE WEB: THE REPUBLIC OF ZEN

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORTE MADERA, Calif. _ Zen is an upfront influence at the office
of ZoZa, a new fashion company set for its Web debut in
mid-October. Shoes are to be removed at the entrance and placed in
cabinets. A hefty Chinese gong stands ready to call meetings, and
there's a large empty swath of carpet for the staff's morning yoga
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ZoZa's high-tech stretchy clothes feature a symbol from the I
Ching that means both ``contemplation'' and ``mountain.'' Floating
across the screen at www.zoza.com will be a mini-swirl of
snowflakes; click on it for a kernel of Zen wisdom, like, ``Be
present, not tense.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Ziegler calls these aphorisms ``mind crackers.'' He and his
wife, Patricia, as ZoZa's co-founders, have even signed on a
genuine Zen master as consultant: Norman Fischer, retired abbot of
the San Francisco Zen Center, the largest of its kind in America.
``I have absolutely nothing to offer ZoZa,'' Fischer said, ``which
is what the Zieglers really love!''
</P>
<P>
   Zen minimalism is a far cry from the amusing, flashy icons of
Banana Republic, the Zieglers' first business, with its full-size
in-store giraffes and jungle jeeps poking through the display
windows. The couple began a retailing revolution 22 years ago a few
miles away in Mill Valley, with safari-style clothing stylishly
tweaked by Mrs. Ziegler, a former San Francisco Chronicle
illustrator, and promoted by a nifty catalog written by her
husband, an ex-Chronicle reporter. Hearing their name for the
business, a friend advised: ``Bad choice. You'll be picketed by
people from small hot countries.''
</P>
<P>
   No protesters picketed that first outpost in 1978, or at any of
the thundering herd of stores to come, jet-assisted by the wildly
popular movie ``Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' When the Zieglers
abruptly resigned in 1988, selling their interest in Banana
Republic, by then a unit of Gap Inc., it had 110 stores and was
ringing up annual sales of a quarter billion dollars. But customers
tired of the Indiana Jones look. Relations between the Zieglers and
the Gap's founder, Don Fisher, soured when the couple insisted on
publishing a travel magazine and began selling travel books in
their shops. (Fisher reportedly said that if he'd wanted to sell
books, he'd have bought Rand McNally.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem,'' Ziegler said, ``was that Patricia and I
were fundamentally unemployable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in their 50s, the Zieglers are hitched to a speedy urban
rhythm with an accent on easy movement required by his dirt biking
and her daily yoga routine, which includes bends that even a tree
boa might envy. They're not averse to a touch of functional
elegance and even sophistication. The endless safari days are past.
</P>
<P>
   The Zieglers came away from the Gap divorce feeling tattered by
their far-from-smooth ride to moguldom. They retreated to the
foothills of Mount Tamalpais above Mill Valley, to a shingled
house, circa 1929, they have renovated _ doubling its interior
space and adding an aerie that is now a workout room. The project
cost $2 million; today the house is worth an estimated $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd first driven up to the place at night,'' Mrs. Ziegler
recalled. ``It reminded us of the Ahwannee Lodge in Yosemite
National Park, where we loved to stay. But the main thing is the
way the house was cradled by the mountain. We were pretty intimate
with the hiking trails up there. You could reach them directly out
the back door of this house without stepping on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Those trails were the Zieglers' first priority. A distant second
was the unobstructed view of San Francisco, 10 miles off. Often
fogged in by morning, the city scintillates like a distant jewel
box by night from the south-facing windows.
</P>
<P>
   Those ample windows, with their original steel frames, had also
caught Mrs. Ziegler's offbeat eye. ``They reminded me of windows in
artists' lofts in old industrial buildings,'' she explained. (In
the renovation, she looked far and wide to locate a firm that still
fabricated steel windows.) She oversaw much of the redesign, from
the minimalist redwood baseboards (she thought stock ones were
``too fancy'') to the new cedar shingles on the facade. The
Zieglers elected to use a labor-intensive, technique, a throwback
to the Arts and Crafts movement: hand-dipping each shingle in an
oil-based stain and then letting it air dry. The result, worthy of
Greene &AMP; Greene, is shingles that will shrink evenly as they age.
</P>
<P>
   The couple have filled the house with Mrs. Ziegler's paintings
and with folk art _ snakes and other reptiles preferred. Once,
while climbing in the Peruvian Andes, Mrs. Ziegler was suddenly
enveloped by a giant shadow. Looking up, she saw a gliding adult
condor, its wingspan easily twice her own length. Back home, she
sketched a condor's head and had it carved into the living room's
redwood beams. Wild creatures also abound in Mrs. Ziegler's
paintings. A tiny watercolor on a stairway wall shows elephants
dimly seen in a nocturnal march, their tusks reflecting moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Banana Republic, the Zieglers assumed they'd
be full-time homebodies and parents to Zio, now 12, and Aza, 8.
Even when Revlon came calling, asking the couple to start a new
line of natural cosmetics, they stayed put. When Aza's
third &UR; - &LR; grade teacher asked the class to describe what their
parents did, she reported that her mother painted and ``my daddy
rides his dirt bike in the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They studied Zen in the quiet time after Banana Republic, and
traded in their espresso machine for a teapot. ``We were attempting
to live our lives by sips instead of slurps,'' Ziegler said. Fine
tea was harder to find locally than fine coffee. So, with a young
business partner, the Zieglers created a new company in 1991,
naming it the Republic of Tea. The labels for the company's metal
tea canisters, handsome and practical, were painted by Mrs. Ziegler
while she was confined to bed during her second pregnancy. They
still incorporate the squat, black family teapot.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler named the teas and wrote the canister copy as
beguilingly as he had written Banana Republic's catalog. (In 1999,
the trade magazine Catalog World named Banana Republic's catalog
the best ever.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the company was sold to a Midwestern beverage bottler.
The Zieglers, who'd gotten this company up and running without ever
leaving home, celebrated the sale by buying the house next door and
converting it into a painting studio, play area and meditation
center.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had no intention of starting a third business. But
then, last summer, they got a phone call from Edward Strobin, their
old chief operating officer at Banana Republic _ and a loyalist in
their struggle with the Gap. ``Everyone else is making a bundle
with Internet start-ups,'' Strobin said. ``Why should we be left
out?''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, infused with $12 million by Softbank, the
Japanese venture capital giant, in return for a 20-percent stake in
the company, ZoZa was born. The Zieglers, who are majority
shareholders, say they ``seeded'' the company, but refuse to
disclose their investment. The couple insist they would never have
committed to a new business without Strobin to handle daily
operations. But they lost him in July to a swiftly attacking
cancer. ``It was too late to put on the brakes,'' Ziegler said.
``We had 40 people working for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ZoZa is a word that, like the names of the couple's children, is
a pure Zieglerism. Like Banana Republic, the company is spun out of
the couple's lifestyle of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The clothing _ 56 pieces in all _ is entirely made from the
newest hi-tech performance fabrics from Japan and Italy. Everyone
knows the mantra _ these are the fabrics that wick away sweat,
breathe, stretch with the body _ and the Zieglers are hardly unique
in upthinking them. But they found most true tech clothing too big,
too shapeless or too tight for spiffy segues from office to
see-and-be-seen bistro.
</P>
<P>
   ZoZa's declared mission is to bring maximum refinement of cut,
style and finish to a washable ready-to-wear line: ``Patagonia
crossed with Prada,'' is how one hopeful ZoZa marketing executive
puts it. Well, not quite. But there is a floor-length evening gown
with an oval cutout in back and a mermaid-like sweep back from the
feet. Seams wander with the wearer's curves, which are cradled in
built-in underwear. Made from Lycra swimsuit fabric, it comes
bundled in a small mesh sack. Stuff it into the glove compartment
in the morning on the way to work and pull it out, unwrinkled, to
slip on just before party time. If you get tossed in the pool, just
start swimming. The gown can even be washed in its sack.
</P>
<P>
   ZoZa seams attempt to go where the body goes _ especially in
enticing places like the small of the back. ``Patricia puts seams
where they have never gone before, but where they always should
have been,'' said Gale Parker, ZoZa's design director, formerly
head designer for Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan to sell ZoZa only as Web wear has been
scrapped. The first ZoZa ``walk-in Web site''is planned for later
this year in Mill Valley. Customers will be able to try on the
clothes, then order from in-store computers. An old-fashioned paper
catalog, sized like a CD case, is also pending, and there has been
interest from two retail giants to form a strategic alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Daniele Clutier, director of fashion research at the Institut
Francais de la Mode, in Paris, viewed the ZoZa Web site. ``Like
Banana Republic, ZoZa seems to promise fashion with a soul and a
strong personality,'' Clutier said. ``Postmodernist theory tells us
that we humans need meaningfulness, which we try to derive partly
from consumer objects, especially clothes. So it seems good for
ZoZa to have something to say beyond `We're nice and
fashionable.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is a tense time for the Zieglers, with Patricia getting out
the clothes and Mel working on the next round of financing. The
pair preserve their calm with a 30-minute commute to their new
``Zen house,'' situated on a bluff over the Pacific Ocean at
Stinson Beach. ``You won't see the house,'' Ziegler warned. ``It's
behind a redwood fence with a hidden gate.''
</P>
<P>
   After the elaborate, art-filled Mill Valley manse, the Zen
house, marked by a single Japanese lantern, comes as a bit of a
shock. It's a small place, sparsely furnished, with a garage that
has been converted to an art studio. But all artwork has been
banished. Mrs. Ziegler motioned to the big windows with their
sweeping vistas of the ocean and muscular hills where evergreen
trees alternate with straw-colored meadows. ``Those are our
paintings,'' Mrs. Ziegler said.
</P>
<P>
   The Zieglers insist that, if not for its relative isolation,
they'd prefer to live now full time in the ``squalor'' of the Zen
house rather than in the grander Mill Valley home. ``The difference
in the two homes is like the difference between Banana Republic and
ZoZa,'' Mrs. Ziegler explained. ``The Mill Valley is about romance.
It's hard to maintain. The Zen house is simple and really
functional, like ZoZa clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   On a bright late summer day, the Zieglers prepared to head to
San Francisco. Zio, Aza and a friend had already piled into the
rear of the family station wagon. Ziegler said, ``It's fun to be
working for ourselves again after years of working for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ziegler pointed to a large black duffel bag stuffed with
samples of ZoZa wear. ``Sometimes, something just coagulates in
midair,'' she said, ``and people say: `That's it! That's the spirit
of the age!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The cybercurtain is about to go up on ZoZa. Clicking rather than
clapping will determine whether, once again, the Zieglers can
transmute the spirit of this high-tech age into clothes.

 &HT;    Maddux approaches scoreless streak with same aplomb as he
pitches
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Poised on the brink of personal history, Greg Maddux
has prepared himself for the occasion with the same pomp and
circumstance that has made him one of baseball's most uncommon
characters.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs. He spits. Then he pitches
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' Maddux said, his singular way of acknowledging
the 36-1/3-inning scoreless streak he takes into tonight's
Atlanta-New York finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong. It's cool but that's it. It's nice to
have. It's better than talking about giving up 30 or 40 runs in 30
innings, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   So much for a rendezvous with destiny. There have only been
three longer scoreless streaks since 1988, when Orel Hershiser set
the major league record at 59 innings. Maddux can also win 20 games
for just the third time (and second as a Brave) in his remarkable
14-year career.
</P>
<P>
   And in keeping with his pulse-less approach to each game, the
streak, the 20 wins might as well belong to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to (win 20). Who wouldn't?'' he said. ``But I'll try
to pitch good and if I get it, great. If not, I'll get ready to
pitch in the playoffs. There's not a whole lot of options.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox and Maddux were still unsettled Wednesday on
how long Maddux might pitch, weighing his personal accomplishment
and the team's pursuit of the NL's best record against preserving
Maddux for the playoffs. But be sure Maddux's ambivalence about
tonight is not shared around the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 he gave up a career-high 258 hits last year and some
baseball minds felt the league had caught up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the middle of so-called struggling last year when
everyone was wondering what's going on, he can't literally turn it
up a notch because he's always at that perfect level,'' John Smoltz
said. ``But he's turned it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just right on. He's not making any mistakes at all. I
don't know if he'll tell you but he makes a lot of mistakes, just
like all of us do. But because of his perfection, he gets away with
them because the hitter doesn't expect it. Right now, he's just
pole-vaulted into an incredible run.''
</P>
<P>
   From June 19 through Aug. 18, Maddux won just four times in 12
starts. The Cy Young race was running without him while the Braves
stumbled through their worst August in 10 years. But since Aug. 22,
he is 6-1 while his ERA has plummeted to 2.91.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having him dealing like this is a huge lift,'' shortstop Walt
Weiss said. ``We got a couple of aces but when one of them is
throwing up zeroes, there's a domino effect that strengthens the
whole rotation. He's been just dominating.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is more wide-eyed than catcher Paul Bako, who assumed the
Maddux account July 22 and has been stunned that every pitch - the
two-seam fastball, the cutter, the slider, the change-up - is
working at peak efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys generally pitch to their strengths, but his strength is
using all those pitches,'' Bako said. ``He can go after a hitter in
any given way. He doesn't get a lot of credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   A 20th win would not only be the seconding speech for his Cy
Young candidacy, it would make the third time Maddux and Glavine
had won 20 or more in the same season. There have only been 15
staffs in the last half-century with twin 20-game winners. Only one
tandem (Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette in 1958 and 1959) were able
to repeat the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux and Glavine would be the first to do so three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have two guys win 20, you have to have a good team, you
need some good pitching and you need some luck,'' said John
Burkett, who with Billy Swift had 20-win years in San Francisco in
1993. ``You do it three times, that kind of throws luck out the
window, doesn't it?''

 &HT;    Netanyahu tries his hand as high-tech spokesman
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Benjamin Netanyahu, veteran of covert operations,
White House summits and global diplomacy, came to Atlanta this week
to talk technology.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial former prime minister of Israel was at the
Telco Systems booth Wednesday on the show floor of Networld+Interop
at the Georgia World Congress Center. Massachusetts-based Telco is
now a unit of BATM Advanced Communications, an Israeli company that
bought Telco from World Access of Atlanta and hired Netanyahu as a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Voted out of office in May 1999, Netanyahu declined Wednesday to
answer political questions except to say that he increasingly gets
them. ``I get asked a lot if I will re-enter politics and I
wouldn't have expected to be asked that so soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu won a chance at a political comeback Wednesday when
Israel's attorney general refused to prosecute him on corruption
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Police had suspected Netanyahu and his wife of conspiring with a
government contractor in a kickback scheme, illegally keeping
gifts, and obstructing justice, and they recommended the former
leader be tried. But in a statement, Attorney General Elyakim
Rubinstein cited ``difficulties with the evidence'' in making a
conviction of Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   For Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who soundly defeated Netanyahu in
May 1999 elections, the announcement comes at a sensitive time.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's far-reaching peace proposals have lost him majority
support in Parliament, and Netanyahu's hard-line Likud party hopes
to force him out once Parliament reconvenes Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicate that Prime Minister Ehud Barak would
handily defeat Netanyahu's successor as leader of the Likud Party,
Ariel Sharon. However, polls show Barak and Netanyahu in a dead
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu came to prominence as a spokesman for the Israeli
government, and he smiled when asked about his shift to corporate
front man. ``First of all, I had to make a living, and I was
approached by Zvi. We started working together _ It is a superb
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Zvi Marom, BATM founder and chief executive, is one of the
richest men in Israel. Shares of BATM have rocketed from less than
$2 to about $100 in two years.
</P>
<P>
   David LeBeau, Telco president, said the combination makes more
business sense than ownership by World Access. ``They are a service
provider and we sell to service providers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said the mesh of Israeli and U.S. culture has been
effective. ``We are aggressive, and they are aggressive. We both
want to win. And they are fast. If they don't know what to build
they'll build it anyway and then we'll tweak it.''

 &HT;    Germany upbeat about reunification, says consul in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Next week, Germans will celebrate the 10th anniversary
of the reunification of their country.
</P>
<P>
   Their initial euphoria has long since given way to reality.
Tearing down the Berlin Wall was surprisingly easy. Creating a
unified people after decades of separation has proven more of a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a visit to his country this month, Germany's
Atlanta-based consul general, Heinrich-Peter Rothmann, assessed the
situation in an interview this week. Here is an excerpt edited from
his comments:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the mood of the people you talked with on your trip?
</P>
<P>
   A: I found two things remarkable. First, the progress made in
Berlin (once again the seat of Germany's government). In every
respect, the city really is coming back to life. The other thing
for Germany in general is clearly a positive climate. We have a
reputation for seeing everything in a rather pessimistic way, but
in this case I think everybody shared the view that economically
it's going ahead. The new German government, half-term in its
electoral stage, has come forward with a few important reforms. We
have tax reform. ... The business community is now quite in line
with the government, ... (which) is a Social Democratic-Green
coalition and was seen in the beginning from the economic sector
with maybe some reservations. These have gone away. The business
community is quite satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On Tuesday, Germany will observe the 10th anniversary of
reunification. What has gone right and what has gone not so well
about that process of reuniting the former West and East Germany?
</P>
<P>
   A: Overall, we have accomplished very much. If you go and look
for yourself today at East Germany, as I have done, you will see
that the country has been transformed. We have not only built roads
and railroads but we've built cities, which were crumbling in the
old (Communist) system. We also have put in an infrastructure. For
instance, all of East Germany today has an optic fiber
communication network, which we don't even have in West Germany.
(But) there are still problems. Unemployment is probably the worst
... around 18 percent in East Germany and less than 9 percent in
the former West Germany. And there is no doubt that this money
coming out of West German pockets going over will still have to
flow for quite a while. Many of the politicians have also conceded
that when the unification came about they were too optimistic. Even
former Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl has very recently recognized that
he was too optimistic about the economic progress that East Germany
would make. This was, of course, a state-run economy that
functioned within the economy of the East bloc. We thought we could
just mend or repair or restructure it, but the East German economy
was so structurally inefficient that we had to tear it down in
order to rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Attention generally focuses on the changes in East Germany,
but has the former West Germany also been changed by reunification?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it has been transformed indirectly in the way that we
have become more conscious that we have to share, that we have
become more conscious of our own history, and we have become more
conscious maybe also in the sense that we see ourselves not only as
... German ... but as European. This has made West Germany more
aware of the need to integrate ... East Germany not only into West
Germany but into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a perception that there's been some increase on the
fringes of Germany in anti-immigrant and ultra-right activity.
</P>
<P>
   A: You only have to open the papers to see this, especially in
East Germany. One very strong reason is economic. If you have an
unemployment at 18 percent and a lot of young people unemployed,
this creates unrest, and people have a tendency to look for
scapegoats. And, then, they will say it is the foreigners that take
our jobs. n East Germany you had a kind of isolation that was
lifted at once when the Wall fell. The country became open.
Foreigners streamed in for the first time. And it's normal that you
turn against the weakest or somebody weaker than you and look to
him for a scapegoat for your own misery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the government responding?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is unanimity between all political factions and the
major societal institutions like the church, labor unions, teacher
unions, all groups of life, that we should respond to this
actively. It's a difficult question often because a lot of what we
call the skinhead movement is, of course, a protest movement. It's
first economic but it's secondly also a youth phenomenon. You know,
if you tell your children to cut their hair shorter, they will
probably let it grow even longer. They know that nothing is more
hurtful to Germany than to be seen again as a country that does not
respect minorities. And since they are frustrated about the
government, they try to use this as a potential for provocation.
When they commit criminal acts ... we will react very hard. If you
kill somebody, if you hurt somebody, the courts will do their work.
But there is a layer in between that is not criminally definable,
and there the response has to be very flexible. It has to be in a
way that they understand. There are many people sitting together,
sociologists, youth psychologists, making programs. We have to work
through them, through the schools. But it's an endeavor that will
take time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: American investment is being welcomed as eastern Germany
rebuilds. We're also seeing a good bit of German investment in the
U.S. South. How do you see the economic relationship going?
</P>
<P>
   A: The economic relationship is going the right way, which means
it is ever increasing. (The United States and the European Union)
are becoming more and more equal partners. Sure, we have
differences. Those are little clouds in the blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Germany was involved in the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia
last year and still is involved in the Kosovo peacekeeping mission.
How significant is that for your people?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's very significant. A large part of the German population
that voted Green and the younger people that voted predominantly
Green were totally against any German involvement. The idea that
German troops would be seen again on the same territory where they
had done their bloody work in the Second World War was for many,
especially young people, unimaginable. But the Kosovo war changed
this. We want to be a fully sovereign and equal player in the
Western alliance and in the group of nations that shares the same
belief in freedom and democracy and human rights.

COMMENTARY: THE WILD POLL PENDULUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Are you getting the feeling, as I am, that we are
being jerked around by wildly swinging poll numbers?
</P>
<P>
   Pre-conventions, George W. Bush led by 17 points;
post-conventions, Al Gore took the lead. Last week most major polls
had Gore breezing to victory; this week, it's Bush edging him out.
</P>
<P>
   With every swing of the poll pendulum, media coverage changes to
savage the front-runner. Whoever is in ``free fall'' can do nothing
right _ until a ``surge'' by the formerly collapsing campaign
restores smugness at headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Is the American majority really switching every few days? Did
Gore's Kiss change tens of millions of minds? This week The
Washington Times headlined ``Bush Surges Ahead of Gore After Chats
With Oprah and Regis.'' Was a 13-point lead in the previous, wacky,
Newsweek poll really all but erased by a Bush countersmooch on
Oprah's cheek?
</P>
<P>
   No. The reasons for the unprecedented swings, and for the
reporting that further exaggerates the swings, are (1) the
pressured pollution of the public opinion polls, and (2) the
horse-race media's hyping of polls as predictors of voting
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Have you noticed, in all the breathless reports of poll results
as if they were reflections of coming reality, the disappearance of
a category that used to be called ``the undecideds''? If one of the
candidates is reported leading by 44 percent to 42, that means 16
percent are determinedly undecided or pulling for splinter parties.
And that is after ``pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because client news organizations in hot competition demand a
hard answer to ``who's winning?'' the pressure is on pollsters not
to take ``I dunno'' for an answer. The pollster pushes: ``Which
candidate do you lean toward today?''
</P>
<P>
   If the interviewee had just been impressed by a powderpuff TV
interview, he or she will reluctantly ``lean'' toward whoever seems
hotter on the Internet or in cable talk or whose name is more
familiar. The poll then counts that person as taking a side. Next
day, the same type of person's soft leaning could easily switch and
would appear as a change of mind. It is not; what is reported as a
``surge'' is merely a sample of wavering out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the seeming voter volatility is the social
unacceptability of appearing uninformed. Many people who are
unwilling to commit before the debates toss out a name to avoid
appearing apathetic or unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes pollsters will assuage their media clients' demands
for results by means of allocation. If one candidate is ahead in a
poll by 45 percent to 40, and 15 percent haven't made up their
minds, a poll may allocate the uncommitted on the ratio of decided
respondents, thereby exaggerating the front-runner's lead.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``respondent'' sends shudders through the nose-counting
community. The dirty secret of political surveys is this: As
recently as 1984, the response rate to pollsters' questioning was
65 percent; that is, two out of three people reached would answer.
Pollster friends whisper to me that the response rate is now down
to 35 percent. (Two out of three pollsters I called went mum or
hung up on me, thus validating this reported figure in my mind,
which never leaves margin for error.)
</P>
<P>
   What does this remarkable response refusal tell us? It means
that two out of three Americans are guarding their privacy with
answering machines or Caller ID, or are telling pollsters to ``stop
bothering me at dinnertime.'' Also, because we suspect that a
response puts our private opinions on a telemarketer's data base,
we are now much less likely to cooperate with pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   The one-third of potential interviewees who do respond are
either the aforementioned pushables or people eager to make their
views known: partisans, activists and the committed. Together,
these are not representative of all likely voters and ignore the
widespread indecision.
</P>
<P>
   All major polls in the 1996 election underestimated support for
Bob Dole, the New York Times/CBS poll by 7 percent, affecting media
coverage and voter turnout. Only the maverick, Zogby/Reuter, came
in on the money.
</P>
<P>
   So I called John Zogby and laid on him my irate view of the
abuse of polling. He in turn gave me this insight: ``Since 1998, we
have evidence that voters are more likely to reject the views of
all pundits.'' Why do I need to know that? ``If you want to help
Bush _ attack him.''

 &HT;    Friends fail to win release of Falun Gong supporter
 &HT;    By Saeed Ahmed
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - In the three weeks that Xiaohua Du has been under
house arrest in China for carrying banned religious materials into
the country, friends and supporters of the Atlanta engineer have
worked tirelessly for her return to the United States _ but with
little success.
</P>
<P>
   Du, a 29-year-old Chinese citizen who has lived in Atlanta for
five years, and her husband were detained at Fuzhou City airport
Sept.8 after customs officials found materials pertaining to the
Falun Gong movement in their possession. The couple had traveled to
China to visit his ailing father.
</P>
<P>
   To press for her release, practitioners of the movement in
Atlanta have demonstrated in front of the Chinese Embassy in
Washington, D.C., confronted China's ambassador on his visit to
Atlanta last weekend, and sent petitions to members of Congress and
human rights organizations urging them to pressure Chinese
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But without a nod from the Chinese government, which is handling
the case, Du and her husband, Shean Lin, remain in Fuzhou province.
</P>
<P>
   China considers the multimillion-member Falun Gong movement a
threat to its stability, and has brutally cracked down on its
adherents. At least 52 followers have died in police custody,
including two this month, according to the Hong-Kong based
Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Followers insist it's a spiritual practice with no political
aspirations. They plan to protest their persecution at Tiananmen
Square on Oct. 1, China's National Day.
</P>
<P>
   Since their detention, Du and her husband have faced three
interrogations and had their tickets and passports confiscated,
said Hong Zhou, Du's brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government has been saying to the (U.S.) State
Department `they were released on the first day and they are free
to travel,' but they wouldn't even let her go to Beijing to get her
visa renewed,'' said Zhou, a software engineer in Baltimore. ``I am
afraid that if they don't let her return soon, it may affect her
job in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   If Du, who took a two-week leave from work, is terminated from
her job for prolonged absence, she would lose her U.S. work status
and be unable to return to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the electronics company in Norcross where Du is
employed said they were aware of her situation, but any action the
company took would be up to its legal department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, adherents of Falun Gong in Atlanta are continuing
their campaign to keep Du's plight in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   A group of practitioners gathered in front of the Chinese
Embassy Sept. 20 and practiced meditation and slow rhythmic
movements to demonstrate the physical elements of their faith and
its nonviolent philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Another group tried to meet with the Chinese ambassador, Li
Zhaoxin, during his visit to Atlanta Sunday, but was rebuffed, both
at the airport and at a banquet in Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rented three hotel rooms just to be able to use the lobby
of the hotel where he spoke,'' said Yuan Li, an Atlanta engineer.
``When he saw us, he took the kitchen elevator and exited, telling
the audience it was a special security measure he had to take
because the Falun Gong practitioners were planning to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Becky Yao, a piano teacher and Atlanta resident for 40
years, has started a letter-writing campaign to ask state and
national lawmakers for their intervention in Du's detention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government won't listen to us, so we're hoping
that by going through the diplomatic channel, we can use a bigger
voice in helping us,'' said Yao.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Reilly, national casework director for Amnesty
International, said the Chinese government won't feel as obligated
to release the couple as it would if they were American citizens.
But he added that he strongly believed pressure from abroad would
eventually work in freeing the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government puts up a good front that international
pressure doesn't matter to them, but it's all an equation to
them,'' O'Reilly said. ``If they feel the disadvantage outweighs
the advantage in holding someone, they will relent.''

THORNTON, SAMSONOV TO PLAY IN LAST THREE EXHIBITION GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No rest for the tardy.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins forwards and former holdouts Joe Thornton and Sergei
Samsonov _ both 21 and with matching three-year, $5.35 million
contracts _ reported for work Wednesday at the FleetCenter nearly
three weeks late. Soon after they punched in, supervisor Pat Burns
announced that he planned to have them make up for lost time by
playing in the crush of three games that wrap up the exhibition
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins play the Florida Panthers Thursday at the
FleetCenter, the Pittsburgh Penguins Friday at the Providence Civic
Center, and the Buffalo Sabres back in Boston Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' Samsonov said. ``We had a good
workout today. We'll see how it goes. I felt pretty good today. Of
course, it's going to be different during games. I don't really
know what to expect. I feel like I'm in good shape. Let's see.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov worked out with a junior team in Lawrence and Thornton
with a team back home in Ontario while their teammates were in
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they're out of shape,'' Burns said. ``They haven't
skated for three weeks with an NHL team. They say they were skating
every day and that's good. But we'll see after day two, three,
four, what kind of shape they're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton _ he'll be the big guy wearing No. 19, having traded in
his No. 6 _ knows he and Samsonov are looking at a lot of work in a
short time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be difficult,'' Thornton said. ``I've got a
practice under my belt today. We'll have the morning skate. My wind
is going to be a little off. My timing will be a little off. But
hopefully we'll get ready for the first regular-season game (a week
from Thursday night against Ottawa). I'm glad we're both here
together and I wish Anson Carter was here as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Two out of three isn't bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's common sense,'' Burns said. ``We have two guys who were
two of our top three scorers last year and at one point they
weren't supposed to be here and you put them on your team and it
makes your club a lot better, no doubt about that. Plus, they're
older. They're more experienced. They're NHL players now. It just
brings that much more to the table for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Carter, who continues to hold out?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's another player that, if he can get in here, he's an NHL
player,'' Burns said. ``He's a 20-goal scorer. He can help us. But
he's not here. You just can't worry about him.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, what Burns can worry about is getting Thornton
and Samsonov ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, during a skating session to close practice, Burns
got on Thornton's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw how red my face was after practice,'' Thornton said.
``He was giving it to me a little bit. I'm just glad to be skating
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as they will be, Thornton and Samsonov were thrown directly
into the mix Wednesday. Samsonov was on a line with Jason Allison
and Lee Goren, and Thornton was with Brian Rolston and Mike Knuble.
</P>
<P>
   There's no time for messing around, Burns said. The opener is
fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no more cautious than the first day of training camp,''
Burns said. ``What do we do the first day of training camp? We
scrimmage. Well, there you go. We have three scrimmages in three
nights, plus it's against NHL teams. I don't have time to be
cautious and I don't think they want to be cautious. We'll play
them all weekend. Put them in right away. It's no worse than coming
into camp and scrimmaging. You want to get in shape, play the
games.''

JAPANESE PATHFINDERS ROMANCING THE CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Mass., Japan)  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)

   NEW YORK _ ``East is East, and West is West, and never the twain
shall meet'' may be good poetry, but it's a limited world view.
Eastern and Western religions, cultures and arts have mixed and
married and traded ever so profitably with each other for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   (Then, of course, there's actual trade, where meeting means less
than money.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Gandharan sculpture absorbed Greek artistic impulses from
Alexander the Great and turned them into something indisputably
Indian. Remnants of Greek mythology made their way across trade
routes and ended up clinging to Japanese deities or religious
figures. Eighteenth-century Europeans drank Chinese tea from real
or ersatz Chinese cups in rooms wallpapered with Chinese scenes. A
British monarch decided that his gamboling would have a certain je
ne sais quoi if housed in a delightfully inauthentic Indian palace
in Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   It's common knowledge that Western art borrowed heavily from
Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It's less well
known that the West repaid the loan with interest. (END OPTIONAL
TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Japan, abruptly introduced to foreign customs and culture after
the mid-19th century, raced to remake itself as a modern nation,
which included adapting Western modes of representation. The
Japanese learned photography from Western photographers, then
modeled their own imagery on examples of Western painting and
photography. ``Shinzo and Roso Fukuhara: Photographs by Ginza
Modern Boys, 1913-41,'' at Sepia International in Chelsea (through
Oct. 14), presents for the first time in New York the work of two
brothers who played early roles in the formation of Japanese
modernist photography.
</P>
<P>
   This show of more than 100 images and some printed material is
sponsored by Shiseido, the cosmetics company, which has also
financed an exhibition on the role of cosmetics in art at the Grey
Art Gallery at New York University. ``Ginza Modern Boys'' was
selected from the Shiseido Corporate Museum collection by Noriko
Fuku, who wrote the accompanying catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Shinzo and Roso Fukuhara's father founded Shiseido, and Shinzo
(1883-1948), as the oldest surviving son, was obligated to follow
his father as company president. He could pursue photography only
as a sideline yet did so with an energy and effectiveness that
might be envied by many a full-time practitioner. In the early
1920s he and his brother organized an amateur photographers' group,
he founded a photography magazine that once featured female
Japanese photographers (a previously undiscovered species), and he
was the first to try to formulate a theory of photography in Japan.
By the '30s, he was promoting the use of photography in
advertisements for his company.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s Shinzo Fukuhara denounced Pictorialist photography
for imitating painting. His own photography, most of it destroyed
in the great earthquake of 1923, began to shift from a dreamy,
soft-focus Impressionism _ an isolated stroller whose face is
obscured by shadow, bridges that melt under massed tones of gray _
to more rectilinear arrangements of stairs and pilasters and walls.
</P>
<P>
   The work of the '30s is sharp and geometric enough for entry
into the modernist club yet never insistently or strictly stripped
down; Shinzo always harbored an affection for soft effects, tonal
gradations, ragged shadows, blurred backgrounds. Other Japanese
photographers went much farther down the modernist road than either
of the Fukuharas.
</P>
<P>
   Roso Fukuhara (1892-1946), the younger brother, did not have to
work and seems to have pretty much devoted himself to his camera.
His style is more spare and unsparing than Shinzo's (and to my mind
lovelier as well as more challenging). A single, calligraphic
branch of wisteria loops down before an empty sky to meet a small,
blurry patch of leaves rising up in the distance. The imprint of
tradition is often, and beautifully, evident in his landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Fuku's catalog says that Roso Fukuhara's work was not published
in his lifetime, yet he was a pioneer of photographic modernism: a
rather startling combination.
</P>
<P>
   He played with space in cunning ways. In ``Sangatsudo'' (1938),
he photographed a roof in the lower half of the frame, then an
oddly shaped section of sky, bounded on the upper edge by a line of
silhouetted dentils that appear to hang down. In fact they are
protruding from the edge of another roof so close that the
photographer (and, by extension, the viewer) must be standing
underneath it.
</P>
<P>
   As Fuku spells out, the Fukuharas' work illumines the
interchange of Japanese and Western styles. A bit of background
first: after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the Japanese were so
determined to westernize that they consulted European constitutions
before devising one of their own and introduced the study of
Western culture in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese artists, hugely impressed by the realism of European
painting (and dumbfounded by that of photography), examined Western
styles intently. An art school with Italian instructors opened in
Japan in the 1870's; an exhibition of English photography was held
in 1892. The Ginza district of Tokyo became the center of arts and
modern life, a place where the most up-to-date (meaning, basically,
westernized) Ginza modern boys hung out with Ginza modern girls.
</P>
<P>
   While the Japanese were trying to learn Western ways of
representation, Japanese prints were casting a spell on
Impressionism, Art Nouveau and painters like Mary Cassatt and Edgar
Degas. Influences kept flowing back and forth. By the first decade
of the 20th century, it was clear that Alfred Stieglitz, Edward
Steichen and other photographers knew Japanese prints and equally
clear that Japanese photographers knew Impressionist paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-cultural influences were so strong in Japan that they
threatened to overwhelm the traditional arts, and a Westerner made
some of the first efforts to rescue them. Ernest Fenellosa, an
American, went to Japan in 1878 to teach philosophy, and he took a
hand in trying to preserve the country's traditions without giving
up the new-found sense of contemporaneity.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story gets a little complicated. In 1890, Fenellosa was
appointed the first curator of Japanese art at the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts; there, he introduced Arthur Wesley Dow, an American
artist, to Japanese prints. Dow wrote an artists' manual
emphasizing Japanese principles of composition and taught art at
the Pratt Institute and Columbia University in New York from 1895
to 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Shinzo Fukuhara, who earned a degree in pharmacology at Columbia
in 1912 and was interested in combining Western innovation with
Japanese tradition, came to admire the American photographer Alvin
Langdon Coburn, who had studied Japanese art at a school founded by
Dow and had added Japanese tradition to Western innovation. Shinzo
often published Coburn's work opposite his own in his magazine, and
his photographic group mounted an exhibition of Coburn's
photographs in Japan in the early '20s. What may have been
particularly appealing in Coburn's art was an element of
familiarity, an attitude and intent the Japanese recognized as akin
to their own.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, the great Kanto earthquake devastated Tokyo and spurred
the Japanese to modernize at a breakneck pace. Tokyo rebuilt with
concrete, steel and skyscrapers. Photography magazines and
photographically illustrated magazines proliferated, making Western
imagery ever more available; the Japanese were especially intrigued
by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, ``Film und Foto,'' the international photography
exhibition organized in Stuttgart, Germany, traveled to Tokyo and
Osaka. Japanese photographers tried out the mechanical,
architectural, graphically ordered styles the West had already
initiated in honor of the machine age and were included more and
more often in exhibitions in the West.
</P>
<P>
   If the show at Sepia is representative, the Fukuhara brothers,
born in the 19th century, clung to landscape and details of
traditional buildings. At their most modern, they never quite
relinquished their ties to Japanese art of the past. They were
capable of circumventing the camera's built-in perspective system
to produce spaces more like those of Japanese screens and scrolls.
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Japanese art conceived of empty spaces as positive rather than
negative, not merely what is left over between and around objects
but every bit as important as solid matter. In Shinzo Fukuhara's
``Light With Its Harmony 8: Pond'' (1924), a tree with leaves that
might have been brushed on arcs slowly, horizontally across the top
of the frame. The water enclosed by the lines of trunk and branch
occupies two thirds of the picture space. Within those lines the
pond fairly tilts up on the surface of the image as water so often
does in Japanese art, and its outlined shape appears to lean
against the curve of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sea at New Year'' (1937), the reciprocal spaces of silvery
ocean and sky are separated by irregular hills that are subtly
darker but no more solid than the atmosphere and dissolve into
swaths of mist. A tiny boat hovers on the surface of the picture
like a splotchy swipe of diluted ink.
</P>
<P>
   In Roso Fukuhara's ``Kamikochi'' (1937), a great flourish of
mist between background mountains and frothy trees up front assumes
a shape at least as strong and commanding as that of the mountains.
In ``Miscanthus'' (1933), reedlike stems, as taut and straight or
elegantly scribbled as pen strokes, stand up before mountain ranges
so pale and delicate that they function as tonal washes applied to
a vertical backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures like these, immediately recognizable as ``Japanese''
but encompassing the dual discoveries of the ancient East and the
modern West, strike me as the most beautiful in the show.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan underwent chaotic changes in the 1920s and '30s _
modernization, industrialization, militarization _ Shinzo and Roso
Fukuhara continued to produce images of peace and quiet that
negotiated alliances between the old dispensation and the new. In
their way they denied what much of the world still believed: that
the twain would never meet.
</P>
<P>
   The twain insist on meeting and have done so repeatedly in the
realm of art, sitting on an endless loop of intercontinental,
interhemispherical influences, where East keeps sliding into West
and veering off to north or south or directions not yet mapped.

CLINTON SUPPORTS `EXPRESS WILL OF THE SERBIAN PEOPLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton accused embattled Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic Wednesday of trying to steal the
election from the opposition, and said the United States would
stand behind the Serbian people in their apparent quest to oust the
international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly appears from a distance that they had a free
election and somebody's trying to take it away from them,'' Clinton
told reporters in the Rose Garden before leaving for a fundraiser
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Europe and the United States should do is to
support the express will of the Serbian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was apparently stunned at opposition candidate
Vojislav Kostunica's strong showing in Sunday's elections, Clinton
administration officials and Balkan analysts said, and is trying to
buy time by insisisting on a runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know how to deal with this,'' said Kurt Bassuener,
a Balkan expert with the US Institute of Peace in Washington. ``He
did not expect to get hammered, apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking an exit strategy, Milosevic is cornered.
</P>
<P>
   He could give himself up and go to The Hague for trial as a war
criminal, hardly an appealing option for the man accused of causing
the deaths of tens of thousands in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He could go into internal exile in Serbia. But while Kostunica,
himself a Serb nationalist, has said he will not turn Milosevic
over to the International War Crimes Tribunal, Milosevic would not
be safe in his own land, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin to think that going to The Hague becomes a better
option than it looked a few weeks ago,'' since Milosevic would be
in danger of assassination, said Jim Hooper of the International
Crisis Group.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic could try to find a sympathetic country to give him
asylum. The most likely candidates would be Belarus and Iraq, a
White House national security official said, but even those rogue
nations wold probably not risk the international outrage by giving
Milosevic sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the United States look the other way if another nation
offers to take in the Yugoslav strongman. ``We've made it clear
there's no deal,'' said the national security official.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Milosevic with no easy way out, and Balkan-watchers
fear that with nothing to lose, Milosevic may create greater havoc.
</P>
<P>
   The West's greatest worry, a Clinton administration official
said, is that Milosevic will try to cut a deal with the opposition
under which he takes the title of President of Serbia, based on the
Socialist Party's domination of the Parliament, while leaving the
grander title of Yugoslav President to Kostunica. Yugoslavia
comprises Serbia, including the southern province of Kosovo, and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The White House strategy is to wait, making comments supportive
of democracy and free elections, while not appearing to dictate to
Serbia, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica cannot rule effectively if he appears to be kow-towing
to the West, which is still hated by many Serbs for NATO's bombing
campaign last year. Long-isolated and beaten down during four
regional wars and a trade embargo, Serbians need to be allowed some
dignity and a sense that they are making their own future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is not taking any sides,'' the official
said. ``We're just playing wait-and-see.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic,
Wednesday accused Western powers of using foreign and Yugoslav
media to destablize the country, and Russia warned against any
international intervention.

ISRAELI AUTHORITIES END PROSECUTION OF NETANYAHU
</HEADLINE>
  (With NETANYAHU-U.S.) 
By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After deliberating for six months, Israel's attorney
general on Wednesday said he had found insufficient evidence to
prosecute former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption
charges, clearing the way for a possible political comeback by the
conservative leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a 22-page decision released Wednesday night, Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein said that he had rejected a police
recommendation of last March that Netanyahu and his wife, Sarah,
face criminal charges of bribery, fraud and theft.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein said that he had closed the case because he did not
foresee ``a reasonable chance of conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   But, with biting language, Rubinstein condemned Netanyahu for
``improper'' conduct and said that the ``picture before us'' had
given prosecutors ``an ill feeling.'' He acknowledged that the
state attorney, Edna Arbel, had disagreed with his conclusion,
urging indictment on some charges.
</P>
<P>
   In an investigation that began over a year ago, the police
suspected the Netanyahus of conspiring with a contractor in an
illegal kickback scheme, of stealing gifts to the state and of
obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Netanyahus denied wrongdoing, claiming persecution by
political enemies and, after the media was alerted to raids of
their home, by an overly zealous police force.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Netanyahu will now return to politics,
seizing the momentum to re-establish himself at the head of a
rudderless right wing. But associates say that he will not make a
decision immediately, waiting instead to see if the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations produce a deal that could
shore up Prime Minister Ehud Barak's tenuous hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Barak released a statement saying that he respected the attorney
general's decision, understood the Netanyahus' ``feeling of
relief'' and wished the couple a happy New Year. Rosh Hashana, the
Jewish New Year, starts Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta on business, Netanyahu, who has spent the last year
as a consultant to Israeli high-tech companies, declined to comment
on the attorney general's decision, which was expected on Thursday,
or on his political future. He said only that he was ``relieved,
relieved, relieved.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this summer, Netanyahu described the
investigation as ``wrenching'' and ``scarring.'' He said that his
sons, 5 and 9 years old, had been taunted at school. ``We've been
in very dire straits,'' he said in August. ``For the boys, going to
school and hearing other kids saying, `Your father's a thief, your
mother's a criminal.' It's been very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   For three tumultuous years, Netanyahu led Israel at the helm of
a religious and nationalist coalition that was perceived
internationally as obstructionist to peace. He stepped down from
politics on the night in May 1999 that Barak, who ran on a
peacemaking platform, overwhelmingly defeated him.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the right wing has been splintered, incapable of
mounting an effective opposition to Barak, even as the prime
minister's government has teetered on the edge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even though Netanyahu disappointed many followers
and alienated many political colleagues while in office, nostalgia
has grown for his telegenic political skills.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Netanyahu neck-in-neck with Barak _ far stronger as a
candidate than Ariel Sharon, the former general and defense
minister who took his place atop the Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, 72, has indicated that he will seek to retain the
leadership, and several younger Likud officials have said that they
are considering a bid for the post when party primaries are held.
But Netanyahu, 50, could change their plans by throwing his hat
back in the political ring.
</P>
<P>
   The hint of a return by Netanyahu, in fact, could push Sharon to
consider joining a unity government with Barak to keep himself from
being shunted aside. But that is likely only if the present
Israeli-Palestinian deadlock continues.
</P>
<P>
   Associates Wednesday urged Netanyahu to make a quick decision.
Reuven Rivlin, a Likud lawmaker, said that Netanyahu, if he intends
a comeback, should ``return to activity immediately and put an end
to this whispering campaign and to a postponement that could cause
the Likud serious damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eitan, a Likud legislator who was a sharp critic of
Netanyahu's leadership, cautioned the party against romanticizing a
politician ``responsible for the largest electoral drubbing the
Likud has ever known, and for the early dissolution of the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Likud won only 19 seats in the election that Netanyahu lost,
seven less than Barak's One Israel/Labor faction and two more than
the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time that Rubinstein declined to indict
Netanyahu because of what he said was insufficient evidence while
sharply criticizing his comportment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, while Netanyahu was prime minister, the police
suggested that he stand trial on corruption charges in a case that
involved a supposed deal between Netanyahu and the former Shas
leader, Aryeh Deri, who is now in prison on a corruption
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The police believed that Netanyahu had agreed to appoint an
attorney general, Roni Bar-On, who would be sympathetic to Deri in
exchange for the Shas party's support for the so-called Hebron
interim agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Gearing up for a possible challenge by Netanyahu, One
Israel/Labor Party leaders were quick to recall that case Wednesday
night. ``I think that it is only in a country like Israel that
after two particularly critical public reports there can still be
talk about a political comeback,'' said Ophir Pines Paz, the One
Israel faction chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the police said the Netanyahus had ``illegally
removed'' gifts to the state of Israel, including candelabras,
silverware and carpets, when they left the prime minister's
residence. They also said that the Netanyahus had accepted up to
$100,000 worth of free services from a contractor, who later billed
the state for the private work.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Rubinstein said it was ``improper behavior for a
governing officials'' to ``amass great debt'' to a ``private
individual,'' the contractor, who was interested in nurturing a
relationship with the prime minister and his wife.

   HART'S HEISMAN: Notre Dame great Leon Hart's 1949 Heisman Trophy
is on the auction block at sothebys.amazon.com's Legends of the
Gridiron fall sale. No one had made the $100,000 opening bid as of
Wednesday afternoon, though the trophy has an estimated valued of
$150,000 to $200,000. The site's description of the trophy includes
information on Hart, one of only two linemen to win the award, and
a detailed description of the trophy's condition _ it has worn
corners and six holes around the base from being attached to the
Freedom Train that toured the U.S. in 1976.

<P>
   The Peachtree-City based Hooter's Tour, whose 2000 season ends
this weekend at White Water Country Club in Fayetteville, touts
itself as more than a training ground for the PGA Tour. Still, it
has been a place where players such as Lee Janzen, John Daly, Jim
Furyk and Tom Lehman have honed their games before moving up. The
tour's web site is geared more toward providing information to
aspiring players and sponsors than fans, but there are statistics,
rankings and tournament results. There are links to golf coverage
on other sites, as well as to the tour's namesake restaurant, where
you can find photos and information on its wings and waitresses.

   NASCAR's ``That's racin''' cliche didn't come about because

that some people don't try, though. There are fantasy leagues
devoted to the sport, and sites that provide statistics from tracks
and events with a history-as-handicapping lean. Speed FX breaks
down the Autocare 500 at Martinsville Speedway with driver averages
since 1990 or '95, and Jeff Gordon heads both lists. That may make
him the favorite Sunday, but not a lock when 43 cars start trading

RISE OF THE WEB FORCES IOC TO PROTECT ITS IMAGE FROM SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
(ATTN: Mo., N.C., Va.)  By FELICITY BARRINGER c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Christie
Ambrosi, the hard-hitting outfielder for the U.S. Olympic women's
softball team, has long had friendly dealings with her hometown
newspaper, The Kansas City Star. So, when asked, she readily agreed
to write an Olympic diary for The Star's World Wide Web site.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But shortly before she left for Sydney, Australia, in August,
she sent an e-mail message to the newspaper, saying, ``As far as
the diary entry, we aren't allowed to do them during the
Olympics.'' The International Olympic Committee was putting teeth
into its often-ignored rule against publication of athletes'
Olympic diaries during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrosi was not alone. Siri Mullinix, the North Carolina-born
goalkeeper of the women's soccer team, stopped her online chats
with The Greensboro News &AMP; Record said she could not contribute a
diary during the Games. The Hartford Courant got the same message
from Karen Scavotto, the 18-year-old archer from Enfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The 27th Olympic Games may be remembered for many things _ world
records, peacetime logistical planning _ but it will surely be a
benchmark in the struggle between those who hold intellectual
property rights in sporting events and those seeking to cover
sports, especially for the ever-expanding universe of news outlets
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the power of the Internet could eventually
undermine the economic foundation of the modern Olympic movement,
the Olympic committee is going to great lengths to control how and
where the images and accounts of the Sydney extravaganza reach the
public. The committee's actions echo what is happening in other
areas of sports, as both amateur and professional teams and leagues
aggressively invoke their property rights to control how and by
whom events are covered.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the committee's attention is focused on the Web. Here,
streaming video _ still in its infancy _ may eventually attain both
the technical quality and reach to cut into television audiences.
This could, in turn, dilute the value of the most valuable asset of
the Olympics: broadcasting rights. The Web could also spawn a horde
of virtual storefronts where those with no rights to Olympic
trademarks piggyback on the Olympic name to hawk their wares
without returning anything to the nonprofit committee, which
supports the athletes and the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects are worrisome enough to make Olympic officials
take a hard line now. No athlete diaries or online chats. No
streaming video of events _ even months-old replays of the
Australian Olympic swimming trials, as the Austrialian site
www.ninemsn.com.au discovered. No use of the trademarked Olympic
rings to promote news organizations' own Olympic coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Two months before the Games began, the committee filed a lawsuit
in federal court in northern Virginia to dislodge 1,800 so-called
cyber-squatters, who had registered domain names using terms
trademarked by the IOC. Names of the defendants took up 40 pages;
among the domain names were bet-on-the-olympics.com,
olympiccasinos.com, alienolympics.com. and olympicsexellence.com.
The lawsuit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 private Web monitors have been chosen on three
continents, using the latest search engine technology to monitor
possible violations of the IOC's property rights. One inadvertent
violator was TV Azteca of Mexico, which has broadcast rights within
Mexico. It had to drop a video clip of the opening ceremonies from
its Web site, which could be seen outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   The strict enforcement of the diary rule hit local newspapers
hard. Mike Fannin, the sports editor of The Kansas City Star, said,
``I would assume that it is their ball and if you want to play, you
play by their rules.'' But, he added: ``The readers miss that
connection with their local athlete. Christie Ambrosi's a softball
player in the Kansas City suburbs. When she walks into a bar,
people know who she is. The Olympics _ it's all about representing
your hometown, your city, your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the director of communications and
new media for the International Olympic Committee, is keenly aware
of the tension between property rights and unfettered coverage of
the Games. But, he said, ``I don't think the IOC can be seen in any
way limiting speech about the Olympics.'' He pointed out that
20,000 journalists are in Sydney _ nearly twice as many media
people as athletes, all free to cover the Games as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that the most important pieces of news, the
results, are released immediately and sent instantly by wire
services to all publications, online and off. Any journalist can
interview the athletes, he added. ``It's the most written-about
event every four years,'' he said of the Summer Games. ``We're very
far removed from any notion of limiting speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive enforcement effort, he said, is meant to ensure
that ``the association between the athlete, the sport, the values
and the symbol that represents all this is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has offered little revenue to the Olympics so far.
There are concerns that the Web could cut into television audiences
and undermine the economic underpinnings of the Olympic movement.
The committee took in about $1.3 billion for television rights to
the Sydney games alone. NBC paid $705 million for U.S. rights.
</P>
<P>
   And though great technological improvements are needed before
the Internet can offer high-quality video to large audiences, even
in print, the Web's reach still expands the power of once-small
publications. The existing rule against diaries was never enforced
against ``small newspapers,'' Servan-Schreiber said. Now, on the
Web, ``nothing is small.''

WHIMSICAL `GIRL ON THE BRIDGE' GIVES SUBTLE PLEASURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 HOUSTON CHRONICLE 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wondrously filmed, wryly amusing French romance ``The
Girl on the Bridge,'' a cabaret knife thrower picks a suicidal
woman as his next target.
</P>
<P>
   When Gabor, the knife thrower (Daniel Auteuil), tries to
convince the sad Adele (Vanessa Paradis) not to leap off a bridge
into icy waters below, he wants to save her and perhaps himself.
Gabor has knowledge of suicidal impulses.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning hardly hints at the luscious, playful, if rather
thin movie that follows. Directed at a sprint by Patrice Leconte
(``Monsieur Hire,'' ``Ridicule''), with vividly colorful dialogue,
``The Girl on the Bridge'' is an extravagant entertainment on a
tiny, by American standards, scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl on the Bridge'' (``La Fille sur le Pont''), in French
with English subtitles, is an un-Hollywood romantic comedy. There
are no laughs, yet a whimsical air dominates every moment. There
are no traditional love scenes between the principals, yet the
sexual tension is, quite literally, cut with a knife. A week after
seeing the film, its plot points may fade, but the movie's sensual
atmosphere will linger.
</P>
<P>
   Gabor claims he is on the bridge that frigid night to recruit
``targets'' among would-be jumpers. Adele may want to end her life
_ at 22 years old, she has had nothing but bad luck in her
desperate promiscuity _ but the idea of the knives brings fear to
the pit of her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never hit anybody,'' Gabor promises, ``in the stomach.''
He insists she has the luck they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the thrower that counts,'' he says. ``It's the
target. You have a special gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabor's own gift, besides steady hands and intense eyes that
seem to see other times and places, is spotting luck. Yet he's a
man with a mysterious past that hints of huge sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could smile sometimes,'' says Adele, who finds amusement
in her own sorrows.
</P>
<P>
   Together, their luck changes dramatically, at least at first.
When the manager at a sunny Monaco resort rejects their act, Gabor,
thinking on the spot, says he throws blind.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting performance, with frightened but excited Adele
pinned to a wall behind a sheet, is just the first of several
bravura scenes in which Leconte's brilliant blending of editing,
direction, acting and music creates a surreal and intensely sensual
cinematic experience.
</P>
<P>
   The throwing scenes are suspenseful. They are also amusingly
over-the-top, a confident director playing to an audience he trusts
to recognize the tongue-in-cheek quality and savor the melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Leconte makes sure we can't mistake the sexual excitement
between Gabor and Adele as his knives pierce the wall closer and
closer to her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I want,'' an aroused Adele says to Gabor after a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now?'' he asks, knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now. Anywhere,'' she says, and they rush off to another
encounter with the flashing knives.
</P>
<P>
   This is not for the literal-minded. Adele can hit 0 at a
roulette table five times in a row when her luck is hot, while
Gabor, banned from the casino, can see and guide her hands by ...
what? telepathy? She and Gabor literally talk to each other when
hundreds of miles apart as though it were natural.
</P>
<P>
   The casting is perfection, especially Auteuil (``Jean de
Florette,'' ``Manon of the Spring'') as Gabor. His craggy,
experienced face whispers of a thousand tragic nights hidden behind
those piercing eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Paradis possesses the correct hopeful contrast and, once Gabor
transforms Adele into his assistant, she gains an ethereal quality
missing in early scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's most static scene is the first, in which Adele
explains her unlucky past to a mysterious panel of out-of-focus
listeners. The rest of the movie, the camera zips and tilts and
even spins.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is beautifully shot in black-and-white by Jean-Marie
Dreujou, in glorious if briefly glimpsed European locations. It is
greatly enhanced by an evocative soundtrack of European and
American music.
</P>
<P>
   There is little real story, and the ending is pat. This is a
movie for viewers who value visual style and joyously wallow in
atmosphere. For those, it's near perfection. &QL;

   (At least one newspaper, however, has printed an athlete's diary
without repercussions. The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., ran a
first-person account Thursday from Joetta Clark Diggs, an 800-meter
runner. An editor there said no Olympic officials had objected.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Servan-Schreiber also said he feared that the better-known
athletes might use their own Web sites to communicate with fans
instead of giving interviews to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want athletes competing with mass media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new emphasis on restrictions like the diary ban is
infuriating to some. ``It's outrageous,'' said Bruce Keller, a
lawyer in New York who has represented both sides in intellectual
property cases. ``They are prohibiting these diaries as a condition
of participation in the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, the noted constitutional lawyer, said it was odd
that ``the increased availability of a means of communication leads
to a ruling seeking to assure that less is said.'' But he said the
IOC is not a U.S. governmental body and so is not bound by the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual fencing off of information and imagery by sports
franchises was well under way before the Olympics. In the last few
years, debates have been joined over whether game developments can
be distributed instantly by pager (they can, a federal appeals
court has ruled).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, NASCAR, the stock-car racing league, backed
off an attempt to make reporters seeking credentials at races like
the Daytona 500 agree that NASCAR was sole owner of ``images,
sounds and data arising from and during any NASCAR event'' _
including the racing times and scoring information.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Persinger, the sports editor of The Charlotte Observer
in North Carolina, the epicenter of the NASCAR universe, rebelled.
``They were saying, `If it happens during the event, we own the
intellectual property rights to it,''' Persinger said. ``And you
can't own the news.''
</P>
<P>
   John Griffin, the managing director for communications at
NASCAR, agreed that the proposed language went too far; the
franchise was trying to protect itself, he said, from freelance
photographers who put drivers' images on mugs or other commercial
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the International Olympic Committee _ a nonprofit
organization that gives more than 90 percent of its revenue to
sports federations, local Olympic committees, organizing committees
of host cities and athletes _ the stakes in controlling the Web
loom increasingly large, particularly in four, six or eight years,
when streaming video on the Web may be light years ahead of the
current fuzzy, jumpy images.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of the results. In January, the
committee proposed to The Associated Press, Reuters and three other
international news agencies that they hold off one hour before they
made the results available to commercial Web sites. The news
organizations objected, and the IOC backed off.
</P>
<P>
   All the issues raised by the Web will be discussed at an Olympic
committee meeting in December.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far in the Games, all scores had been sent out to news
organizations instantaneously, said the A.P.'s sports editor, Terry
Taylor. ``It's been going fine,'' she said. ``We're moving it as
fast as we get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the 15-hour to 18-hour time difference between Sydney and
the United States, many dedicated fans are turning to the Web for
results. Traffic on the sports sections of all major sites, like
sports.yahoo.com, msnbc.com and cnnsi.com, surged in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Weiner, NetRatings' vice president for analytic services,
says he does not think the Web has cut into the broadcast audience.
``People have been using it to determine what they want to watch on
TV,'' he said. ``If you were a basketball fan and heard they had a
close game against Lithuania, you might be interested in
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fannin of The Kansas City Star said, ``I think all these
leagues are getting more proprietary about their rights and what's
theirs and what's theirs exclusively _ especially when it pertains
to the Internet.'' And when it comes to sports, ``it's a seller's
market.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yasser Arafat traveled 19 miles off the Gaza coast
Wednesday to light the first flare stack over a major offshore
deposit of natural gas, proclaiming it ``a gift from our God to our
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, celebrating the multibillion-dollar discovery of what
industry officials confirmed was a major gas deposit, said the
deposit would provide ``a strong foundation for a Palestinian
state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gift from our God to our people, to our children, to
our women, to our people inside and outside, to our refugees and
those who are living here on our land,'' the Palestinian leader
declared. The deposit is considered to be more than enough gas to
meet Palestinian needs for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat gave a signal to the foreign crew to light the flare atop
the floating platform, and gas from the test well burned overhead.
Reciting a passage from the Koran, he echoed a divine promise that
the ``weak and dispossessed of today'' will become the ``leaders
and heirs'' of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The BG Group of London, which won a concession in November from
Arafat's Palestinian Authority to drill in the 2,000-foot-deep
waters off the Gaza Strip, said Wednesday that this first Gaza test
well was flowing at a strong 37 million cubic feet a day, more than
in any of eight recent offshore gas strikes in nearby Israeli
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made an extremely good discovery,'' Timothy Forbes,
who runs BG operations in North Africa and the Middle East, told
reporters in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government, despite criticism from rightist
opposition leaders, has tacitly permitted the exploration effort,
renouncing any sovereignty over the Mediterranean waters directly
off the Gaza Strip. One Israeli gas-exploration consortium,
contending that the Palestinian Authority lacks the legal status to
grant energy exploration permits, has sued in Israeli courts to
block the Gaza drilling.

<P>
   Executives said BG could not confirm reserve figures until it
had further analysis of the drilling information next month. Yet
even by conservative estimates, they said, the mile-deep deposit
known as Gaza Marine 1 should more than satisfy projected
Palestinian electric-power needs for 10 to 20 years, with enough
left over for possible sale to Israeli or other foreign customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the key messages here today,'' said Hugh
Miller, who manages the Palestinian and Israeli concessions of BG.
``There will be gas available for export. And from my conversations
with Palestinian officials, including President Arafat, it is clear
that they have no interest in just sitting on a gas surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   At current prices, the value of the strike was estimated at $2
billion to $6 billion, depending on pressure, quantity and other
variables. It could take two to three years and $250 million to
build the pipelines and other installations needed to deliver the
gas onshore, Palestinian officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A domestic Palestinian gas supply could eventually eliminate
spending on electricity and household fuels that are now imported
from Israel, and exports would provide a needed source of dollars.
The gas industry ``will prove to be one of the main economic
cornerstones for a future independent state of Palestine,''
predicted Said Khoury, president of the Consolidated Contractors
Co. of Athens, Greece, the minority partner in the project.
</P>
<P>
   The BG Group plans to drill at least one more test well off Gaza
while continuing explorations in adjacent concessions in Israeli
waters, executives said. Some of the larger potential gas reserves
identified by geologists lie underneath the division between
Israeli and Palestinian waters. The boundary has never been
precisely delineated.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   While soft and squishy sports are often best suited to indoor
play, PlayHut's Shoot A Round basketball contraption ($22;
www.playhut.com functions well in any environment. Essentially a
wire and mesh pop-up box with a hoop, the modestly sized ``portable
basketball court'' practically erects itself (though collapsing the
unit can involve a rich lesson in origami) and comes complete with
four undersized balls. Shooting ``nuthin' but net'' returns a ball
down a funnel flume. Moreover, crashing the boards is an immensely
forgiving endeavor as the Shoot A Round will yield completely and
then sproing itself back into shape. A lot of fun for the whole
family.

TV INTRODUCES ITS NEW FALL SEASON OF WEB SITES  
 SURPRISING GEOGRAPHY OF AMERICA'S DIGITAL DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Maybe it is because they are used
to a new season in the fall. But the Internet services that are
tied to big television networks seem to be picking this month to
showcase new versions of their sites.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Walt Disney's Go.com, which incorporates sites
related to its ABC and ESPN networks, introduced a complete
redesign. And on Monday, NBC Internet, a company partly owned by
General Electric's NBC network, will introduce its new flagship
NBCi.com. The site brings together under one name the features from
a jumble of brands that the company built and bought, including
Snap, Xoom and NBC.com. (The MSNBC news site and the CNBC financial
news site are separate.)
</P>
<P>
   While neither Go.com nor the NBCi sites have been able to keep
pace with the growth of the very largest Internet portals _ America
Online, Yahoo and Microsoft's MSN _ they are coping in very
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Go is trying to squeeze more from less. It has stripped down the
site to little more than a search engine while increasing the size
and number of advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   NBCi, by contrast, continues to add features and technology in
order to try to beat the bigger portals at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend a lot of time on Yahoo,'' said Edmond Sanctis,
NBCi's president, noting that the greater the number of pages seen,
the more ads are sold. ``We got a lot of people to try us as a
search engine, but we never got people to stay. We want to go from
an average of three or four pages per visit to eight pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of the site's new initiatives appear to be copied
from Yahoo.com. Its advertising urges users to customize NBCi to
their personal taste, much as the popular My Yahoo feature does.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Yahoo offers free Internet access through Kmart,
NBCi is making a similar offer through Montgomery Ward. NBCi has
also introduced a free software program that lets users search the
Web even when they are not on its site. And yes, Yahoo also has its
own search software.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, NBCi says its products will be different from and
better than the competition. Its personalization software, for
example, will aim to learn as much about each user as possible so
that searches are more fruitful. A user in Britain, say, would get
a different result of a search on ``football'' from someone in
Boston.

   Surprising Geography of America's Digital Divide
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the digital divide is still more like a gaping hole, with
nearly half of the U.S. population lacking access to the Internet.
But a surprising new study says that families with lower incomes
and less education, once they log on to their home computers, on
average spend a lot more time there than do others.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen/NetRatings, people earning $21,000 to
$33,000, typically in blue-collar, farming or service fields, with
a high school education at most, spent the most time online in June
_ 11 to 12 hours, compared with the national average of nine hours.
The people who spent the least amount of time online in June were
those with an income range of $53,000 to $136,000.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy O'Neill, group manager and senior analyst at NetRatings,
said much of the disparity can be attributed to the fact that
blue-collar workers, in factories and service jobs, for example, do
not have access to the Internet at work. Higher-income office
workers can log onto the Web during the day, reducing the need to
go online once they are home.
</P>
<P>
   The study uses a target marketing system known as Prizm, which
classifies U.S. households into 62 neighborhood clusters, composed
of racial and socioeconomic types, and applies a label to each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is still a digital divide; minorities are still
underrepresented on the Internet,'' O'Neill said. ``But when lower
socioeconomic groups get online, they do find sites relevant to
them and spend a disproportionate amount of time there.'' She said
this indicated that the Web offered a more diverse set of services
than some people might think.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that a lower-income cluster centered in the
South spent an average of 12.6 hours online in June. That cluster
is characterized as predominantly black, blue-collar laborers with
a median income of $20,500. A cluster made up of Hispanic Americans
with a median income of $32,600 spent an average of 11.4 hours
online.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed differences in the kinds of sites people
visited from home.
</P>
<P>
   Those people who spend the most time online use entertainment
and shopping sites like Walmart.com and Emazing.com, while more
affluent users spend more of their online time visiting finance
sites like Schwab.com and TheStreet.com.

WIRELESS NET ACCESS SPEEDS UP (COLUMN) &HT;    By HENRY NORR
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   An announcement last week from Metricom Inc. marked a milestone
in the history of data communications in the Bay Area and beyond:
For the first time, wireless Internet access is available at high
speeds here.
</P>
<P>
   At 128 kilobits per second, the Los Gatos company's newly
enhanced Ricochet service is more than twice as fast as a
conventional modem _ and more than 10 times the speed of other
wide-area wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   The company also rolled out the high-speed service in Baltimore,
Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix and, on a limited basis,
Manhattan. Atlanta and San Diego have had it since June. Seattle
and Washington, D.C., as well as 15 airports and various university
campuses across the country also have Ricochet service, although
for now those areas are still limited to a nominal 28 Kbps.
</P>
<P>
   Metricom's plan goes a long way toward solving the two big
problems with the old Ricochet service. With coverage in only three
metropolitan areas, it wasn't something most mobile professionals
could count on as an overall solution for Internet access on the
road. And with actual throughput of no more than 22 or 23 Kbps _ at
least in my experience as a Ricochet subscriber of more than two
years' standing _ it was adequate for e-mail but barely tolerable
for surfing a Web that's increasingly laden with ads, graphics,
animation and other bandwidth-devouring doodads.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the new service brings a new problem: price. The
old Ricochet was $29.95 a month, a rate that struck me as fairly
reasonable, even though I didn't use the service most days. But the
new plan, offered through several service providers, will be priced
about $70 per month.
</P>
<P>
   That rate, obviously, will limit the market severely _ aside
from Internet millionaires with nothing else to do with their
money, I think only salespeople and others who really need constant
access to online data will be able to justify the price.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's the opening of a new era, and it puts Metricom at
least 18 to 24 months ahead of the big boys in telecommunications.
It'll be interesting to see whether they can capitalize on the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   BRAVE NEW WORLD: Meanwhile, eager entrepreneurs keep thinking of
clever new things to do with mobile phones. Consider this sampling
of initiatives just from the last few weeks:
</P>
<P>
   Handspring, as you probably saw last week, finally announced the
long-awaited phone module for its Visor line of Palm OS-based
personal digital assistants. Considering its $299 price _ not
counting the cost of Visor itself _ and its dependence on a network
(GSM, or Global System for Mobile communications) that's relatively
undeveloped in the United States, I'm not sure how successful the
VisorPhone will be. But even if unit volumes are limited, the
device could go a long way toward popularizing phone-based text
messaging in the United States. (It's already one of the hottest
technology trends in Europe and Japan.)
</P>
<P>
   And if it succeeds, it's bound to inspire a new wave of
competing phone-PDA hybrids. Early efforts in this direction _
IBM's Simon, the Nokia 9000 Communicator and Qualcomm's pdQ _ were
so clunky and overpriced, they gave the idea a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   But once users see how much easier it is to do messaging on a
device like the Visor _ with a relatively large screen, handwriting
recognition and onscreen soft keyboards _ than on a conventional
phone with just a 12-key dial pad, I bet both users and vendors
will be willing to take a second look. I'll bet Motorola's
disclosure today of a deal with Palm won't be the last such
alliance this year.
</P>
<P>
   LightSurf Technologies of Santa Cruz, the latest venture of
longtime tech heavyweight Philippe Kahn, showed off its first
product at this month's DemoMobile 2000 conference in Pasadena: a
thumb-sized digital camera that clipped on to a next-generation
phone from Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Using a patent-pending wireless acceleration technology and
back-end image-management system, the phone quickly transmitted
images from the camera and automatically posted them on a special
Web site where they could be viewed and downloaded by anyone with a
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, the United States is merely beginning to catch up
with Japan, where similar devices are apparently already a
sensation. My own guess is that the idea won't take off here until
the wireless phone networks offer significantly greater bandwidth,
but with luck that should happen in a couple of years _ especially
if Metricom starts to put some real competitive pressure on the
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   FunMail, a startup in Pleasanton, Calif., is developing an
``animated instant messaging'' service for I-Mode. Users send a
short text message to the FunMail Web site (www.funmail.com), where
a ``text-to-animation engine'' automatically generates a
cartoon-like sequence based on key words in the text; once the
sender approves, the text and animation are sent together to the
intended recipient, either on another I-Mode phone or on any
browser-equipped computer.
</P>
<P>
   The service is already available (and about to enjoy a major
upgrade) for desktop computer users, and company officials say
they'll have it running before long on additional phone formats.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia, the Finnish phone giant, introduced a new GSM phone
called the 3310, which features extended support for online chat
(including built-in libraries of pictures and smiley icons),
graphical ``screen savers,'' four built-in games and a new feature
that makes the phone vibrate at critical moments in game play.
</P>
<P>
   RealTimeTouch, a division of Design Systems Research and
Development in Alpine (San Diego County), went Nokia one better _
conceptually, at least _ with word of technology it says will
enable wireless devices to ``send and receive instantaneous,
person-to-person touch transmissions.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, according to the news release, ``a husband and wife
who have been notified of a crisis (might) speak to each other via
cellular telephone. In order to reassure his wife, the husband
squeezes his phone. His wife immediately feels her husband's touch
as the phone expands in her hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site (www.realtimetouch.com) takes this idea _
for which RealTimeTouch says it has patents pending in more than
100 countries _ considerably further. Among other descriptions of
possible applications of the technology, it says business owners
could seal deals by shaking each other's cell phones; teen idols
could virtually ``hold the eager, outstretched hands of their
excited fans''; and politicians and religious leaders could
``convey trust and sincerity (by) touching millions of viewers
during interactive television, Web-based, and live performances.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology, according to the company, could even
``revolutionize current military strategies'' and health care,
possibly making ``the difference between life and death for an
infant'' starved for physical attention.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to Craig Linden, CEO of RealTimeTouch, who explained
that all this would begin with phones that, like the Nokia 3310,
simply have programmable vibrators. The next step, he said, will be
adding special transducers that expand or contract parts of the
phone on receipt of a coded ``touch transmission.'' Then would come
new devices capable of much more varied and extensive movements _
for example, remote-controlled teddy bears, physical-therapy
devices and military machines. In effect, they'd be
phone-controlled robots.
</P>
<P>
   Linden even has a trademark on the term ``CyberHugs.'' The
imagination runs wild ...
</P>
<P>
   TIME TRAVEL: Yesterday marked an important date for commuters to
or from the Peninsula and the South Bay, not to mention Giants fans
from those areas: Caltrain made major changes to its schedule,
adding 10 new trains on weekdays and four on Saturdays. To
``improve reliability'' _ that is, to give you a slightly more
realistic idea of how long your trip will really take _ the agency
is also adding four to eight minutes to the weekday San Jose-to-San
Francisco timetable and a whopping 25 minutes on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even if you're a regular rider (as I used to
be), the schedule information you carry in your head probably isn't
much good anymore, and at least for a while most users will be
checking the new timetable frequently. Caltrain will be happy to
give it to you on paper, but if you don't have it yet or don't want
to carry one more document, technology can help.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true for owners of Palm handhelds, thanks to a
local programmer named Rob Barnes: He has ust updated his nifty
little Caltrain Schedule app, which will show you arrival and
departure times for any two stops you select.
</P>
<P>
   The program is free, and the new version takes up just 23
kilobytes of memory, only a third as much as the old one. You can
download it from Baynes' personal site
(www.members.home.net/rbaynes/palm/) or from Palm Gear H.Q., the
leading online library for Palm OS software (www.palmgear.com).
</P>
<P>
   If you're into this sort of thing, check back regularly for
updates _ Baynes has plans to add lots of new features.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Gear also has a Caltrain map in a format you can display on
your Palm, provided you've installed FireViewer (formerly Image
Viewer) _ just search for ``caltrain map.'' Be careful, though,
about another schedule app called CalTrain 1.2: Its database is now
out-of-date, and author Anand Rajaraman says he can't spare the
time to update it (though he'll make his source code available if
someone else wants to).
</P>
<P>
   BART riders, by the way, can also keep that system's timetable
in hand with BART Scheduler, a Palm OS program by Mike Wittman. It
has some nice extras, such as an option to show only trains that
allow bikes. It's at Palm Gear, too, or at Wittman's site
(www.cs.berkeley.edu/wittman/bart-scheduler/).
</P>
<P>
   An aside: The availability of so much specialized software like
this is one of the best arguments for the Palm platform _ the
Pocket PC camp is going to have a hard time catching up even if its
hardware is superior. Just this month Palm said its count of
registered developers has topped 100,000. Microsoft won't say how
many developers have committed to Windows CE, but it's clear that
the number is only a small fraction of Palm's total.
</P>
<P>
   On the transportation front, though, you're not out of luck even
if you don't have a Palm or compatible device _ with a PC, a Mac, a
Pocket PC or (presumably) anything else with a Web browser, you can
find the new Caltrain timetable, plus schedules for dozens of other
Bay Area transportation services, at www.transitinfo.org, a
convenient central site supported by the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission. For hard-core schedule junkies, the site
even lets you sign up for e-mail alerts about future timetable
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The slickest high-tech schedule service is reserved for riders
of the Muni's five Metro lines and the 22-Fillmore trolley bus, as
well as Emeryville's Emery-go-Round shuttle service. An Emeryville
company called NextBus Information Systems runs a site
(www.nextbus.com) that estimates when the next bus will arrive at
the stop you select, based on actual, real-time location
information transmitted from GPS devices installed on the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   As The Chronicle's Ed Epstein reported last month, the free
service is now available not only on conventional Web browsers, but
also on mobile phones with Internet and text-messaging
capabilities, on the Palm VII and Palm V devices with OmniSky
wireless modems and on selected two-way pagers, including Research
in Motion's Blackberry line.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Take heart _ complicated gadgets will someday seem simple
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I walked into the massive Las Vegas casino auditorium
on opening day for a big consumer electronics show. On the
giant-screen TV there was a close-up video of a VCR with the clock
flashing in red: 00:00.
</P>
<P>
   Superimposed was this headline: ``The shame of our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have trouble setting the time on a VCR or following
the instructions in the manual. Our gadgets are impossibly complex
and often don't work as well as they should.
</P>
<P>
   If your lawn mower were as cranky and complex as a home
computer, the world would be overgrown with weeds. And the
instructions for most gadgets read like the operation manual for a
747.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you follow the directions, your DVD or computer can
make you look like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   It happens to me. I'm not a great expert, but I've spent time
running control boards at commercial radio stations, have passed
FCC examinations and know enough to grab a soldering iron by the
cool end.
</P>
<P>
   But just the other night I tried to show a DVD movie on my home
theater system, and the television turned itself off every time I
tried to switch from the cable to the DVD player. My guest was a
Ph.D. scientist at Vanderbilt. Neither us could figure out why the
TV wouldn't work, nor could we figure why it suddenly began working
again.
</P>
<P>
   Why are things that complicated? There's an easy answer. Like
most easy answers, it isn't very satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Your gadgets are that complicated because they are, well, they
are complicated gadgets. Your PC is much more powerful than the
computer that went along on Apollo missions to the moon. That VCR _
now old tech _ is the offshoot of television broadcasting
technology that brought stunning changes to commercial TV. Your DVD
player is such a miracle it was literally considered impossible a
decade before it was introduced. Even your microwave oven is based
on the technology that made radar possible.
</P>
<P>
   Life and technological advances move at an incredible pace
today. Technologies once took decades to reach the ordinary person
_ and got refined along the way. Nowadays, complex gadgets are on
sale at the discount store while they're still warm from the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, over time, things will get better.
Technology follows a well-worn path through history, and if you
look down that path you'll see the future. Early home radios were a
mess. To tune them you had to fuss with various settings. There was
enough knob twiddling to make a safecracker proud.
</P>
<P>
   There were magazines aimed at early owners of radios and
televisions, offering tips on how to make them work. But things
eventually got better. When was the last time you needed to read
the manual for a radio or to take a class on how to operate a
television set?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are some simple rules that may help.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every electronic gizmo you own has a microprocessor
brain. When things get really out of whack, you often can reset
that microprocessor by removing the power. For instance, the manual
for my big-screen television suggests that when the remote control
(it said ``when'' not ``if'') stops working to remove the batteries
to reset the processor. Read the instruction manual for your
gadget, and you may find it has a built-in reset switch that will
perform the same function.
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume you've done something wrong if you slavishly follow
the instructions and that gadget stubbornly refuses to work. Try
again. I can't explain why this is true any more than I can tell
you why my cat sometimes sleeps on the TV. But it works.
</P>
<P>
   If your home computer stops working, try restarting it. If it
works, avoid the natural temptation to fix the computer. Fixing
computers causes more damage than anything I know, including
dropping them.
</P>
<P>
   The most important rule is this: When you buy a new gadget, ask
to see the instruction manual. If you can't understand the manual,
don't buy the device.
</P>
<P>
   None of this advice should be necessary. Your DVD player should
be as simple to use as the telephone. Until that day comes, the
most important attributes needed are patience, a good sense of
humor and a 13-year-old child to fix the stuff you break.

   The most extensive analysis of women's views in this campaign
season has shown that as the economy has improved, American women
have been taking a much closer look at the quality of their lives,
and not liking a great deal that they see.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy has bolstered the incomes of millions of
families, but it has also exacerbated the sense of estrangement
between the haves and have-nots, and has left many women with the
feeling that they have less and less time to spend with their
families and properly care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was drawn from a series of focus groups and a
bipartisan national poll conducted for Lifetime Television and the
Center for Policy Alternatives. The joint project was called
Women's Voices 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest it won't be easy for politicians of either
party to fashion a ``women's message'' because the women's vote is
far from monolithic, and some of the issues of concern to large
numbers of women are so tough and so complex they will require very
creative solutions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, two of the major issues of concern to poll
respondents were the ever-tightening ``time crunch'' (more time at
work, less time with family) and what was perceived by many
respondents as a decline in the nation's moral values. The best way
to reverse the decline in moral values, according to the poll, was
for parents to spend more time with their children. But the
ever-increasing demands of work have made that virtually impossible
for most families.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, 59 percent of women with children under 6
said they were finding it harder to balance the demands of work and
family now than they did four years ago, when the last Women's
Voices analysis was conducted. And 30 percent said it was ``much
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found:
</P>
<P>
   _ That a large majority of women _ 72 percent _ would like their
health insurance to be independent of their employment. This was
not even one of the issues the pollsters had intended to ask about,
but it came up repeatedly in the focus groups that preceded the
polling. Politicians should take notice.
</P>
<P>
   _ That 93 percent of African-American women, 91 percent of
Latinas, 90 percent of Asian-American women and 87 percent of white
women said equal pay and benefits for women should be one of the
top policy priorities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ That retirement is a major worry for many women. Some 85
percent of Democratic women and 77 percent of Republican women want
pension benefits that can be transferred from one job to another.
</P>
<P>
   _ That nearly half of all women _ 48 percent _ feel they
eventually will be responsible for the care of a parent or other
elderly person.
</P>
<P>
   The polling appeared to show that, more than ever, class
distinctions among women are being shaped by whether a woman is
college-educated and married. Women who are neither are frequently
in a woeful economic state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unmarried women feel so much more economically marginal than
married women,'' said Celinda Lake, who conducted the polling with
Linda DiVall, Linda Williams and Anna Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, like men, women are finding a big economic
divide between those who have a college education and those who do
not. And the awareness of these distinctions is increasing, Lake
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are now more likely to say they are concerned about the
growing divide between the rich and the poor,'' she said. ``The new
economy, the new prosperity, has made the class differences more
dramatic, because while everyone agrees the economy is better and
offers more opportunity, one side of America tends to feel it has
benefited much more than the other half of America.''
</P>
<P>
   While these concerns do not all lend themselves to government
solutions _ and some, like the time crunch, offer difficulties that
approach the level of paradox _ there is a noticeable sense among
women that government can and should try to do what it can.
</P>
<P>
   The good times are seen as pretty good, not great. And many of
the poll's respondents, with little in the way of savings and
troubling memories of the job crunch of a few years ago, look to
the future warily.

NETANYAHU, IN ATLANTA, IS ALL SMILES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Mich)  (With ISRAEL-NETANYAHU)  
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA, _ Benjamin Netanyahu was among a crowd of techies here
Wednesday, trying his best to pitch the merits of an Israeli
telecommunications company while being repeatedly interrupted by
calls on his cellular telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, story's breaking,'' he said with a satisfied grin.
``It's a nice story to break.''
</P>
<P>
   He was all smiles, dressed in a dark suit and checkered tie. But
Netanyahu, who was at a technology convention here this week to
generate press for Telco Systems, spilled no news himself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he remained strategically mum about his exoneration.
Asked how he felt about the Israeli attorney general's decision not
to prosecute him after a yearlong investigation, Netanyahu would
say only, ``relieved, relieved, relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was called in for interrogation, the public investigation
began one day after Rosh Hashanah,'' he added. ``It was formally
closed a day before Rosh Hashanah.'' The formal decision by the
Israeli attorney general was to be announced Thursday, and Rosh
Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, begins Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting inside a conference room at CNN headquarters here,
Netanyahu declined even to say who he was on the phone with. ``Just
people from Israel,'' is all he would offer.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to reflect on the impact of the latest developments
on the Likud Party, or its Labor opponents. And he remained
teasingly reticent about whether he plans to return to politics,
insisting that he wished to speak to his family and his lawyers
first.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu had been scheduled to speak with a stream of
reporters, most of them covering technology, later in the day. But
he canceled those plans, took a private plane to Ann Arbor, where
he was to give a talk at the University of Michigan, and then was
to catch an El Al flight from New York to Israel Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really like to talk about it once I go there,'' Netanyahu
said of his potential political plans. ``I'd like be there in
Israel to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he insisted, he had not even seen the text of the
report, only had its highlights read to him over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   By whom?
</P>
<P>
   A smile and a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the former prime minister revealed nothing of his plans,
his current boss, Zvi Marom, chief executive officer of Telco's
parent company, BATM Advanced Communications, did, predicting that
Netanyahu would likely return to politics.
</P>
<P>
   If Netanyahu demurred on questions about his political opponent,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Marom repeatedly lashed out on his
behalf. ``When a witch hunt happens and you don't get a witch, you
have yourself a martyr,'' he added. ``He will be forced into
politics. His popularity is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was at the Telco Systems booth in the subbasement of
the convention center Wednesday morning at 11 a.m. when news came
over his cellphone. Marom said he watched his face relax. ``He
looked at me. I looked at him and we knew.''

DENMARK TO VOTE ON WHETHER TO ADOPT EURO AS ITS CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark _ Denmark, pursuing an odd calling as the
barometer of Europe's mood, holds its fourth referendum in less
than a decade on Thursday on what degree of integration with the
European Union the country desires.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the question being put to just over 4 million voters
is whether Denmark should follow 12 other countries of the
15-member Union and join a shared European currency, the euro. But
the real issue in the vote may be summed up otherwise: it's the
politics, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish currency, the krone, is pegged to the euro and has
followed the currency's 25 percent slide against the dollar over
the last 21 months. This link will be maintained whatever the
outcome of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But even if this arrangement ties Denmark irrevocably to
Europe's economic fate, many Danes are concerned about adopting a
currency they see as a political symbol of a push for a European
superstate in which the identity of small nations like Denmark
would be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countries should have their own borders, their own defense and
their own currency, but all of this is being eroded by attempts to
create a United States of Europe,'' said Peter Skaarup, a member of
the right-wing Danish People's Party. ``If we give up the krone, we
won't be masters in our own house any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fears have bolstered the ``No'' campaign, and most opinion
polls suggest that Danes will reject the euro. The vote, however,
is too close to call, with at least 10 percent of the electorate
undecided, and the government of Social Democratic Prime Minister
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is placing its faith in a last-minute swing in
favor of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Other European governments will be watching closely. The
weakness of the euro since its introduction in 1999 has been tied
partly to a market perception that the will does not exist in the
European Union to pursue the sort of political integration that
would bolster the currency.
</P>
<P>
   A Danish rejection of the euro would inevitably reinforce such
sentiments at a time when the European Central Bank, with support
from the United States and Japan, has already felt obliged to
intervene in support of the currency. Any prospect of Britain and
Sweden adopting the euro would also recede.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll published on Wednesday showed 47 percent of Danes
against the euro and 41 percent in favor. A poll by the National
Statistics Office gave the anti-euro camp an even wider victory,
with 51.7 percent voting ``No'' and 41.3 percent ``Yes.'' Only one
survey, by the Vilstrup polling center, gave a narrow victory to
supporters of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Jorn Thulstrup, a pollster who has followed the national mood
closely and was predicting a month ago that Denmark would accept
the euro, said he had now reluctantly concluded that the country
would reject it. ``It looks very negative,'' he said. ``There are
irrational fears that if we are in the euro, pensions would decline
every time the euro slips.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fears are unfounded in that the krone already tracks the
euro's rate against the dollar. In fact, it seems clear to most
analysts that Denmark's currency _ and so people's real incomes _
would be more vulnerable to a speculative attack if the country
opts to stay out.
</P>
<P>
   But the fears about pensions reflect anxiety among Danes that
adopting the euro would open the way to outside domination in the
form of an insistence that Denmark cut its taxes, scale back its
welfare state and deregulate its economy along the lines that
markets generally favor.
</P>
<P>
   One result of all the crosscurrents is the opposition to the
euro by both the left and the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing an unholy alliance of right-wing nationalists
concerned about our identity and left-wingers worried about
economic freedom,'' said John Iversen, a spokesman for the Social
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The government has argued that Denmark will be strengthened by
being inside the group of European nations that, in any event,
dictate the broad course of monetary policy here. And it has
insisted, but without convincing evidence, that this message is
getting through and that the euro will be adopted.

 &HT;    Jones stays a step ahead of turmoil
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - When she heard her name booming over the loudspeaker,
Marion Jones smiled and waved to the crowd at Olympic Stadium like
a woman with nothing on her mind except running fast, then jumping
far.
</P>
<P>
   Jones blocked out the turmoil in her private life Wednesday long
enough to reach the semifinals in the 200-meter dash and the finals
of the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I love to be; I love to be out there in front of
the fans,'' said Jones, who eased up for second place in her
second-round race with a time of 22.50 seconds. She then met the
qualifying standard on her first and only long jump. ``I love to be
in front of the lights. It kind of gets my mind off everything.
There's so much going on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after her husband, shot-putter C.J. Hunter, cried at
a news conference and denied he had taken performance-enhancing
drugs, Jones' quest for five gold medals continued without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-meter semis and final will be today, with the long jump
final Friday. The two relay finals will take place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I think the support has been incredible and I think
that's the reason I'm able to get through this,'' said Jones, who
said she had her family in Sydney and the public behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have e-mailed, and Jones said one message read, ``C.J.,
Marion, you're in our prayers and we believe in you 100 percent.
Prove them all wrong. Go out there and win all your golds.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Kipketer didn't win his gold Wednesday. The Kenyan
native, who missed the 1996 Olympics because he had just become a
Danish citizen, couldn't catch German Nils Schumann in the 800
meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is better than nothing,'' said Kipketer, whose time
of 1:45.14 was .06 behind Schumann. ``I'm 90 percent happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Olga Shishigina won the women's 100-meter hurdles, followed by
Glory Alozie, the Nigerian whose fiance was killed when he was
struck by a car before the Olympics. A gleeful Melissa Morrison of
the U.S., was the happiest bronze medalist Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former sprinter Irina Privalova of Russia won the 400-meter
hurdles with a time of 53.02. Privalova won the bronze in the 100
meters in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Pole vault legend Sergei Bubka, who no-heighted in Barcelona,
did the same here. He passed the first four heights, then missed
three times at 18-8.
</P>
<P>
   John Capel of the U.S. and Darren Campbell of Great Britain have
the fastest qualifying time in the men's 200 meters at 20.13
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Huffins, an assistant track coach at Georgia Tech, is
leading the decathlon entering Thursday's final five events.
``Everything was solid, but nothing was great,'' said Huffins, who
scored 4,554 points to lead Great Britain's Dean Macey by only
eight points. ``I'm looking for fireworks tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Jones, who conserved her energy Wednesday. She had two
rounds of the 200 meters, winning her heat in the morning with a
time of 22.75 seconds, followed by some rest and then the evening
race that was ``the easiest 22.50 I have ever run.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jones put on the brakes, Melinda Gainsford-Taylor of
Australia edged her by .01. Beverly McDonald of Jamaica had the
fastest qualifying time, 22.44.
</P>
<P>
   Only 64 minutes later, Jones had to get ready to long jump. She
qualified for the final on her first jump, 22 feet, 3 inches, then
didn't take her other two attempts. Heike Drechsler of Germany had
the best jump in her group of 22-5 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do the first jump and get home,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Hunter are staying at a local hotel but have switched
rooms with another athlete so they won't be disturbed by telephone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, I said today was going to be my most difficult day,
even though it's not difficult to run 22.7 and 22.5, and then to
come back and get that qualifying mark,'' Jones said. ``As you all
know, I've had difficulty with my qualifying jump. So to come out
this evening and to pop a qualifying jump on my first jump, I'm
pleased with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones initially thought she had fouled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `What?'' she said. ``I turned around expecting a
red flag. But no worries at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the controversy engulfing her husband, she said, ``I'll deal
with it all after the Sydney Games are done.''

PRICELINE SHARES FALL ON WORD THAT SALES WON'T MEET FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares in the online retailer Priceline.com fell more than 40
percent Wednesday after the company said its sales in the third
quarter would be as much as 11 percent below analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed the shortfall to slow sales of airline
tickets _ its signature product, which still account for 87 percent
of its sales. Priceline lets customers offer a set price for a
ticket on the condition that the company can specify the time of
the flight and the airline.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, sales have been hurt because of the
$20 surcharge that the airlines imposed on each round trip to cover
higher fuel costs and because of schedule disruptions at United
Airlines. Moreover, rather than sell more tickets through
Priceline, the airlines chose to have their own fare sales in
September, the company said. To compensate, Priceline encouraged
its customers to make lower bids for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail message sent to customers last week, for example,
sounded an increasingly desperate tone as it described Priceline's
``first ever airline ticket sale.'' It suggested that customers bid
as little as $99 for tickets. ``No reasonable offer will be
refused!'' the e-mail message said.
</P>
<P>
   The only effect of these promotions, the company said Wednesday,
was to reduce revenue even further. They did not increase overall
sales volume, as hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline said that ticket sales in the quarter ending this
month would be $20 million to $25 million less than its sales in
the quarter that ended in June. Even though the company has had as
many customers bidding this quarter, the airlines made available
fewer seats and the average ticket price declined.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the company said it expected revenue in the third
quarter to be $340 million to $345 million. Analysts had estimated
revenue of $360 million to $380 million. In the second quarter, its
revenue was $352 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company estimated that it would lose about 1 cent a share,
the same as it lost in the second quarter, excluding various
noncash charges. As a result, analysts no longer expect the company
to post its first profitable quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several analysts who had been bullish on Priceline _
including Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch and Anthony Noto of
Goldman, Sachs _ downgraded the stock Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``While consumers may go to Priceline because of high airline
prices or because of concerns about reliability, Priceline may not
be in a position to fill that demand profitably when they are
negatively affected by macroeconomic factors such as higher fuel
costs and any competitive promotional pricing activity,'' Noto
wrote to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Fay Landes, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, who has been
among Priceline's harshest critics, said the news emphasized the
flaws in the company's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call,'' she said. ``They have a business
that targets cheapskates, and it's hard to make money off them.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said, the company is vulnerable to being able to
get access to the airline tickets it needs, in the face of the
airlines' own discounting and other competing Internet sites.
``They don't have control of their supply,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline did say that its revenue from other categories _
including bidding for hotel rooms and long-distance telephone calls
_ would grow by 20 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's shares fell $7.89 to $10.75, a record low,
Wednesday. As recently as March, the company's shares were at $104,
giving it a value higher than any airline. Now the company is
valued at $1.8 billion, a relatively modest multiple of 1.4 times
the company's projected $1.3 billion in revenue for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of other Internet travel companies fell on the news.
Travelocity, which has an extensive partnership with Priceline,
fell $2.50, to $12. Expedia, which also runs a name-your-own-price
service, fell by 25 cents, to $14.75.
</P>
<P>
   And stocks of other big Internet companies, which have nothing
to do with airline tickets, also fell sharply on the news. Ebay's
shares dropped $7.19, to $63.50. Amazon.com shares fell $1.88, to
$37.88. And Yahoo, fell $12.06, to $90.38.

BILL TO ALLOW MORE FOREIGN HIGH TECH WORKERS STALLS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER HOYT 
c.2000 HOUSTON CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate agreed Tuesday to consider legislation
expanding the number of high-tech foreign workers allowed to work
in the United States, but the measure has been caught up in a
partisan dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want to expand the bill to lower immigration barriers
for almost a million people, including amnesty to hundreds of
thousands living in the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have blocked the proposal, which has White House
support, and accused Democrats of playing politics in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats said they want to add the lower immigration
barriers to a bill to fund the Commerce, State and Justice
departments in 2001 and warned Republicans that without the changes
President Clinton would veto the spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, a top legislative priority for the nation's
high-tech industry, would increase the number of H-1B visas for
highly skilled foreign workers from the current 115,000 a year to
195,000 annually through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   With employment at an all-time high, computer companies and
allied services say there are not enough American workers for all
the high-tech vacancies now. This year's visas had been allocated
by the end of March and under current law the number of high-tech
visas for foreign workers is set to drop over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical to our information technology age; it's critical
to our high-tech companies,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch told Democrats on the Senate floor that the bill was
``being held hostage because you want to give amnesty to 500,000
illegal immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said, ``I think the Democrats are
embarrassing themselves by making it clear they're not really for
this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered that they support increasing the number of
high-tech visas, adding that fairness dictates giving a similar
break to immigrants who are unskilled or semi-skilled as outlined
in the proposed Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``would rather risk delaying passage of the H-1B
visa bill than vote for the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act or
risk the political consequences of voting against it,'' said Sen.
Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Latino legislation would ease
restrictions on immigrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras
and Haiti to become permanent residents. The rules were relaxed in
1997 for Nicaraguans and Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would allow illegal immigrants who entered the
United States before 1986 to apply for permanent residency and
would reinstate a provision of immigration law that had allowed
immigrants to remain in the United States while waiting to receive
their green cards.

`BARENAKED' SURE TO PLEASE GROUP'S FANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 HOUSTON CHRONICLE 
 
For fans of the band Barenaked Ladies, ``Barenaked in America'' is
like an elaborate postcard from the road, full of ``wish you were
here'' delights and highlights.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But beyond fans, it's hard to imagine much audience for this
lively yet limited documentary directed by former teen heartthrob
Jason Priestley (``Beverly Hills 90210'').
</P>
<P>
   At best, these impish, eclectic pop-rockers from Toronto may
grow on the noninitiated _ as people, if not as music makers. After
all, they come across as hard-working, tight-knit and indifferent
to star trips.
</P>
<P>
   But for music and history, ``Barenaked in America'' _ though
well shot and edited _ is a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   Musical performances are rarely sustained until the end, and
though the film is filled with interviews of the band and its crew,
it's only a sketchy look at the group's formation and growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barenaked'' is really more of a personality portrait, with the
dominant personalities being singer-guitarists Ed Robertson and
Steven Page.
</P>
<P>
   As shown in concert footage, the latter is a superb vocalist _ a
hearty but controlled belter with a high range _ and both are
buoyant, bouncing, fun-loving showmen, stamping this group with
their irreverent yet never mean-spirited humor.
</P>
<P>
   They're also family men, so the usual rock regimen becomes
``sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll _ hold the sex and drugs.'' (Well,
they do admit a fondness for drink.)
</P>
<P>
   The film's biggest window to their lives is a 1998 tour in
support of the album ``Stunt,'' which provides several songs in
fragments (``Alcohol,'' ``Who Needs Sleep?'').
</P>
<P>
   Between gigs, we see the lads' silly attempt to attract
President Clinton outside the White House and their singing of the
American national anthem at a Philadelphia Flyers hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   They also perform on Conan O'Brien's ``Late Night'' show,
followed by a stiff and seemingly staged meeting backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Tour-bus footage is mundane, but tour stops can be illuminating,
especially an eventful trip to New York. There, the band gets
combative about a video shoot that doesn't go well (for ``It's All
Been Done'').
</P>
<P>
   This candor also extends to trivia, such as determining the
guys' favorite ``Sesame Street'' characters _ as if we care.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the ``too-much-information'' category: Robertson
declaring he could ``grow rice between my toes'' and the band
discussing pre-concert urination rituals.
</P>
<P>
   But amid this larkish if not gonzo behavior comes stellar
musicianship, a hard drive to entertain and one sobering
revelation: the diagnosed leukemia of keyboardist Kevin Hearn.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the band to seek treatment, his heroic return to
the stage at film's end brings gravity and soulfulness to an
otherwise airy if not empty-headed affair, especially given the
strong finishing-kick performance of ``Brian Wilson.''
</P>
<P>
   At such times, we can almost forget the band is Canadian. But
Priestley, who's also Canadian, seems self-consciously fixated on
it.
</P>
<P>
   We're constantly reminded the Ladies are Canadian, often in
tiresomely nationalisitic ways. There's even an assertion that
Canada discovered the Beatles months before the United States, as
if that matters, even if it's true.
</P>
<P>
   Yet then we're expected to embrace the Ladies as guys who just
happen to be Canadian but, more importantly, are a great band.
</P>
<P>
   We understand: Being Canadian means everything _ yet it's
irrelevant. &QL;

A story to 'Remember,' a film to forget &QL; 
By Bob Strauss &QL;
<P>
   Make speech. Throw ball. Make another speech. Win game.
Everybody sing golden oldie. Make speech again.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   End racism.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much the formula by which all things get along in
``Remember the Titans,'' an inspirational sports/tolerance
entertainment that, if nothing else, deserves some kind of trophy
for most bogus ``true story'' ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Purporting to tell the tale of a just-integrated Alexandria,
Va., high school football team's perfect 1971 season, this
sanitized slice of social consciousness has its heart in the right
place, at least for such a determined exercise in abject
commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   But while the anti-hate message the film relentlessly throws in
our faces -- when it's not busy with the equally vital task of
pumping us up to cheer for pre-ordained gridiron victories, anyway
-- is unassailably admirable, it would have been much more so if we
could believe a second of the film actually happened in the manner
depicted. The situations are so predictable, the characters such
limited stereotypes and the lessons presented so generic that it
all feels like calls from a screenwriting playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington is all hardcase determination (and
unfortunately little more) as Herman Boone, the coach brought in
from South Carolina to take over the forcibly bused team at T.C.
Williams High. This displaces the institution's beloved veteran
coach, Bill Yoast (Will Patton), a fair-minded, churchgoing widower
whose excitable 9-year-old daughter Sheryl (Hayden Panattiere, who
will charm as many people as she'll irritate) knows more about
football than he does.
</P>
<P>
   Though he abhors the thought of playing second fiddle, Yoast
agrees to coach defense when his white players risk their college
careers by refusing to suit up for anyone else. In no time, Yoast
and Boone realize that their love of the game and commitment to
their young charges transcend color barriers. Although Yoast quite
rationally questions Boone's exhaustive training methods -- which
seem less appropriate preparation for varsity athletics than for an
amphibious landing at Haiphong (and that's one more reference to
the then-raging Vietnam conflict than you'll get from the movie) --
he goes along with Boone's orders that black and white athletes
bunk and talk with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Once school actually starts amid angry parental protests, the
football squad is, if not a perfect picture of harmony, at least a
comparatively shining example. In a subplot that eventually goes
the manipulative way of ``Brian's Song,'' the team's white captain
(Ryan Hurst) and most Afrocentric member (Wood Harris) become the
closest of friends. Other meaningful positions are filled by a fat
white transfer (Ethan Suplee) who seems incapable of even noticing
anybody's color and the California hippie transfer (Kip Pardue),
dubbed ``Sunshine,'' whose ta'i chi approach to quarterbacking
proves invincible -- and, get this, who just might happen to be
gay!
</P>
<P>
   There are a few hallway fights, a broken window or two and some
shady conspiring among the district's old boys to drive Boone out
of his job (no uttering of the most common bigoted epithet, though,
at distributor Disney's insistence; the unrealistic absence, while
a lovely ideal, only makes you hear the bad word louder in your
imagination). But none of these fumbles could begin to block the
momentum of the Titans' relentless rush to the state finals and to
love, peace and happiness for all.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably missing from any corner of this Washington suburb is
the least evidence of drug use, homegrown hair, teen-age sexuality
or any of the other myriad forms of youthful rebellion that were
evident in even the deepest South by the '70s. What's specifically
off -- and too bad for the movie's mythmakers, but at least one
unquiet journalist out there is a T.C. Williams Class of '71 alumna
-- is the fact that the school was actually integrated in the
mid-1960s, rendering race an all but moot issue there by the year
of the miracle season.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for all its infuriating Jerry Bruckheimer-production
reductiveness and falsity, ``Remember the Titans'' does do one
thing ineluctably well. Although all the details in Gregory Allen
Howard's script and shortcuts in Boaz Yakin's direction feel wrong,
the film captures the genuinely inspiring, adaptable spirit with
which much of the segregated South, after decades of violent
opposition, so thoroughly accepted equality once forced to. I saw
it happen at my Florida high school in the early '70s, and while
the real process was both more difficult and in some ways more
graceful than that shown in ``Remember the Titans,'' it was the
same kind of beautiful, hard-won thing.
</P>
<P>
   One small expression of school pride, though, if you'll kindly
indulge: We did it despite a football team that well and truly
sucked. &QL; 
-----``REMEMBER THE TITANS'' &QL; 
Rated PG: mild violence, racism, children in jeopardy &QL; 
The stars: Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst,
Kip Pardue. &QL;

 &HT;    Holyfield restaurant down for count
 &HT;    By Tinah Saunders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chef John Akhile stood in an empty dining room
Wednesday morning, surveying what had been Holyfield's New South
Grill.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, county marshals guarded the upscale restaurant that
bears the name of boxer Evander Holyfield. They had served eviction
papers earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who lent his name to the business and was a primary
investor, was in Sydney for the Olympic Games and could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomas Jorgensen, property manager for the Sandy
Springs, Ga., building, Akhile had not paid rent in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Akhile was a partner, general manager and the man who wrote the
checks. The award-winning chef came to Atlanta's attention at
Buckhead's Azalea and later at the Galleria's Waverly Grill. But
his reputation was not enough to make a success of Holyfield's,
which opened in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had the business,'' Akhile said. ``We did everything
right. We had the demographics that showed people in Sandy Springs
ate out, and we did the community things you are supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's demise saddened Sandy Springs business leaders
who commended Akhile for his community involvement. ``He did so
many things to help (the community) out,'' said Donna Gathers,
executive director of the Sandy Springs Business Association. ``He
hosted meetings at little or no cost.'' She said the restaurant's
location, set back between two office towers, made it hard for
potential customers to find.

 &HT;    Athletes view showmanship as part of sport
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - In Olympic track and field, it is no longer just about
winning, but also how you look as you win. The lanes have been
turned into runways, the athletes models of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about appearances now. From styled hair to audacious
jewelry to painted fingernails to makeup to funky sunglasses to
alluring gear. All of it to make an impression beyond the display
of skill. My, how times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   How much? Even the Russian female athletes, whose stern, stiff
look once symbolized their country's iron-fisted government, bring
a softer, more appealing look with styled hair, makeup and
lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entertainers,'' said 100-meters gold medalist Maurice
Greene. ``It's a show. So... ''
</P>
<P>
   So, many of them dress like performers. Or like they want to be
seen. Or both. Greene wears gold necklaces and rings and an
earring. His Nike spikes _ resplendent with an array of crossing
colors _ were valued at $100,000 after he tossed them into the
stands following his victory last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I know that, I should get them back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Greene's showmanship pales in comparison to hurdler Gail
Devers. Here's a woman with the entire arsenal: heavy makeup, long
blue nails, silver hoop earrings, bright red shoes, a necklace with
a charm on it and the coup de grace _ a silver chain around her
waist, part of which dangles under her shorts and on her thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the late Florence Griffith Joyner did not have this
in mind when she elegantly dominated the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
Griffith Joyner said at the time that being gorgeous made her feel
good, which made her run faster
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance was marked by flowing hair, extended, painted
nails, facial blush, eyeliner and lipstick. She readied herself as
if she was going to a social event.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the point where track is now has been a gradual
progression that has reached an apex. Runners don expensive,
high-tech sunglasses _ even at night. There is enough jewelry, much
of it gaudy, to reflect a Mr. T Starter Kit.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes often do not even match the outfit. Rather, they match
the athlete's need to be seen. Michael Johnson, who sprinted to
Olympic lore in Atlanta in 1996 in his metallic gold spikes, had
another pair (with a brazen red Nike swoosh) for his 400-meter
conquest this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need more of that,'' U.S. 1,500-meter semifinalist
Gabe Jennings said. ``The sprinters, in particular, are the glamour
guys. They rip off their warm-ups and strut around, like `Look at
me.' But we need more of it. It helps with the connection to the
fans. We have to realize that we're performing. This is our
opportunity to connect with the fans. We have to make a race an
entire experience, and that includes looking good to go with
performing good.''
</P>
<P>
   That, apparently, is the credo. The women pole vaulters, for
instance, attracted catcalls for their two-piece outfits during
competition that looked more like what the beach volleyball players
wear. Tight-fitting tops and high-cut shorts. Sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Couch, the 100-meter hurdler who lives in Stone Mountain,
recalls an event in Barcelona that typifies pre-race preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the bathroom, in the mirror,'' she recalled. ``All
the athletes. We were putting on makeup. And we just started
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a performance when you go out there and run. If you look
good, you feel good. And when you feel good, you race good.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch wore a funky hairdo with a silver ring and diamond stud
earrings. ``Sprinters are very individualistic,'' she said. ``With
me, Nike gives us such an array to choose from, which is good
because we all have our own tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all have fallen into the fashion-conscious wave. U.S.
hurdles bronze medalist Melissa Morrison sported blue Oakley
sunglasses during her races and two diamond studs in each ear. But
that was it. Her hair was in pigtails and she wore no makeup or
lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   She did have a pair of custom-made Reeboks _ one shoe was blue,
the other red. However, they were abandoned for a pair of old
Reeboks after her first qualifying heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad because Reebok made them for me,'' she said. ``But
they were uncomfortable. That's mostly what I'm into. Comfort. I
don't put much thought into what I wear. If others do _ and they
certainly do, as you can tell _ that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I have on clothes, I can run. Now, if I'm running
naked, then I've got a problem.... The way things are, that might
not be a problem for some others.''

<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   ``Girlfight'' is both familiar and fresh. It's a classic
Hollywood underdog story given a shot in the arm by its unknown
star, Michelle Rodriguez, who delivers a performance that makes for
a great combination punch -- it's volatile and vulnerable,
masculine and feminine. Even when the movie runs a good 20 minutes
too long, it's never dull, at least not when Rodriguez is on screen
weaving her magic.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez isn't the only new talent on display. Karyn Kusama
makes her writing and directing debut with ``Girlfight,'' and while
the movie has its share of uncertain and predictable moments, it's
clearly the work of a good storyteller with a sharp eye for detail.
The directing award she won at Sundance was deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez plays Diana Guzman, a tough teen-ager living in the
Brooklyn projects who finds herself swimming in a steady stream of
trouble. Teachers and classmates don't understand her and her
clueless father (Paul Calderon) ignores her. Diana wears a mask of
toughness to protect her from the contempt and cruelties of her
world as well as the self-loathing and doubts that come with being
an adolescent.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's life changes after she discovers boxing. Her younger
brother,Tiny (Ray Santiago), is taking lessons at the local gym,
not because he wants to, but because his father wants to squelch
Tiny's artistic dreams and see him adhere to old definitions of
manhood. But it's Diana, not the sensitive Tiny, who becomes
enthralled by the energy and excitement of the ring, and soon she's
stealing money and pawning her meager possessions to pay for
training lessons.
</P>
<P>
   At the gym, Diana meets Hector (Jaime Tirelli), a Panamanian
immigrant who agrees to train her, and, in the process, becomes a
surrogate father. She also begins a wary friendship with a handsome
young boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), which blossoms into a kind
of Romeo-and-Juliet romance. Diana's father remains unaware of his
daughter's new hobby and new love; his ignorance does not translate
into bliss, however.
</P>
<P>
   In its training and athletic scenes, ``Girlfight'' plays like
``Rocky'' and a host of other sports films that feature an underdog
facing long odds. But Kusama invests other sections of the movie --
particularly the guarded relationship between the young innocents
-- with such authenticity that we can forgive lapses of
predictability. She's aided enormously by the charisma of her two
young leads. Douglas is a find in his own right, a perfect balance
of strength and sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Girlfight'' belongs to Rodriguez, who gives Diana a
compelling combativeness borne out of heartfelt desperation. Kusama
found the 21-year-old actress at an open casting call, and you
can't imagine anyone else playing the part. In her brief bio,
Rodriguez says she aspires to be an action hero. With
``Girlfight,'' she's already there and then some. &QL;

 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This has been a week for literary prizes. The Atlanta-based
Southern Regional Council announced three winners of the Lillian
Smith Book Awards, and the Lannan Foundation handed out $700,000 to
nine authors.
</P>
<P>
   Evan S. Connell, whose 1984 ``Son of the Morning Star''
eloquently retells the story of George Armstrong Custer, was
awarded a $100,000 lifetime achievement award from the Lannan
Foundation. Other winners are poets Herbert Morris and Jay Wright;
fiction writers Robert Coover, David Malouf, Cynthia Ozick and
Leslie Marmon Silko; and nonfiction authors Bill McKibben and Carl
Safina.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of the Lillian Smith Book Award, named for the Georgia
civil rights pioneer and author of ``Strange Fruit,'' are Michael
Keith Honey for ``Black Workers Remember: An Oral History of
Segregation, Unionism and the Freedom Struggle''; Andrew M. Manis
for ``A Fire You Can't Put Out: The Civil Rights Life of
Birmingham's Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth''; and Lawrence N. Powell
for ``Troubled Memory: Anne Levy, the Holocaust, and David Duke's
Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be presented at a noon luncheon Nov. 17 at the
Sheraton Colony Square. A young writers workshop will be held in
conjunction with the awards at 10 a.m., featuring Atlanta authors
Melissa Fay Greene (``Praying for Sheetrock'') and Anthony Grooms
(``Trouble No More''). Information: 404-522-8764, Ext. 28, or

   &QR;  What's in a name? It's clear by now that Oprah Winfrey likes
books with women characters who triumph over seemingly
insurmountable obstacles. Apparently she also is partial to
characters named Ruth. The talk show queen's 37th book club
selection is ``Drowning Ruth'' (Doubleday, $23.95) by debut
novelist Christina Schwarz. An earlier Oprah selection was Jane
Hamilton's ``The Book of Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in Wisconsin at the end of World War I, Schwarz's novel
focuses on Amanda Starke, a Lutheran farmer's daughter who returns
to the family farm after being seduced and shamed. When Amanda's
brother-in-law returns from the war, he finds his wife dead of
mysterious circumstances and his young daughter, Ruth, in Amanda's
care. Amanda will tell him nothing about the night his wife drowned
or about what happened to her parents.

   &QR;  Other media: Nelson DeMille has sold the movie rights for ``Up
Country,'' the sequel to ``The General's Daughter.'' The catch is,
DeMille hasn't finished the book yet. Publishers Weekly reports
that Paramount has paid seven figures for the synopsis alone. John

 &HT;    All-in-one browsers offer the Web, chat, e-mail and more
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Welcome to the era of the mega-browser.
</P>
<P>
   You may be thinking: ``What on earth is a megabrowser and why
would I ever want or need one? My trusty Netscape or Internet
Explorer browser works just fine, thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   But megabrowsers from big guns like Microsoft (which rolled out
its MSN Explorer browser earlier this month) and smaller companies
like the Norcross, Ga.-based Ultrabrowser are one of the hottest
Web trends today. The companies are hoping this new breed of
one-stop browser will foster Web loyalty that will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to provide one-stop shopping for busy Web users or
newcomers who don't have time to read up on all the Web has to
offer. These new browsers tuck almost every Internet task into one
neat package: Surfing, searching, instant messaging, shopping, news
and e-mail, audio, video and eventually phone service are all
there. All you have to do is download and go. The idea is to
develop a loyal audience that will keep coming back. That
translates into money because the more users any site or product
has, the more advertisers it attracts and the more money it's
possible to make.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape is also hoping to develop user loyalty with its latest
browser _ Netscape 6. It will incorporate many features of popular
parent company America Online. Among other things, Netscape 6 will
provide continuous and customized news updates automatically
``pushed'' to the user as well as links to AOL's instant messenger
software.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a slightly different tack is super portal Yahoo. Yahoo
has a new product called Yahoo Companion that will customize your
current browser with a Yahoo toolbar that contains the links you
specify. ``Y Companion'' will download a Yahoo toolbar and hook it
right into your current browser. If you are a Yahoo registered
user, you can also import other sites you've bookmarked and have
them turn up on the toolbar.
</P>
<P>
   This new crop of browsers is an attempt to create what is known
as ``stickiness.'' Remember when search engines just searched the
Web? There was a time when Yahoo, Lycos and the other major portals
had one purpose : Helping users find what they were looking for
elsewhere on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Then Web-measurement firm MediaMetrix developed data, later
supported by competing firm Nielsen/NetRatings, that users were
typing in search data, getting the information they wanted and then
leaving the sites so fast they were leaving virtual skid marks. If
you look at any of the major portals, you find a variety of things
to do there from checking the news to downloading music and even
keeping an online appointment calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network online service was first out of the gate
with its superbrowser called the MSN Explorer browser. Although
it's still in the development stages, it can be downloaded at the
MSN Web site (www.msn.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we do this?'' MSN Explorer's group program manager
Hillel Cooperman said to a skeptical group of analysts and
reporters at a demonstration in New York City. ``To get to the next
level this is what it's going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman and his bosses at Microsoft already know that
developing software _ whether it is for the computer or the
Internet _ is what Microsoft is all about. Unlike Atlanta-based
EarthLink or AT&AMP;T's WorldNet, it knows the core business is not
access, it is giving consumers something useful and engaging to do
once they get to a site.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet service providers and anyone else focused on
catching up to AOL in terms of both subscribers and revenue, MSN is
targeting new computer and Web users who know they need to be
online but don't know exactly how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online experience isn't simple,'' Cooperman said. He said
that three out of 12 users can't get online because they literally
cannot navigate the installation process. Research based on the old
MSN network showed that four out of 12 users gave up when trying to
install the software.
</P>
<P>
   MSN developed its new browser with a sharp eye on AOL. With AOL
at 25 million members, even its most bitter rivals are forced to
concede AOL is doing something right. ``AOL has been a pioneer at
integrating services,'' Cooperman said. ``People on AOL take the
Web for granted because AOL has harnessed everything into one
place.''
</P>
<P>
   So why reinvent the wheel? Microsoft has already built a suite
of Web sites and applications including Hotmail, HomeAdvisor,
Carpoint and MSN Money, which are considered to be among the top
Web sites in their respective categories.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cooperman says that the ``a la carte approach'' doesn't
work for everyone. While some users don't mind surfing the Web to
find and bookmark the sites they want, other people _ and many of
the 25 million AOL users would be in this group _ like having
everything prepackaged for them.
</P>
<P>
   MSN Explorer is a browser that users can download and install
for free. It looks like Microsoft's conventional browser, the
Internet Explorer, but it also includes a personal start page users
can customize. From there you have one-stop access to your Hotmail
or MSN e-mail account, local weather and links to all the MSN
properties. Also included in the package is Windows Media, an audio
and video player that lets users listen to music or watch streaming
videos while they work.There's a music icon on the toolbar that
lets users select from hundreds of radio stations all around the
world. Newbies will appreciate how easy it is to use, while
veterans will appreciate not having to hunt around for software or
download information.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the MSN browser is still in development, don't be
afraid to download it. It works well, appears to be bug-free and
doesn't reconfigure any of the settings already on your computer.
It's also attractive and fun to use, even for grizzled vets.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of information and integration of Web
applications makes going online a lot easier for new users and
old-timers alike.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hunting around for software plug-ins or being
overwhelmed with windows, buttons and strange new terms like
``keyword'' or ``IM.'' You can start listening to music or writing
e-mail the minute you log on. You can also register for MSN's
Passport service, which remembers your user name and password so
you don't have to as you travel across MSN sites and others that
use the Passport system.
</P>
<P>
   MSN has also customized the browser to reflect the city you live
in. New York users get a nice shot of the Manhattan skyline, while
Atlanta users get to see their own personal skyline. It's a small
thing but does personalize the Web. Also included in the service is
the MSN messenger, and a phone service is on the way. Users can
purchase Internet access from MSN directly or they can just use MSN
Explorer with any ISP they currently have instead of launching a
conventional browser.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Loizides, a Web technology analyst with Jupiter
Communications, says the MSN Explorer is not AOL, but it's not a
Web browser, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really call it a browser,'' she says. ``It's
inherently different.The browser is in the background. They are
delivering a new kind of user interface and trying to make things
as simple as possible for somebody coming fresh onto the Web who
doesn't want to fuss with a whole lot of windows.''
</P>
<P>
   At the MSN demonstration in New York, the company went to great
pains to show how many windows it might take to get something done
on AOL. No windows burst open with MSN Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Personalization that really makes a browser look like it was
built just for you is also the goal of a Norcross-based firm called
Ultrabrowser.com. Ultrabrowser is hoping Web surfers are tired
looking at the big Netscape ``N'' or the little Microsoft windows
icon twirling around in their browser windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is create an Internet environment,'' says
Yassine Sbiti company founder, interim president and chief
executive. ``We've incorporated a search engine, directories,
access to TV and radio and an area you can customize.''
</P>
<P>
   You can download a plain ``vanilla'' version of Ultrabrowser
right now at its Web site (www.ultrabrowser.com). Ultrabrowser's
goal is to customize its product for companies and organizations
all over the world. For example, a university might have
Ultrabrowser design a browser with the school's logo that it will
distribute free on its home page or via CDs given to students,
alumni and others. The ``skin'' or on-screen appearance will be
tailored for an institution or company and the start page will
always be the company's home page.
</P>
<P>
   Sbiti says the schools, companies and organizations distributing
Ultrabrowser bring a whole new dimension to branding on the Web.
``It's a different thing entirely,'' he says. ``You used to be a
Web site. Now you're a browser.''
</P>
<P>
   What both these new megabrowsers want to do is attract loyal
users and hold them. MSN is hoping its suite of sites and services
will win hearts. Ultrabrowser is hoping the idea of a personalized
look and feel combined with services will entice users. For Yahoo,
an ever-present toolbar will generate more users than the Web site
alone. As for Netscape, just looking a little bit like AOL will go
a long way toward holding on to its users.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's Loizides said loyalty is the name of the game when it
comes to customer retention.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSN is trying to build relationships with the client and the
Internet and they're betting you'll invest all this time in the
site,'' she said. ``They're hoping you won't want to take all the
photos you've uploaded to your personal photo albums and take them
to another site.''
</P>
<P>
   While these sites may build loyalty, it could still be too
little too late if MSN or anybody else wants to catch AOL, she
believes:
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so far ahead, does that mean there's no hope of MSN
or anyone else catching up? This may not be the golden arrow that's
going to get them up to AOL's numbers. But if they can parallel the
types of services AOL has, then they are on an even playing field.
And if you have a great interface and have all the features rolled
up into one place and boom it's right in front of you, that's
something.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Internet's elementary lessons reach from near to far away
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My children attend a school in our community. Our
school launches them on trips far and near. Some of those trips are
off-site field trips by bus. Many are classroom-based journeys to
faraway worlds.
</P>
<P>
   With their current studies, one child takes field trips to
places in our community while the other learns about places like
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This week my oldest child enjoyed a lesson about Kenya when her
librarian shared stories of her real-life travels. Looking at the
librarian's travel treasures was an exciting lesson for the
children.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers cover thousands of miles from their classrooms.
These study units include places I have visited and learned about.
There are other times when my children learn about things that I am
unfamiliar with that I need to learn about. If I want to be a part
of their teaching, I need to share in their studies.
</P>
<P>
   My children show enthusiasm for their learning, owed in great
part to their schools and teachers. They introduce me to lessons
that enrich my knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, I might one day be a solid contender for ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is my quick trip to self-motivated study hall.
Together my kids and I can work on studies and outside interests.
Current plans for one child include a field trip to the Tullie
Smith Farm (www.atlhist.org
</P>
<P>
   /HousesGardens/html/tulliesmith.htm) and lessons about places
and people in our community.
</P>
<P>
   The Tullie Smith Farm description on the Web was useful to me. I
am not a native Atlantan, and before I had school-age children had
never heard of the place. Now, armed with a description from the
Atlanta History Center, I understand where the Tullie Smith Farm is
located and what its purpose is for a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   My other child's study of Africa allows us to search Web sites
for facts about the continent.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Internet research so special for us is that we can do
it together in our small amounts of spare time.
</P>
<P>
   Internet research fits in between Spanish lessons and
dinnertime, Barbies and Britney Spears. The speed of point, click
and read is invaluable to us in our research.
</P>
<P>
   I am a big fan of the public library, and I often check out
books and do research there. Our Internet connection enhances the
efforts of the school, the resources of the library and our
first-hand experience.
</P>
<P>
   Today, my second-grader and I talked about things you can learn
on the Internet. I suggested we look up some maps of Africa. I was
redirected to another topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we learn some Swahili words?'' she asked. ``We are working
on some Swahili words at school. Does the Internet know those words
or some more?''
</P>
<P>
   In a few clicks through one of my favorite sites for kids'
stuff, About.com (www.about.com), we found our way to reach what
she wanted to learn. We searched on the terms ``language'' and
``Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter saw ``jambo,'' a word meaning ``hello'' that she
learned at school. She also learned some new Swahili words. We
printed the list, and she will take it to school.
</P>
<P>
   Countless sites share kid-friendly information. If you care to
learn about animals, check out www.animalsearch
</P>
<P>
   .net. Some children may want to learn about the weather at
weathereye.kgan.com. Many who need general information can turn to
sites like www.edupuppy.com.
</P>
<P>
   The EduPuppy site is an educational resource for kids (and their
families), preschool through second grade. The prescreened database
of links includes great content and resources for teachers and
families.
</P>
<P>
   I feel comfortable using the Internet with my children. They are
too young to use it on their own. Just as I monitor their
television viewing, I help them with Web searching.
</P>
<P>
   The school-related resources go beyond homework help or
extracurricular lesson enhancement. Many schools, including ours,
have Web sites. Some include information about lunch menus, the
PTA, extracurricular activities, special events and more.
</P>
<P>
   The school sites can offer forgetful parents a way to keep up
with school activities even after they lose all the stacks of
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The technology continues to grow with multiplying Web sites,
faster computer speeds and more computers. I encourage my family to
have a growing level of comfort and familiarity with the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   I am thankful for the opportunity to keep up with my children's
lessons. If I want to look like a smart mom, I had better know the
elementary school lessons.

   SHOWING OFF: Thumbs up or thumbs down? VH1 is giving viewers a
chance to go online and decide the fate of five new series. At 8

entire shows and then go to the network's Web site and decide which
programs should stay and which ones should go. The nominees:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``EveryNight'': A hip musical late-night talk and variety show
.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Reunion'': Former bandmates who have parted ways get a

   GRAY MATTERS: Don't be surprised if Grandma asks to borrow your
MP3 player for bingo night. Contrary to perceptions that online
music sharing is confined to the skateboard-and-body-piercing
crowd, there's new evidence that older people also are downloading
their favorite tunes or accessing music from other sites. Media
Metrix reports 6.8 million unique visitors 50 and older went to
music-related sites in June, up 92 percent from 3.55 million a year
earlier. That's more than twice the average growth for such sites
in same period. Also, the older crowd represented 17 percent of the
traffic on music-sharing Web sites in June.
</P>
<P>
   TRUE OR FALSE: A survey of 700 adult Internet users shows their
concerns over privacy and the safety of personal data causes 23

   The survey, conducted by SpectraCom.Inc., also found:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  92 percent said they sometimes refuse to provide personal

refuse.

<P>
   &QR;  About eight out of 10 are somewhat or very comfortable
providing their e-mail addresses, education, marital status, ethnic
origin and hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Only 7 percent are comfortable providing a Social Security

   &QR;  16 percent are OK with providing a bank account number.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About 40 percent say they're somewhat or very comfortable

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I want to buy an Internet appliance to use at home for e-mail
and the Internet, but I've had trouble finding one even to look at.
An article I read highly recommended the iPAQ, which is made by
Compaq. Their Web site listed nearby stores that supposedly carry
it, but when I called no one had it and some didn't know what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynne Pickens, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The iPAQ Home Internet Appliance or MSN Home Companion, if
you're talking Microsoft (www.microsoft.com), is what some of us
might call a ``dumb terminal.'' Meaning, you get your data from a
server. Not much lives on the unit itself, but it has all you need
if you're mainly into the Web and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's Compaq's (www6.compaq.com/) answer to the Netpliance
i-opener, and people are raving about it. Keep it in your kitchen,
or plop it by your TV. Pop up the screen, plug it in and type away
at your wireless keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It has dial-up Internet service, e-mail, instant messaging
and other MSN services. It handles attachments, plays MP3 audio
files and displays video using Windows Media.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You're right when you say it's hard to find. We called
several Compaq retailers in the Atlanta area. Most don't carry it
and have no idea what it is. Or, if they have it, it's gone. Compaq
says that is because it's so popular and so durn new.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sorry, we don't have an iPAQ IA tucked up our sleeve. Many
local retailers told us to call back on a Saturday, which is when
their new stock arrives. You may want to try that.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Meanwhile, let's check in on Netpliance's i-opener
(www.netpliance.com), the early mover in the Internet appliance
game. The i-opener 2001, billed as the new-generation IA, will
sport an enhancement or two when it ships in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It'll have multiple e-mail accounts this go-around. Up to
four. Netpliance also glommed onto software called Jabber and built
an instant-messaging system they tout. It has the ability to
``jabber'' _ or communicate _ with other instant-messaging systems,
such as AOL's.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The tiny plug-and-play dealie has taken jabs for its price
fluctuations, though. A promotional offer of $99 for a membership
package a few months ago soared to $399, then dipped to $299.
There's a $21.95 monthly Internet service fee. But remember, you
gotta go with their ISP.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you recall, the first-generation i-opener disappeared
after it fell prey to hackers. Some folks figured out how to crack
open the Internet surfing machine with its wee chip and turn it
into a full-fledged, heckuva-deal computer by adding a hard drive.
</P>

   TWO NETWORKING CONCERNS MERGE: Predictive Systems, a leading
networking consulting firm, plans to announce Tuesday that it is
acquiring one of its small private competitors, Synet Service.
Predictive, based in New York, will pay $9 million in cash and 2.2
million of its own shares for Synet. Predictive's shares closed
Monday at $15.12, down $1.88, giving the deal a value of about $42
million. ``What was attractive about Synet was that in addition to
having very strong technical people who are up on the latest
technology, they, like we, had a very business-oriented approach,''
Robert L. Belau, Predictive's president, said in an interview
Monday.

   PRO-MICROSOFT REPORT: As the Microsoft antitrust case looms
before the Supreme Court, the public relations war is accelerating.
Monday, the pro-Microsoft Association for Competitive Technology
released a study by a University of Texas economist that asserts
that the government's proposed anti-trust remedy of splitting
Microsoft into two companies will cost consumers worldwide $125
billion to $310 billion in higher software costs over three years.
The study, written by Stan J. Liebowitz, suggests that after a
split of Microsoft, the resulting two new competitors will ``depart
from Microsoft's traditionally low-pricing practices.''

   ETHERNET SERVICE EXPANDING: Continuing the expansion of
Ethernet, the local area networking technology, from offices into
large communications networks, Level 3 Communications, the big
telecommunications upstart, plans to announce Tuesday that it is
offering high-speed Internet service over Ethernet. Long thought
robust enough only for office networks, Ethernet this year has
emerged as a way to provide high-speed data links outside of
buildings at costs far below those of traditional communications
systems and with little, if any, loss of reliability.

   POINT, CLICK, WIN (MAYBE): In another experiment by advertisers
using new technology to deliver sales pitches, AT&AMP;T and Ericsson
are co-sponsoring an interactive wireless promotion tied to the ABC
quiz show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' AT&AMP;T and Ericsson will
mail out 100,000 electronic devices shaped like Ericsson cellular
phones to consumers, who will be asked to watch the show in late
October for special encoded commercials. The devices can read light
patterns when pointed at a TV screen, which will tell viewers
whether they have won prizes.

   TAKE-BOS  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 UNDATED: ... action: ``Dinosaurs.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No doubt, the tension must give at some point. ``It's an issue
that has to be dealt with,'' says Walter McDonough, a Boston
entertainment lawyer and director of business and legal research
for an advocacy group called the Future of Music Coalition. ``We
are obligated to work this out without impeding the growth of the
Web,'' McDonough says.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you make that happen when the content owners and the
technology companies are duking it out in court? McDonough suggests
there is a ``common sense solution'' similar to the compulsory
license system used by radio stations. Under this proposal,
Internet music companies would need compulsory licenses to stream
music online and the funds generated would go into a pool to be
redistributed to the record labels and music publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Some academics have pointed toward a more radical solution,
suggesting a tax and royalty system in which money is collected
through a tax on either the electronics needed to play digital
content or on Internet services needed to access such
entertainment. The money would be distributed to creators in
proportion to how frequently their materials are used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is conceivable that something as radical as that would be
necessary,'' says Fisher of Harvard. ``The effect of a dramatic
intervention of that sort would be to provide an alternative
revenue to creators.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have suggested that the music business will morph into a
service industry, with consumers paying for all-you-can-play
subscriptions in the same way they pay for cable television.
Meanwhile, the film industry has been talking about offering its
products online on a pay-per-view basis, but only when it finds a
way to protect the work from piracy. Technical experts contend,
however, that any protection system, no matter how sophisticated,
can eventually be cracked. ``It is important to recognize that
security isn't going to work,'' warns Sheirer of Forrester
Research.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the primary battlefield is in the courts. The
Napster appeal will be heard in court in the next few weeks, and
the Scour lawsuit has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle lines are beginning to blur as entertainment
companies merge with technology companies. If the AOL-Time-Warner
merger is completed, the nation's largest content provider will be
under the same umbrella as the country's largest Internet service
provider. Likewise, Sony finds itself in a strange position in the
Napster case: Its record division is a plaintiff in the case, but
as a member of the Consumer Electronics Association, its
electronics business effectively signed onto an amicus brief filed
in defense of Napster.
</P>
<P>
   These are strange times, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. The struggle for control over content gets
more intriguing every day. Back in March, Napster inventor Shawn
Fanning said he wrote the file-sharing software because he was
suffering from ennui during his short-lived tenure as a
Northeastern University student. ``I was bored,'' he said in a
Globe interview. ``I had some time.'' Today, the controversy is
anything but ho-hum.

and are third-worst overall, allowing 379.3 total yards per game.
They are giving up 34 points a game, second-most in the NFL.

his 2,000-yard rushing season.
</P>
<P>

regular-season games in the team's first 40 seasons, and one of
those was Hall of Famer Jim Brown in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   _ QB Troy Aikman returned as the Dallas starter after missing
two games because of his ninth concussion. He was 14-of-25 passing
for 197 yards with a touchdown, an interception and a fumble.

WHAT'S THE NEXT NEW THING ON YOUR INTERNET DASHBOARD? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL TORCHIA AND MATT CARROLL   c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past five years, the creative breeding ground of the
Internet has changed our lives with a dizzyingly long list of
innovations: browsing, e-mail, online auctions, day trading,
instant messaging, Napster. While not all consumers have used
everything, most have become dependent on at least one.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been an altogether smooth ride. People have thrown up
their hands in frustration after wandering in the Internet
wilderness searching for, say, the cheapest airline ticket. Or they
have cringed at the idea of handing over personal information to
anonymous online vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the problems that have spawned the next big thing on
the Net, one that is expected to give more power to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon: software applications that will search the Net for
you, comparison shopping for a used car, and taking into account
your desire for something with CD player and six cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   Another application will search out blue-chip stocks with solid
earnings that will appeal to your conservative financial views. And
a third will alert the local oil dealer with the best price around
that you are low on heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   These separate applications _ and others that collect specific
information on everything from stamp collecting to medical records
_ will be viewed through one overarching, personal ``dashboard''
that will display all the information that has been collected.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard program will also jealously protect a consumer's
personal and financial privacy by releasing just the data needed to
make a purchase, and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   These changes will flip the traditional business model on its
head. Until now, companies have told consumers what was available
and at what price. Now a customer's software will tell a company
what the consumer wants and what price the person is willing to
pay. Interested companies will need to scramble to fulfill that
need.
</P>
<P>
   Leverage will shift to a new type of proactive consumer _ a
``prosumer,'' perhaps? This consumer _ no longer locked into any
one particular company _ will be empowered to pick and choose based
on criteria they establish, and it will be up to companies to meet
it.
</P>
<P>
   Bits and pieces of this are available now and more are coming.
ByAllAccounts.com of Woburn, Mass., which was launched in July,
offers consumers a single place to monitor and analyze financial
data. The idea is to help individuals, who might have portfolios
with a half-dozen or more financial companies, pull that
information together, said L. Patrick Gardner, co-founder and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Users set up online accounts with the company, which collects
the information from the companies where the user keeps accounts.
The software offers tools to measure investment performance and can
send alerts when there are important changes.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like this allow consumers to gain more control. With
information centralized, consumers can more easily measure their
own financial health, as well as more easily measure the
performance of the financial institutions that are caring for
users' investments. Gardner sees this as just a start, and ``the
next step is to offer guidance or advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Another startup, VigilTech.com in Acton, Mass., has built
software that searches the Internet to provide desktop information
on specific topics to business users, said Gidi Cohen, founder and
chief executive officer. Users can create their own custom
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our technology takes input from the user and then adapts as it
scours the Internet, to provide information to the desktop on what
you need and want, when you need and want it,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have developed software that makes it easy for
buyers to comparison shop. Frictionless Commerce of Cambridge,
Mass. sells its software to sites such as Lycos.com, which uses it
in its comparison shopping section, said Robert H. Guttman,
co-founder and chief technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   The software can be used to find the best prices on everything
from car seats to laptops; from printers to in-line skates. ``We
have pieces of software that crawl the Web and find pieces of
information,'' Guttman said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is just the beginning. These companies, or new
companies, will push this concept into new directions. The end
result will be greater ease for users in finding what they need.
</P>
<P>
   Changes are also being driven by concerns about protecting
personal privacy. People have read about online thefts of credit
card numbers and the recent bankruptcy fight over Toysmart.com, in
which supposedly protected personal data about customers may be
tossed on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   Pattie Maes, an associate professor at MIT's Media Lab, is
acutely aware of the concerns people have over protecting their
personal data. Maes founded Firefly Network Inc., which was one of
the first companies to commercialize technology for building
profiles of its users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it has to be the user that has control,'' she
said. While obstacles remain from legal to cultural, the time is
right for consumers to grab much greater control of their own data,
she said. ``It is a real need right now.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that personal profile data is sold to other
companies without your knowing it. There is no reason, she says,
that users should not be able to use their own data to negotiate
better deals.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, some of the new software fulfills old business
ideas called ``sense and respond.'' It's not an original online
idea. It is, for example, what oil companies have done for years by
counting degree days and thus knowing when to fill a customers'
tank before it is empty.
</P>
<P>
   But online companies can carry the idea a step further. What if
consumers didn't lock into one particular oil company? What if they
bought from whichever dealer happened to have the lowest price? And
what if this all happened automatically?
</P>
<P>
   That's the promise of the new era in software. Soon it will
suggest we transfer money to a new bank with higher interest rates
on CDs, look through our doctor's computer to get the results of
the latest lab test, get test scores from school, and maybe catch a
note from the baseball coach about how Junior needs to work on
ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   We're not quite there yet. But it's where smart consumer
companies are headed. They know that we, the consumers, want _ make
that, deserve _ the ultimate in customer experience. Smart
companies will work hard to find out exactly what consumers want,
educate them about their product or service, and then provide it
when asked. It's the next big thing.

CELL PHONE CHIP TRANSFORMING DAILY LIVES AROUND GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY   c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask the average person to name a computer chip, and he would
probably choose Intel Corp.'s Pentium III or the Athlon from
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. He probably wouldn't single out the
processor chip inside the typical cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   But that cell phone chip, and millions like it, are transforming
the daily lives of people throughout the world in ways no Pentium
or Athlon can match.
</P>
<P>
   The chip technology that drives a cellphone also drives the
newest digital cameras. Similar chips power the MP3 music players
that are rewriting the recording industry's business models. You'll
find them managing billions of bits of data flowing over the
nation's phone lines every second. They're even used to sort
chocolates in candy factories. Indeed, these remarkable chips are
starting to appear in almost every device that links human beings
to the digital universe.
</P>
<P>
   The chips are called digital signal processors, or DSPs, and
they may be the most important pieces of silicon in the world right
now. DSPs are specialized computers that can digitally reshape the
events of the real world, such as sounds and images. And since
nearly everybody in the real world uses electronic gadgets, it's no
surprise that engineers are cramming them full of these superchips.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmakers sold $4.4 billion worth of DSPs last year, according
to Tempe, Ariz.-based Forward Concepts, a semiconductor research
consulting firm based in Tempe, Ariz. Sales are expected to top $6
billion this year and grow to $19 billion in 2004. ``It is the
technology driver of the semiconductor industry,'' said Forward
Concepts analyst Will Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   The DSP boom has echoed through the corridors of Analog Devices
Inc. in Norwood. Already the fourth largest maker of DSP chips, the
company saw its DSP sales leap 143 percent for the quarter ended
July 29. Analog posted quarterly revenues of $700.7 million, up 85
percent. Profits for the quarter, at $192 million, were more than
three times higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   And Analog is one of the smaller players in the industry. By
far, the leading maker of DSP chips is Texas Instruments Inc., with
about half the market in 1999. Next comes Lucent Technologies Inc.,
with about a quarter of the business. Analog is neck and neck with
Motorola Inc., at about 10 percent market share each. Analog
designs its chips in Massachusetts but farms out manufacturing to
chip foundries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar Pentium and many other chips are ``general-purpose
microprocessors.'' These are the Clydesdales of computing,
workhorse chips used for a vast variety of tasks, many of them
having little to do with mathematical calculation. For instance,
the processor in a desktop PC spends much of its time just moving
data between itself, the main memory bank, and the hard drive. A
lot of the chip's transistors are devoted to this kind of
housekeeping duty.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a DSP is like a thoroughbred groomed for the
Kentucky Derby. This sliver of silicon is optimized to perform
extremely complex math equations. Equally important, it's designed
to do this math in real time, engineer-speak for instantly, as
events happen. That makes DSPs ideal for manipulating information
when processing delays are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds and images start out as analog data. They come in waves,
not in digital packets. This data is first converted to digital
form by a chip that samples the analog waves millions of times each
second. The result is a digital simulation of the wave that can
then be processed by a digital computer.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the speed of a DSP becomes critical. Analog events
_ for example, somebody talking into a cellphone _ happen in real
time. Each tiny digital data sample has to be processed in
millionths of a second to avoid any gaps or delays in the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world of signal processing, you have to be able to
process real time,'' said Robert Conrad, vice president of Analog
Devices' DSP division. ``When you take a sample, you have to
process it completely before the next sample comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to its speed, the DSP can perform some magical
transformations. Say you're using the cell phone in a noisy room.
Little of that noise will reach the person on the other end. That's
because the DSP uses complex math algorithms that can tell the
difference between background noise and the user's voice. The chip
instantly deletes most of the noise, so that the voice comes
through clearly.
</P>
<P>
   DSPs are so good at cleaning up line noise that callers might
hear dead silence at each pause in the conversation. That could
make them hang up, thinking the connection has been broken. So some
DSP chips used in phones are programmed to insert a little extra
background hiss, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   The DSP can do all this while using just a fraction of the
electrical power that a Pentium needs. And then there's the price.
High-end Pentium IIIs sell for hundreds of dollars apiece. The DSP
chip in your phone runs about five bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that your phone's chip was made by Texas
Instruments, which makes 70 percent of all DSPs found in wireless
phones. The company is also determined to win in other DSP markets.
It spends millions at universities around the world to train future
engineers and programmers in the use of DSP chips. And Texas
Instruments has assembled teams of engineers, each targeting an
up-and-coming DSP market, such as digital music players, digital
cameras, and Internet telephone products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of those teams are on a mission from God to become
the next wireless,'' said Greg Delagi, Texas Instruments' DSP vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Analog Devices isn't sitting still either. The company worked
closely with Aware Inc. of Bedford to develop the DSL systems used
in thousands of homes to provide high-speed Internet access over
standard phone lines. DSP chips are at the heart of DSL systems,
and Analog is the market leader in this segment. The company is
also a major producer of DSP chips for cable modems, another
popular broadband technology.
</P>
<P>
   DSPs are starting to appear in home appliances, to precisely
regulate the energy consumption of a refrigerator or washing
machine. Analog Devices DSPs are appearing in air conditioners,
constantly measuring room temperature and making tiny adjustments
in fan and compressor speeds. The result is optimum cooling
performance, using a minimum of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Inc. uses DSPs in its optional OnStar automobile
tracking system; the chips use signals from the global network of
GPS navigation satellites to provide a precise location for the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McGuire, product line director for Analog Devices, says
DSPs will become even more popular with automakers in the years
ahead. He sees them replacing less-advanced microprocessors in
controlling automobile fuel systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government ever says to the automakers, you've got to
get your fuel average up to 40 miles a gallon, they'll be coming to
us for DSPs,'' McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is even used to make blind machines see. Cognex
Corp. of Natick, Mass. puts DSPs in its In-Sight machine vision
products, used by manufacturers to automate industrial processes.
The DSP uses its processing power to analyze a video input,
recognize patterns, and control a robot. One such machine was
designed by Cognex for a candy maker, to enable its robotic
packaging machine to pick individual chocolates from a production
line.
</P>
<P>
   As computing and data networking capacity is blended into more
and more of the world's machines, the number of potential uses for
DSP just keeps growing, along with the financial prospects of
Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, and the other DSP makers. Said
Will Strauss of Forward Concepts: ``DSP is everywhere.''

WEB SLOW TO RESHAPE POLITICAL REPORTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  c.2000 The Boston Globe 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Web hasn't changed political news coverage much _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's the view among political professionals, Web specialists,
and political reporters who have watched the rise of the new medium
with varying degrees of enthusiasm and concern.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some are disappointed. For years, the Web has been seen
as a technology that could reinvigorate democracy, by creating
direct communication channels among the governed and by opening
dialogue with public officials. To date, it has blurred the lines
between news organizations and political Web sites, as both compete
to offer information to voters and to fact-check the claims of
opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, a host of start-up companies calling themselves
``democracy portals'' want to serve the same market. At
Grassroots.com, for instance, users can read about Senator Joseph
I. Lieberman's predictions on voter turnout or read comments on
George W. Bush's environmental voting record from a Gainesville,
Fla., nurse using the screen name ``RationalMind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately sites like these promise to ``make national politics
truly national,'' according to Governor Jim Gilmore of Virginia.
Gilmore, a Republican, has emerged as one of the Web's biggest
boosters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC;  But even Gilmore says he can't name an example in which an
online news item or coverage on the the Web has altered the
dynamics of his campaigning and governing. The most persistent
questions still come from reporters from traditional news
organizations, and their output remains the most widely read source
of information for most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just beginning the process of the application of the
Internet to the political process,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, reporters from traditional news organization,
like the Dallas Morning News, whose questions have created the most
difficulties for Bush. In contrast, the most talked-about Web
journalism this year was probably a piece by Dan Savage, a writer
for Salon.com. In his piece, ``Stalking Gary Bauer,'' Savage
described licking office doorknobs in an effort to spread a cold
and derail the conservative candidate's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Early expectations for the Web were probably too lofty. One
basic problem is that slow connections for most viewers limit the
Web's ability to offer compelling video. ``The concepts are true,
that the Web will change things,'' said Dana Milbank, who writes
about politics for The Washington Post. ``But the promise hasn't
been realized. It will have a profound effect on politics, but not
in this cycle. Probably in the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Perhaps the most significant impact of the Web has been to
bring print media into a constant-news mindset, a change
cable-television news had already forced on the networks. Now
newspapers and magazines are also pressing their reporters to write
quick, short versions of their stories for the Web during the day,
much as newspapers used to update themselves with afternoon
editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of a news cycle is almost passe,'' said Jeff
Zeleny, who covered the Iowa caucuses for the Des Moines Register
and now writes for the Chicago Tribune. ``I found myself filing
Internet updates and posting stuff from the trail all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention to the Web's impact on politics began in earnest
during the 1996 election cycle, the first time both major
presidential candidates invited users to visit their campaign
operations online. Since then, operatives have proved the Web can
be used as an effective campaign tool in specific instances.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the impeachment proceedings against President
Clinton, for instance, even Republicans acknowledged the
Democratic-leaning site, MoveOn.org, which drew 500,000 signatures
and pledges of $13 million to urge Congress to move on to weightier
topics. During his campaign for president, Senator John McCain
often mentioned his Web site; in the two days after his victory in
the New Hampshire primary, he raised $1 million with the help of
his Web site, according to PoliticsNow.com.

<P>
   WESTBOROUGH, Mass. _ When Informix announced in August that it
would move its headquarters here from posh Menlo Park, Calif., the
bicoastal headlines could not have been more different.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, readers of the San Jose Mercury News were
told, ``Informix Bows Out of Silicon Valley.'' In the East, the
Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette's headline celebrated the
cross-country move and the creation of ``About 100 Jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Informix a defeated company, exiting with its tail between
its legs? Or is it a corporate hero, creating jobs in this edge
town outside the Interstate 495 arc?
</P>
<P>
   In the longstanding rivalry between the Bay State and the Bay
Area for the gold medal in cutting-edge technology, the title still
belongs to Silicon Valley. But what may be most significant about
Informix's decision to move its headquarters east is what it says
about the shifting relationship between east and west.
</P>
<P>
   There have been others. In recent months, PlanetRX.com, InsWeb
Corp., Performance Polymer Technologies, and Galil Motion Control
have decamped from Silicon Valley altogether. Travelocity,
Pets.com, and Egghead.com have joined Informix in moving some
company divisions out of the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Informix executives say that being in Westborough amounts to a
25 percent reduction in rent, based on the terms of their lease. If
they were to pay today's market rates, the differential would be
even greater, over 60 percent, said Tony Riggio, the company's
director of public relations.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Silicon Valley's cachet continues to attract as many
technology companies as it loses. And Informix isn't technically
leaving California. Though its corporate headquarters will be in
Westborough, the majority of its workers will remain on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really just moving two exits down the road,'' said Peter
Fiore, president of Informix's services and consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   Informix, which is battling flat revenues and disappointing
earnings, is effectively splitting the company in two. One company
_ Informix Software, headed by James D. Foy _ will be based in Palo
Alto. The other, a yet-to-be-named e-business consulting and
services firm headed by Fiore, will be based in Westborough.
</P>
<P>
   Which coast is getting the better half of Informix?
</P>
<P>
   Some would say it's Silicon Valley, which is getting the part of
the company that generates $800 million in annual sales, or 85
percent of the comany's total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Others would argue it's Massachusetts. While the Westborough
subsidiary is forecast to have just over $120 million in sales this
year, it is expected to grow 80 percent to 100 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay State will also be home to the parent company, Informix
Corp., which ended up in Massachusetts when it acquired
fast-growing Ardent Software in March for $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new chief executive, Peter Gyenes, was president
of Ardent, and half of Informix's senior management team also came
from the Westborough-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Ardent was the company being acquired, their key
managers turned out to be very sharp and capable,'' said Hurwitz.
As a result, the locus of leadership shifted towards Massachusetts,
she said. ``The talent for the more dynamic part of their business
turned out to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Silicon Valley, ground zero for all things
futuristic, is ending up with the slow-growing technology business,
while Massachusetts, once known for its dying minicomputer
industry, is ending up with the cutting-edge firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that both coasts win in this,'' said Fiore,
downplaying the competition. ``They each get a company.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But what's different is that Massachusetts is
clearly back in the race.
</P>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's no doubt about the highlight of tonight's
telecast: Marion Jones' attempt to win her second gold medal of the
Games. Adding to the intrigue is the challenge offered by
Australia's national heroine Cathy Freeman. The rest of the
prime-time lineup pales in marquee value to this showdown, but the
men's 200 meters, long jump and decathlon are more than bit
players. Americans Coby MIller, Floyd Heard and John Capel Jr. all
reached the semifinals and have a chance to contend for a medal in
the 200. Georgia Tech assistant coach Chris Huffins ranks among the
leaders going into the conclusion of the decathlon, while Tucker
High graduate Dwight Phillips is the lone U.S. hope in the long
jump The late-night telecast will feature Georgian Shareef
Adbur-Rahim and his NBA mates facing Russia in a quarterfinal
basketball game, and MSNBC (TV 33) has the gold-medal match in
women's soccer between the U.S. and Norway. The last look at tennis
stars Venus and Serena Williams in action will be on CNBC, which
has their doubles gold-medal match against the Netherlands' Kristie
Boogert and Miriam Oremans.

EMC: MAKING THE VENTURE CAPITAL COMMITMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  c.2000 The Boston Globe 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They call their venture group, conspicuously, EMC.
</P>
<P>
   But they're quick to point out that their group is not an arm of
the computer storage giant in Hopkinton, Mass. Rather, EMC is short
for Egan Managed Capital, a pool of family money that's invested in
early-stage start-ups for EMC founder Richard Egan.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Egans nor the partners in the fund mind the
confusion over the name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Dick's idea. The name helps,'' said Mike Shanahan, one
of six partners at the $110 million downtown venture group, which
was started by Jack Egan, son of Richard and former EMC Corp. sales
guru.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in February 1997, Egan Managed Capital has
done about 20 deals and claims to have reaped triple-digit returns
each year. Winners include Network Engines, a $3 million investment
that turned out to be worth more than $100 million, and Epicon, a
$1 million investment on which Egan made about 13 times its money.
Egan also invested in Caldera Systems, a Linux company, and Top
Layer Networks, a switch maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has turned out to be even better than we expected,''
Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Egans are happy enough to have renewed their venture capital
commitment. They recently launched a second fund, of $66.7 million,
following the first $43 million fund. Four investments have already
been made from the new pot. Shanahan said it took only an
hour-and-a-half meeting with Jack Egan to get the nod on the new
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this isn't big money for the Egans. In its latest
survey, Boston magazine ranked the senior Egan as the 17th-richest
man in the Commonwealth, with a fortune worth $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Shanahan contends this is more than a rich man's angel
hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very deliberate effort to create an institution with
their brand on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also outside the realm of corporate venture capital, the
hot fad of the moment, in which big companies, including EMC
itself, make side investments in start-ups. Companies from
Microsoft and Intel to Fidelity Investments have large venture
capital businesses. And many other companies have dabbled in what
turned out to be riskier business than they had planned.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Corp. does make its own corporate venture investments, and
there is no distinct cooperation between Egan and the company.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Barry, senior editor of the Corporate Venture Capital
Report, says that could cause controversy. For example, Dell
Computer's venture arm gets a shot at investing in companies that
Michael Dell's venture group, MSD, backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If shareholders of Dell were to find out that Michael Dell
invested in a company, and (Dell) itself didn't get a chance to
look at those deals, investors might be upset,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   That's if the investment turned out to be a good one, of course.
Investors would surely bark, too, if the company followed the
founder's personal investments and lost money.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the Egan funds is information technology and
business-to-business players. The goal, Shanahan says, is to make
investments of $2 million to $4 million in 12 to 15 companies over
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   These are good times in venture capital, Shanahan says. As the
years go on, it will be tougher to impress the Egans, holders of
one of the best stocks of the past decade, with a rise of more than
75,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I check EMC's stock price every time we're on the phone, to
know how Jack's feeling,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  This will doubtless go down as the year in which venture
capital made a mint for Harvard University's massive endowment
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The private equity portion of the $19.2 billion endowment
provided a 155 percent return for the 12 months ended June 30, said
Harvard Management Co. The overall return was 32.2 percent, thanks
largely to help from the venture returns. The total fund's return
marked the send-best showing since 1974, when Harvard Management
was started. In 1983, the return was 43.6 percent.

WHO STOLE MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY?

 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN   c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the beginning of the summer, a copy of an unreleased single
from Madonna's upcoming album ``Music'' found its way onto Napster,
the popular file-swapping service. Needless to say, the Material
Girl was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   And she was not alone. As the summer wore on, illicit copies of
other forms of entertainment appeared all over the Internet.
Bootleg versions of such movie blockbusters as ``Gladiator'' and
``Me, Myself, and Irene'' popped up on networks like Scour Exchange
and Gnutella shortly after their release in theaters. And the
hottest book of the season, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire,'' was traded illegally online within hours after it hit the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, file sharing isn't just for music anymore. Virtually
anything that can be reduced to digital bits is becoming a
commodity, and the entertainment and publishing industries are
grappling with ways to protect copyrighted material at a time when
the very notion of intellectual property is being challenged. Even
the needlepoint industry is running scared: Ladies who stitch
samplers are trading patterns online, and one pattern publisher,
South Carolina-based Pegasus Originals, has reported a 40 percent
drop in revenue since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tension is building between the old economy copyright owners _
the record labels, movie studios, and publishing houses _ and the
new economy entrepreneurs who are constantly inventing new ways to
distribute content. Meanwhile, consumers are rapidly embracing the
new technology even as the entertainment industry is frantically
trying to curtail its spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a turf war going on over the hearts and minds of
consumers and the way they use content,'' says Eric Sheirer, media
and entertainment analyst for Forrester Research. ``The content
industry and the technology industry are battling it out, and they
really can't both win. Their interests are not aligned.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the content industry appears to be winning _ at least in
the courts. Two weeks ago, a federal judge ruled that MP3.com
violated the copyrights of Universal Music Group by offering its
CDs for play over the Internet and ordered potentially crippling
damages that could hit $250 million. Last month, the Motion Picture
Industry Association of America scored a victory when a federal
judge ruled that it is illegal to publish DeCSS, a program used to
crack antipiracy features on DVDs. And in July, a federal judge in
San Francisco issued an injunction to shut down the wildly popular
Napster service; the order is on hold pending appeal, and the case
returns to the courts next month.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the court rulings, the concept of file-sharing is
becoming ingrained in the public consciousness. Users, particularly
college students and young professionals, are growing accustomed to
easy access to music sampling services, and litigation only seems
to increase Napster's hold on the popular imagination. For
instance, traffic to Napster.com surged the week after the court
ruling, according to Media Metrix, the New York-based market
research firm that measures Internet usage. And in July, Napster
hit Media Metrix's list of the top 50 US digital media and Web
properties; the service currently claims to have more than 20
million users.
</P>
<P>
   So can tens of millions of people be wrong? ``You can't impose a
law that is not morally upheld by the vast majority of people,''
says Internet activist John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the
Electronic Freedom Foundation. ``And you can't impose a standard
that can be broken _ and just about all of them can.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just an economic battle between those who hold that
information should be free and those who claim they ought to be
paid for content. There are enormous cultural implications to the
debate as well. There is nothing new about file sharing; early
adopters have been sharing digital photographs (albeit, mostly
pornography) and text files since the early days of bulletin board
services. But now that file sharing has become mainstream, the
technology creates enormous potential for previously unheard voices
to reach the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Unsigned record artists, independent filmmakers, and unknown
novelists are all using the Internet to get their products seen and
heard by the public, creating new niche markets and forging offbeat
cultural communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are huge cultural advantages to allowing or facilitating
Internet distribution of these materials,'' says Harvard Law School
professor William Fisher. ``It expands the set of authors who can
reach the media and reduces the grip on popular culture by a small
number of dominant American companies. It would be a tragedy if the
opportunity for the communication of these materials were lost
because of excessive protectionism.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, artists must have some incentive to
create their work in the first place. ``Unless we can come up with
alternative arrangements for compensating creators, those
incentives will be eroded, and we'll be throwing out the baby with
the bath water,'' Fisher adds. ``And that is an equal tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the dilemma. How do you encourage the cultural
diversification made possible by the Internet while also ensuring
that artists get paid for their work? Some in the entertainment
industry insist that the immediate solution lies in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make it very clear that stealing is wrong, and
we will not hesitate to go to the courts,'' says Jack Valenti,
president of the Motion Picture Association, which is suing
Scour.com, the company that runs a popular multimedia search engine
and file-swapping service.
</P>
<P>
   But most legal scholars _ and a growing number of executives in
the entertainment industry _ contend that the lawsuits are a waste
of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding the large verdict against MP3.com, lawsuits
aren't a very good way to make money,'' says Mark Lemley, a
professor of intellectual property law at the University of
California at Berkeley law school. ``If we are going to get a
solution, it is going to come from the content industry being
willing to make the leap into online distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the content companies have claimed all along that
they plan to come out with systems that enable consumers to
purchase and hear music online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see litigation as the be-all and the end-all,'' says
Hilary Rosen, president and CEO of the Recording Industry
Association of America, the umbrella group representing the music
industry in the cases against Napster, MP3.com, and Scour. ``I see
it as an important tool in sending a message to venture capitalists
that the way to support innovation is to respect the creative
interests. But I am also very clear that the music business has to
evolve, and it is in everybody's interest to create a legitimate
online music business.''
</P>
<P>
   But the music industry, in particular, tends to move with the
speed of an oil tanker negotiating a narrow inlet. And so far, its
online efforts have been less than spectacular. EMI, Sony, and
Universal Music Group recently entered the digital download
business, offering a limited number of albums for sale online. But
consumers used to the ease of Napster haven't exactly raced to
check out these offerings, and the few consumers who have tried to
buy digital music from the major labels have experienced technical
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that there have been growing pains, and
some initial starts have been awkward,'' concedes Rosen. ``Everyone
is doing the best they can, and there is a will and a path and a
huge amount of investment going into doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the technical problems, the music industry has
suffered a backlash since it took on Napster and other file-sharing
services. After the heavy metal band Metallica sued Napster, its
own fans ridiculed the band and its leader, drummer Lars Ulrich,
posting parodies of the band online and vowing to boycott their
albums.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the book industry wants to learn from the music
industry's mistakes and avoid a public relations embarrassment. As
a group, the book publishers haven't been as aggressive in taking
their case to the courts, for a number of reasons. The book
audience is older than the popular music audience, and piracy is
not as prevalent _ yet. Likewise, electronic reading devices are
still a novelty embraced primarily by early adopters.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the book industry is sitting back idly.
``We are watching the litigation very closely,'' says Allan Adler,
vice president of legal and government affairs for the Association
of American Publishers. Last month, the association launched an
anti-piracy Web site and announced a strategy to promote legal,
protected books for sale online.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one author, science fiction writer Harlan Ellison,
says the industry isn't doing enough to ward off piracy. His books
and stories are routinely traded online, and he has sued individual
Web site operators as well as Internet service providers, including
America Online, that he claims facilitate piracy. He won a case
against an individual pirate, but he has been unsuccessful so far
battling the big ISPs in the courts. Ellison sees a sense of
urgency in dealing with the problem and has one word to describe
publishers who have yet to take legal action: ``Dinosaurs.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Send.com mastered the dot-com business formula last year: Throw
thousands of products onto a Web site, spend millions of dollars on
prime-time television commercials, and then pray.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a change typical of the survivors of this year's dot-com
bloodbath, the company is acting more like a real merchant _
cautious about spending, savvier about consumer behavior, and
nervous as hell about the holiday selling season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what you saw in the last few years of e-tailing was
driven by a technology perspective rather than a consumer
perspective,'' said Michael Lannon, chief executive of Send.com, a
Waltham, Mass. online seller of gifts. ``You can't be a technology
company that sells stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, Lannon's holiday preparations would have
appalled any traditional merchant. That's when Lannon began ramping
up for the Christmas bonanza in the fall. He has since learned that
planning for the following season should start, well, right after
Christmas. And like a true retail executive, he now starts
panicking in September rather than December.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Labor Day ended, it was like, `Summer's over. My life is
over,' '' Lannon said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lannon and other Send.com executives got an early
start on mapping their holiday strategies. They decided to slash
advertising spending, revamp their Web site, and offer a smarter
selection of gifts. Hiring for the company's customer call center
began in September, a few weeks earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Send.com, a closely held company known for its advertisements
featuring ``The Giver,'' is actually the third version of a company
that Lannon started three years ago. Initially, he started selling
bottles of wine by phone, using merchants across the nation to
package and deliver the orders.
</P>
<P>
   But Lannon's first Web site, Sendwine.com, won over customers.
In October 1999, the company became Send.com, reflecting its much
larger offering: cigars and champagne as well as gift certificates
for fine dining, spas, and exotic car rentals.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company's annual sales are growing 10-fold, and the
business has an enviable return rate of less than 1 percent.
Hundreds of merchants have signed on as partners, with 90 percent
expected to be using Send.com's MerchantLink order-management
software by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making the Web practical for the merchants,'' said Mary
Obana, the company's marketing director. ``Most of them don't have
the expertise or a Web site. We provide them with a simple solution
to allow them to go on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing smaller retailers onto the Web initially took more
hand-holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a bit scared,'' said Steve Marchlik, who manages
MerchantLink for Send.com. ``They picked up a mouse . . . and were
like, `What is it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the merchants have become more sophisticated. Today, even
retailers with Web sites has signed on, viewing Send.com as a way
to broaden their appeal. For example, Tealuxe Inc., A Franklin,
Mass. company that runs tea bars and its own Web site, wants to use
Send.com to attract corporate gift givers as well as tea lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't competing with our Web site,'' said Diana Rodgers,
marketing director for Tealuxe. ``Most of our customers are from
our stores, and our Web site is a convenience for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the growth in Send.com's sales and merchant
partnerships, these are leaner times for virtual retailers. Today,
Send.com executives are under pressure to deliver profits, which
they plan to do in the fourth quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But they are well aware of what can happen when investors lose
their patience. In the last year, investors have pulled their
support from such Internet merchants as Boo.com, Toysmart.com, and
Craftshop.com.
</P>
<P>
   The hostility has spread to suppliers, advertising agencies, and
even landlords. In the spring, Send.com had hoped to move to larger
offices in Waltham. But after a commercial real estate agent
demanded a special ``dot-com'' security deposit of $1 million,
company executives abandoned their search and decided to spend
$50,000 renovating their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the backlash, Send.com executives are wielding the
budget ax. Last year, the Internet retailer spent a staggering $13
million on TV commercials to raise awareness for its brand. For
this holiday season, ``there will be no TV,'' Lannon said.
</P>
<P>
   The compay will instead target customers through less expensive
e-mail, regular mail, and radio promotions. Send.com's gifts also
will be displayed on CNBC.com and other sites that attract a busy
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Executives have sought other cost-trimming opportunities. They
have cut $100,000 in photography fees by doing the work in-house,
for one.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Send.com is set to debut a new site design that will
help the company quickly update its Web pages, moving slow sellers
and products with low inventory to the bottom of the pages. The new
functionality was needed as the company began offering more
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were collapsing under the weight of our product
selection,'' Lannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Send.com also will tweak its Web pages to reflect consumer
behavior. The company has learned that lost customers log off, so
it will add navigational tools, a search box, and product
categories on every page.
</P>
<P>
   Executives also have learned that online shoppers only buy what
you show them. That means more pictures, less chatty text, and
better use of the site's prime real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Customers rarely scroll down, the company discovered, so
displaying products at the bottom of a Web page is like storing
them at the top of an 11-foot shelf in the rear of a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very visual, and we were making them read too
much,'' Obana said.
</P>
<P>
   Insights into consumer behavior are crucial for Internet
retailers. For instance, Send.com now knows that men don't buy men
golf lessons. (It's considered an insult to the male ego, Send.com
officials say.) The company also has realized that it needs to
prepare for two order surges for Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valentine's Day was a two-week holiday for us this year,''
Obana said. ``The week before Valentine's Day, women were buying
gifts for men. The week of Valentine's Day, men were looking for
gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers also have informed Send.com that they want more
products under $50 and a wider variety of gift suggestions. In
response, the company has added a collection of teas and tea sets.
Its holiday lineup will include steaks, hams, fresh-baked cookies,
and wide array of gift baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep updating,'' Obana said. ``Customers don't
want to give people the same thing again and again.''

DISHING THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE   c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're in the market for Internet access faster than a
dial-up modem but are cursed to live somewhere with neither cable
modems nor digital subscriber line telephone access, you still have
hope: Net links through satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that, for now, the main broadband-for-computers
service, Hughes' DirecPC product, costs more and delivers less than
AT&AMP;T Broadband, RCN, or the various DSL offerings from Verizon,
FlashCom, and others.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that later this year, perhaps as soon as next
month, both DirecPC and the Dish Network plan to offer much faster,
two-way satellite broadband services. They will probably still cost
more than landline alternatives but deliver faster access than
satellite systems do now, especially for sending information out to
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   For now, DirecPC, the dominant offering in the computer Net
market (leaving aside WebTV, which provides Internet access through
your TV set and a keyboard), can give you download speeds about
eight times faster than a dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   Installation charges are often waived during promotions, but
generally it costs $150 to get the dish, or $200 for a ``DirecDuo''
dish that brings in both the Internet and hundreds of channels of
television.
</P>
<P>
   For $30 a month, with DirecPC you can surf the Web for 25 hours
a month, paying $2 for every extra hour, or under a new unlimited
access plan pay $50 a month. Those charges include $10 for an
Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   If you live somewhere you can get DSL or a cable modem but don't
plan on using the Net more than an hour a day for the next two
years, factoring in monthly charges plus the one-time dish cost,
you might come out ahead taking the 25-hour plan.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts note that, once you've had a taste of
always-on, high-speed Internet access, you are very likely to make
using the Net a much bigger part of your life and entertainment and
might find it hard to limit yourself to 25 hours a month.
</P>
<P>
   The DirecPC service is not quite true broadband because it uses
a dial-up modem to transmit information from your computer _ such
as a request to load the Boston.com Web page _ and then blasts the
contents of the page back down to your computer through a satellite
dish on the side of your home at up to 400 kilobits per second.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little like mailing a postcard out to someone and getting
an overnight package sent back. And the satellite is not aiming
content to your address, but rather including it in a huge stream
of thousands of transmissions, encoded so that you receive only the
Web page you asked to get.
</P>
<P>
   While noticeably faster than a dial-up modem, DirecPC, at 400
kilobits, is still considerably slower than the
640-kilobit-per-second service offered by Verizon DSL or the 1.5
megabit connections of AT&AMP;T Broadband. Verizon and AT&AMP;T's
RoadRunner generally cost about $40 a month, and more for faster
DSL. Installation and modem fees may run to $100 but are often
waived during promotions or through coupons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems expensive for a consumer in the Boston area relative
to a cable modem or a DSL hookup, but in a lot of rural areas it's
going to be the only way'' to get broadband services, said John
Galego, director of service provider relations with
GetConnected.com. The site is a Boston service that offers unbiased
comparison shopping for Internet access and other communications
and energy services.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Massachusetts, which is blessed to ave some of the
widest-ranging cable modem and DSL offerings of any state, there
are still many broadband gaps _ either towns where the cable
franchise has not been upgraded for Internet access, or areas of
cities and towns more than about two and a half miles from a
``central office'' equipped for DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   While satellite Internet access can be a good choice for someone
whose only alternative is pokey dial-up access, Galego said that
``one of the biggest considerations for satellite access'' is
decidely low-tech: your neighborhood geography.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, to get DirecPC reception you have to be able to
get a clear view to the southwest sky from some part of your home
or property where you are willing to install a dish, with no trees
or other homes in the way.
</P>
<P>
   People often wonder whether satellite reception will suffer
during heavy rain or snowstorms _ or when a flock of geese flies by
_ but Galego said in his experience service outage problems are
``negligible'' for satellites compared to cable or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   DirecPC also requires a fairly powerful Pentium-chip computer to
function, running Windows 98 and containing at least 32 megabytes
of RAM memory and 20 megabytes of space on the hard disc for the
DirecPC software.
</P>
<P>
   Both DirecPC and Echostar have been pouring money into rolling
out new two-way satellite Internet services they plan to unveil
this fall, and even more offerings are expected in the next three
years, such as iSky and Astrolink.
</P>
<P>
   Working with an Israeli company called Gilat-to-Home, EchoStar's
Dish Network plans a two-way broadband satellite offering that
could go live as soon as next month in some parts of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing and performance are still a little fuzzy, however.
EchoStar and Gilat-to-Home say users ``can expect Internet access
speeds up to 10 times faster than normal modem speeds, with burst
rates considerably higher.'' Bursting refers to one-time downloads
of big files such as songs or video clips.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar plans to use an oval-shaped dish, about two feet by
three feet in size, that can bring in both Internet access and the
500 channels of the Dish Network.
</P>
<P>
   DirecPC also says it will launch a two-way broadband service
sometime this fall, still offering about 400 kilobits downstream
but allowing somewhere between 128 and 256 kilobits upstream. To
make it work, you will need to install a transmitter in the USB
port of your computer.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, DirecPC also offers a service allowing them to
blast out content to multiple locations without getting hung up in
bottlenecks. For less than $100, for example, a company could
transmit a 30-mb file to 10,000 personal computers across the
country in less than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One user of this service is RLM Software of Brighton, Mass.,
which pumps up-to-the-minute data on airline flight arrival times
to customers across the country such as shipping companies. It also
provides much of the data used by Travelocity.com's flight status
service, through a direct link to Federal Aviation Administration
radar data showing the actual location of thousands of airplanes,
which is used to calculate expected arrival times.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Flynn, a senior executive with 20-person RLM, said the
company decided to use DirecPC for its FlightView service because
``all our customers don't necessarily have access to a high-speed
Internet connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also determined that using satellites to steer clear
of the Internet would prevent lots of headaches trying to determine
the cause when customers reported they were not receiving data.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an outage on the Internet, and that still happens a
lot, you have to go track it down,'' Flynn said. After some early
rocky going, Flynn said, ``They have made improvements in the last
18 months. The reliability is there now.''

COMPUTER CHIP COULD KEEP YOUR LAPTOP SAFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER   c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   W. David Lee has a solution to a rash of laptop thefts: a car
alarm for your PC.
</P>
<P>
   He means it literally. A device he hopes to sell to computer
makers is based around a motion-detection chip made by Analog
Devices of Canton, Mass. The chip is already widely used in car
alarms and airbags.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lee, a former consultant for Analog, hopes to take the
device a step further with his own company, Caveo Technology LLC in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is in talks with several makers of laptop computers
to provide alarm systems for their models that would appear next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's vision includes a flat device measuring 30 milimeters
square containing the Analog chip, a speaker, and its own battery.
The system would be built directly into laptops or other electronic
devices, and would include software to prevent the machine from
booting up without the correct passwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just became obvious to me that something was needed to make
these more secure,'' says Lee, who as Caveo's chief executive and
largest shareholder oversees seven employees.
</P>
<P>
   Caveo is hardly alone in the market for laptop security, a topic
of much interest as increasing volumes of data are kept only in
electronic bits rather than on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, for instance, an IBM laptop belonging to Irwin
Jacobs, chief executive of wireless-chip maker Qualcomm Inc., was
missing from a hotel conference room moments after he addressed a
conference of business writers in California.
</P>
<P>
   To solve the problem of laptop theft, some competitors sell
software that tracks a computer's whereabouts on the Internet, or
heavy cable locks customized to bolt onto PCs. Kryptonite Corp. of
Canton makes its own motion-detection alarm for laptops, which
costs $60 and provides users with a docking station and a 110-db
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Lee says his solution will be more subtle, combining two of his
previous roles.
</P>
<P>
   As former board member of Kryptonite, Lee helped oversee the
development of computer-security products. And, as a consultant for
Arthur D. Little, Lee was involved in the production of a
motion-sensor chip at Analog, in Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, the most recent version of the chip,
known as the ADXL202E, contains as its prime feature a polysilicon
structure suspended above a silicon wafer with tiny springs also
made from polysilicon. The suspended mass weighs just 0.7
micrograms. A movement, or acceleration, of the chip can then be
determined by measuring the electrical signals generated by the
displacement of the suspended structure.
</P>
<P>
   Analog began producing such chips in 1991 and, in addition to
automotive-component makers, currently sells many to Microsoft,
Sony, Nintendo, and other producers of gear for computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Christophe Lemaire, a marketing manager for the company, said it
is also in discussions with makers of cell phones and
personal-digital assistants to provide what he calls ``gesture
recognition.'' Imagine, he said, a cell phone that could be hung up
with a jiggle, or one that could shaken just so to dial a
particular phone number.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, Analog and Caveo have developed what Lee calls
a ``motion-algorithm library,'' so that an installed chip and its
software will be able to tell when a host laptop is just being
pushed around a desk, or when it is being carried on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Caldwell, a Caveo vice president, said the alarm can be set
to go off when the laptop is carried beyond, for example, a 10-foot
perimeter from its original placement.
</P>
<P>
   Prices haven't been set, but Caldwell said the company expects
to sell its systems to laptop makers at around $20 each.

<P>
   Take a trip to www.requiemforadream.com and you'll find yourself
wondering if you have taken the wrong potion in Wonderland. This is
not your usual movie promotional Web site, but then ``Requiem for a
Dream'' is not from your usual filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Aronofsky, whose first film, ``Pi,'' dealt with an
obsessed math genius, turns his attention to Hubert Selby Jr.'s
novel of drug-fueled delusion and isolation in the Coney Island
district of New York. ``Requiem,'' which stars Ellen Burstyn, Jared
Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans, is set for release Oct.
20 from Artisan. Though the film is currently unrated (it was
originally rated NC-17, but the filmmakers withdrew their
application), there is little as far as we can tell that is overtly
sexual, violent or advocates drugs.
</P>
<P>
   What you find when you first encounter the site which uses movie
scenes, excerpts from the book and sound bytes is an upbeat,
somewhat confusing scene. Soon, though, as you try to interact,
colors begin to fade, error messages occur, and you're directed
into weird places. If you don't know any better, you'll think there
is something wrong with your computer and you're no longer in
control. The site, according to Artisan, is meant to be an extended
mind trip that mirrors the characters' quest for happiness and
their ultimate disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   You be the judge as to whether this Web site works or not, but
it's clear that you'll be seeing more of these kinds of adventurous
sites as studios seek new ways to promote their films.

technology takes online surveillance to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   Hosea's start-up company in Cambridge, Mass. has developed
software that builds digital ``silhouettes,'' or profiles, of
Internet users, after tracking their clicks across the Web. For
example, if a Web surfer visits an airline site and then a Boston
museum site, Predictive's profile model might immediately send the
user a pop-up ad for a Massachusetts travel guide from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Predictive is being closely watched by privacy advocates
because, unlike many similar software companies, it has struck
deals with Internet service providers rather than individual Web
sites. As a result, Predictive's software can follow users of these
ISPs everywhere on the Web, gaining insights into their ages,
incomes, shopping preferences, and hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the whole menu,'' said Hosea, who maintains that his
company protects consumers while allowing advertisers to better
target their audience.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash against Predictive, which launched in May,
highlights the intense debate over privacy on the Web. On one side
are those who believe Internet users should be protected from
companies compiling extensive personal data. On the other are Web
firms that say they are no different from traditional companies in
their desire to research consumer habits.
</P>
<P>
   Hosea believes he is striking the proper balance. He said
Predictive tosses out the list of Web sites that users visit and
keeps only a set of ``scores'' that reveal a customer's implied
demographic information and preferences. No advertiser or ISP can
view the anonymous profiles. Rather, Predictive controls the
silhouettes and sends ads directly to users.
</P>
<P>
   But some privacy advocates remain skeptical of promises made by
Predictive and other Internet companies. They say Predictive does
not properly get ``opt-in'' consent from consumers and does not
have a strict privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates also point to DoubleClick Inc., which
outraged Internet users when it attempted to merge its database of
anonymous consumer information with another database that
identified consumers by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much worse,'' said Andrew Shen, a policy analyst with
the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. ``This is
tracking virtually every move of the Internet user.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts also fear Predictive's software will be widely
accepted by ISPs and, later, cable companies. In seven months, the
tiny firm has signed on six ISPs, including AT&AMP;T WorldNet, IDT
Corp., PSINet, and three others it declined to identify.
Advertisers also are lining up, impressed by Predictive's ability
to dramatically improve customer response to ads.
</P>
<P>
   Predictive plans to announce this week that it has received $45
million in a second round of funding led by venture capital firms
Battery Ventures and Advent International. Smaller investors
include Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., the world's largest
telecommunications company, as well as Internet telephony carrier
Net2Phone Inc. and Internet researcher Nielsen/NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 2001, Predictive projects that 10 million Internet
users will be on the receiving end of the company's profiling
software.
</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc. and Microsoft Corp., two giants in Internet
service, declined to comment on whether they might use Predictive's
software or any similar technology in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where both Hosea and privacy experts agree: Big ISPs
that have largely avoided tracking users will eventually adopt
profiling technology to increase their ad revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Hosea, the son of a nuclear physics scientist, had dabbled in
artificial intelligence at an early age. From a computer in his
father's laboratory at Princeton University, Hosea managed to crack
into a sensitive file. Rather than punishing him, the university
gave him a part-time job writing data-analysis software. Two years
ago, Hosea decided to leave his job as a vice president in GE
Capital's Equity Capital Group to build his own company.
</P>
<P>
   His company's software is downloaded when customers receive
their ISP service. Using artificial intelligence, Predictive does
its best to match Internet users with compatible advertisements. It
works by scoring consumers on 120 different demographical and
preference categories based on Web sites visited. Clicking on a
video-game site, for instance, could result in a low score for age.
But visiting Charles Schwab's site might translate into higher age
and income ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies argue that such digital profiling limits the
number of advertising misfires _ those banner ads that consumers
consider annoying and that advertisers find ineffective. Fewer than
1 percent of customers click on banner advertisements, according to
industry figures. But IDT, one of Predictive's partners, has seen
ads that have drawn 18 percent of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end users say it's a much more pleasurable experience,''
said Michael Packer, domestic operations director for IDT, based in
Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Hosea believes Web users will let Predictive, which shares ad
revenue with ISPs, watch their every move online in return for
lower Internet-service rates. IDT is now using Predictive's
software for a free service called freeatlast.com, while AT&AMP;T
WorldNet is using the technology in a $4.95-a-month package.
</P>
<P>
   Predictive's business model and approach to online privacy also
helped it win over service providers, ISP executives said.
Predictive allows customers to access their silhouettes. And it
does not send them ads for alcohol, tobacco, firearms, or
pornography. Medical self-help sites and hate-monger sites also are
banned.
</P>
<P>
   Although the software can collect keywords at a search engine
and other data typed on a Web page, the company has restrained
itself. Predictive's privacy board, led by Boston civil-liberties
attorney Harvey Silverglate, has expressed concerns about the
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Hosea also stepped to the side, allowing more seasoned
management to steer the company. Michael Skarzynski, 44, a former
executive at Lucent Technologies Inc., took over as CEO May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Predictive's efforts to reassure consumers, critics say
there are glaring problems with the company's techology.
</P>
<P>
   First, Internet users ``opt in,'' or agree to allow Predictive
to track them, by signing a contract with the ISP. That means that
people who choose not to participate simply do not get the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their threshold for opt-in is meaningless, ridiculous,
extremely unfair, and potentially actionable,'' said Ed
Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the US Public Interest
Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts also say Predictive's privacy statement, which
is displayed on its Web site, does not rule out the possibility
that an ISP user name and identification number could be linked to
the anonymous ID number attached to profiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure exactly what they mean when they say anonymous,''
said Jonathan Zittrain, an assistant professor at Harvard Law
School who noticed the clause in Predictive's privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   A Predictive spokesman said the company has not received
personally identifiable information from ISPs and does not intend
to do so. In response to criticism, the firm will rewrite the
clause. ``Predictive Networks is clarifying the privacy policy to
reiterate our operating policy,'' the company said Friday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of Predictive's ISP partners was concerned enough
to strike the clause from its agreement during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I specifically negotiated in our contract that I would not do
that,'' said Harry Lalor, a vice president at Ashburn, Va.-based
PSINet. ``I wanted to stay out of that whole discussion. There's no
way to win, especially for an ISP.''

SENATORS HEAR EXECUTIVES TESTIFY ON CHILDREN AND MOVIE VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs to rewrite and add information; story grows by about 720
words.)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican and Democratic politicians on Wednesday
intensified their criticism of the way violent movies are marketed
to children, as eight Hollywood executives appeared before a Senate
committee and tried to explain their companies' actions and
differed on whether they would continue to market R-rated films to
children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a new industry policy announced Tuesday to limit
that kind of marketing, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said, ``My
friends, that language is not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, the movie companies set a ``goal of not
inappropriately specifically targeting children'' in advertising
and promoting R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand this language,'' said McCain, chairman of
the commerce committee. ``I think it's filled with loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic
vice presidential candidate, said the language of the movie
industry's policy ``almost suggests that one could appropriately
specifically target children in their advertising of R-rated films,
and that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Capitol Hill, Lynne Cheney, whose
husband, Dick, is the Republican nominee for vice president,
accused the Democrats of talking out of both sides of their mouths
_ criticizing Hollywood ``with a wink and a nudge'' and then
soliciting money from the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   The eight executives at the hearing of the Senate Commerce
Committee were asked one by one whether they would promise not to
market R-rated films directly to children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the executives said they would, and four said they would
not, insisting that some R-rated movies were appropriate for
teen-agers younger than 17 who went with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Under the industry's voluntary code, children under 17 are not
supposed to be admitted to movies rated R unless they are
accompanied by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who would not take the pledge, Mel Harris,
president and chief operating officer of Sony Pictures
Entertainment, said it was a ``judgment lapse'' for his company to
try to advertise a film with violent scenes on a children's
television network.
</P>
<P>
   Harris defended Columbia Pictures, a subsidiary of Sony, in
another instance when children aged 9 to 11 were interviewed as
part of the test marketing of a violent R-rated movie. But Harris
said the studio would stop using under-age children in focus groups
unless they were accompanied by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate hearing was called in response to the Federal Trade
Commission report released Sept. 11 that the vast majority of
adult-rated movies, recordings and electronic games were marketed
to children.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of the morning-long hearing, Sen. Sam
Brownback, R-Kan., told the movie executives: ``You've really got
to help us out. Parents are really struggling out there. You are
part of the solution and part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left up to the movie studios whom to send to testify
Wednesday, and those who appeared were not the highest ranking
executives. For instance, Robert Iger, the president of Walt Disney
Co., testified instead of the more prominent chairman, Michael
Eisner, and Harris testified for Sony instead of the chairman, John
Calley.
</P>
<P>
   Without being asked, Harris gave an explanation of two instances
described in a front-page article in The New York Times on
Wednesday in which movies with violence made by Columbia Pictures
were marketed to young children.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the studio tried to advertise ``The Fifth
Element,'' a science-fiction thriller starring Bruce Willis, on
Nickelodeon, a network with an audience mostly 12 years old and
younger. The network refused to accept the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advertisement buyers went astray,'' Harris said. ``That
was a judgment lapse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, researchers hired by the company interviewed
50 9- to 11-year-old children to evaluate concepts for the sequel
to ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' a tale of a serial slasher
who wielded an ice hook.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the producer was surprised to learn from the
researchers that a large number of young children went to that
movie, and he was interested in their views. In preparation for the
sequel, ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' researchers
called the parents of children who had seen the first movie, asked
their permission to speak with the children and then interviewed
the children on the telephone, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the procedure was acceptable since the
parents gave permission, but he promised that children under 17
would not be used again in test marketing by his company unless
their parents were actually with them.
</P>
<P>
   The executives from Disney, DreamWorks SKG, 20th Century Fox
Film Corp. and Warner Bros. pledged not to appeal directly to
children under 17 in advertisements of R-rated films. In addition
to Harris, executives from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Paramount
Pictures and Universal Studios refused to take that pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Snider, chairman of Universal, said her studio certainly
would not ``market R-rated films to 12-year-olds,'' but she said
many R-rated movies were ``suitable for mature teen-agers to see
with their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris McGurk, vice chairman and chief operating officer of MGM,
said his studio would release two R-rated movies about World War II
next year that ``could be of great value to mature teens.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At another hearing on a different topic on the other side of the
Capitol, an awkward moment occurred when Rep. Steve Largent,
R-Okla., out of the blue asked Gerald M. Levin, chairman of Time
Warner, whether he thought the media promoted violence.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, whose son, Jonathan, a schoolteacher, was killed in New
York in 1997 by a former student, responded that he doubted that
Largent had actually experienced violence as a personal tragedy.

 &HT;    Groups make `final' push against polio
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Polio is being passed from person to person only in
the poorest and least stable of the world's countries, but remains
a health problem for the entire world, political and public health
leaders said at a ``polio summit'' here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from the World Health Organization, the Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the service
organization Rotary International joined representatives of
governments from the United States to the Ivory Coast at the United
Nations to refocus attention on the global effort to eradicate
polio by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Since the worldwide campaign began, the annual count of cases
has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to about 20,000 last year. The
disease, which can be prevented by immunization, persists in parts
of Africa and South Asia, and campaigners fear that attention and
funding will lapse before the job of eradication is complete. If
the campaign were not completed, polio could rebound _ or at the
least continue to exact its current global price tag of $1.5
billion each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the story enters what we must make its final chapter,''
Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the U.N., told the group of 500 in
a keynote speech. ``We cannot risk being complacent: Every child on
this earth must be immunized against polio, so that we can free the
world together from the grip of this dreadful disease.''
</P>
<P>
   According to WHO's strategic plan, outlined by Director-General
Gro Harlem Brundtland, eradicating polio requires multiple steps:
intensifying immunization and surveillance to see where it crops
up; identifying and destroying, or securely locking away, any
remaining lab stocks of the virus; and figuring out when to scale
down, or stop, polio immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   But experts said the initiative continues to face multiple
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   One is securing enough funding from public and private sources
to complete the campaign. The effort is expected to require an
additional $1 billion over the next five years. The coalition
fighting polio has identified sources for about half of that, and
fears it will face a $450 million shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner, whose United Nations Foundation recently gave $28
million to the polio campaign, was on hand to urge major companies
and well-off individuals to pony up more money to combat the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to call on the private sector _ those who have
been blessed with more wealth than they need _ to make their
contributions to this cause,'' he said, ``and to share the joy and
the triumph that we're going to have when polio joins smallpox as
one of the two diseases that have been eradicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The other major obstacles to polio's defeat are getting access
to all the children who still need vaccine, and garnering political
support for vaccination campaigns, twin goals that are emerging as
the greatest remaining hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   Areas in some African countries, as well as in parts of Asia,
are closed to immunization campaigns by small-scale wars.
</P>
<P>
   Others are overwhelmed by refugees, fleeing conflicts and
natural disasters, who move so quickly and unpredictably that they
are difficult to monitor and immunize.
</P>
<P>
   Local political support, combined with strong international
censure, could make a difference, the polio campaigners believe.
But those contributions have been slow in coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that 10 years ago, or even five years ago, we
quite realized the obstacle that access would be,'' Carol Bellamy,
executive director of UNICEF, said after the meeting. ``Money, of
course, is still an obstacle. But we need a greater understanding
worldwide that access is a significant problem, because that could
possibly lead to greater pressure being placed on some of these
problematic places.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the summit Monday seemed devoted to raising the profile
of the international battle _ it began with the triggering of a
``Countdown Clock'' that will tick off the seconds until 2005 and
the remaining lab-confirmed cases down to zero _ and to honoring
the major organizations carrying out the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the WHO and other groups had set a goal of
eradicating the disease by the year 2000. But over the summer, the
coalition said political and scientific hurdles would push
achieving that goal back by several years.
</P>
<P>
   Technical planning and fund-raising were being carried out
behind the scenes. But the upfront, high-luster public relations of
the summit, according to one participant, was in itself a policy
goal.

CALIFORNIA GOV. DAVIS VETOES TAX ON WEB SALES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle   SACRAMENTO _ Saying he is
<TEXT>
protecting California consumers, Gov. Gray Davis Monday vetoed a
bill first-in-the-nation bill that would have forced many Internet
retailers to charge sales tax.
<P>
   The governor's action protects California e-businesses from
being taxed immediately but leaves the door open for future
decisions on how best the state can reap financial rewards from the
rapidly expanding e-commerce industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for the Internet to reach its full potential as a
marketing medium and job creator, it must be given time to
mature,'' Davis said in his veto message. ``At present, it is less
than 10 years old. Imposing sales taxes on Internet transactions at
this point in its young life would send the wrong signal about
California's international role as the incubator of the dot-com
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, by Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, would
have made Internet sales conform to laws governing catalog sales by
forcing Internet companies to charge sales tax if they have a
brick-and-mortar store in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The veto, while widely expected, leaves California still
wrestling with the highly charged debate about taxing the billions
of dollars of online sales of everything from books to patio
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is still there. How do we handle taxation of
e-commerce transactions?'' said Teresa Casazza, California vice
president of the American Electronics Association, which opposed
the Internet tax bill. ``We are very interested in moving forward
with that discussion, but (Migden's) bill was not the way to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he believes the matter should be reviewed in three to
five years, and he signed a bill creating a commission to further
study the issues surrounding sales tax and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member ``California Commission on Tax Policy in the New
Economy'' will make recommendations to the governor and Legislature
on tax issues. It will include representatives of business, local
government and the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``State and federal responses to taxation and the Internet over
the past few years have been awfully narrow and, as a result,
controversial,'' said the bill's author, Sen. John Vasconcellos,
D-Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto of the Migden bill, Davis said he did not want to
single out Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet must be subject to a stable and nondiscriminatory
legal environment, particularly in the area of taxation,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, AB 2414 does not provide such a stable
environment: it singles out companies that are conducting
transactions electronically and attempts to impose tax collection
obligations on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Migden and supporters of the bill say the governor missed
the substance of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is flat-out, plum wrong,'' Migden said Monday. ``This
measure is only about obeying existing law and making sure that we
all live by the same rules. The governor and some business people
favor making exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Goldberg, the lobbyist for the Northern California
Independent Booksellers, said the bill was meant to target the few
companies that violate current law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have told a handful of businesses that they had to
follow the law,'' he said. ``I'm not surprised it was made out to
be a bigger deal than that. It was a question of substance versus
the symbolism, and Davis reacted to the symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government and dozens of states are
considering taxing the Internet, officials in Migden's office said
her bill was the first attempt to enforce sales tax collection by
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, some e-tailers like Barnesandnoble.com and
Borders.com do not charge California sales tax because their
Internet subsidiaries are based outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   But other online retailers _ such as Macys.com and
EddieBauer.com _ do charge state sales tax because they do not use
separate, out-of-state subsidiaries to operate their online
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy stems from a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that
requires merchants to collect sales tax only in states where they
have a physical presence or `nexus.'
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble have said that their
stores do not constitute nexuses for their Web subsidiaries because
their Internet operations are separate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill supporters say they will continue to push to level the
playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is not going away,'' Goldberg said. ``In the real
world of business people, the issue doesn't just disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   In other action, Davis signed two bills aimed at protecting
children:
</P>
<P>
   --Car safety seats or booster seats will be required for kids
either younger than 6 or lighter than 60 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, children must ride in safety seats until they are at
least 4 years old and also weigh at least 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The new age and weight requirements take effect Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   --Schools must tell parents when pesticides will be used at
their children's school.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also creates a registry so parents can find out when a
pesticide is going to be applied.
</P>
<P>
   Davis vetoed a stronger bill last year because of its
requirements on how pesticides were to be used at schools.
</P>
<P>
   This year's bill contains no requirements, just the the
mandatory notification.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also requires schools to post warning signs at areas
being treated 24 hours in advance and 72 hours after a pesticide is
used.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  Changing the way TV and Web interact 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' has changed the way reality television and new
media can interact.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. As godawful as what you've seen on TV has been,
Internet viewers were granted an occasionally compelling moment.
What's more, Netizens changed both the dynamic in the house and the
TV show's content. In other words, audiences of the Internet feeds
literally wrested control of the show from its unimaginative
producers and, on rare occasions, created drama for TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I agree with the description of this show as a 'train
wreck,''' cracks Lauri Hoese of Austin, one of the Internet
conspirators, ``I'm searching for a better metaphor. You see, train
wrecks are interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cliche to joke about how it's like watching paint dry,
but when the final history of TV is written, 'Big Brother' will be
considered more important than the better and the more highly rated
'Survivor,''' declares Robert Thompson, founding director of
Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Big Brother' provided a model that Internet users and TV
users might actually use, like no other convergence idea, like
'Enhanced TV,' did. Viewers took over the show, affecting
storylines, and carved out a powerful set of lessons that will be
applied in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new way of watching a television show. In the past,
someone made it, they showed it to us, we watched,'' Thompson
continues. ``Now they can create programs that are jumping-off
points, that can become a lifestyle. You watch the show, go to the
Internet and follow it some more, and use the Internet to plot and
become part of it. It takes control from out of the hands of the
people making the show and into the hands of who knows who.''
</P>
<P>
   Even George, the portly, high-strung roofer banished last week,
admitted he got his idea for a dramatic, if briefly considered,
mass walkout from one of the banners Hoese and Jeff Oswald, known
collectively as Media Jammers, flew over the Big Brother compound.
Even though the potential rebellion was quelled the day it began,
CBS milked the potential walkout for drama for four episodes.
</P>
<P>
   None of it might have happened had those responsible for ``Big
Brother'' been so incompetent. While it's been a hit in every
country it's aired in since debuting last year in the Netherlands,
everything, it seems, went wrong for ``Big Brother'' in America:
</P>
<P>
   Casting was a botch, heavy on trailer-park personalities,
self-absorbed 20-somethings and/or passive-aggressive sorts, a
group so self-conscious that few arguments and even less romantic
intrigue resulted inside the Studio City pressure cooker. Host
Julie Chen was initially seen as a cynical gambit to promote ``The
Early Show'' but emerged as worse miscasting than the houseguests.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers torpedoed CBS by voting out the show's most provocative
personalities, ensuring the house's general level of somnolence. In
fact, when the show offered the final six contestants $50,000 to
exit the house, the group valued their comraderie more than the
money: hardly the sort of dynamic the network had hoped to foster.
</P>
<P>
   Also perplexing was the producers' avoidance of potentially
provocative moments Eddie's racist jokes, Cassandra's vivid
description of an African trip, the houseguests' first disgusted
talk of rebellion and the airplane banners, which became so
ubiquitous, CBS finally couldn't ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas ``Big Brother'' preferred to pretend its producers were
in control, another reality series, BBC America's ``Castaway
2000,'' transforms its production woes into drama. ``Castaway,''
stranding 36 strangers on an island, documented the production's
inability to get the compound built in time for the show's kickoff
and its accidental destruction of some participants' belongings, as
well as the subsequent irate walkoff by key cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Castaway' is really avoiding 'Big Brother's' mistake,''
Thompson points out. ``Here, they chose to bury the conflicts
between 'Big Brother' and the people in the house as if it would
harm the show, when in fact that could've made that show. And that
got the Internet dimension mad at the program itself. One of the
places where great drama can occur, which 'Big Brother' didn't
recognize, is in the conflicts between these innocent naives who
come into the show-business world only to be exploited by the evil
network. You can bet if CBS does 'Big Brother' again, things will
be very, very different.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a ``BBII'' is virtually guaranteed, given impending
actors and writers strikes. Who wouldn't want to watch ordinary
folks struggling and even join in the battle against producers who
would gleefully posit themselves as corporate Richard Hatches, the
scheming ``Survivor'' champion, in an effort to show that Davids
can still best mega-media-conglomerate Goliaths? After all, reality
TV is all about getting its participants to squirm; who's to lose
if a show invites viewers to turn the tables?
</P>
<P>
   Though a bust on TV, ``Big Brother'' has been a boon to the
Internet. Its official Web site, Bigbrother2000.com, recorded 4.25
million user hits in July, the highest among new Web sites. Viewers
to that site, late on the night of Aug. 14, witnessed a revolution
sputter to life in Studio City. The houseguests were all cranky,
having been forced to perform a profane 'roast' with scripted gags
that insulted one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was angry that CBS edited the second roast to make it appear
as if the houseguests themselves had come up with those horrible
'jokes,''' says Kaye Mallory, known to the houseguests as Megaphone
Lady. (She tipped them off to the network's impending offer of
money to leave the house, allowing them to steel themselves against
looking greedy on-air, and encouraged them during their recent
potential rebellion.) ``So when George and Britt talked about
walking out together, I was in total agreement. That started the
whole thing. I had to get a megaphone and let them know I was
behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Also appalled was the group at Salon.com's ``Big Brother'' Table
Talk thread, where Hoese, Oswald and others exchanged ideas of how
to sabotage the show until 5 the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been joking for some time that we wished we could
'banish' the producers,'' recalls Hoese. ``Then, the option of the
houseguests leaving all together was raised. We in Internet land
were galvanized and cheering this subversion on, when it was
abruptly ended by the suggestion of pancakes. The houseguests
drifted away from the idea, but we seized on it, and after a short
period of smart-ass talk about revolution and breakfast foods, flew
our first banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Others began flying banners over the house, and Hoese and Oswald
created a Web site mediajammers.org that details its grievances
with ``BB,'' including serious allegations that in manipulating the
show's reality, the producers are breaking laws that were set in
place after the quiz-show scandals of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the houseguests' attitudes toward the banners have
ranged from confusion to contempt, while they openly called for
Mallory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Megaphone was able to be almost immediately responsive to
the houseguests,'' Hoese notes. ``They felt like they were
interacting with her, whereas the banners felt more like criticism
and made them defensive. It's interesting, though, that once we
flew a banner explaining CBS had chased Ms. Meg off, the
houseguests stopped asking for her. It's a sign of how anxious they
are to please the show's powers-that-be. They're terrified that
they're being negatively portrayed, so they try to avoid doing
anything they think might result in retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the effects of Media Jammers and the Megaphone Lady
contributed to what could have been great television, had CBS been
clever enough to understand that, and what will probably be
processed by more clever producers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing thing that people have had such an impact on
the show,'' says Mallory. ``If I were CBS, I'd glom onto the
outside 'interference' and capitalize on the publicity. Publicity
means that people are paying attention! I just don't think that CBS
gets that about this show. It's a new type of genre, so there have
to be new rules.''

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD and SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A book about anthropologists working with isolated Indians in
Amazonia has touched off a raging storm in the profession, reviving
scholarly animosities, endangering personal reputations and, some
of the parties say, threatening to undermine confidence in
legitimate practices of anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, ``Darkness in El Dorado: How Scientists and
Journalists Devastated the Amazon,'' Patrick Tierney, a journalist,
presents evidence showing that in 1968 anthropologists, supported
by the former Atomic Energy Commission, inoculated several
communities of the Yanomami Indians with a measles vaccine. He
suggests that this experiment possibly contributed to the epidemic
of the disease that broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds, perhaps thousands'' of people died in a population
of little more than 20,000, the author reported.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most inflammatory of several cases described by
Tierney as examples of careless and perhaps unethical behavior by
anthropologists and filmmakers who visited and studied the
Yanomami. Living in the Amazon basin of southern Venezuela and
northern Brazil and having virtually no contact with the outside
world until the 1950s, the Yanomami have become to social
scientists models of what primitive Stone Age cultures must have
been like.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists who have read the book or a summary of the
allegations joined the attack, urging the American Anthropological
Association or some other scientific body to undertake a thorough
investigation of the ``imminent scandal.'' They expressed concern
that the allegations would make it more difficult to gain
permission to conduct field work in many countries and win the
trust of subjects of their studies.
</P>
<P>
   Others who are familiar with some of book's contents insisted
that the allegations were either unfounded or exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of project was Dr. James V. Neel, a specialist in
human genetics at the University of Michigan and member of the
National Academy of Sciences, who died in February.
</P>
<P>
   A young protege of Neel and a junior member of the 1968
expedition was Dr. Napoleon A. Chagnon, now an emeritus professor
of anthropology at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
He denied the allegations, calling them part of a ``long vendetta
against me'' by some of the critics. ``No Indians that we gave the
vaccine to died,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   As charges and countercharges raced back and forth over the
Internet and telephone in the last 10 days, several prominent
anthropologists have sprung to Chagnon's defense, saying the
implied charges were not credible.
</P>
<P>
   Medical scientists said they doubted that the vaccine itself
could have caused a widespread outbreak of measles or directly
caused so many deaths, even among people with little resistance to
the disease, like the Yanomami. They said it was more likely that
carriers of the disease had introduced it to the villages at about
the same time that the vaccination program was under way.
</P>
<P>
   International health workers worried that a suspicion of
unethical practices related to the measles outbreak, even if proved
untrue, would raise more obstacles to vaccination programs that are
needed to control infectious diseases, particularly in Third World
countries where approval of such campaigns is already being
resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney's book is to be published by W.W. Norton on Nov. 16 and
is scheduled to be excerpted in The New Yorker next week. Only
galley proofs of the book have been available so far. A spokesman
said that Tierney was declining all interviews until the book's
publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not rush to judgment, especially since the book
hasn't been published yet,'' Dr. Louise Lamphere, president of the
anthropological association, said in an interview. ``In case
violations did occur, we're going to have to find some way to deal
with them. It's not like anthropologists are doctors or attorneys
who can have their licenses revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Johnston, chairwoman of the association's human
rights committee, said she was organizing a panel discussion on the
book on Nov. 16 at the association's annual meeting in San
Francisco. Tierney has agreed to participate, but Chagnon said in a
widely circulated e-mail message that he would decline. ``She is
inviting me to a feeding frenzy in which I am the bait,'' he
complained.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Tierney wrote that Neel's Yanomami vaccine project
was a continuation of the Atomic Energy Commission studies on the
effects of radiation on human subjects, which the scientist had
participated in since the end of World War II. The commission
wanted thousands of Yanomami blood samples to determine genetic
mutation rates in a population completely uncontaminated by
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Neel had established an international reputation for discovering
the genetic nature of thalassemia, a form of anemia that occurs
among those of Greek or Italian descent, and demonstrating that
sickle-cell anemia is a protective adaptation against malaria. Both
were major research insights.
</P>
<P>
   But Neel also espoused some controversial views. According to
the book, Neel believed that there was such a thing as a
``leadership gene,'' and that a genetically isolated society like
the Yanomami would be an ideal place to study this, presumably as
the result of dominant men having more chances than lesser ones to
reproduce their genes and pass on their leadership qualities.
</P>
<P>
   In the book Tierney does not reach a conclusion about the motive
for the vaccine experiment. But in a long letter summarizing the
book's allegations, two anthropologists, Dr. Terence Turner of
Cornell University and Dr. Leslie E. Sponsel of the University of
Hawaii, speculated that a likely motive for spreading the measles
epidemic _ if the harshest allegations are correct _ might have
been to support Neel's genetic theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible,'' Turner and Sponsel wrote, that Neel
``thought that genetically superior members'' of these isolated
groups ``might prove to have differential levels of immunity and
thus higher rates of survival to imported diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Turner and Sponsel said there appeared to be no written
text or recorded speech by Neel to back up this contention, they
noted that the book raised questions about why the anthropologists
never explained why the vaccine was used, even after earlier
evidence emerged linking the inoculations to the cause or spread of
the epidemic. Tierney also reported some evidence that he said
showed that the research team might have abandoned some of the
epidemic victims without treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the allegations are proven true, it will mean crimes
against humanity have been committed,'' Turner said in an
interview. He and Sponsel were cited by Tierney as sources of
``comments and encouragement'' in preparing the book.
</P>
<P>
   Chagnon, however, said the vaccinations were a ``humanistic,
very humane activity on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Glenn Smith, an anthropologist at the University of
California at Davis and a former colleague, said: ``I knew Jim Neel
for nearly 30 years and what people are saying about him sounds
like a witch hunt. I can assure you he didn't think the Yanomami
had a gene for headmanship. That is preposterous.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tierney emphasized that the vaccine used was a strong live-virus
strain, known as Edmonston B. Medical scientists said that the
World Health Organization had issued advisories in 1965 that the
vaccine should be used with caution, accompanied by doses of gamma
globulin. An improved vaccine was available by 1968 but was not
used by the anthropologists.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William H. Foege, a former director of the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, said: ``Edmonston B was one of the
first measles vaccines, and was strong and sometimes caused severe
reactions that were like a light case of measles. But I would be
very surprised if the vaccine caused a death, particularly death in
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the controversy heated up last week, Dr. Susan Lindee, a
science historian at the University of Pennsylvania who is
researching a biography of Neel, examined some of the scientist's
field notes for 1968 and other papers and said she found evidence
contradicting Tierney's view of certain events.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the book, Lindee said, Neel had permission from the
Venezuelan government to carry out the vaccine program. When an
epidemic was declared, these notes showed, Neel provided medicines
to the affected villages and their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that he attempted to discourage anyone
from providing treatment,'' Lindee said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Ferguson, an anthropologist at Rutgers University at
Newark, N.J., and author of ``Yanomami Warfare,'' published in
1995, said he thought Tierney's book was ``largely accurate in
reporting the facts, but there are also opinions and
interpretations, and that's where it gets much more debatable.''

FOR THE BEST VIEW OF TELEVISION, USE A WIDE LENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, a party to celebrate the start of a cable arts
channel was held at the home of an art collector. The walls were
lined with canvases by Jasper Johns and other contemporary painters
whose work museums would be happy to have. Yet any idea that this
event signaled an easy coexistence of high art and mass media was
short-lived. When it was time for a toast, the hostess announced
without a trace of irony or self-consciousness, ``We're not
television people, m husband and I, but we figure it's not going
away so we might as well support an arts channel.''
</P>
<P>
   As if that quaint, condescending comment were not bad enough _
making it seem that we had stepped into a time warp and landed in
the 1950s _ the next was truly jaw-dropping. The chairman of the
new channel said he agreed, and justified his decision to wallow in
this declasse medium with a cliche: ``If you can't beat 'em, join
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to dismiss their remarks as the lingering snobbery
of a dying breed, and to some extent that's just what they were.
But their attitudes are also not as rare as you might think. They
are extreme versions of the many wrongheaded approaches to
television, which range from the dismissive on one side to the
happy-go-lucky on the other. Images that pigeonhole the medium
dominate any conversation about it; in these views, watching
television is thought to be cultural anthropology, mindless
escapism, emotional solace or a source of news, sports and
occasionally art. But it is rarely embraced for doing all these
things at once.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that variety, and the way the parts feed one another, is
where television gets its immense social power. A fresher, more
realistic way to understand and appreciate television is to stop
regarding it through a narrow lens, and instead to embrace its
breadth.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who does not watch television cannot possibly understand
mainstream American culture. That may be disappointing news to art
collectors who wish we lived in Renaissance Italy, but there it is.
We live in a vast, messy society, and television mirrors who we are
in all our contradictions, complexities and uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just as there used to be people who proclaimed that they
watched only PBS, now there are people who claim to watch only HBO
(for ``The Sopranos,'' of course, and not ``G-String Divas'' and
other sex-filled late-night shows. There is even unmistakable
self-loathing displayed on television itself. ``It's not TV, it's
HBO,'' goes the idiotic slogan for the best channel there is.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's TV, you ninnies, it's just good TV. But that is a
concept the marketing people obviously think won't convince the
upscale audience they mean to attract. The slogan TNT uses for its
original films, ``The best movie studio on television,'' also
attempts to borrow some luster from the movies, even though the
increasingly homogenized film world no longer has much glory to
share.
</P>
<P>
   A wider embrace of television, taking the medium on its own
terms, is more revealing. Paradoxically, only such a broad view can
cut to the heart of our multifaceted society, a place where pop
culture and high art, reality and fiction, news and television's
shaping of it, meet. Whether you're watching television as an
escape at the end of a tiring day or seeking out sociological
clues, those activities come to the same thing; the sociology seeps
in by osmosis.
</P>
<P>
   Without going out of its way, television provides a constantly
updated chart of what mainstream America thinks. The several Emmys
recently awarded to the sitcom ``Will and Grace,'' including best
comedy and best supporting actor for Sean Hayes as Will's friend
Jack, offer a staid, traditional sign of approval. The show's
popular success tells us that Americans will watch the story of a
gay man and his female best friend. But ``Will and Grace'' also
hints (here is its nasty secret) that it is safe to create a
stereotypical flouncing gay man in Jack, who can reassure viewers
that their prejudices are true. Even programmers' attempts to gauge
what America is ready for indicate how the zeitgeist is perceived.
In the end, the show's easy acceptance said one thing; if it had
created an outcry, that would have meant something else.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most popular shows of recent years, there is no single
``reality'' reflected by television, but several provocative
versions of how we think about real life. From ``The X-Files'' we
learn that we live in a country in which people are deeply
suspicious of the government's truthfulness; in the alien-hunting
Mulder and the rational Scully we see the dramatized tension
between belief and skepticism. From ``The West Wing'' we learn that
viewers long for a president like the one Martin Sheen plays, more
upright and heroic than we are ever likely to have in life, and
that this longing can coexist with a tough-minded acknowledgment of
political horse-trading. ``E.R.'' tells us to expect doctors who
are dedicated and selfless, whatever messy personal problems are
nagging at them that day; life tells us those expectations are
insanely idealized.
</P>
<P>
   While networks and critics crow about so-called quality shows (a
favorite, meaningless buzzword), pedestrian and even outright bad
shows are revealing, too. The ordinary ``Drew Carey Show'' offers a
middle-American, overweight, unglamorous hero, a comfort to average
people everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Look even briefly at more respected art forms and you find
creators who genuinely like television, are influenced by it and
make it a significant part of their work. David Foster Wallace's
story ``My Appearance,'' about an actress who is a guest on the old
``Late Night With David Letterman,'' is a sophisticated work about
the ironic turn our society has taken, a failing marriage and the
masks we wear every day. Dave Eggers' acclaimed novelistic memoir,
``A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,'' is loaded with
television references, including an account of his failed audition
for MTV's ``Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   These writers represent just two of the generations (those in
their 30s and their 20s) who grew up with television. The
pioneering video art of the older Nam June Paik began when the VCR
was an alien concept. Such artists embrace television as an
important, imperfect part of American culture, without looking down
on it or losing their critical judgment.
</P>
<P>
   It is perceptive of them to incorporate the medium in their
work, because even as the explosion of channels creates a more
fragmented television universe, what we know and how we know it is
shaped more than ever by television. Political campaigns are no
longer simply staged with the evening news in mind; they are
made-for-Oprah or made-for-Larry King events.
</P>
<P>
   Television now creates cultural moments as much as it reflects
them. The prepackaged Olympics, which end today, and the annual
ritual of the Academy Awards transcend what the athletic contests
or the Hollywood awards would be if the cameras stayed away. The
details of the O.J. Simpson trial, the JonBenet Ramsey murder, the
Monica Lewinsky scandal and the Elian Gonzalez custody fight have
invaded the public conversation in a way that would never have
happened without cable news channels. (Though the Internet is
rapidly gaining ground, it has not yet become pervasive enough to
claim that kind of grip.)
</P>
<P>
   Even our language has been shaped by television. Catch phrases
enter and leave the language, understood even by people who don't
watch the shows that spawned them. They are marks of what has
captured the public imagination: the simplistic ``final answer''
from the cheery ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''; the overwrought
fatalism of ``the tribe has spoken'' from the cutthroat
``Survivor''; the ``yada, yada, yada'' tribute to the joys and
neuroses provoked by life's ordinary details in ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that television is important doesn't mean that
everything it does is good. Most of it is dreadful, but even at its
worst it can be dreadful in a fascinating way.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A vapid mini-series like ``The Sixties,'' with its laughably
hollow image of a volatile decade, demonstrates how television can
reduce history to a meaningless montage of film clips, music and
colorful costumes, defanging a whole era to make it palatable for
television and buyers of the soundtrack CD. Yet, by giving us what
the '60s was not, by creating a caricature historians can rail
against, ``The Sixties'' perversely contributes something to the
conversation. That is not the ideal contribution, but it matters.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with junk television (apart from boredom) is
that its critics can use it to demonize the whole medium. Movies,
especially, love to make television the easy scapegoat, in films
like ``The Truman Show,'' which suggests people cannot escape the
medium's evil control.
</P>
<P>
   As the current political debate about marketing violent
entertainment to children illustrates, condemning an entire
industry is more a political convenience than an idea rooted in the
vast range of what television presents every day.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of watching television is more complex than
either the politicians or the Hollywood executives, both full of
narrow self-interest, admit. Blinkered opinions that damn
television for its Jerry Springer excesses or foolishly overpraise
it for half-witted sitcoms are both off base.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Television's highest achievements do not define it any better
than its lowest. ``The Sopranos,'' which has the depth of character
of genuine art, is like a gift, rare in any medium. It is as
distant from most junk on television as a Kurosawa film is from a
Hollywood action movie or a Toni Morrison novel from a Danielle
Steel romance. Yet no one dismisses film and novels in general just
because popcorn movies or beach books outweigh true art. No one
would dream of saying, in a regal tone, ``We're not book people, my
husband and I.''
</P>

   Television people are everywhere, watching everything, realizing
(as only people with a solid grasp of American culture can) that
the highbrow-lowbrow divisions so often imposed on television are
nonsensical. It's not HBO; it's TV.

<P>
   _ MTVi group cuts 25% of work force
</P>
<P>
   _ i2Go teams up with GM in music deal
</P>

   NOTHING TO SING ABOUT: MTVi Group is cutting 25 percent of its
jobs, or 105 positions, at the online music entertainment company.
The cuts follow a net loss of $46.4 million on revenue of $18.2
million, according to regulatory filings. They also follow the
merger of the company's parent, Viacom Inc., with CBS Inc. MTVi's
operations include youth-oriented VH1.com, MTV.com and SonicNet. It
was recently redesigned to lure more views and advertisers. The
cuts reportedly were in editorial, technology and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC TO GO: Speaking of music, Atlanta-based i2Go, which
develops mobile audio technology, has created a co-branded Web site
with General Motors that allows new car owners to download music
and news programs from the Internet, then take it in their cars
``to go.'' As part of the GM ``Sound Values'' marketing program,
i2Go also built a special-edition digital audio player that will be
given to GM customers who buy Pontiac Grand Am, Sunfire, GMC Jimmy
or Sonoma models to download the music and information.
</P>
<P>
   DIRECTING TRAFFIC: Speaking of cars, Microsoft Corp. plans to
jump onto the bandwagon of companies that are developing car
navigational systems. The software maker is teaming up auto-parts
maker Robert Bosch GmbH to develop systems for in-vehicle
navigation and Internet access. The products, using Windows CE
software, will be sold to automakers under Bosch's Blaupunkt brand.
Ford Motor Co. and PSA Peugeot Citroen announced a similar
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   CONTROLLING ACCESS: San Diego-based Websense Inc. has created a
new Internet filter to help companies control what sites employees
can access. According to eMarketer research, the average worker
spends 12 hours a week on the Net, compared with 2.5 for home.
Websense's goal is to enable IT administrators to conserve network
bandwith, discourage employees from using company time for personal
pursuits and mitigate employers' legal liability. The company's
Premium Group 1 software allows companies to control access to
online brokerage sites, free software downloads, sites that charge
users instant messaging services and bandwith-intensive ads.

   WESTWAYNE'S BACK: Atlanta's largest ad agency, WestWayne, has
been silent in cyberspace for much of the year for a redesign. That
finally changed this week with the relaunch of www.westwayne.com.
The agency serves clients that include Publix, Russell Athletic and
NAPA Auto Parts. WestWayne even has its own interactive division.
But what WestWayne didn't have was an active Web site from March
through September, making it one of the area's few sizable ad
agencies without a forum on the Internet. The highlights include
staples of most ad agency sites, including a client list and case
studies of ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   WHO NEEDS 'EM? In the wake of more online layoffs, like those at
MTVi Group and Hollywood.com, a portal that cut 50 employees this
week, it's no surprise that fewer Net companies are using
headhunting services. A survey by the Association of Executive
Search Consultants found a 12.5 percent drop in searches for
executives at e-commerce and online media companies in the second
quarter, which are the most recent data available. That compared
with a 14 percent increase in executive searches across all other
industries.

 &HT;    Duval closer to playing shape
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ Upright again and finally off his back, an
energized and easygoing David Duval walked into the interview room
at the Buick Challenge Wednesday. Greeted in the doorway by his
former Georgia Tech teammate, Stewart Cink, he offered a summary of
his condition after a two-month absence from the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, Duval will get the question so many times, he'll
wish it was embroidered on his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not quite all the way there, but I might not be until
maybe June,'' Duval told him.
</P>
<P>
   Usually it's a laid-back week for Duval at Callaway Gardens. But
not when you've been sidelinedwith a strained lower back ligament
since Aug. 4. Each day will be a proving ground. On Tuesday came 16
holes in a practice round, which brought some strange stiffness,
but nothing to deaden his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not necessarily fit right now golf-wise,'' said Duval, who
when healthy is among the PGA Tour's fittest players, ``because I
haven't been doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the $2.3 million tournament commences at the Mountain
View Course, it will be Duval's first full round of golf since
Sunday at the British Open, when the world winced as he struggled
through a four-shot stay in the Road Hole bunker.

MAJOR PARTIES ARE EMERGING AS BIG SPENDERS IN TV ADVERTISING
CAMPAIGNS PETER MARKS  
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Wisc., R.I., Mo.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic party organizations are by a wide
margin outspending both special interest groups and the Bush and
Gore campaigns on television in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say this trend is transforming the parties
this year from supporting players into full partners in the
advertising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The basic strategic shift, say researchers who monitor
television spending in the presidential race, is a departure from
previous election cycles, when the candidates themselves ran the
majority of commercials and spent far more money than the parties.
And it means that this year, if the trend continues, the
advertising campaigns will have been financed to a much larger
degree by the unregulated soft money donated to the parties by
corporations and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The use of soft money has become an issue this year in many of
the highest profile political campaigns, including the New York
Senate race, where Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio have
tentatively agreed to a ban on soft money in campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Vice President Al Gore, in response to a call by
two senators for similar limits in the presidential race,
challenged Gov. George W. Bush to accept such a ban. Bush has said
he does not favor soft money restrictions, because he does not
trust the Democrats to abide by them.
</P>
<P>
   The latest indication that the national parties are the major
advertisers for Gore and Bush this year came in a study on
television spending on Wednesday by the Brennan Center for Justice
at New York University School of Law. The report showed that
between June 1 and Sept. 20, the two parties had spent more than
$52 million on commercials, while the Bush and Gore campaigns had
spent less than half that _ about $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   The study, produced jointly with Ken Goldstein, a political
science professor at the University of Wisconsin, found that the
trend was continuing to hold up this month, traditionally the time
when the candidates, flush with the proceeds from the federal funds
allotted them after the conventions, have taken over much of the
responsibility for running commercials
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, for example, Bob Dole's campaign ran 6,100 spots
and President Clinton's 3,600 spots the first full week after Labor
Day, the Brennan Center found. That same week, the Republican Party
ran just 147 commercials and the Democratic Party a mere one.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the parties have shown no sign of letting up
after Labor Day. Brennan Center researchers found that in the seven
days that ended Sept. 20, the two parties were still the biggest
spenders: The Republican Party spent nearly $2.3 million on
television during the week, or $300,000 more than the Bush
campaign. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, spent $1.8 million, or
about $800,000 more than the Gore campaign. Special interest groups
spent a total of about $1.1 million on both candidates across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's confirmed this week is that for the first time in
history, the political parties are dominating the ad wars in the
presidential campaign,'' said E. Joshua Rosenkranz, president of
the Brennan Center, a legal and research center that has developed
a specialty in campaign finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   The data also highlight the evolution over the years in the
roles of the Democratic and Republican national committees, which
once had little to do with the marketing of a nominee. ``Twenty
years ago, I don't know if the RNC and DNC were doing much more
than sponsoring brochures,'' said William Benoit, a professor of
communication at the University of Missouri who has studied 50
years of campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party disputed the Brennan Center's findings, but some
officials cautioned that the portrait of spending could change as
Election Day draws nearer, and the campaigns more aggressively
spend down the remainder of the $67 million in federal funds, or
hard money, each has been allocated for the fall campaign. The
Brennan Center study noted that the Bush campaign has spent $13
million on television since June 1, and the Gore campaign $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to have money in the bank at the end of this
campaign,'' a Republican official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a general acknowledgment on both sides that the
parties have become more active now in selling the candidates than
ever before, and have been elevated at the very least to a
partnership with the campaigns on advertising, the single costliest
aspect of a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The likely outcome in November, said another Republican campaign
official, is a kind of parity among the parties and campaigns, with
each of the four entities spending between $40 million and $50
million on advertising. That would still represent a heightened
participation this year by the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The competitiveness of the campaign may also be a factor in the
ratcheting up of party advertising. Joe Andrew, national chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, said the party initially had
no plans to continue running spots after the conventions, but the
strategy changed because the Republicans were advertising so
heavily at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose to run issue advertising after the convention and
we chose to defend our record and continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say they expect no respite, either. ``What we're
seeing here is a sustained effort by both the party and the
campaign, and it's unlikely that it will let up until the last
ballot is cast,'' said Clifford D. May, the communications director
for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say that the parties' intensifying roles have
not only further blurred the distinctions between the candidates
and the parties, but also between the kinds of commercials that
each makes. Political parties are barred from running commercials
that engage in electioneering, an activity that has been defined by
the courts as employing such explicit terms as ``vote for'' or
``defeat.'' They are instead supposed to run only ``issue ads,''
commercials intended for such activities as party-building.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctions were all but erased in the last presidential
campaign, when President Clinton's advisers devised a way of
running spots for his re-election early without depleting the
campaign's own money. Featuring Clinton _ but not those magic
words, ``vote for'' _ the strategists were able to pay for the
commercials with Democratic Party funds. The Republicans eventually
copied the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the practice was challenged by Common Cause, a group
that advocates campaign finance reform, no action was taken. In
1998, the Federal Election Commission rejected the recommendation
of its own auditors and general counsel that the Clinton and Dole
campaigns be forced to repay $25 million for what they concluded
was the illegal coordination of their advertising with their
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell West, a Brown University political scientist who
analyzes campaign commercials, said enforcement is so lax that the
parties are now essentially engaging in ``direct candidate
advocacy'' with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that soft money was designed for party building
and get-out- the-vote efforts,'' he said. ``Now we've ended up in a
situation where much of the ad money is being funneled through the
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   To some who have been monitoring the process, the blurring of
the lines only makes stronger the arguments of those who contend
the next president will be beholden to special interests. ``The two
major party presidential candidates made a deal with the public,
and the deal is we will accept an enormous amount of federal money
in return for the promise not to raise private money for our
campaigns,'' said Rosenkranz of the Brennan Center. ``That deal has
broken down.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, the Democratic chairman, said that his hope had been
that the party ``would be a full partner in the campaign.'' But he
added, ``It's not a positive development that we're spending so
much money to do that.''

 &HT;    Blacks may protest students' vote to repaint Rebel flag
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAPOOSA, Ga. _ Students at majority-white Haralson County
High School voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to restore a painted
Confederate flag to the outside of the gym in time for their
homecoming game Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a homecoming game.
</P>
<P>
   Some black athletes are talking of staging a boycott, according
to Superintendent Greg Hunt, who told school board members this
week that minority players were unhappy over the Rebel flag's role
in their school.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, black students in the marching band could join
the protest, said Anne Williams, whose middle school-age daughter,
Angelica Griffin, plays in the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the football players decide to boycott, then we will
support them,'' Williams said. ``To me, and to many other black
people, the flag represents bondage.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, vandals painted over the flag, which locals said
has been on the gym wall more than 30 years. The school's nickname
is the Rebels, and the mascot is a cartoon Confederate general.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was among parents called to the west Georgia school
Wednesday to help count ballots after the student body voted
whether to repaint the flag on the gym.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote, she said, was 861 students for restoring the
flag; 150 against; and 14 who wrote ``I don't care'' on their
ballots. The racial makeup of the school was about 93 percent white
and 6 percent black last spring, according to the state Department
of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she and other parents were surprised the all-white
school board allowed students to decide such a sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
   High schoolers, she said, are too young to appreciate the
negative connotations vested in Confederate symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really just thinking, `This is my school's mascot and
I don't want it to change,' '' Williams said. ``I'm sure if they
understood, the vote would have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   School board member Dianne Hamil said she thought the students
should be allowed to decide ``because it's the children's school.''
Board members said a countywide committee will be formed to study
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Anthony, 17, an 11th-grader, said he voted to restore the
flag. ``I'm not a racist or anything like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When results of the vote were announced, students broke out in
cheers, Joseph said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other students flew large Rebel flags from their vehicles
as they drove off campus Wednesday. Students also leaned from
windows of school buses, waving smaller flags and chanting,
``Rebels! Rebels!'' Some of the younger black children on the buses
chanted happily along with the others.

STATE AID TO UNINSURED CHILDREN HOLDS SURPRISES

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Alaska, health-care officials found that the best way to get
children enrolled in a federal health insurance program was to give
their parents information encased in an imitation caribou-skin tote
bag. Louisiana had a tireless advocate for the program, and made
things easy for parents by giving them stamped self-addressed
envelopes to return their applications.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, the Legislature forbade groups to try to enroll
people through the public schools, and the state has lagged behind
dozens of others in the number of children it has insured.
California is the among the worst states in enrollment _ a 27-page
application form was just one of many problems there.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Congress provided $4.2 billion to the states to
provide health insurance for the millions of children whose parents
were too poor to afford commercial plans but made too much to
qualify for Medicaid. But a majority of the states are now in
danger of forfeiting their shares of the federal money because they
have not been able to get their versions of the program, the
Children's Health Insurance Program, up and running.
</P>
<P>
   What separates those states that have managed to enroll children
into health insurance programs from those that did not defies logic
and, in many cases, the expectations of experts in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Geography did not dictate the outcome. Often states that failed
miserably adjoined states with highly successful programs. Nor did
the difference always prove to be related to partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   And while states that have fared best often share a few crucial
factors _ like a person or group obsessed with getting the plan
rolled out, or simpler application forms _ just as often it was an
odd legislative twist of fate that determined whether the program
was a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this just shows how weird policy can be,'' said Rhea
Williams-Bishop, a coordinator in the South for the Children's
Defense Fund. ``Putting it in place and implementing it are really
two different things, and one quirky event can really change the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in some 40 states that are in danger of losing federal
financing for the program said they were simply not able to find
enough children to enroll, or argued that when they tried to ferret
out children, they found many who were eligible for Medicaid and
enrolled them in that program instead. But it is also clear that
some states made a much more concerted effort early on.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska was never expected to be among such states. Experts did
not expect a rural state, with a large Native American population
and broad swaths of hard-to-travel land, to set any records in
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Alaska was among the top six states in signing
up uninsured children, according to figures from the Children's
Defense Fund, which has closely monitored enrollment. Like many
other states, Alaska chose to expand its Medicaid program with the
new federal money rather than to start a new program from scratch.
But it packaged it in a whole new way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create a program that didn't feel like
government,'' said Karen Pearson, the deputy director of the
division of public health in the state's health department.
</P>
<P>
   The program got a name that sounded like a private insurance
company _ Denali KidCare _ named after the mountain. The state
hired a marketing expert, rather than telling a totally
inexperienced state employee to create advertising, as many states
have done. The move resulted in a snappy advertising campaign that
was distributed where potential beneficiaries actually lived.
</P>
<P>
   Many new staff members were hired, in part to shave away at the
entrenched Medicaid culture _ one that discourages people from
signing up for benefits rather than recruiting them, Pearson said.
And the state quickly teamed up with the Alaska Native Tribal
Health Consortium, which runs Native American hospitals, to reach
out to those potential enrollees. Incentives were put together that
were ethnically specific, like the imitation caribou tote bags.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the state has enrolled 38,980 children, 20,000 above its
expectations. Sherry Gutierrez, who supports three children in
Fairbanks on about $1,800 a month, said she was thrilled with the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some years that I was eligible for public
assistance but I stayed away from getting it because it seemed like
a lot of the health-care professionals treated you badly,''
Gutierrez said. ``I didn't want my kids to feel that. With Denali,
they treat it much more like health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fairly rural state, with a large Indian population and
among the highest number of uninsured children, is Arizona, where
the insurance program has gone quite another way. The biggest
barrier there, pediatricians, advocates and government officials
agreed, were a few powerful state legislators who opposed the
program, calling it federal interference, in spite of strong
support from the governor and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the measure was killed in the Legislature, only to be
revived in a quick special session with one caveat that has kept
enrollment figures low: The state could not give contracts to
public schools to enroll students, one of the most successful
methods of recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had a chilling effect,'' said Frank Lopez, a spokesman
for the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. ``School
districts were hesitant to do anything in our outreach efforts.''
Efforts to overturn the ban have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think citizens around the state have tried to do enrollment,
and the state has made a reasonable effort to simplify the
process,'' said Carol Kamin, executive director of the Children's
Action Alliance of Arizona, an advocacy group. ``But the bottom
line is that in order to do outreach, you have got to go to where
the kids are _ and schools are, after all, where they are.''

   One of the most successful programs in the nation is in New

model for other states, and where the state often recruits in
schools.

her three children for school, and saw the Children's Aid Society
handing out fliers. She had already been through three efforts to
wind her way through the Medicaid application procedure. ``I came
home and told my mother I couldn't believe they gave my children
insurance, because it was too easy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, state Sen. Russell Bowers, a major proponent of the
ban on school outreach, defended his position, saying: ``I feel
schools are for education. I am not interested in contracting for
health care in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, a Republican, acknowledged that his position was hugely
unpopular, even in his own district, but he said, ``If the whole
state wanted to do something and I felt it was wrong, I still would
vote no.''
</P>
<P>
   To generate opposition, someone sent fliers around the state
insisting that federal health insurance for children would require
that sixth-grade girls have pelvic examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Those same fliers were also distributed throughout Texas, where
a few opponents of the program in the Legislature also slowed the
program's start. The number of uninsured children in Texas is among
the nation's highest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tough fight trying to get a good plan,'' said Carl
Rush, chief operating officer of Family Health Foundation in San
Antonio. ``There are elements who think this is the thin edge of
the wedge of socialized medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not help matters that the Texas Legislature meets once
every two years and had just adjourned in 1997 after Congress
passed the measure. Other states had similar calendar problems.
</P>
<P>
   States that turned over much of the enrollment process to
community-based groups also tended to do best.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, California and some other states were dogged by fears
among legal immigrants that their status would be challenged if
they accepted a public program. This was especially true in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the little things added up. Consider Mississippi and
Louisiana. In Mississippi, one of the worst-ranked states, there
was no single person in charge of recruitment. Five separate
government entities have their hands in the program, with no formal
coordination among them. Birth certificates are required with every
application, and applicants are responsible for their own return
postage.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana had one person who coordinated the work from the
beginning, did not require the birth certificates and covered the
postage, said Williams-Bishop. ``One little thing like that can
really be a barrier,'' she said.

DEFENSE IN LOCKERBIE TRIAL UNDERMINES A KEY WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands _ In an atmosphere so hostile that the
witness' fear could be heard even in the voices of his translators,
the testimony of the most important witness in the Lockerbie trial
was systematically torn to pieces by defense lawyers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two defense lawyers spent the day battering every important
point made on Tuesday by Abdul Majid Giaka, a Libyan double agent
who has been in a U.S. federal witness protection program for the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka's tentative performance Wednesday, coupled with his
failure on Tuesday to link the two defendants firmly to the bomb,
seemed to seriously undermine his usefulness to the prosecution and
its effort to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the two Libyans
on trial, Abdel Baset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, blew
up Pan Am 103 in 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the defense lawyers called Giaka a liar at least 30
times, and only once the whole day did a prosecutor rise to object.
</P>
<P>
   To question after question, Giaka flailed for a response and
often was reduced to answering: ``I do not remember,'' ``I am not
lying,'' ``These things were many years ago,'' ``I did not see what
the CIA wrote,'' or ``Maybe I said it, or maybe I forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from CIA cables describing its many interviews with
Giaka from 1988 to 1991, William Taylor, a defense lawyer, raised
serious doubts whether Giaka had ever seen the defendants carrying
a brown Samsonite suitcase through the Malta airport, that they
ever stored 25 pounds of TNT in a desk, that Giaka had ever
prepared a report for Libyan intelligence on how to slip an
unaccompanied suitcase onto a plane, or that one of the defendants
had ever referred to that report and warned him, ``Don't rush
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor elicited a pattern: Each time the CIA, which was paying
Giaka $1,000 a month, threatened to cut him off as a worthless
informant, he argued, Giaka would come up with a new bit of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's questions also implied a darker subtext and became, in
effect, a scathing indictment of the behavior of the CIA and FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA emerged as an agency that knew Giaka was a worthless
informant but deliberately unloaded him on FBI investigators trying
to crack the Lockerbie case by advising Giaka that he could realize
his dream of getting to America if the Justice Department accepted
him as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   It then concealed, from 1988 until just last month, under the
claim of national security, cables that made clear just how grave
its doubts were about Giaka's veracity.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecution fails, questions will no doubt be raised
about the $200 million spent arranging this special trial in the
Netherlands, as well as about the decade of international sanctions
that Libya claims cost it $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the FBI has protected Giaka, who is now a U.S.
citizen, for a decade despite his CIA record and the extravagant
claims he made before a grand jury in Washington in October 1991,
such as that he was a relative of former King Idris of Libya, and
that the presidents of Malta and Libya were secretly part of a
Masonic plot.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution is expected to call some of Giaka's former
low-level CIA handlers as part of its case. Oddly, neither the head
of the FBI's Lockerbie investigation nor the CIA's are on the
witness list.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The CIA cables read out by Taylor Wednesday showed a slow
progress from excitement in 1988 about Giaka's potential as a
double agent to barely concealed disgust for him by 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor repeatedly referred to the cables as ``concealed from the
defense until the trial started'' or ``obscured until recently.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1991, the CIA was describing Giaka as ``a shattered person''
who ``does not want to be part of the security apparatus and is
certainly milking any of his contacts, including us, for whatever
he can get.''
</P>
<P>
   By then his handlers knew that he had never been an important
member of Libyan intelligence, and his procrastination about
penetrating it was ``testing his case officer's patience.'' He had
been taken off the payroll but was still getting some cash. He had
even ``wondered aloud if it would be possible to get $2,000 to buy
bananas for his return to Libya, where they sell for 2 to 3 times
the Maltese price.'' He had ``burned all his bridges,'' his wife
was pregnant, and he was afraid of assassination.
</P>
<P>
   The most damning element concerned the bomb-loaded suitcase.
From 1988 to mid-1991, Taylor said, while giving the CIA many
details of minor Libyan intelligence activities, Giaka had never
mentioned seeing the two defendants with a brown Samsonite suitcase
_ the same kind that contained the Lockerbie bomb and the kind that
he testified on Tuesday the defendants had carried through the
Malta airport on Dec. 7, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   After his case officers, eager to get rid of him, explained how
important his shipboard meeting with the FBI would be, ``this
deafening silence on the subject ends the very next day, when you
come up with a brown Samsonite suitcase and this rubbish about
Customs,'' Taylor said snidely. ``What do you have to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Giaka answered weakly that the Justice Department had very good
investigators. In one of the day's more theatrical touches, Taylor
suggested the court break for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, cross-examination was taken over by Richard
Keen, lawyer for Fhimah.
</P>
<P>
   His questions were simpler: What made you tell an American grand
jury that the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, his foreign
minister and the president of Malta were all Masons and part of a
Masonic conspiracy? Why did you claim you were a relative of King
Idris? When you approached the CIA, did you lie about your career
to make them think you were more important than you were?
</P>
<P>
   Giaka refused to answer about Gadhafi and claimed he had said
nothing about a Masonic conspiracy. He denied being related to King
Idris or ever claiming to be, and blamed a translator. He denied
inflating his importance, or concealing the fact that he started at
the Libyan intelligence service as an auto mechanic. He conceded
that he had claimed friendship with important Libyans he barely
knew, but would not concede that this amounted to lying.
</P>
<P>
   Keen accused Giaka of embellishing his stories as late as
Tuesday. His suggestion that Fhimah had been involved in a sexual
harassment complaint was absent from his first descriptions of the
incident 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like Taylor, Keen was soon ending each line of questioning with:
``That's a complete lie,'' or ``Either now you're lying or you lied
before. Which is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Keen, too, capped his questioning with a flourish. He asked
Giaka if he remembered going through Gatwick, the London airport.
Getting an affirmative response, he ended with the question: ``Do
you remember trying to sell yourself to British intelligence?''
</P>
<P>
   As Giaka spluttered, ``What do you mean?'' Keen said he had no
more questions, and the court adjourned for the day.

<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Even in their worst moments, Brazilians
had their prowess in soccer to sustain them, as celebrated in four
World Cups. But the passion has suddenly become a sorry symbol,
with the coach of the World Cup team accused of corruption and
several star players under investigation for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the nation is suffering a crisis of identity and
its team is in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   After having lost only one qualifying match in the entire
70-year history of the World Cup, the Brazilian squad has lost to
Paraguay 2-1 and to Chile 3-0 and tied with Colombia and Uruguay,
results regarded here as shameful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we sunk to the point of being humiliated by Paraguayans
and Chileans?'' the columnist Arthur Dapieve asked recently in the
daily O Globo.
</P>
<P>
   The defeats have ``revived our national inferiority complex,''
he added, since soccer and music are the two reasons ``for us
Brazilians to be proud and look down on the rest of humanity from
above.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trials of the playing field are hardly the only reason
that Brazilians are calling for the head of Wanderley Luxemburgo da
Silva, coach of the national team. His former secretary, Renata
Moura Alves, says that Luxemburgo was involved in a series of
illegal schemes, from clandestine payments from the sale of player
contracts to money laundering and the purchase of apartments,
paintings and luxury automobiles through dummy companies to avoid
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal tax authorities say that they are hot on Luxemburgo's
trail and that he may owe as much as $1 million in back taxes and
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Luxemburgo himself has said ``the problem is being resolved''
and has vowed that ``the course of the case will not affect the
exercise of my profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of all this on the national psyche is hard to
overestimate. As the newsmagazine Epoca noted recently, ``Here in
the land of soccer, the post of coach of the national team can be
just as prestigious as that of president of the republic.''
</P>
<P>
   During the most repressive period of the 21-year dictatorship
that ended in 1985, the coach at the time, Joao Saldanha, was one
of the few people who dared publicly to defy the military. Before
the 1970 World Cup, when Gen. Emilio Medici pressed Saldanha to
choose certain players that were favorites of his, the coach
replied, ``I promise not to tell him how to run the country if he
promises not to tell me how to run the team.''
</P>
<P>
   In Luxemburgo's case, even his age is now in doubt. He says he
is 45, but documents recently uncovered by news organizations here
show his real age to be 48. The age differential is important
because it indicates that as a young man Luxemburgo was still
playing youth-level soccer when he should have been playing as an
adult. That is a violation of both Brazilian and international
rules because it is unfair competition and if detected can result
in fines or suspension of a player or an entire team.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Police have said they want to question Luxemburgo
about possible perjury on his return from Sydney, where he was
coaching an Olympic squad that is younger and less experienced than
the World Cup team. Brazil's Olympic team was eliminated on Sept.
23 after upset losses to South Africa, 3-1, and to Cameroon, 2-1 in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   For the average fan, the most serious of the accusations is that
Luxemburgo may have named some players to the national team in
return for payments from their agents. Because of the prestige of
being on the squad, the market value of such players would soar,
and they would be able to command higher transfer fees when later
sold to European teams, with a percentage of the money allegedly
going to Luxemburgo.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Brazilian Soccer Federation, Ricardo
Teixeira, has said that action will be taken against Luxemburgo
only if it can be proved he was involved in the purchase and sale
of players.
</P>
<P>
   But some commentators maintain there is only one plausible
explanation for some of the quirky player choices he has made. One
cartoon shows Luxemburgo with those questionable picks and has him
asking, ``You didn't think I was doing this for free, did you?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Eurico Miranda, a director of the Vasco da Gama soccer team
here, noted recently: ``Evanilson was a name that nobody even knew
how to pronounce. Nonetheless, he was picked for the national team
and soon afterward was sold to a German team'' for a reported $7
million.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Luxemburgo has said that all the accusations against him not
related to the tax case are false and are intended to get him
fired. Before heading off for the Olympics, where Brazil has never
won the gold medal in soccer, he appeared on a popular television
program to plead with the public to ``let me do my job'' and to
proclaim his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this is all over, they're going to say it was all a lot
of nonsense, and it will be understood that nobody proved anything
against me because there was nothing to be proved,'' he said.
``They're treating me like I'm a crook, but I'm not a crook.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Luxemburgo has also been fighting with some of the team's
most popular players, including the star striker Romario, hero of
Brazil's 1994 World Cup victory and now in line to become the
second leading scorer in team history, after Pele.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are no good need no help in destroying themselves,''
Romario said recently after the coach left him off the Olympic
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Romario himself, along with Ronaldinho, Roberto Carlos and
at least four other members of the World Cup team, is also being
investigated for possible tax evasion, federal authorities have
said. That is a surprising new attitude, the humorist Luis Fernando
Verissimo wrote recently, in a country where soccer and those who
play it have long enjoyed ``a sweet irresponsibility, without
obligations and without punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Brazilian team won the 1994 World Cup in the United
States, for example, players, coaches and executives brought back
several tons of household and electronic appliances, computers and
other luxury goods. When they landed and customs officials demanded
they pay duty, they threatened to boycott the official
celebrations, and top government officials were forced to intervene
to get the customs department to relent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is healthy, therefore, that the soccer business is finally
being seriously investigated and that adult behavior is being
demanded,'' Verissimo wrote. For too long, he added, players and
management alike ``have counted on the tender tolerance given to
children playing at being grown-ups.''

RIVAL SAYS MILOSEVIC HAS LITTLE TIME TO ACCEPT DEFEAT

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Buoyed by an enormous demonstration of
more than 200,000 of his supporters, who filled downtown Belgrade
on Wednesday night to celebrate his apparent victory as Yugoslav
president, Vojislav Kostunica said Slobodan Milosevic had only a
short time left to recognize the will of the Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is now no way out for him,'' Kostunica said in
an interview, as the crowds gathered. ``This is a situation that
cannot last long.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica has rejected the idea of running against Milosevic in
a second round, set for Oct. 8, saying preliminary official figures
showing him with less than 50 percent of the vote are fraudulent.
((Early on Thursday, the Federal Election Commission ruled that a
runoff on Oct. 8 was needed because neither candidate won 50
percent.))
</P>
<P>
   ``People know I won these elections,'' Kostunica said in the
interview. ``Why should I accept Milosevic's offer of a second
round? People won't understand it and will feel that I'm betraying
them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, to the massed and happy crowd, shouting and
swaying under a clear night filled with stars, Kostunica said: ``We
tell them from this place that there is no second round. There is
no market in votes.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned Milosevic that he had ``less than 24 hours'' to
recognize the real results of the elections, because the Federal
Election Commission must issue its final findings by Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been silent since the vote on Sunday, making no
appearances of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the crowd _ one of the largest in memory here _ was
a message to Milosevic, too, backed by other large rallies in towns
like Novi Sad, where 35,000 gathered, and Nis, with 25,000. In
addition, 15,000 rallied in Kragujevac and 10,000 in Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments were also passing the word to Milosevic that
his options were fast running out, senior Western officials said in
telephone interviews on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They told Milosevic through his intermediaries that he had a few
days to renounce power and leave the country without difficulty, to
settle where he would, but that if he delayed, he could face arrest
and a trial in The Hague on war crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``His choice is to fight or make a graceful exit,'' a senior
Western official said. ``His only hope of avoiding The Hague is to
say, publicly and irrevocably, that he's leaving, and to go on his
own resources somewhere.'' If he were to leave, Russia and Belarus
appear to be possible destinations.
</P>
<P>
   No Western country would publicly bless an arrangement like
this, the officials stressed, given Milosevic's indictment by the
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, a creation of the U.N. Security
Council. ``But there are enough people indicating, to the extent
he's listening, that he has a little time to make a dignified exit
without interference,'' another senior Western official said. ``We
want him to hear it loud and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The representatives of a number of Western nations left Belgrade
before the NATO bombing began last spring, and from a distance have
been lobbying the Serbs to overturn Milosevic, with offers to end
economic sanctions and provide aid.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Kostunica said Milosevic could cling to power
now only through repression. ``Politically he has no future, and
I'm not sure he can count on repression, either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the situation is becoming clear to them, and we see
the panic that they feel,'' he said. ``It's why I say there will be
no revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way to help Milosevic to the correct decision,
Kostunica said, is ``by being very firm and sending a message to
the people around him, who are already afraid, that there will be
no revanchism and no revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Kostunica told the crowd that he was sure of
his victory, given their strength, and he had a message for the
army and the police, who did not interfere on Wednesday night.
``Our message to the army and the police is that we are one,'' he
said. ``The army and the police are part of the people; they exist
to protect the people, not one man and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd shouted, ``He's finished!'' about Milosevic,
Kostunica asked, ``Why would our army, which was so courageous last
year against NATO, be afraid now of one man?''
</P>
<P>
   People in the crowd were happy but slightly unsure that
Milosevic was beaten. There was a sense of self-discovery and
suspense, caught in an historical tide that had not yet reached its
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's finished, because of the people here,'' said
Ivana Petrov, a 25-year-old medical student. ``We hope he'll go.
But he won't go so easily. Things here can't change that fast, even
if he does go.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandar, a middle-aged man who would not give his surname,
said the atmosphere was fantastic. ``But you never know what the
authorities here can do,'' he said. ``We've had big rallies in
Belgrade before.'' But then he brightened. ``Now, though,'' he
said, ``all of Serbia is like this.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife broke in, saying, ``I think he's finished, and we are
very, very happy.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were small signs on Wednesday that the government's
attitudes might be shifting. In the state-run newspaper Politika,
there was an article by the state-run news agency, Tanjug, that
reported fairly and accurately about the news conferences of the
democratic opposition, in which Kostunica supporters cited their
own polling evidence that he had won an outright victory in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, state television ran a straight report of a
news conference by the opposition leader Zoran Djindjic, although
it came after the airing of an interview with Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic, who blamed the international media and NATO
propaganda for deluding the voters.
</P>
<P>
   For Milosevic, calling the elections proved to be a blunder; his
term extended to next July, but he called the elections early,
apparently hoping to cement and extent his hold.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, the army chief of staff who supports
Milosevic, gave an interview in which he said the army would stay
out of politics. He said that Milosevic ``will never order the army
to intervene against the people'' and that the army would ``respect
the choice'' of Yugoslavs in presidential elections.

DEFENSE LAWYER THREATENED `SLOW DEATH MARCH' IN LEE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal prosecutor in the Wen Ho Lee case told a
Senate subcommittee Wednesday that a defense lawyer's threat to
turn a trial into a ``long, slow death march'' that would force the
government to reveal highly classified nuclear weapons data made
the government more willing to reach a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said prosecutors should not have
been worried by combative remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had told me they were going to put me on a long,
slow death march, I would have told them, `Let's start walking,'''
said Specter, a former prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law known as the Classified Information Procedures Act,
or CIPA, defense lawyers are allowed to try to persuade a judge
that a defendant must divulge secrets to obtain a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a private meeting that we had in late May,'' the
prosecutor, Norman C. Bay, the U.S. attorney in Albuquerque, N.M.,
said of the discussion with an unidentified defense lawyer. ``He
said, `My guy is not going to take any charge in the indictment,
and if you don't like that, I'm going to put you on a long, slow
death march under CIPA.'''
</P>
<P>
   The fear of exposing nuclear secrets at a trial was cited by the
director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, as a critical factor that led the
government to settle the case. In a plea bargain reached on Sept.
13, Lee pleaded guilty to a single count of the 59-count indictment
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers have insisted that they were not threatening the
government but were simply insisting on the public airing of
evidence that, they said, would exonerate Lee at a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing came one day
after Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno testified about the Lee
case at another Senate hearing, the beginning of what is expected
to be a lengthy congressional review of the investigation and the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the hearings have not settled the complaints about the
government's conduct, nor have they silenced specific criticisms of
the prosecutors' actions, including their insistence on keeping Lee
behind bars for 278 days before he was released.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has urged Reno to appoint a
special counsel to review the Lee case. The Justice Department and
the FBI have opened internal inquiries into the case, led by their
separate in-house ethics units.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer has said that an outside investigation would be
preferable as ``the surest route to a creditable and complete
analysis of the troubling questions the public legitimately has
with the way the Department and the FBI conducted the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's supporters have also expressed support for an independent
inquiry. Cecilia Chang, the founder of WenHoLee.org, an online
organization ``advocating justice'' for Lee, said Wednesday that
Reno and Freeh, in their testimony on Tuesday, had failed to
justify their actions in the case and presented ``tattered reasons
to justify this politically motivated witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter pressed the witnesses on whether the government could
have obtained a cooperation agreement with Lee much earlier.
Specter cited complaints expressed by the judge in the case, James
A. Parker, who said that the prosecutors failed to engage in early
settlement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bay said prosecutors had sought Lee's cooperation. He quoted
from an Aug. 4, 1999, letter written by John J. Kelly, the former
U.S. attorney, to Lee's lawyer, saying, ``I assure you that I have
absolutely no desire to prosecute an innocent man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have used what tools prosecutors have to try to gather all
the facts,'' Kelly said in his letter. ``Those facts establish your
client's guilt. If additional facts that only he can provide would
explain his actions and point to his innocence, I would sincerely
like to know that before embarking on a course of action that will
have a profound impact on many people. Once again, I extend to you
the invitation to have your client tell his side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers were highly critical of the government's
determination to keep Lee in jail as he awaited trial. He was
confined in a county jail in Albuquerque under solitary conditions
like those imposed on maximum security prisoners. At times, Lee was
manacled with wrist, waist and ankle chains, and a light was always
on in his cell.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Freeh have said that they were unaware of the harsh
conditions, and on Wednesday their aides said that neither Lee nor
his lawyers complained during his confinement. In recent days,
Lee's lawyers have criticized the ``egregious pretrial conditions
imposed on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay provided a letter from Raymond Sisneros, the sheriff of
Santa Fe County, N.M., to Samuel Montoya, the county manager,
describing a visit Sisneros made to Lee's cell in March for the
purpose of asking about Lee's confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than being incarcerated he had no complaints,'' the
March 10 letter said, adding that ``his only request was for
additional fruit at the evening meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay also said that the light in Lee's cell that remained
switched on during the night was not a bright light. ``I'm told
that the light was a dull blue light,'' Bay said, ``kind of like a
night light, in Dr. Lee's room and that the jail would use that
just to make sure that if someone walked by and looked inside his
cell that they could make sure that he was there and that he was
doing OK.''

SUMMIT BANCORP SAID TO DISCUSS ACQUISITION BY FLEETBOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By RIVA D. ATLAS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summit Bancorp, the largest bank in New Jersey, is in talks to
be acquired by FleetBoston Financial Corp., executives close to the
discussions said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The executives would not disclose the terms of the deal, but
analysts estimated the bank could be sold for $7 billion, or $40 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Summit, which is based in Princeton, rose $3.56
Wednesday, to $34.31, and are up 25 percent this week on
speculation of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Summit, with just $39 billion in assets and more than 500
branches, would be a small bite for Fleet, which has assets of $181
billion. But the deal could help Fleet increase its market share in
the New York area, a goal of Fleet's chief executive, Terrence
Murray. Summit controls 15.6 percent of New Jersey's deposits, more
than double the share of Fleet, which has had a presence in the
state since it bought NatWest Bancorp in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both sides declined to comment, although the Fleet
spokesman noted that the company was no longer distracted by its
$13 billion merger a year ago with BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger is complete,'' said James Mahoney, the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In another deal pending in the New York area, Fleet has agreed
to invest $250 million should North Fork Bancorp succeed in its $2
billion hostile bid for Dime Bancorp. In return, North Fork, which
is scheduled to decide Thursday whether to proceed with its
takeover bid, has promised to sell 17 Dime branches to Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years people have been talking about Fleet and Summit,''
said Lawrence Cohn, an analyst with Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. ``Fleet is at
a size in this market where either they need to get bigger or get
out.'' With one-third of Summit's branches in the suburbs of New
York City, Fleet could market to an affluent customer base products
sold by its subsidiaries, the high-technology investment banking
firm Robertson Stephens and the discount broker Quick &AMP; Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Summit has been seen as a takeover target since at least 1992,
when a predecessor company was the target of a proxy fight by
Chilmark Capital, a money management firm in Saddle River, N.J.,
which owned 10 percent of the stock. At the time, it was the
largest bank holding company to fend off a proxy fight, a Summit
spokeswoman said. Eight years later, the pool of potential
acquirers has narrowed considerably, noted Neil Weisman, president
of Chilmark, who sold his stock soon after his proxy battle failed.
``Fleet is the logical choice,'' Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   The investment bank Merrill Lynch has been trying to drum up
interest from other potential buyers, executives close to the deal
said, but the list of banks whose stock price is strong enough to
afford the deal and with a presence in the New York area is fairly
small. First Union Corp., which was said to be interested when
Weisman was lobbying for Summit's sale, would most likely have
antitrust problems if it tried to acquire Summit. In the late
1990s, First Union greatly expanded its presence in the area with
the acquisition of CoreStates Financial Corp. and First Fidelity
Bancorp, Cohn said.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to clients Wednesday, Judah Kraushaar, a Merrill Lynch
analyst, said, ``The main issue for Fleet in judging potential
investor reaction will be whether a deal with Summit waters down
Fleet's efforts to move away from traditional banking and towards
higher valuation businesses'' like investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has already said it is evaluating a partial spinoff of
Robertson. So far, investors do not seem too concerned: Fleet's
shares closed at $39, up 31 cents. A spokesman for Merrill declined
to comment on the firm's role in the deal; Kraushaar did not return
calls. &QL;

REPORT ATTACKS GOVERNMENT POLICY ON AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying that more effective AIDS prevention could
avert thousands of new infections each year in the United States,
the nation's leading science organization sharply criticized the
Clinton administration Wednesday for what it said was a failure to
develop a comprehensive and effective plan to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a definite lack of federal leadership with regard to
HIV prevention,'' and ``there is no time to lose,'' the
organization, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of
Sciences, said in a strongly worded report that called for a new
national strategy in combating HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The report called on the government to improve its tracking of
new HIV infections to help communities better implement appropriate
prevention services, develop better sex education programs, deliver
more public health messages to overcome complacency about the
seriousness of the epidemic, and provide more money for
needle-exchange and treatment programs for drug users.
</P>
<P>
   It also called on health insurance organizations to pay for the
time it takes for doctors to deliver prevention messages as part of
clinical care.
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state and local laws and policies that hinder proven
prevention strategies should be abolished, the report said. It said
the government spends $250 million over five years for sex
education programs that emphasize only abstinence, without any
evidence that such efforts are effective in preventing HIV
infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet comprehensive sex education and condom availability, which
have been shown to reduce the risk of HIV and other sexually
transmitted diseases without promoting sexual activity, are not
always supported,'' said Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, the provost of
Harvard University and co-chairman of the committee that wrote the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The report also urged the government to revise the way it spends
the $775 million for prevention each year and to adopt a specific
plan to sharply reduce the estimated 40,000 new cases a year, a
figure that has been stable since 1992. The figure contrasts with
the 160,000 new infections that occurred at the peak of the
epidemic in the United States in the mid-1980s, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is outrageous that the rates of new HIV infections in the
United States have stayed consistently at 40,000 a year,'' Ronald
Johnson, the associate executive director of the Gay Men's Health
Crisis of New York City, said.
</P>
<P>
   Fineberg, who is an expert in public health, said that
``thousands of new HIV infections could be avoided each year if we
gave greater emphasis to prevention and were smarter in the way we
spent our prevention dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   While the goal may seem obvious, ``many current HIV prevention
efforts do not operate with this objective in mind,'' Fineberg said
at a news conference at the institute's headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra L. Thurman, who directs the White House Office on
National AIDS Policy, said in an interview that ``the report is
important because it gives us a yardstick to measure our progress
and to take a hard look at our current investments at CDC.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look at the criticism and take it very seriously,''
Thurman said. ``We have a fluid epidemic, and there is a sense of
urgency particularly among minority and other communities hardest
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that women, young people and members of
minorities now accounted for a growing proportion of new AIDS
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The report renewed calls to increase financing so that more drug
abusers could be enrolled in treatment and needle-exchange
programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the federal
agency in Atlanta responsible for tracking the AIDS epidemic,
commissioned the study and asked the committee to come up with a
framework for HIV prevention. Responding to the report, Dr. Helene
Gayle, the director of the AIDS program at the centers, said her
agency was in general agreement with the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gayle said, the agency has issued a draft of its
plan that aims to reduce by half the annual incidence of new HIV
infections by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that ``there must be a strong, clear leadership
structure in the Department of Health and Human Services.''
</P>
<P>
   Because many agencies share responsibility for federal HIV
prevention activities, the agencies compete for resources and
public attention and ``there is no explicit strategy that currently
guides the overall investment of federal HIV prevention funds,''
the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of financing should be preventing the greatest number
of infections for a given amount of money, the report said, adding
that the government ``should be held accountable'' for such
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The report urged wider application of a testing method that CDC
has developed that tells more accurately than current tests when a
person was infected, allowing public health officials to determine
where the epidemic is heading.
</P>
<P>
   The report said it would be more cost-effective to spend money
on needle-exchange programs and preventing infections among
newborns than on developing tests to screen for tainted blood,
which can be very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that testing and treating pregnant women cost
about $32,000 for each infection prevented and that needle-exchange
programs cost $3,000 to $50,000 for each infection prevented but
that screening blood for transfusions cost $7.5 million for each
infection averted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to reconcile a difference of such magnitude,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward H. Kaplan, a professor at the Yale School of
Management, said that the report, which he co-wrote, should be
regarded as a blueprint for the next White House administration.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gov. George W. Bush concluded three days of
education events Wednesday with a visit to a parochial school in
this city's heavily Hispanic South-Central section, talking about
reading, character education and discipline. But there was one
issue Bush did not so much as mention: school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   That Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, would avoid
discussing at a Catholic school a policy that many Catholic parents
staunchly support _ and that he has endorsed _ spoke volumes about
the way he has been campaigning on the education issue this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush's aides distributed a 16-page pamphlet on his
education agenda that does not use the words school vouchers. On
Tuesday afternoon, when asked if he supported vouchers, Bush
sidestepped the issue by saying the decision should be left to
state and local officials. And on Tuesday evening, when Larry King
asked him on his CNN program whether he thought vouchers worked,
Bush replied, ``I'm not positive.''
</P>
<P>
   From his extraordinarily careful handling of the issue, one
might conclude that Bush harbored deep reservations about vouchers.
But in fact, a voucherlike proposal is an integral part of his plan
to push public schools to be more accountable for student
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal, the federal government could take aid away
from chronically failing schools and give it directly to low-income
parents. The parents could use the money _ $1,500 per student _ for
a variety of educational purposes, including private school
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   That is the widely accepted definition of a voucher, yet Bush
declines to use the word, suggesting that he considers it loaded
with bad connotations. Instead, he and his running mate, Dick
Cheney, emphasize the concept of choice. Their plan, they say,
would provide poor children trapped in bad schools a range of
options normally available only to the more affluent, such as
hiring tutors, transferring to other public schools or attending
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``A voucher connotes that you want everybody to take the money
and flee into the private world,'' said B. Alexander Kress, an
education adviser to Bush. ``I think the governor is of the notion
that the problems will be fixed by the public schools. But if they
aren't, then there are these other options.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
nominee, contend that Bush is running away from a contentious
policy that they say is widely opposed by the moderate swing
voters, particularly women, he is assiduously courting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``realizes most Americans don't agree with vouchers,''
asserted Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign. ``That's
why they don't use the word vouchers for what is a voucher plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, many polls suggest that the public is divided on the
matter. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in July showed
that 47 percent of voters supported the concept of
taxpayer-financed vouchers, while 46 percent opposed it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore strongly opposes taxpayer-financed vouchers, arguing that
they drain public aid away from the schools that need it most. That
is also the position of the powerful teachers unions that are
expected to provide important support in getting out the Democratic
vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed more broadly, Bush's approach to vouchers is similar to
his handling of a number of contentious conservative policies. Bush
has won support from groups like the National Rifle Association and
the National Right to Life Committee by opposing most forms of gun
control and by vowing to sign legislation outlawing the procedure
known by opponents as partial-birth abortion. Yet he rarely
discusses those views on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   During a week in which Bush focused on education, hammering at
Gore's policies and warning of an ``education recession,'' his
avoidance of the word, or even the concept, of vouchers was often
striking.
</P>
<P>
   The pamphlet his campaign issued on Monday, titled ``Ending the
Education Recession,'' says that Bush of Texas would give parents
``real options _ like tutoring or the ability to transfer to
another school,'' avoiding any mention that the money could be used
for private or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   At a public high school in Redwood City on Tuesday, a student
asked Bush how he felt about vouchers. Bush never acknowledged that
he supported the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state of California wants to do that, it's up to the
state of California,'' he said. ``I believe in local control of
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney offered a similar answer to voters in a visit to Michigan
on Tuesday. Michigan and California have hotly contested ballot
initiatives this year calling for the creation of voucher systems.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Tuesday, during his interview on ``Larry King Live,''
Bush said, ``I'm not positive vouchers work.'' But, he continued,
``I think we ought to try them.''

SUSPECT IN STABBING OF CELTIC PIERCE IN CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR AND STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One of three suspects in the nightclub attack on
Celtics star Paul Pierce was taken into custody Wednesday night
just hours after police publicly identified three men wanted for
the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hurston, who allegedly bashed Pierce in the head with a
bottle as the Celtic played pool in a Theater District nightclub
early Monday, was met at Logan International Airport when he
returned voluntarily from New York to face a charge of assault and
battery with a dangerous weapon, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for Hurston, 31, of the city's Dorchester section,
told reporters his client is too short to have reached Pierce's
head, even with a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, John Swomley, who also represents the rap group Made
Men, said Hurston is a lifelong friend of Made Men member Raymond
``Ray Dog'' Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Made Men ``are disheartened Mr. Hurston has been sucked into
this,'' Swomley told reporters outside the Area A police station.
``They are as confident as I he had nothing to do with the assault
on Mr. Pierce.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other men are still being sought with warrants for assault
with a knife, William Ragland, 28, of the city's Roxbury section,
and Trevor Watson, 34, of Boston, indicating that both allegedly
took part in the knifing that left Pierce with multiple wounds
moments after he walked into the Buzz Club/Europa for a party early
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Superintendent Margaret O'Malley, of the department's
Bureau of Investigative Services, said she believed the three men _
all of whom O'Malley said are known to police in Boston and in the
region _ may have fled the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three individuals may be dangerous,'' O'Malley said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Police denied that they were actively seeking to question
Michael McNeill, as reported in the Globe Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McNeill, who has ties to Made Men, may have been at the club
during the stabbing, a police source said, but he is not believed
to be a primary witness, and police are not actively seeking to
interrogate him.
</P>
<P>
   Based on information provided to the Globe from a separate
police source, the Globe reported Wednesday that investigators
wanted to question McNeill in connection with the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley made no reference to McNeill at the press conference.
Efforts to reach McNeill have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley would not comment on the motive for Pierce stabbing, or
whether any of the suspects had ties to Made Men.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the stabbing, Made Men members Raymond ``Ray
Dog'' Scott and Marco Ennis acknowledged being at the club at the
same time as Pierce. But they adamantly denied any involvement in
the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley said eyewitness descriptions and cooperation from the
public helped police identify the three suspects named Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Trevor Watson was with Scott at suburban South Shore
Plaza in June 1999 when two Braintree police officers stopped and
questioned them after a Macy's sales clerk suspected them of using
a stolen credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The card in fact belonged to Scott, who filed criminal charges
against the officers who arrested him. The officers were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Watson received a 20-year suspended sentence for a 1986 armed
robbery. In 1995 he was convicted as a felon in possession of a
firearm and served a five-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The second man charged in the Pierce stabbing, Ragland, has 16
convictions spanning eight years, including robbery and three
separate assault convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Hurston, who is charged with attacking Pierce with a bottle, has
no known criminal history. But the Dorchester man was the victim of
a crime in 1990, when he was shot in front of a lounge after an
argument with another man in the early morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley would not comment on whether Pierce knew the suspects
or if he had been able to identify them through photographs.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend of Pierce who was with him at the time of the
stabbing, Derrick Battie, insisted Tuesday that neither Pierce nor
the two friends who were with him knew the stabbers.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics coach Rick Pitino said Wednesday Pierce had just arrived
at the club when a fight began and his attackers began stabbing
him. ``He was only at the club 10 minutes,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Pierce could be released from New England Medical
Center in the next day or two.

GLOBAL MONITORING FIRM OVERLOOKS WORKPLACE PROBLEMS, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a rare inside look at the auditing firms that inspect
overseas factories to see whether they are sweatshops, an MIT
professor contends that the world's largest factory-monitoring firm
does a shoddy job and overlooks many safety and wage violations.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Dr. Dara O'Rourke, said in a report to be issued
Thursday that inspectors from the firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, had
a pro-management bias, did not uncover the use of carcinogenic
chemicals and failed to recognize that some employees were forced
to work 80-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the firm overlooked other basic problems, including
timecards that were falsified and machines that were missing safety
guards to protect workers' fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``PwC's monitoring efforts are significantly flawed,'' said
O'Rourke, a professor of environmental and labor policy at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``PwC's audit reports
glossed over problems of freedom of association and collective
bargaining, overlooked serious violations of health and safety
standards, and failed to report common problems in wages and
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Pricewaterhouse officials defended their monitoring, saying
their inspectors often uncover violations of minimum wage, overtime
and safety laws. But these officials acknowledged that the firm's
inspectors occasionally missed things that an expert on industrial
hygiene, like O'Rourke, would uncover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do very good work in this field, and we're
contributing to improving conditions on behalf of our clients,''
said Randy Rankin, the partner in charge of Pricewaterhouse's
global contractor compliance practice.
</P>
<P>
   Many apparel companies and universities have hired
factory-monitoring firms in recent years to reassure consumers who
want to know that the clothes they buy were not made in sweatshops.
Pricewaterhouse, which performs more than 6,000 factory inspections
a year, in sweatshops. Pricewaterhouse, which performs more than
6,000 factory inspections a year, is the world's leader in doing
inspections for companies, like Nike, that want monitors to check
on conditions in the factories they use.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke accompanied Pricewaterhouse inspectors and officials
with Business for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit group in San
Francisco, to factories in China and Korea after Harvard, Notre
Dame and three other universities asked them and several other
groups to review conditions at more than a dozen plants that make
apparel with the universities' logos. That broader monitoring
report was presented to the universities last week but is not
scheduled to be released until early October.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke's report comes during a fierce debate in which many
student groups, labor unions and human rights groups are
criticizing corporations and universities that rely on auditing
firms to inspect their factories. These groups assert that the
auditing firms often have a pro-corporate tilt, do not do thorough
inspections and should work with nongovernmental organizations,
like human rights groups, to gain a fuller picture of factory
conditions overseas.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke, who has inspected more than 100 Asian factories for
the World Bank and various United Nations organizations, called on
universities and companies to demand more rigorous monitoring
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Pricewaterhouse inspectors for failing to identify
that workers in a garment factory in Seoul, South Korea, used a
spot remover containing benzene, a carcinogen. When he visited a
factory outside Jakarta, Indonesia, he found that the firm's
inspectors had overlooked the same problem during an earlier
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   He also faulted the firm's monitors for not noting that the
labor union at a Shanghai garment factory was, like most Chinese
unions, controlled by management. And he criticized the inspectors
for failing to note that little information was given on chemicals
used in the factory and that some workers did not wear proper
gloves, masks or shoes while doing dangerous tasks or handling
dangerous materials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his report said Pricewaterhouse monitors received
most of their information from managers, not workers, and did
perfunctory interviews with workers inside the factory instead of
in-depth interviews outside, where workers would probably talk more
openly.
</P>
<P>
   Pharis Harvey, executive director of the International Labor
Rights Fund, a nonprofit group based in Washington, said, ``The
lesson to be drawn is that Pricewaterhouse has to learn how to
monitor before it can claim it's doing a serious job.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending Pricewaterhouse, Rankin said his firm received
information not just from managers, but by observing factories,
examining their records and interviewing their workers. He accused
O'Rourke of bias and of failing to appreciate that his firm found
many overtime and safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegation that we rely on management at the expense of
all other things, that's absolutely wrong,'' Rankin said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the firm's inspectors might not have found some of the
timecard problems that O'Rourke found because they looked at only a
sampling of timecards. And he acknowledged that his firm's
inspectors might not have recognized that the spot remover was a
benzene derivative because they were not trained industrial
hygienists.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Ryan, university attorney at Harvard, said he was not in a
position to judge whether O'Rourke's criticisms were valid. ``We
know monitoring has shortcomings,'' he said. ``What Dara O'Rourke
is saying is that it might have more shortcomings than we
thought.''

CLINTON ACCUSES REPUBLICANS OF IRRESPONSIBLE SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton bragged Wednesday that the
government had a bigger budget surplus than ever before and then
accused congressional Republicans of trying to devote much of the
money to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned, frankly, about the size and last-minute nature
of this year's congressional spending spree,'' Clinton said as he
announced revised White House projections showing a federal budget
surplus of more than $230 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The annual standoff over the enactment of 13 spending bills
needed to keep the government running is once again down to the
wire, though Congress is poised to extend the time limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is due to vote on a stop-gap spending measure on
Thursday that would keep government agencies functioning until Oct.
6, seven days beyond the official end of the fiscal year at
midnight Saturday. The House approved the temporary spending bill
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans responded angrily to the president's suggestion that
they are acting irresponsibly in supporting increases in the
budgets of some domestic programs. They say it was their actions
that brought about the surpluses now being trumpeted by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's volley of words came the same day he sent his chief of
staff, John Podesta, and Jack Lew, the director of the Office of
Management and the Budget, to Capitol Hill to speed up negotiations
on the thorny issues on some of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta and Lew spent much of their time meeting with Republican
and Democratic negotiators from the House and Senate who are
attempting to reach a compromise on an $18 billion measure to
finance the Interior Department and other agencies, including the
National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and some in Congress complained that
the Interior spending bill has been loaded up at the last minute
with a raft of amendments known as riders.
</P>
<P>
   A number of these amendments _ including one that would halt
studies on the feasibility of tearing down a number of dams in the
Pacific Northwest, a move championed by environmentalists to allow
salmon a free run to their upstream spawning areas _ have been
pushed by Sen. Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican who is locked
in a tight re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also hanging up the bill is debate over a provision to establish
a $45 billion trust fund over a 15-year period to conserve land for
recreation and wilderness areas. The provision, known as the
Conservation and Reinvestment Act, would not be subject to the
vagaries of the annual budgeting process, but instead would be
funded by royalties from offshore oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the heads of appropriations subcommittees who
control the money for the Interior Department fear they would lose
power and have joined with several lawmakers from western states to
oppose the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that Senator Gorton disagrees with its goals,'' said
an aide to the senator, speaking of the conservation provision.
``He disagrees with the fact that it creates an entitlement. And
that says this is more important than education or health care.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Interior Department spending measure remains stalled,
negotiators report some progress on the approximately $55 billion
transportation spending measure. That bill, which provides money
for air traffic controllers, highways and mass transit systems, has
been hung up in a House and Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Progress on the measure has been blocked by disagreement over,
among other things, a provision requiring that states adopt more
stringent standards on the amount of alcohol a driver must consume
to be considered drunk.

 &HT;    Some souvenirs getting pricey
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Olympic souvenirs are taking on a new and costly
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The price tags on anything worn by high-profile Olympic athletes
are skyrocketing, driven by fanatical sports enthusiasts and
Internet auctions, as well as by the standard brick-and-mortar
shops.
</P>
<P>
   There's a $186,000 price tag in Australian money for gold-medal
sprinter Maurice Greene's gold-plated running shoes, according to
the Daily Telegraph. He threw one of the specially made Nike shoes
into the crowd after winning the 100-meter finals.
</P>
<P>
   Track clothes worn by Australian 400-meter gold medalist and
cauldron lighter Cathy Freeman are worth thousands of dollars. An
autographed photo commands up to $200.
</P>
<P>
   On an online charity auction, the goggles worn by the heroic
Equatorial Guinea swimmer, Eric ``The Eel'' Moussambani, were
listed for up to $3,800. Moussambani barely finished his 100-meter
freestyle event but delighted the crowd with his effort.
</P>
<P>
   Online bidding reached $3,760 for the swimming cap of American
Misty Hyman.
</P>
<P>
   Other expensive items include gold boxing kangaroos thrown into
the crowd during the Opening Ceremonies, Olympic volunteer uniforms
and Olympic torches.
</P>
<P>
   In general, signed items command much higher prices. And values
could fall after the Games end and interest in them wanes.

 &HT;    Strip club owner arrested, organized crime captain indicted
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal authorities intensified their prosecution of
the Gold Club, arresting the strip club's owner and indicting an
alleged high-ranking captain of the Gambino organized crime family.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the moves appeared to fizzle Wednesday, at least
temporarily, when a federal magistrate allowed club owner Steve
Kaplan to remain free on bond. U.S. Magistrate E. Clayton Scofield
III said prosecutors' allegations that Kaplan ordered government
witnesses assaulted and intimidated were ``somewhat problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want Kaplan's $2 million bail revoked and the club
owner held in custody until trial, set for February. But Scofield
said Kaplan can remain free, at least until an evidentiary hearing
on the allegations is conducted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan and 16 others are charged with participating in a
sweeping racketeering conspiracy, including illegal ties to
organized crime, money laundering, prostitution, loansharking,
credit card fraud and police corruption. Kaplan also is accused of
paying Gold Club dancers to perform sexual favors for high-profile
professional athletes to heighten the club's profile.
</P>
<P>
   Michael DiLeonardo, also known as ``Mikey Scars,'' was named in
the amended indictment, which includes new charges unsealed
Wednesday. He is accused of being a member of New York's Gambino
crime family who extorted money from Kaplan's clubs.
</P>
<P>
   One defendant, a former Gold Club dancer, has pleaded guilty in
the case. Jana Pelnis, known by the stage name ``Frederique,'' is
cooperating with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents unsealed Wednesday, FBI Special Agent Frank
Graziano detailed allegations that Kaplan had government witnesses
attacked, intimidated and followed.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a witness was followed out of the federal
courthouse by a Kaplan associate, who struck her in the face after
she refused follow his orders, Graziano said. This former Gold Club
employee lost two teeth because of the assault and went into
hiding, moving from hotel to hotel, in fear for her safety, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano also accused Kaplan, 40, of intimidating and trying to
contact other government witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan appeared to be caught by surprise Tuesday evening at his
attorney's office when federal agents arrested him. Wearing faded
jeans and a windbreaker, he appeared agitated as he was led
handcuffed into the courtroom Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Kaplan's lawyer, Steve Sadow, said he
can refute every one of the prosecution's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   As for the witness who claims to have been assaulted, Sadow
said, ``Mr. Kaplan had nothing to do with it.'' Sadow said he has
talked to the person who allegedly struck the witness and ``he said
it never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadow disclosed that Kaplan's defense team has conducted an
``aggressive'' investigation of the federal charges, amassing tape
recordings of more than 200 witnesses. Some of these recordings
were acquired covertly, with the defense team using friends of the
witnesses who were wearing hidden microphones, Sadow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have their words on tape,'' Sadow said. ``When we sent a
friend out, these witnesses thought they were talking to a friend.
They weren't saying what the government wanted to hear, they were
saying what the truth is.'' Sadow said he has tape recordings that
will rebut the indictment as well as the recent allegations that
Kaplan intimidated witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   As for Monday's hearing, Sadow said, ``Bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Art Leach said Judge Scofield's concerns
about the new allegations are not the final word.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like the evidence is there,'' Leach said. ``We
wouldn't have filed the motion if we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Kaplan left the courtroom, DiLeonardo, alleged to
be a top captain in the Gambino crime family, entered and pleaded
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the judge to take the bench, DiLeonardo leaned back
in his chair at the defense table and joked with FBI agents,
talking mostly about baseball. He was allowed to remain free on
bond pending trial, after putting up his $1.5 million Staten
Island, N.Y., home as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses DiLeonardo, 45, of taking extortion
payments from Kaplan since 1994. DiLeonardo gave the money to the
Gambino family, which then provided protection to Kaplan's strip
clubs in Florida and Atlanta, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   DiLeonardo also is charged with extorting $100,000 in 1995 from
the owners of Scores, an adult entertainment nightclub in New York.
When the FBI began investigating Scores and its ties to organized
crime, Kaplan allegedly paid off an ex-manager of the nightclub
with cash and sexual favors from Gold Club dancers. In return, the
former employee agreed not to implicate DiLeonardo in the federal
probe, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows a much closer relationship between Kaplan and the
Gambino family, a much closer relationship between Kaplan and
organized crime,'' Leach said of the new charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaplan's ties to the Gambino family are merely geographical,
not criminal, Sadow said. ``Mr. Kaplan happens to live in the same
school district as John Gotti Jr.,'' Sadow said, referring to the
acting boss of the Gambino family. ``Their kids go to school
together. Their wives know each other.'' Kaplan has homes in
Atlanta and Oyster Bay, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti frequented a nude dance club Kaplan once owned in Boca
Raton, Fla., Sadow said. ``He was treated like any other
customer,'' he said.

SUSPECT IN STABBING OF CELTIC PIERCE IN CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>

 By FRANCIE LATOUR AND STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One of three suspects in the nightclub attack on
Celtics star Paul Pierce was taken into custody Wednesday night
just hours after police publicly identified three men wanted for
the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hurston, who allegedly bashed Pierce in the head with a
bottle as the Celtic played pool in a Theater District nightclub
early Monday, was met at Logan International Airport when he
returned voluntarily from New York to face a charge of assault and
battery with a dangerous weapon, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for Hurston, 31, of the city's Dorchester section,
told reporters his client is too short to have reached Pierce's
head, even with a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, John Swomley, who also represents the rap group Made
Men, said Hurston is a lifelong friend of Made Men member Raymond
``Ray Dog'' Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Made Men ``are disheartened Mr. Hurston has been sucked into
this,'' Swomley told reporters outside the Area A police station.
``They are as confident as I he had nothing to do with the assault
on Mr. Pierce.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other men are still being sought with warrants for assault
with a knife, William Ragland, 28, of the city's Roxbury section,
and Trevor Watson, 34, of Boston, indicating that both allegedly
took part in the knifing that left Pierce with multiple wounds
moments after he walked into the Buzz Club/Europa for a party early
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Superintendent Margaret O'Malley, of the department's
Bureau of Investigative Services, said she believed the three men _
all of whom O'Malley said are known to police in Boston and in the
region _ may have fled the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three individuals may be dangerous,'' O'Malley said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Police denied that they were actively seeking to question
Michael McNeill, as reported in the Globe Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McNeill, who has ties to Made Men, may have been at the club
during the stabbing, a police source said, but he is not believed
to be a primary witness, and police are not actively seeking to
interrogate him.
</P>
<P>
   Based on information provided to the Globe from a separate
police source, the Globe reported Wednesday that investigators
wanted to question McNeill in connection with the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley made no reference to McNeill at the press conference.
Efforts to reach McNeill have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley would not comment on the motive for Pierce stabbing, or
whether any of the suspects had ties to Made Men.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the stabbing, Made Men members Raymond ``Ray
Dog'' Scott and Marco Ennis acknowledged being at the club at the
same time as Pierce. But they adamantly denied any involvement in
the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley said eyewitness descriptions and cooperation from the
public helped police identify the three suspects named Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Trevor Watson was with Scott at suburban South Shore
Plaza in June 1999 when two Braintree police officers stopped and
questioned them after a Macy's sales clerk suspected them of using
a stolen credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The card in fact belonged to Scott, who filed criminal charges
against the officers who arrested him. The officers were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Watson received a 20-year suspended sentence for a 1986 armed
robbery. In 1995 he was convicted as a felon in possession of a
firearm and served a five-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The second man charged in the Pierce stabbing, Ragland, has 16
convictions spanning eight years, including robbery and three
separate assault convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Hurston, who is charged with attacking Pierce with a bottle, has
no known criminal history. But the Dorchester man was the victim of
a crime in 1990, when he was shot in front of a lounge after an
argument with another man in the early morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley would not comment on whether Pierce knew the suspects
or if he had been able to identify them through photographs.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend of Pierce who was with him at the time of the
stabbing, Derrick Battie, insisted Tuesday that neither Pierce nor
the two friends who were with him knew the stabbers.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics coach Rick Pitino said Wednesday Pierce had just arrived
at the club when a fight began and his attackers began stabbing
him. ``He was only at the club 10 minutes,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Pierce could be released from New England Medical
Center in the next day or two.

FDA APPROVAL IS SEEN FOR ABORTION PILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve the
abortion pill RU-486 by the end of this week, according to
individuals familiar with the approval process.
</P>
<P>
   The pill, also called mifepristone, causes an abortion by
preventing a fertilized egg from attaching itself to the uterus. It
is for use in women who are up to 49 days pregnant. RU-486 would be
manufactured and distributed by Danco Laboratories LLC, a small New
York-based company.
</P>
<P>
   It would probably be available by November, people close to the
approval negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 is expected to reshape reproductive health in the United
States, transforming the abortion process from an invasive
procedure to a one as simple as swallowing a few pills. About 1
million women have surgical abortions each year.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has been in the approval process for almost a decade.
It has been available in France since 1988 and has since become
commonplace in much of Western Europe, China and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The US version of the pill, however, would be subject to
regulations unusual for standard prescription drugs, sources said.
It could be prescribed only by doctors who perform abortions,
rather than, as is usual, by any physician. In addition, the
prescribing doctor will be required to have admitting privileges at
a hospital within one hour of his or her office.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 would also contain a ``black box'' warning, sources said,
a stern caution reserved for powerful drugs like thalidomide, which
is known to cause birth defects, and the narcotics that are used to
ease cancer patients' pain.
</P>
<P>
   Danco has been in frantic negotiations with the FDA over the
past few weeks, even as late as Wednesday night, to complete its
plans to package and distribute the pill.
</P>
<P>
   Approval has been put off at the last minute before, but sources
indicated that the negotiations were proceeding smoothly and were
in their final stages.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential race in full swing, the drug's approval
could become an explosive issue. Vice President Al Gore has said he
would not block its distribution. Governor George W. Bush of Texas
has said he is opposed to it. Anti-abortion activists have said
they will file a lawsuit blocking its distribution if RU-486 is
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Approval had been expected in February but was postponed after
the FDA released a statement saying that certain questions ``need
to be resolved before final manufacturing approval can be
granted.'' A deadline of Sept. 30 was set for a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The pill has been vehemently opposed by antiabortion groups,
whose protests have contributed to the drug's lengthy approval
process.
</P>
<P>
   The French company that makes the pill, Roussel-Uclaf, refused
to sell it in the United States, fearing boycotts and violence. No
US pharmaceutical would touch it either.
</P>
<P>
   Roussel-Uclaf handed the rights to RU-486 to the Population
Council, a New York-based nonprofit international abortion rights
group. The council funded clinical trials on women in the United
States, and gathered studies showing that almost half a million
women in Europe have taken it safely. The studies do show that it
has some side effects, including bleeding, cramping, nausea and
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   The Population Council sought FDA approval in March 1996. The
agency ruled that it was safe and effective, but it had questions
about how it would be marketed and distributed, and concerns
related to the heated political atmosphere surrounding abortion and
abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Population Council had difficulties securing a
manufacturing partner. Eventually, it struck up a partnership with
Danco, a somewhat secretive company run by a former executive of
the drug giant Merck &AMP; Co. Danco would sell RU-486 directly to
abortion doctors and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 induces abortion by blocking receptors of the hormone
progesterone, which plays an important role in developing a fetus.
Another drug, misoprostol, is then taken to cause contractions, in
which the fetus is expelled.
</P>
<P>
   RU-486 would be administered in a doctor's office, then
misoprostol would be taken at home. Studies have shown this
combination to have been effective 95 percent of the time in
producing early abortions.

UNDER PRESSURE, PUTIN POSTPONES MILITARY CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Facing opposition from his military commanders,
President Vladimir Putin postponed plans Wednesday to cut the armed
forces by a third and said ``there will be no wholesale, massive
reductions of the Russian armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin sounded a note of frustration at a meeting of his National
Security Council with top military commanders present, saying, ``We
spend colossal resources on the military, and we allow the military
budget to be wasted on peripheral issues that have nothing in
common with either the army's combat readiness nor with its direct
supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he added, ``we don't have the right'' to make
``mechanical'' reductions in forces, but rather need to streamline
the efficiency of the military. And, he added, ``we cannot any
longer simply provide for the army's needs without also providing
training with high technology and modern equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks seemed to undercut statements this month by Defense
Minister Igor D. Sergeyev that Russian military ranks would be cut
between 2001 and 2003 to 850,000 from the present level of 1.2
million, a reduction of just under one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said the issue of Russia's national defense could not be
addressed ``by sheer enthusiasm'' in the budget-cutting process,
although he said the country was still spending far too much on the
military establishment inherited from the Soviet Union. Military,
law enforcement and security services represent about 35 percent of
the Russian budget.
</P>
<P>
   He said the leaders of all departments with military units had
raised objections to the reduction plans disclosed by Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and Sergei Ivanov, secretary to
the security council, recommended Wednesday that Putin put off any
decisions until November.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the recommendation, Putin said, ``Measured, calm
and smooth work is needed to optimize the country's entire military
machine.'' He added, ``It will take time to formulate decisions and
work out their format.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that despite the need to make budget reductions, ``our
army must be mobile, effective, flexible and combat capable.'' But
he added, ``This does not mean that we have to follow the path of
mechanical reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's remarks surprised some experts, coming as they did after
the sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk on Aug. 12 and the
generally poor performance of the Russian military in two
inconclusive campaigns against the rebellious republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The public perception that poor maintenance and safety standards
in the Russian fleet contributed to the loss of the Kursk's
118-member crew created strong political momentum for military
reform, including additional cuts in standing forces, which have
declined to 1.2 million today from more than 2 million a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Putin realizes that the only way he can eventually get
a military that can do the job is to cut it drastically,'' said
Dmitri Trenin, a former military officer and deputy director of the
Moscow Carnegie Center.
</P>
<P>
   Trenin said he believed that Putin's decision to postpone his
first round of cuts was more tactical than strategic. ``He prefers
caution and nonconfrontation in dealing with the military,'' he
said. ``Everyone knows that there is political support for
improving defense, and that means cutting forces.''
</P>
<P>
   William E. Odom, a retired American general and longtime analyst
of the Soviet and Russian military, expressed some doubt that Putin
could carry through with significant cuts to forces or to the
defense budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Putin's public statements about foreign policy
and the military, they all have the element of saying Russia must
be a strong military power,'' Odom said. ``Well, he is now being
hoisted on that petard because Russia does not have the money to
have a strong military.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Putin, as a former KGB officer and director of its
successor agency, the Federal Security Service, is particularly
indebted to the military and security services for political
support, and the war in Chechnya was a critical factor in Putin's
political rise.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Kremlin meeting, Ivanov, the security adviser,
said Putin's decision was intended to give the military six more
weeks to ``calculate once again all the economic parameters of the
reforms that will be carried out pretty soon.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Europe is rushing to tear down borders, but the Internet
is toppling some of them even faster, making life distinctly
uncomfortable for European policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   A big source of that discomfort is the threat of lost tax
revenue, because European nations depend far more on taxes on
consumption than the United States does. So in contrast to the
United States _ where a federal commission failed to agree on how
states should tax basic electronic commerce and mail-order sales
like books, consumer electronics and other products _ European
officials are pushing hard to adopt a seemingly narrow but
potentially far-reaching proposal to ensure that digital products
bought in Europe over the Internet do not escape taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the legislation proposed in June by the European
Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the 15-nation
European Union, defines digital products like software and video
programming downloaded by computer as services rather than goods.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to insure that such transactions face the
value-added tax, an elaborate system begun in Europe in which
purchases are taxed at each stage from production to final sale.
(However lucrative, it is a system that politicians in the United
States have shied away from.)
</P>
<P>
   Normally in Europe, services would be taxed in the country of
origin, meaning that European nations would gain no tax revenue
from services flowing in from the outside. But this bill, which has
stirred controversy not only on the Continent but among
high-technology companies in the United States, would require
companies outside Europe with sales here of such services exceeding
100,000 euros, or about $88,000, to register in one European
country for the purpose of paying value-added taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are significant. In 1999, European e-commerce sales
were $3.4 billion, or less than one-half of 1 percent of total
sales. But by some estimates, such sales in Europe may rise as high
as 12 percent of the total in the next few years. And while sales
of digital products from outside Europe are only a small fraction
of that, policy-makers _ even more than their counterparts in the
United States _ are fretting over possible lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the United States, where relatively few people
pay state sales taxes on Internet purchases, European governments
already impose national value-added taxes on goods sold over the
Internet within Europe. The tax rates and the list of goods covered
vary from country to country. For services sold by European
companies within Europe, the VAT is paid by the selling company in
its home country.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, European governments already tax e-commerce more
than the United States does. The Internet Tax Freedom Act, passed
by Congress in 1998, created a moratorium on sales taxes on
e-commerce across state lines until 2001, and anti-tax forces in
Congress have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to extend the
moratorium until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has sought to coordinate Internet tax policies with
the Europeans through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development in Paris. At an OECD conference in Ottawa in 1998, the
Europeans and the United States agreed on a list of principles for
treating digital goods as services rather than manufactured
products, to avoid customs duties on their delivery, and on
jurisdiction in case of eventual taxation.
</P>
<P>
   But in Europe, the issue is considered a pressing one. European
governments depend for roughly 40 percent of their total revenue on
value-added taxes, while state sales taxes in the United States
make up only about 25 percent of total state tax revenue. The
budget of the European Commission is financed almost entirely by
the VAT.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe as in the United States, governments are also coming
under pressure from traditional retailers that must collect taxes
on all their sales _ taxes that Internet providers can skirt. The
American software producer Symantec, for instance, which sells its
Norton Utilities software to Europeans in several languages through
its Web site, encourages customers to download the software
directly, saying that there is ``no value-added tax, shipping or
export charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, serious obstacles face the proposed European legislation,
and enactment is far from certain. For one thing, the bill will not
become effective unless it is approved and enacted into national
law by all 15 members of the European Union. It also needs to pass
in the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   So difficult is the debate expected to be that Thomas Tindemans,
a tax expert in the Brussels office of the law firm of White &AMP;
Case, said the delays would probably produce ``a de facto
moratorium.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the debate complex is that the proposed legislation
affects not only software but also other electronic services like
pay-for-use radio and television broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The path the Europeans have taken is not unlike the one Congress
chose in July, when it passed legislation to resolve the issue of
how to tax cellular phone use in the United States. Under the new
rules, cell phones have a ``primary service area'' in which the
telephone user pays state and local user taxes. But unlike the U.S.
legislation, the broader European measures face bitter opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The European legislators are treading a thin line. National
governments _ at pains to see their industries close the gap with
the United States, where Internet use by business and consumers is
ahead of Europe's _ do not want to impose extra burdens. Yet
officials in Brussels also worry that inaction could encourage
individual countries to take unilateral action to prevent tax
erosion. Tindemans of White &AMP; Case said the goal appeared to be
``to force debate at the European level and try to coordinate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial criticism has been intense. In the United States, the
Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group,
assailed the draft as ``fatally flawed.'' Mark Bohannon, the
group's general counsel, said the measure would be unenforceable
because it is often impossible to tell where a customer is in
cyberspace. He called the proposed law a step backward from
international agreements not to tax the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, just about every interest group seems unhappy. At
Eurocommerce, a trade organization for wholesale and retail
distributors, officials are preparing a catalog of objections,
including ones to the plan to set the threshold at 100,000 euros.
They say that would discriminate against small European companies
that already pay the tax while their small rivals abroad would not.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the trade group hopes to use the issue as a cudgel to
force governments to harmonize value-added tax rates at lower
levels, arguing that the proposal encourages foreign companies to
register in countries with little or no VAT for digital products,
like Britain, where the rate on some items is zero, rather than,
say, Sweden and Denmark, where the uniform rate is 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the theory,'' said the chief tax adviser at
Eurocommerce, Dimitris Kalogeras. ``The practice is quite
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Tengberg, chief executive of a company called Buyonet,
could not agree more. When Tengberg, a former mechanical engineer
with Exxon, set up his company in 1997 to sell software on the Web
and to help other companies do likewise, he established
headquarters in Sweden, but registered it in Seattle. The company
sells all its products to Europe from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Buyonet's main competitors, Tengberg explained in an interview,
are American companies like Beyond.com that enable European
customers to download their products without paying the value-added
tax. If Buyonet added Sweden's 25 percent rate to its prices, he
said, ``people just would not buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tengberg, one of the most outspoken opponents of the
legislation, called it ``primitive and impossible to enforce.'' The
authorities in Europe, he argues, would have no power to force
American companies to register. And if American authorities
cooperated, he said, many companies would simply move the computers
used to deliver their products ``to Uruguay, Burkina Faso or
Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a digital world,'' he went on, ``where you deliver from
doesn't matter. A buyer in Bahrain gets the same service as a buyer
in Philadelphia. It's a beautiful fact, but for the tax man it's a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Therese Torris, a tax specialist at Forrester Research BV,
regards such comments as nonsense. So far, the market for directly
downloaded digital products consists mainly of software sales to
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large companies have no incentive for tax evasion,'' she said,
relying on governments for assistance in matters like anti-piracy
and copyright protection. Small businesses may seek to evade taxes,
she said, ``but it's not in the interest of big companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they have a problem,'' Torris added, ``they go to the
government and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   She said European and American governments face a formidable
challenge when digital goods are delivered online and paid for
directly over the Internet. But she also said that the problem was
purely technical and that companies specializing in tax-collection
software were already providing solutions. Taxware International,
for instance, recently began marketing software to track European
value-added taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Buydens, a tax specialist at the OECD, said Europe's
value-added tax system could more readily be adjusted than what
exists in the United States, where 7,000 tax jurisdictions create a
minefield of differing sales tax rates, and there are contrasting
definitions of taxable and nontaxable items.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, Europe will have to make some changes,'' he
said. ``In the United States, the discussion is about the system
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tengberg of Buyonet said that he, like many other executives
of businesses operating in cyberspace, believes that the Internet
ultimately spells the end of the European value-added tax system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works in a physical market,'' he said. ``It doesn't work
here.''

SUSAN S. BAILIS, 54; HEALTH CARE PIONEER, OF BREAST CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Smart, brassy, sometimes profane, Susan S. Bailis rose
from social worker to top hospital administrator, then quit to
build New England's biggest nursing home company, which was sold in
1996 for $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   She dressed in silk and Armani, threw dinner parties, and, in
her husband's words, ``ferociously devoted time'' to her family,
cooking the food for her son's bar mitzvah over several weeks and
stashing it in the freezer, one lasagna at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, her reaction was typical:
She launched a foundation to fund research of the disease's
environmental causes and kept right on working, taking her cell
phone with her to chemotherapy. Only in recent weeks did the
illness manage to keep her in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Bailis died Wednesday at her home in suburban Belmont,
surrounded by family and friends. She was 54.
</P>
<P>
   Word that Bailis was slipping away rippled through the diverse
arenas where she had made a mark: her alma mater, Brandeis
University, one of many institutions where she was a trustee; the
health care world, where she was known as a fierce negotiator on
behalf of elder care; the community of breast cancer researchers
and advocates, who called her a pioneer, but knew that Bailis,
never one for sentimentality, hated to be called ``courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, even as friends made farewell visits to Bailis's
home, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center named her to its board
of trustees. It was no symbolic gesture, said trustee Jordan
Golding, who told Bailis's husband, Larry, of the decision: The
hospital needed her help at a time of financial challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, family, friends and business associates
described a woman who was at once feisty and nurturing, idealistic
and pragmatic; one of those individuals who has a lasting effect on
nearly everyone she encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has this sparkle in her eye that tells you this is a woman
who you don't want to mess with,'' said Julia G. Brody, executive
director of the Silent Spring Institute in Newton, whose research
into preventable causes of breast cancer is backed by the Susan S.
Bailis Breast Cancer Research Fund. ``She's got ideas and she's
going to carry them out.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those ideas was figuring out what environmental factor _
pesticides, perhaps, or plastics, or any of the myriad products
women use _ might be contributing to the rising incidence of breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with the disease getting a lot of public attention,
the majority of research focuses on drugs and diagnosis, lucrative
areas for companies that fund studies.
</P>
<P>
   In a fund-raising video for Silent Spring, Bailis, dark-haired
and elegant, uses the language of a businesswoman to explain the
problem: Looking for environmental causes won't make anyone rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, what we may find may be costly to the economy,''
she says, slightly raising one eyebrow. ``Therefore, the
traditional funding sources are not highly incented to fund this
kind of research.''
</P>
<P>
   So, even though it would not help cure her own cancer, that's
where she chose to throw her weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the legacies I would like to leave,'' she says on the
video, ``is that I did something that will make a difference for
the women and their daughters that come after me.''
</P>
<P>
   That willingness to leave the beaten track reminds Bailis's
husband of how she got onto the marching band at A.B. Davis High
School in Mount Vernon, N.Y., where the couple met on the cast of
``Pirates of Penzance.''
</P>
<P>
   She played the viola, an instrument that was out of place on the
football field. So she agreed to play the glockenspiel, Larry
Bailis said, ``doing what it takes to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bailis was the youngest daughter of Sanford Solender, a
Jewish community leader, and his wife, Ethel, a violinist. Her
brother, Stephen Solender, now is head of United Jewish
Communities.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from Brandeis in 1967 and got a master's degree in
social work from Simmons College _ where she later became
chairwoman of the board of trustees _ all the while helping Larry
get through graduate school at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been supporting me ever since,'' said Larry Bailis, now
an associate research professor at Brandeis's Heller School.
</P>
<P>
   They have two children. Kathryn, 25, who teaches middle school
at Noble &AMP; Greenough, and David, 21, studies ethnomusicology at
Reed College, although he has been studying at the Berklee School
of Music to be near his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Bailis's high-powered career didn't stop the family from
spending weekends together in Rhode Island and taking yearly trips.
Larry Bailis recalled his wife waiting for business packages in the
Greek islands, in Ireland, at the Sheraton Great Wall Hotel in
China, and then heading off for some family time.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning as a social worker at New England Medical Center,
Bailis rose to be associate director. In that role, she hired Alan
Solomont, who ran his family's long-term care company, to operate a
pediatric nursing home for the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Solomont admired her tough negotiating skills, and in 1985 she
quit to help him build the ADS Group into the state's largest
elder-care company, managing 5,000 beds at 60 sites with nearly
$100 million in revenue. In 1996, they sold the company to
MultiCare, which was quickly bought by Genesis Health Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care chief executive Charles Baker said
Bailis often held him to the fire on Medicare reimbursement rates
when he was state secretary of health and human services.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was good at separating the issues _ which at times were
very contentious _ from the people,'' he said, choking up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Solomont, who became close friends with Bailis, said she swore
``like a sailor,'' yet managed not to sound crude. At the same
time, he said, she was a nurturing manager, setting up a
scholarship fund for the largely female work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in our company would walk on hot coals for her,'' said
Solomont. ``She would say, `These are poor women taking care of
poor women and we have to look out for them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bailis became involved in breast-cancer advocacy when another
close friend, Ellen Parker, helped found the Massachusetts Breast
Cancer Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1992, Bailis apologized to a state official for being
off her game in a meeting. She had been diagnosed with breast
cancer that day, she explained.
</P>
<P>
   After chemotherapy, she thought she had it beat. But in 1995,
her doctor found tiny tumors had metastasized to her bones and
lungs. She told her husband, ``I guess we're not going to grow old
together after all.''
</P>
<P>
   In a book of essays by people with breast cancer, Bailis used
typically direct, staccato phrases to describe how she and Solomont
broke the news to colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I planned to go on with my life and my work. I'm a
fighter. I told them they could talk to me about it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She hated being called a survivor,'' Parker said. ``She didn't
want to be the poster girl for feel-good cancer things. If you have
breast cancer and you go out to dinner, people say you're
courageous. It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailis described telling President Clinton about her illness at
a White House breakfast, saying, `` `I think you can relate to that
since your mother died of it.' He became completely and totally
riveted on me. I said the word `breast' in the White House. I knew
damn well what I was doing. Everyone except the president was
uncomfortable. . . . He threw his arms around me and said, `Hang in
there!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bailis made her last public appearance in July, showing up using
a walker for a meeting of Governor Paul Cellucci's health-care task
force. The governor suggested nursing home beds could be converted
to elderly housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole room turned to Susan,'' recalled Ned Morse,
president of the Massachusetts Extended Care Federation. She
``politely but firmly'' told him why his idea was all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vintage Bailis,'' said Morse.
</P>
<P>
   Later, kept comfortable by her doctor Roger Lang, Bailis had
time for sweet conversations with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Parker said she asked Bailis, ``Are you really scared,
scared about dying?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `No, Ellen _ do you think that's very odd?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Not from you.' ''

MILITARY COMMANDERS SEEK DEFENSE SPENDING INCREASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Expands earlier story.) By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States' senior military commanders told
Congress on Wednesday that the armed services needed a significant
increase in spending in the years ahead, suggesting amounts that
would exceed what has been proposed by either major presidential
candidate and would consume a large part of the projected budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the Senate and the House, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, and the chiefs of the
Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps warned that aging weapons
and deteriorating barracks and bases were threatening to erode
military readiness and that only an infusion of dollars would
sustain American military might.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings _ in the midst of a presidential race in which the
state of the U.S. military has been hotly disputed _ had little to
do with current Pentagon spending, since the budget for the next
fiscal year has already been passed and signed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the chiefs outlined what amounted to their argument
over how to use much of the budget surplus, setting the stage for
what will certainly be a contentious fight over the nation's
spending priorities, no matter whether Vice President Al Gore or
Gov. George W. Bush is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats countered the chiefs' remarks by arguing that the
Pentagon _ and Congress _ had not done enough to find internal
savings, by closing unneeded bases and scrapping ballistic missiles
that the Air Force no longer wants to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the record, let me just say that at $305 billion, the U.S.
military budget is more than five times larger than Russia's, the
second-largest spender,'' said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. She added
that it was 22 times larger than ``the combined spending of the
seven countries traditionally identified by the Pentagon as our
most likely adversaries, those being Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North
Korea, Sudan and Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs did not propose a specific overall increase in the
military budget, but they used the hearings to outline what they
said were the most pressing needs facing the armed services. They
cited the increasing pace of military operations overseas, warning
that the effort to provide front-line forces with the latest
equipment and training drained resources for troops back home.
</P>
<P>
   They also warned that aging weapons built in the 1980s had
become outdated and increasingly expensive to maintain. Gen.
Michael E. Ryan, the chief of the Air Force, said aircraft in the
service were on average 22 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Those rising maintenance costs, they said, forced them to shift
still more money from new weapons and to maintain the current
arsenal _ a process that the undersecretary of defense for
technology and acquisition, Jacques S. Gansler, once called ``a
death spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are collectively robbing Peter to pay Paul _ or robbing
modernization, which is long-term readiness, to pay for current
readiness,'' Shelton told the Senate's Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed by Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., the chiefs offered
rough estimates of the new spending that they would need to address
those problems. Gen. James L. Jones, commandant of the Marine
Corps, said $1.5 billion a year was needed over the next seven
years to make a ``modern Marine Corps.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Eric K. Shinseki of the Army called for an increase of $10
billion a year for the Army, though at the House later in the day
he suggested still more.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs of the Navy and Air Force went further, calling for
increases of $20 billion to $30 billion a year _ much of it for
buying new aircraft and ships.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office estimated
that it would cost $50 billion a year more than current spending to
sustain the military at roughly the size it is today. Pentagon
officials have disputed the report's underlying assumptions about
the size and mission of the military, but the chiefs on Wednesday
largely endorsed its findings, saying that for years they had
diverted money from new weapons to pay for current operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must find the resources necessary to modernize the force,''
Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Military spending has begun to rise after falling at the end of
the Cold War. The Pentagon budget, including nuclear weapons
maintained by the Department of Energy, is now projected to grow
from $305 billion for the fiscal year that begins Sunday to roughly
$330 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures prepared by the Department of Defense, the
Congressional Budget Office's estimates would consume two-thirds of
the projected surplus over the next five years that is not
dedicated to Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In their campaigns, both Bush and Gore have proposed more modest
increases than those the chiefs outlined. Bush has called for
spending $4.5 billion more a year, while Gore has called for about
$8 billion more a year.

 &HT;    School calls wallet chain a weapon, suspends girl, 11
 &HT;    By Yolanda Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A 10-inch novelty chain that dangled from Ashley
Smith's Tweety bird wallet is costing her two weeks of school.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old sixth-grader was suspended Tuesday for breaking
the Cobb County School District's zero-tolerance weapons policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a little chain, and I don't think it can really hurt
anyone,'' said Ashley, a Tweety fan who publishes her own Web site
devoted to the cartoon character.
</P>
<P>
   One critic says it's ``zero-tolerance gone awry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't have jumped to immediately suspend her,'' said
Jerry Weber, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said the rules on weapons are clear _ no
chains. And, they said, Ashley and her parents, Raymond and Carmen
Smith, knew the rules. The school district lumps Ashley's Tweety
bird chain into a category with pellet guns, ice picks and swords.
</P>
<P>
   So Principal Eugene Wright handed down the maximum punishment
after his assistant snapped the chain that connected the girl's
wallet to her key rings. The sixth-grader will miss 10 days of
class and won't get an appeal to the school board because it is a
``short-term'' suspension, said Tony Arasi, assistant
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Weber said the school district may be violating Ashley's rights
to due process.
</P>
<P>
   When the school year started, students were shown examples of
items not allowed at school. But Ashley said she saw a thicker
chain about 2 feet long. After the school showed her a much larger
chain, ``the student may have thought that something like a wallet
chain is not in violation,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the ACLU successfully represented Atlanta Public
Schools student Rose Marie Spearman, who was suspended and charged
with criminal weapons possession. She had brought African tribal
knives to school for extra credit on a project.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, the principal, did not return a call seeking comment,
but Arasi defends the suspension and the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's parents agree weapons should be banned from school, but
Raymond Smith said the suspension lacks ``common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A little piece of chain is not a deadly weapon,'' he noted.

PARENT SAYS CHRYSLER UNIT WILL POST A THIRD-QUARTER LOSS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take is short separate on Daimler-Chrysler   investing in
China . )  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ DaimlerChrysler AG said Wednesday that its
Chrysler car group would report a loss in the third quarter _ the
first such loss since a recession in the United States nine years
ago _ and that Chrysler's highly respected design chief, Thomas C.
Gale, would retire at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither announcement had been entirely unexpected, they
provided new evidence that DaimlerChrysler remains deeply divided
between its U.S. and German car companies long after their historic
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Gale, 57, is the latest in a long series of top Chrysler
executives to bail out of the company since the merger two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler's former president and the top
American working on integration of the two companies, quit last
year after his relations with German executives soured.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's former chairman, who had been a
co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler, retired in March, earlier than
expected. Many others below the top ranks have left as well.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler attributed Chrysler's anticipated third-quarter
loss to extremely stiff price competition in the United States and
the costs of bringing new models to the market quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But the company insisted that Chrysler would again turn
profitable in the last quarter of the year and asserted that total
operating profits this year would match those of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That would be better than many analysts had been fearing,
because rumors have been circulating for weeks that the entire
company might report a loss and that full-year profits would
decline sharply. Reflecting the relief, shares in DaimlerChrysler
rose 2.6 percent in Frankfurt to 52.8 euros or about $46.62. In New
York, shares rose 94 cents to $45.94.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the loss at Chrysler is extraordinary given the
company's reputation for profitability during the mid-1990s. It is
the first such loss since an $82 million shortfall in the third
quarter of 1991 _ and that was a recession year, in contrast to the
flush economic times in the United States now.
</P>
<P>
   Investor concern about Chrysler is reflected in the shares of
the parent company, which have still lost more than half their
value since they peaked at $108 in January 1999. And the basic
problems confronting Chrysler are not over. Though the retro-styled
PT Cruiser has been a runaway hit, other models are getting stale
and need to be revamped.
</P>
<P>
   In a determined effort to hold its market share, Chrysler has
torn into its profit margins by spending vast sums on discount
programs and other incentives to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining its predictions for the rest of the year,
DaimlerChrysler said that Chrysler would lose about $530 million in
the third quarter of this year but would post an overall profit for
the year of about $1.7 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Juergen Schrempp, the chairman of DaimlerChrysler, has already
announced plans for billions of dollars in cost-cutting moves
during this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is looking for additional cuts, while also
trying to speed up the introduction of new models and expand
production of the PT Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Chrysler, Mercedes has continued to post healthy
gains. Even though the German market for midpriced cars shriveled
this year, largely because of a flood of nearly new used cars on
the market, Mercedes sales increased slightly in Germany and about
4.5 percent worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Even the much-criticized Smart, the snub-nosed two-seat vehicle
that was a flop, has bounced back. Its sales jumped 67 percent
through August, to 69,500 cars.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Gale had been widely expected, but it could
be an important loss. Having spent 33 years at Chrysler, Gale
oversaw the design of cars ranging from popular Chrysler Intrepid
sedan to the Dodge Viper, an eye-catching muscle car that helped
jazz up Dodge's dusty image.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about Gale's departure spread as soon as it became clear
that Stallkamp was on his way out as president. Earlier this year,
when asked in an interview about his intention to stay with the
company, he carefully avoided making any long-term commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Gale strongly implied he had indeed begun planning
his departure about that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jim Holden took his position as president, I agreed to
stay on and see the future product plan through, while continuing
to build the team to succeed me,'' Gale said. ``Now that both of
those processes are complete and we're in the next phase of
development, it's time for me to step back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gale will be replaced by Richard O. Schaum, who has been in
charge of engineering platforms _ the basic chassis and components
that are common to many different car models. Trevor M. Creed, who
was recently promoted to senior vice president in charge of design,
will be responsible for the more visible aspects of exterior and
interior styling.
</P>
<P>
   Gale also said there are no plans to replace him on the
13-member DaimlerChrysler management board. His departure would
leave a 12-member board _ nine from Daimler and three from
Chrysler.

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ DaimlerChrysler will invest $118 million in
cash to revive Beijing Jeep, one of the earliest joint ventures in
China that has been making the same modified Jeep for the past 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   The investment is part of a $226 million restructuring plan
meant to prepare the joint venture for competition after China
enters the World Trade Organization and duties on imported sport
utility vehicles fall. DaimlerChrysler plans to produce two new
models at the joint venture in the next three years. China is
expected to join the WTO within the next few months.

 &HT;    Lieberman's mom, son visit Florida
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ She is a master kibitzer, a protective
parent, and to the Democratic faithful, something of a doting
Jewish queen mother in a wheelchair throne.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Lieberman _ mother of vice presidential candidate Sen.
Joe Leiberman _ came to town Wednesday and continued a family
whistle-stop tour that has included South Florida visits from the
candidate, his wife, his daughter, and now his son and mother.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed in her wheelchair by grandson Matthew, 33, Marcia
Lieberman signed autographs and encouraged the almost entirely
over-65 crowd at three appearances to vote for ``the party that
gave us Social Security and Medicare and . . . the party that will
give us free prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke in the morning at the Plumbers &AMP; Pipe Fitters Union
Hall, swung by the Morse Geriatric Center for a little tuna salad
and a quick press conference and then hit Century Village.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, 85, told about 200 seniors at the union hall that she
was totally shocked in August when Vice President Al Gore picked
her son to be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much of a surprise as it was to the country, it was that
much of a surprise to us,'' Lieberman said. ``I have to tell you
that most of all, as much as we hear about Joe running for vice
president, that it's because of the vice president's courage to
break the barrier of having a Jewish young man run as his mate.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was largely of the same mind. ``When Gore can have the
chutzpah to pick a Jewish man and the polls show he's running so
much ahead, that's something,'' said David Grossberg, 82. ``I
didn't think I would see it in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeling her way through the Leonard and Sophie Davis Atrium and
the Jack and Pearl Resnick Pavilion and The Shapiro Family
Auditorium and Chapel at the Morse Geriatric Center, Lieberman
shook hands with dozens of other people in wheelchairs and passed
out ``Seniors for Gore and Lieberman 2000'' buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman, who lives in Connecticut, has been making public
appearances in senior centers across that state for years. The
senator is said to call his mother every day.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Lieberman has earned a reputation as something of a
character. She recently mailed brown paper-wrapped care packages to
the reporters covering her son's campaign. In the packages:
Tylenol, lip balm, tissues, an apple, bagel chips, a news clipping
on her son, candies, a pair of plastic sunglasses, and postcards
for reporters to write home to their own mothers. Also included, a
handwritten note imploring the recipients to ``Please be good to my
son!''

 &HT;    Judge questions guidelines before sentencing gunrunners
 &HT;    By John Pacenti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ A prosecutor warned ``the world is
watching'' and a federal judge questioned the wisdom of lawmakers
as he sentenced three Northern Ireland gunrunners to less than five
years in prison Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons, sent hidden in toys and other goods, were meant for
use by the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Their gun dealer, Edward Bluestein, was put on probation for two
years, including six months of house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   So ended the emotional case that brought the turmoil of Northern
Ireland into a South Florida courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The stiffest sentence handed down by U.S. District Judge Wilkie
D. Ferguson was four years and eight months to Connor Claxton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person can be sentenced to life for having $400 worth of
crack cocaine, then this sort of offense ought to get the death
penalty,'' Ferguson said in reference to Claxton's case.
</P>
<P>
   Later the judge said he didn't really think the defendants
should get the death penalty but only wanted to point out that
lawmakers seem to have their priorities askew regarding gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also told Bluestein, who testified against the
gunrunners, that ``much of the proliferation of firearms in this
community is caused by licensed dealers.'' Bluestein, 57, said he
no longer is in the business. He suffered heart failure and stood
in front of the judge huffing and puffing, grabbing onto the
lecturn for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my doctor I can't live like this anymore,'' said
Bluestein, who has been out on bond. ``I think I was in jail for
the last year.'' The judge told Bluestein _ who spent less than a
day in jail _ that he had no idea what it was like to be locked up.
</P>
<P>
   Bluestein admitted to selling the gunrunners 43 weapons for
shipment overseas. He agreed to break gun-reporting laws by
reporting only a few of the guns in exchange for a $50-a-gun fee.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government did fail in its main task to convict the
three gunrunners _ Claxton, Anthony Smyth and Martin Mullan _ of
the most serious charges of terrorism and conspiracy to commit
murder and maim persons in a foreign land, which could have put the
men in prison for life. They were found guilty of weapons
transporting crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe in some great degree the world is watching what
we do,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Scruggs. ``It is
unacceptable to bring their problems to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Smyth's girlfriend, Siobhan Browne, also admitted to purchasing
guns. She already has been sentenced to 20 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor put the number of guns Wednesday at 118 that the
men intended to ship in Tonka trucks, empty VCRs and other items to
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be here today except for the situation I grew up in
in my country,'' Claxton told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth and Mullan received three-year sentences and Smyth has to
pay a $3,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Irish nationals have already spent 14 months in
federal jail. Irish-American organizations raised more than
$100,000 for defense costs. Supporters outside the courthouse,
weunrunners to less than five years in prison Wednesday.

wearing green ribbons, compared the men to George Washington,
revolutionaries fighting against British rule. Scruggs, the
prosecutor, said one of the gunrunner's relatives threatened him
after the verdict. He also said he received thank yous from the
Royal Ulster Constabulary, the police in Northern Ireland, which
has lost 300 officers to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``These weapons were going to be used to kill them. They told us
we saved lives,'' he said.

Barbra Streisand's farewell concerts at Madison Square Garden this
week were officially sold out within hours, but the true story is
closer to ``I Can Get It for You Wholesale.'' The concerts
Wednesday and Thursday night were officially sold out within hours.
But plenty of tickets were being offered by brokers over the
Internet on Wednesday at prices ranging from $500 to $1,500 or
more. The face value of the tickets was $125 to $1,500, with VIP
tickets going for $2,500, including dinner. (Michelle V. Agins/The

in some way, large or small, a new study has found. Chained gates

Moffett abandoned her comfortable longtime job as a legal secretary

little or no teaching experience, hired by Schools Chancellor
Harold Levy to fill chronic vacancies in the system's most troubled
schools. In August, the fellows took a crash course in teaching and
eight hours of certification exams. In these first weeks of school,
Moffett is learning that teaching is only part of her job

TV-GIDEON-BRAUGHER -- Actresses inspire Andre Braugher more than
actors, because he believes weakness is almost bred out of men.
That's why he has never seen Hamlet played as the coward he
believes he is. Braugher is starring in his second television
series, ``Gideon's Crossing,'' a hospital drama on ABC. He plays
Dr. Ben Gideon, a character based on Dr. Jerome Groopman, a Boston
physician who chronicled his clinical experiences in the 1997 book
``The Measure of Our Days.'' While the role isn't exactly Hamlet,
the character appears to be complex enough to keep Braugher's fires
fed for now. (Monica Almeida/The New York Times)

at the New York Film Festival, is the first of Edward Yang's seven
features to reach American theaters. Set, like all his films, in
middle-class Taipei, ``Yi Yi'' provides an engaging introduction to
Yang's fictional universe, in part because of its bemused approach
to family life. Yang has been compared with Michelangelo Antonioni
and Jean-Luc Godard and his 1991 film ``A Brighter Summer Day'' is
considered one of the modern era's greatest Chinese-language films.

``Girlfight'' is about ``an outsider who enters a world where she
does not belong and finds a place for herself,'' says director
Karyn Kusama. The film, which opened Friday, is the story of a
sullen, gum chewing, muscular girl from the underclass, played by
Michelle Rodriguez, who literally fights her way into the ring. It
could be a metaphor for Kusama's bout with studios as she tried to
get financing. (Ruby Washington/The New York Times)

For race horses and race drivers, the inside lane is the place to

location. U.S. Olympic runner Angelo Taylor, was less than thrilled
Wednesday when he learned he would start from Lane 1, on the inside

and science teachers to world standards, a national commission
reported on Wednesday. Former Sen. John Glenn, the ex-astronaut is
chairman of the National Commission on the Teaching of Science and

Late,'' cited often-used statistics from the mid-1990s that show
most Americans emerge from high school with less knowledge of math
and science than most students their age in other nations. Glenn

London is seeing the greatest cultural expansion in its history, a
list of many of the largest donors enabling this growth reads like
a who's who of American philanthropy. American money accounted for
nearly 30 percent of all the individual financing for the $214
million Tate Modern in London, the first new national museum in
Britain in 100 years and its first devoted solely to modern art.

TV-GIDEON-BRAUGHER -- Actresses inspire Andre Braugher more than
actors, because he believes weakness is almost bred out of men.
That's why he has never seen Hamlet played as the coward he
believes he is. Braugher is starring in his second television
series, ``Gideon's Crossing,'' a hospital drama on ABC. He plays
Dr. Ben Gideon, a character based on Dr. Jerome Groopman, a Boston
physician who chronicled his clinical experiences in the 1997 book
``The Measure of Our Days.'' While the role isn't exactly Hamlet,
the character appears to be complex enough to keep Braugher's fires

the first debates Bush did not have to do much. Not one of the six
Republican candidates got more than 15 minutes to respond to a
question. Two months later, Bush was suddenly a font of
interjections and rebuttals, as if he had to rush to fit in all
that he had to say. As he approaches what is almost certainly the
most important debate of his political career, a first encounter
with Vice President Al Gore in Boston next week, it is impossible
to know which incarnation of Bush will show up. Bush and Sen. John

from Boston who wanted to save the poor. But now Flynn, whose
political life came to a blistering and emotional end two years
ago, is coming back. The former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican says
his most concentrated effort has been his personal research into
the Charles Stuart murder-suicide case that cast a racial stain on
Boston during his reign as mayor. Flynn is using his time to write
books that tap into his creativity and his experiences will all be

<TEXT>
<P>
   The final Los Angeles-area tour event of the year returns to
Wilshire Country Club next month, when Joe Inman takes aim at a
third consecutive title in the Senior PGA Tour competition known
this year as the SBC Senior Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Wilshire has been like a second home to Inman, who was an upset
winner twice there for his only two senior victories after coming
in both times hoping only to play well enough to secure his tour
card for another season.
</P>
<P>
   His victims at Wilshire amount to a who's who of the Senior
Tour, including runner-up Lee Trevino and two-time defending
champion Gil Morgan in 1998, when the event was known as the
Pacific Bell Senior Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Inman shot a closing 65 in the final Pacific Bell
Senior Classic to finish two strokes ahead of Dave Stockton and
Bruce Summerhays in a field that included player of the year Bruce
Fleisher and senior superstar Hale Irwin, plus Trevino and Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Inman might have to hold off the broadcast booth as
well, with announcer-turned-contender Gary McCord waging a season
stretch run to earn a title defense of his Senior Tour
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The funny and fun-loving McCord, a nonwinner during 25 years on
the regular tour but a megastar at corporate outings, showed how
well he has aged last year by winning the season-ending Senior Tour
Championship. But McCord needs a top-31 finish on the 2000 season
earnings list to return to the Tour Championship and entered this
week 38th with five tournaments remaining _ including the
season-ending Wilshire event, Oct. 27-29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will play as much as I have to to get in,'' he said. ``A win
would probably be enough to get me in.''
</P>
<P>
   If he needs the win at Wilshire, McCord is in the right area.
His first Senior Tour win came in Southern California, at last
year's Toshiba Classic in Newport Beach. Although the colorful CBS
analyst says he never dreamed of even talking about winning on the
regular tour, the victory at Newport Beach changed his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the first one made me realize I could do it,'' he
said. ``Then, winning the Tour Championship clinched it. I never
got over that hump on the regular tour. I didn't win there for a
billion years. Now, all I think about is winning and having fun
while I'm doing it.''

1989, will be without that event this year following the Shootout's
move to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Area golf fans, however, won't miss a chance to see Sherwood's
splendor or top pros this fall, as the Tiger Woods Foundation
Williams World Challenge fills the November gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams event, which will include Woods and 11 of the
world's top players, is scheduled the week of Nov. 27-Dec. 3 and
has already attracted No. 3 in the world David Duval, reigning
Masters champion Vijay Singh and defending Williams champion Tom
Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman won by three strokes over Duval in last year's 72-hole
stroke-play competition at Scottsdale, Ariz. This year's winner
earns $1 million from a $3.5 million purse that makes the event one
of the richest of the offseason. It is also the major fund-raiser
for the Tiger Woods Foundation, which has used golf to interact
with more than 60,000 young people across America.

Expo, the annual spring golf show run so successfully by the
section that it funded the SCGPA's new twin-course home at Oak
Valley, will operate next year as an alliance project of SCPGA and
International Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   The name will stay the same and the Expo will continue to be
managed by the SCPGA, but the partnership makes the Southern
California event the largest public golf show in the western U.S.
and part of IMG's National Golf Expo Series, which includes shows
in Ohio, Illinois and Massachusetts.
</P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Despite higher gasoline prices and a diminishing
supply of homes, California's economy is expected to continue to
expand in the coming years at a rate not seen in more than a
decade, a University of California, Los Angeles, survey predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Wednesday by the UCLA Anderson School of
Business also predicts nonfarm employment will rise 3.8 percent
this year, up from 3.1 in 1999. Employment is expected to grow 2.6
percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a truly stellar performance, particularly when you
realize that we didn't grow at all for the first half of the
1990s,'' said Rajeev Dhawan, director of econometric modeling at
UCLA and author of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rosy picture painted by the Anderson survey, one
prominent economist not associated with the survey warned that
Southern California's economic expansion could be curtailed by
increased gasoline prices, a prolonged bus drivers strike and
several possible strikes that are looming on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic fundamentals look rather good, but there is just
enough factors out there that now is the time for a more cautious
stance,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles
Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit group that tracks and
promotes the five-county Los Angeles area's business community.
</P>
<P>
   The Anderson survey sees few clouds on the horizon. Employment
grew by 2.2 percent for the year to date in Los Angeles County,
compared with 1.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of California's international markets will also
contribute to continued job growth for the rest of this year and
next in areas such as wholesale trade and transportation, said
Dhawan.
</P>
<P>
   A slower state growth rate, 2.4 percent, forecast for nonfarm
employment in 2002 should reflect an overall slowing in the
domestic economy, Dhawan said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the California economy has grown on average by 3.2
percent in the last five years, a rate not seen since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem is the housing market, which could create a
drag on the state's economy,'' he said. ``Affordability will become
an issue down the road, if high home prices prompt residents to
leave or prevent newcomers from settling in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser disagreed, saying affordability is already an issue. ``The
issue of home prices is already a problem if you go to the Bay
Area. It is starting to cause some distortions not only in Silicon
Valley, but in other parts of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, for example, has experienced an increase in home
prices because of refugee dot-com companies leaving Silicon Valley
and migrating to less expensive areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by the California Association of
Realtors, the median price of a home in the Golden State rose to a
record $255,580 during August. The price was 14 percent higher than
the August 1999 median price of $224,200.
</P>
<P>
   New residential construction in California for the first-quarter
of 2000 was the best seen in almost 10 years, the UCLA forecast
said. However, both sales and permits were down in April, they
picked up the pace in June in spite of the Federal Reserve's recent
interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Dhawan said some weakness was noted in the July numbers, but the
full impact of the Fed's rate hikes should be felt later this year.
</P>
<P>
   What helped save the housing sector this summer have been
rallies in the Nasdaq market and a drop in the 10-year bond rate
that lowered the mortgage rate from its highs in early summer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this year should turn out to be a good year for new
construction, with 150,000 new permits compared with 140,000 in
1999. The next two years will also be relatively good ones for
construction, with 145,000 new permits predicted for 2001, and
153,000 for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Construction employment, currently the highest in history, is
nearing 749,300 in California, and in August was 9.4 percent higher
than the year-ago total.
</P>
<P>
   California's employment growth has been double the national rate
for the last year and that trend is expected to continue, said
Dhawan. The state's unemployment rate, recently erratic but rising
and currently at 5 percent, will hold steady at this level for the
next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. unemployment rate is expected to rise from 4.1 percent
to 4.4 percent next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, central California continues to experience
double-digit rates of unemployment. Unemployment rates are highest
in Tulare County, 15.8 percent, and Fresno County at 14.1 percent,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The high unemployment figures reflect the fact that the region's
economy remains based on agriculture, said Kyser.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, inland Riverside and San Bernardino
counties continued to lead the state in employment growth an
increase of 5.2 percent through May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason this is going on is Southern California has always
had an area that was its hot zone,'' said John Husing, a regional
economist with Economics &AMP; Politics in Highland. ``Previously it
was the San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Valley and Orange County.
It just happens to be the Inland Empire's turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Husing said another reason for the amazing job growth is that
most of the rest of Southern California is running out of space to
build industrial or commercial facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a consequence of that if they want to build new facilities
they are almost forced to go to the Inland Empire, whether they
want to or not,'' he said. ``Because we have the space, it's also
cheaper to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending remains anything but cautious. As measured by
taxable sales, the survey predicts that sales will continue to
reflect strength in personal income and employment gains.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 increase of 9.9 percent in statewide taxable sales will
be followed by gains of 10.9 percent this year, 5.6 percent in 2001
and 5.3 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The survey predicts that total immigration will average slightly
less than 250,000 people annually through 2002 and the overall
population should grow by 1.6 percent per year for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   As for exports, Dhawan predicted the strong gains experienced in
2000 would continue to grow in 2001 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   After showing a modest gain of 2.4 percent in 1999, state
exports posted a 21.2 percent year-to-year increase in the second
quarter. Mexico continued to be the leading destination for
California exports, increasing 34.5 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   California's second-largest trading partner Japan showed a gain
of 18.3 percent in the second quarter, while Canada was third,
followed by South Korea and Taiwan.

Barbra Streisand's farewell concerts at Madison Square Garden this
week were officially sold out within hours, but the true story is
closer to ``I Can Get It for You Wholesale.'' The concerts
Wednesday and Thursday night were officially sold out within hours.
But plenty of tickets were being offered by brokers over the
Internet on Wednesday at prices ranging from $500 to $1,500 or
more. The face value of the tickets was $125 to $1,500, with VIP
tickets going for $2,500, including dinner. (Michelle V. Agins/The

Moffett abandoned her comfortable longtime job as a legal secretary
on Wall Street to be one of 320 ``teaching fellows'' -- people with
little or no teaching experience, hired by Schools Chancellor
Harold Levy to fill chronic vacancies in the system's most troubled
schools. In August, the fellows took a crash course in teaching and
eight hours of certification exams. In these first weeks of school,
Moffett is learning that teaching is only part of her job

TV-GIDEON-BRAUGHER -- Actresses inspire Andre Braugher more than
actors, because he believes weakness is almost bred out of men.
That's why he has never seen Hamlet played as the coward he
believes he is. Braugher is starring in his second television
series, ``Gideon's Crossing,'' a hospital drama on ABC. He plays
Dr. Ben Gideon, a character based on Dr. Jerome Groopman, a Boston
physician who chronicled his clinical experiences in the 1997 book
``The Measure of Our Days.'' While the role isn't exactly Hamlet,
the character appears to be complex enough to keep Braugher's fires
fed for now. (Monica Almeida/The New York Times)

at the New York Film Festival, is the first of Edward Yang's seven
features to reach American theaters. Set, like all his films, in
middle-class Taipei, ``Yi Yi'' provides an engaging introduction to
Yang's fictional universe, in part because of its bemused approach
to family life. Yang has been compared with Michelangelo Antonioni
and Jean-Luc Godard and his 1991 film ``A Brighter Summer Day'' is
considered one of the modern era's greatest Chinese-language films.

``Girlfight'' is about ``an outsider who enters a world where she
does not belong and finds a place for herself,'' says director
Karyn Kusama. The film, which opened Friday, is the story of a
sullen, gum chewing, muscular girl from the underclass, played by
Michelle Rodriguez, who literally fights her way into the ring. It
could be a metaphor for Kusama's bout with studios as she tried to
get financing. (Ruby Washington/The New York Times)

location. U.S. Olympic runner Angelo Taylor, was less than thrilled
Wednesday when he learned he would start from Lane 1, on the inside

   (NYT23) WASHINGTON -- Sept. 27, 2000 -- GLENN-MATH-COX-2 -- The
nation should spend more than $5 billion a year to raise the
``unacceptable'' performance of the ``scandalously underpaid'' math
and science teachers to world standards, a national commission
reported on Wednesday. Former Sen. John Glenn, the ex-astronaut is
chairman of the National Commission on the Teaching of Science and
Math in the 21st Century. The report entitled ``Before It's Too
Late,'' cited often-used statistics from the mid-1990s that show
most Americans emerge from high school with less knowledge of math
and science than most students their age in other nations. Glenn

him into space 38 years ago. (Rick McKay/Cox News Service)

demolished a wall separating the kitchen from the living room. ``I

   LOS ANGELES -- Entertainment giant Sony said Wednesday its
release of PlayStation 2, billed as the biggest consumer
electronics launch in history, will be only half as big as the
company planned.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said its production schedule of PS 2 is lagging by about a
month because of a components shortage. The company trimmed its
estimate of the number of units available for the Oct. 26 launch to
500,000 from 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The news had a ripple effect on the stock market as shares of
video game software makers affiliated with Sony as well as Sony's
own shares dropped at the news. Among those dropping was THQ of
Calabasas, Calif., which will release its game Summoner in
conjunction with the platform's launch.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of THQ were down $3.38, or 13.8 percent, to close at
$21.06. Sony was down $9.63, or 8.8 percent, to close at $99.38 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks in general were down in anticipation of the negative
call from Sony,'' said Melissa Williams, an analyst who covers
retailing for brokerage Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
   Toy industry observers anticipate that PlayStation 2 will be
among the biggest holiday toy sellers, with the game platform being
virtually sold out through preorders even before its release.
Unlike the original PlayStation, the biggest-selling video game
platform ever, the new version can play DVD movies and will soon
offer broadband connections.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Sony to revise its estimate of available
units to approximately 700,000, Williams said. Even though the
revised estimate is lower, Williams expected stocks to rebound
today now that word is out.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Locke, THQ's executive vice president of North American
publishing, said the reduced shipments will have a negligible
effect on her company. THQ expects sales of Summoner, its only PS 2
offering, to account for no more than 5 percent of the video game
maker's total fourth-quarter sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said that despite the setback, it still plans to ship as
many as 1.3 million units by Christmas, sending an additional
100,000 units every week through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The production delay does not affect our initial projections
for worldwide output,'' said Sony Computer Entertainment
spokeswoman Molly Smith.

Barbra Streisand's farewell concerts at Madison Square Garden this

Wednesday and Thursday night were officially sold out within hours.
But plenty of tickets were being offered by brokers over the
Internet on Wednesday at prices ranging from $500 to $1,500 or

little or no teaching experience, hired by Schools Chancellor
Harold Levy to fill chronic vacancies in the system's most troubled
schools. In August, the fellows took a crash course in teaching and
eight hours of certification exams. In these first weeks of school,
Moffett is learning that teaching is only part of her job
description -- for now, an achingly small part. Moffett with her

TV-GIDEON-BRAUGHER -- Actresses inspire Andre Braugher more than
actors, because he believes weakness is almost bred out of men.
That's why he has never seen Hamlet played as the coward he
believes he is. Braugher is starring in his second television
series, ``Gideon's Crossing,'' a hospital drama on ABC. He plays
Dr. Ben Gideon, a character based on Dr. Jerome Groopman, a Boston
physician who chronicled his clinical experiences in the 1997 book
``The Measure of Our Days.'' While the role isn't exactly Hamlet,
the character appears to be complex enough to keep Braugher's fires
fed for now. (Monica Almeida/The New York Times)

at the New York Film Festival, is the first of Edward Yang's seven
features to reach American theaters. Set, like all his films, in
middle-class Taipei, ``Yi Yi'' provides an engaging introduction to
Yang's fictional universe, in part because of its bemused approach
to family life. Yang has been compared with Michelangelo Antonioni
and Jean-Luc Godard and his 1991 film ``A Brighter Summer Day'' is
considered one of the modern era's greatest Chinese-language films.

``Girlfight'' is about ``an outsider who enters a world where she
does not belong and finds a place for herself,'' says director
Karyn Kusama. The film, which opened Friday, is the story of a
sullen, gum chewing, muscular girl from the underclass, played by
Michelle Rodriguez, who literally fights her way into the ring. It
could be a metaphor for Kusama's bout with studios as she tried to
get financing. (Ruby Washington/The New York Times)

nation should spend more than $5 billion a year to raise the
``unacceptable'' performance of the ``scandalously underpaid'' math
and science teachers to world standards, a national commission
reported on Wednesday. Former Sen. John Glenn, the ex-astronaut is
chairman of the National Commission on the Teaching of Science and
Math in the 21st Century. The report entitled ``Before It's Too
Late,'' cited often-used statistics from the mid-1990s that show
most Americans emerge from high school with less knowledge of math
and science than most students their age in other nations. Glenn
stands next to ``Friendship 7,'' the first spacecraft that carried
him into space 38 years ago. (Rick McKay/Cox News Service)

about math and science as is necessary to protect the nation's
prestige, good jobs, military security and competitive position in

   (NYT21) NEW YORK -- Sept. 27, 2000 -- KITCHEN-REMODEL -- At age
89, Will Machado, an interior designer gave himself an inspiring
present: a minimalist Zen kitchen that is warm, serene and
efficient. He wanted a kitchen that was easy to walk around, and he
demolished a wall separating the kitchen from the living room. ``I
wanted to simplify my life,'' he says, but even with a $30,000
budget (including demolition) he had to make trade-offs. He loves
wood for its warmth and tactility, and he hired Stephen Iino, a
cabinetmaker, to execute his design in ash and maple. (Fred R.

Republican candidates got more than 15 minutes to respond to a
question. Two months later, Bush was suddenly a font of
interjections and rebuttals, as if he had to rush to fit in all
that he had to say. As he approaches what is almost certainly the
most important debate of his political career, a first encounter
with Vice President Al Gore in Boston next week, it is impossible
to know which incarnation of Bush will show up. Workers carry in

political life came to a blistering and emotional end two years
ago, is coming back. The former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican says
his most concentrated effort has been his personal research into

FARGAS' MOVE LEAVES `WHAT-IFS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news that Michigan's Justin Fargas asked for a switch to the
secondary could only cause head-shaking from those who watched the
former Notre Dame High star become the No. 1-rated prep tailback in
the nation three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And make the same people wonder what would have happened if
Fargas had stayed home instead of going to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   __ He might be splitting time at tailback with DeShaun Foster at
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ He might be working on his third year starting for USC.
</P>
<P>
   __ He would not be playing in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   __ He would not have suffered a career-threatening injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to dissuade him from moving, but he told me he
absolutely wants to make the move,'' Michigan coach Lloyd Carr
said. ``I'm excited because he's excited. I think Justin will be an
outstanding defensive back.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps UCLA coach Bob Toledo was right when he said two weeks
ago that Fargas could start at cornerback for the Bruins. But
before breaking his leg two years ago, Fargas was on track to
become a spectacular back for the Wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried as hard as we could to get him,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said, after hearing Fargas was switching positions.
</P>
<P>
   The injury drastically altered Fargas' career and makes those
who saw him play in high school sound silly today: They know how
good he was and how good he could have been if he had not been
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Fargas isn't the only California phenom to switch positions.
Last year, D.J. Williams of Concord De La Salle was considered the
top prep player in the nation and projected to be a linebacker at
the school of his choice.
</P>
<P>
   Williams showed little interest in staying home and signed with
Miami. He was quickly moved to fullback and is starting to make the
transition to college. Williams had two carries for 10 yards and
caught three passes for 54 yards against West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Williams played on special teams in the loss at Washington, and
in the season-opening victory over McNeese State, he had one carry
for 2 yards and one reception for 13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us a huge shot and made three or four big plays in the
first half that gave us first downs,'' coach Butch Davis said. ``He
was a big infusion in the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams suffered a hip injury against West Virginia and is
uncertain for this week's game against Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fan control: After Oregon fans abused UCLA players after last
week's game in Autzen Stadium, extra security precautions are being
taken for this week's game against archrival Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) could be a real problem,'' Oregon athletic director Bill
Moos said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Anti-Aggies: Texas Tech defensive tackle Kris Kocurek, who
grew up a Texas A&AMP;M fan, put this week's meeting with the Aggies in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we beat them, and only them, then I would consider it a
good season,'' Kocurek said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Boz is back: Before Oklahoma's game at Rice, the Sooners'
1985 national-championship team was honored, which allowed former
All-America linebacker Brian Bosworth to address the team.
</P>

   Torretta just happened to be in Tallahassee working the game for

   That was the Seminoles' last loss at home. Their 48-game
unbeaten streak is the longest in the nation.

   ``There's been a lot of changes,'' Torretta said. ``They've
added 20,000 seats in here, so I know it's a lot louder. We always
used to say at Miami that they added seats because they couldn't
beat us. Boy, the shoe's on the other foot now.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Shakeout hits General Cinemas

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ General Cinemas appears to be closing at least three
of its five metro Atlanta theater locations in yet another sign of
trouble for an overbuilt industry.
</P>
<P>
   General Cinema and other theater chains are plagued by a glut of
movie screens nationwide. Columbus-based Carmike Cinemas filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August and has since closed
about a half-dozen metro Atlanta locations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for General Cinema declined to comment on the
chain's plans, but real estate brokers say the company is marketing
a block of theater sites in the area. General Cinema's parent
company, GC Cos., has said it is contemplating a bankruptcy filing
to restructure debts.
</P>
<P>
   The chain is also closing a number of theaters in other markets,
including 11 theaters in Florida. General Cinema, with 130 theaters
and nearly 1,100 screens nationwide, announced plans last year to
unload some of its older, smaller theaters in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a six-screen General Cinema was torn down at
a metro Atlanta mall to make way for an expansion. Chris Carlaw of
Rouse Co., part owner of the mall, said there are no plans to build
a replacement theater for at least two years, the time he thinks it
will take for the industry shakeout to level out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is to halt any conversations until consolidation
has played out,'' said Carlaw, development director with the
Maryland-based company. ``There will be some survivors and some
that will get swallowed up. We think the prudent approach is to sit
on the sidelines and let it play out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many chains are building 14-, 16- and 18-screen megaplexes
featuring steeply tiered stadium seating, advance ticket sales and
valet parking. But nice as they are, the megaplexes are
overwhelming the industry with more screens than it can handle.
</P>
<P>
   If General Cinemas declares bankruptcy, it would join Carmike,
United Artists and Edwards Cinemas in seeking protection from
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Regal Cinemas, the largest U.S. theater chain, said last month
it had begun seeking relief from bank agreements. Loews Cineplex
Entertainment Corp. has warned it might default on its debt.

   (NYT31) NEW YORK -- Sept. 27, 2000 -- NY-BARBARA-STREISAND --
Barbra Streisand's farewell concerts at Madison Square Garden this
week were officially sold out within hours, but the true story is
closer to ``I Can Get It for You Wholesale.'' The concerts
Wednesday and Thursday night were officially sold out within hours.
But plenty of tickets were being offered by brokers over the
Internet on Wednesday at prices ranging from $500 to $1,500 or
more. The face value of the tickets was $125 to $1,500, with VIP
tickets going for $2,500, including dinner. (Michelle V. Agins/The

privately owned public spaces in New York City, created in a

in some way, large or small, a new study has found. Chained gates

with natural stone can be a rewarding experience because a project
finished in stone has a rustic charm that is unmatched in any other
building material. Stone is easy to work with because it requires
minimal dressing and shaping, although gathering and positioning
stones calls for a lot of muscle and sweat. (Ed Lipinski/The New

   (NYT28) NEW YORK -- Sept. 27, 2000 -- NY-NEW-TEACHER -- Donna
Moffett abandoned her comfortable longtime job as a legal secretary
on Wall Street to be one of 320 ``teaching fellows'' -- people with
little or no teaching experience, hired by Schools Chancellor
Harold Levy to fill chronic vacancies in the system's most troubled
schools. In August, the fellows took a crash course in teaching and
eight hours of certification exams. In these first weeks of school,
Moffett is learning that teaching is only part of her job
description -- for now, an achingly small part. Moffett with her

   (NYT27) HOLLYWOOD -- Sept. 27, 2000 -- ADV. FOR OCT. 1 --
TV-GIDEON-BRAUGHER -- Actresses inspire Andre Braugher more than
actors, because he believes weakness is almost bred out of men.
That's why he has never seen Hamlet played as the coward he
believes he is. Braugher is starring in his second television
series, ``Gideon's Crossing,'' a hospital drama on ABC. He plays
Dr. Ben Gideon, a character based on Dr. Jerome Groopman, a Boston
physician who chronicled his clinical experiences in the 1997 book
``The Measure of Our Days.'' While the role isn't exactly Hamlet,
the character appears to be complex enough to keep Braugher's fires
fed for now. (Monica Almeida/The New York Times)

at the New York Film Festival, is the first of Edward Yang's seven
features to reach American theaters. Set, like all his films, in
middle-class Taipei, ``Yi Yi'' provides an engaging introduction to
Yang's fictional universe, in part because of its bemused approach
to family life. Yang has been compared with Michelangelo Antonioni
and Jean-Luc Godard and his 1991 film ``A Brighter Summer Day'' is
considered one of the modern era's greatest Chinese-language films.

FILM-GIRLFIGHT -- Like more traditional boxing movies before it,
``Girlfight'' is about ``an outsider who enters a world where she
does not belong and finds a place for herself,'' says director
Karyn Kusama. The film, which opened Friday, is the story of a
sullen, gum chewing, muscular girl from the underclass, played by
Michelle Rodriguez, who literally fights her way into the ring. It
could be a metaphor for Kusama's bout with studios as she tried to
get financing. (Ruby Washington/The New York Times)

For race horses and race drivers, the inside lane is the place to

location. U.S. Olympic runner Angelo Taylor, was less than thrilled
Wednesday when he learned he would start from Lane 1, on the inside

   (NYT23) WASHINGTON -- Sept. 27, 2000 -- GLENN-MATH-COX-2 -- The
nation should spend more than $5 billion a year to raise the
``unacceptable'' performance of the ``scandalously underpaid'' math
and science teachers to world standards, a national commission
reported on Wednesday. Former Sen. John Glenn, the ex-astronaut is
chairman of the National Commission on the Teaching of Science and
Math in the 21st Century. The report entitled ``Before It's Too
Late,'' cited often-used statistics from the mid-1990s that show
most Americans emerge from high school with less knowledge of math
and science than most students their age in other nations. Glenn
stands next to ``Friendship 7,'' the first spacecraft that carried
him into space 38 years ago. (Rick McKay/Cox News Service)

   (NYT21) NEW YORK -- Sept. 27, 2000 -- KITCHEN-REMODEL -- At age
89, Will Machado, an interior designer gave himself an inspiring
present: a minimalist Zen kitchen that is warm, serene and
efficient. He wanted a kitchen that was easy to walk around, and he
demolished a wall separating the kitchen from the living room. ``I
wanted to simplify my life,'' he says, but even with a $30,000
budget (including demolition) he had to make trade-offs. He loves
wood for its warmth and tactility, and he hired Stephen Iino, a
cabinetmaker, to execute his design in ash and maple. (Fred R.

DRUG-COST BILL MAY NOT DENT INDUSTRY PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a bill allowing imports of low-priced prescription drugs
became law, drug companies would be able to use many tactics to
protect their profits, Wall Street analysts said Wednesday, and to
keep the amount of reimported drugs to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups gave the plan to reimport prescription medicines
from countries like Canada or Mexico a tepid thumbs-up Wednesday,
saying they would continue to push elected officials to do more to
rein in drug prices. Drug prices are now the leading cause of the
nation's rising health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not jumping for joy,'' said Judy Waxman, deputy
executive director of Families USA, a nonprofit group in Washington
that focuses on making health care more affordable. ``It could
possibly help some people. But we don't know how it will play
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry makes most of its profit in the
United States, the only major country where the government has not
enacted controls on drug prices. The drug reimportation bill now
pending in Congress is meant to chip away at those profits. But
analysts said Wednesday that they could not yet predict just how
the industry could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Neil B. Sweig, an analyst at Ryan Beck &AMP; Co., said that prices
of some drugs could decline by as much as 30 percent to 40 percent
_ which is estimated to be the average difference between prices in
the United States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts said they expected the companies to be able
to minimize the sale of reimported drugs by keeping tight controls
on the quantities of drugs shipped to lower-priced countries or by
sharpening the differences between foreign-sold and American-sold
pills. For example, said Richard T. Evans, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co., the companies could make the pills sold in foreign
countries different sizes, shapes and colors from the drugs sold
here, which would keep them from being reimported.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, House Republican leaders announced that they would
approve the Senate-passed version of a drug reimportation bill,
which is also favored by President Clinton. The move by Republicans
makes passage of the bill into law almost certain.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow pharmacies and wholesale distributors to
buy prescription drugs abroad, reimport them and then sell them to
consumers at a lower cost. The measure is not expected to have an
impact for two years because the Food and Drug Administration will
need to write regulations to govern the imports.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is aimed at helping people who take drugs like
Prilosec, a popular heartburn drug sold by AstraZeneca. According
to an analysis by the National Council of Senior Citizens, the U.S.
retail cost of a monthly supply of Prilosec is $105.50. The same
number of Prilosec pills sell for $53.51 in Canada and $29.46 in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A monthly supply of another drug, Fosamax, a medication for
osteoporosis that is made by Merck &AMP; Co., sells for $169.73 in the
United States, according to the council's analysis. That compares
with a price of $45.01 in Canada and $51.33 in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Closing that price gap by even a fraction would hurt the profits
of drug companies because of their dependence on sales in the
United States, which is the largest and fastest-growing market for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of reimporting drugs into the United States is similar
to a process now allowed in Europe. Companies known as parallel
importers have been able to make a business of shipping products
from southern European countries like Spain and Greece, where drug
prices are low, to northern countries like Britain and Germany,
where prices are higher.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the opportunities, parallel importing accounts for
less than 5 percent of European drug revenue, said Jeffrey
Chaffkin, an analyst at PaineWebber, in a recent report. The drug
companies have been able to minimize the impact, Chaffkin said, by
tightly controlling the quantities of drugs they ship to
lower-priced countries.
</P>
<P>
   Evans of Bernstein said that the companies could also make
slight changes at their factories that make drugs for other
countries so that the drugs would no longer meet the requirements
of the FDA and could not be reimported. Evans said that could be as
easy as switching a single step in the manufacturing process, like
the pressing of the drugs into pills, to a facility that did not
choose to seek FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweig at Ryan, Beck said he did not believe that the
companies would be so successful at minimizing the impact. He said
he expected prices to drop first for popular oral drugs that are
used for chronic problems like high cholesterol, arthritis or heart
disease. Later, Sweig said, prices of injectible drugs used by
hospitals should come down.

 &HT;    Leaning on family, friends helps Taylor hurdle to gold
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Just as soon as the momentum of a full-throttle,
leaning finish played out, Angelo Taylor dropped to his knees on
the Olympic track that more than ever looked the color of Georgia
clay.
</P>
<P>
   He folded his hands, bowed his head and gave his thanks, not
knowing that his last lunge had indeed held off the surprise Saudi,
Hadi Souan Somayli, and that his night was golden.
</P>
<P>
   What a solitary figure he was, this one kneeling soul on the
floor of the 103,000-seat house. But whatever other doubts Taylor
took with him to prayer, one thing he knew for certain: No one
makes it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Before the world's best 400-meter hurdler took his mark, he had
been better buttressed than most storm shelters. All day, friends
and family kept filling his head with positive messages and
soothing vibes. They changed the oil, tuned the engine and rotated
all four tires on his ego.
</P>
<P>
   And Taylor had needed it. Not winning his semifinal heat had put
him at the mercy of a draw for his final lane assignment. His
number came up ``one,'' the most inside and undesirable lane they
make. Taylor hadn't run from Lane 1 in three years, failing to
advance in a semifinal then. He'd have to lean that long, thin
frame of his into the steepest of turns and dig that much harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why they put you in No. 1, don't you?'' posed his
mother, Subrena Glenn-Everett. ``That's because you are No. 1.''
Taylor had met with his assembled family the morning of the final.
They prayed then, too. His mother gave him a verse of scripture to
slip into his running shoe come race time.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor called Derrick Adkins, the 400-meter hurdle Olympic
champion in 1996 and Georgia Tech teammate. He took calls from his
old high school coach, Napoleon Cobb and former assistant Vincent
Elder. Another call from Tech coach Grover Hinsdale. Just 90
minutes before the final, Terrence Trammell, the 110-meter hurdle
silver medalist, filled his ear with more inspiring tidings.
</P>
<P>
   You're the fastest man in the race, don't forget that, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane 1 is ideal, since you're such a closer.
</P>
<P>
   Others have won from there (the last being John Akii-Bua in
1972, in world-record time).
</P>
<P>
   Just run contained and in control, and attack those last three
hurdles down the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   If the 21-year-old Taylor didn't do something spectacular with
this race, it wouldn't be for lack of support. ``They helped me
believe I could win out of Lane 1,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came this great voice from above. It wasn't the Almighty's
answer to Taylor's prayer, but the next best thing. Angelo Taylor
was proclaimed Olympic champion. Everything he was told had came
true. He did run in perfect control, his timing over the opening
hurdles as good as it had been all summer. He stormed through the
finishing hurdles, contorting his face almost beyond recognition
with the effort. He ran the field into the ground at the end. He
won in an excruciating lean. All in a personal-best 47.50 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later, Greece's King Constantine was hanging a
gold medal from his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the epitome of the best,'' said Taylor's mother, taking
superlatives to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   A most amazing thing has happened over one three-day period in
Australia. Two kids from the same high school a half a world away
watched an Olympics in their hometown in 1996 and decided they were
going to be running in the next one. Not just some Olympics, the
next Olympics, no matter how young they were. Improbably, Trammell
and Taylor were as good as their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes more and more incredible the more it settles in,''
said Cobb, the high school track coach who made the pilgrimage here
to witness the ultimate payoff to a life's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two kids a year apart at the same school go gold-silver in the
same Olympics? I think your chances are better of hitting the
lottery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There had to be a heavenly convergence of family and coaching to
get these two to a medal platform in the same Games. And Atlanta
can long debate the legacy of its Olympics, but it will always have
the accomplishment of two native sons to point to.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have grown up watching all those Olympics, to have seen
them in my hometown and then to be a part of them. It's hard to put
into words,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the Olympic Games at home had to be a factor,'' Cobb
said. ``I still remember both of them telling me after they had
seen their events in Atlanta that they were going to be in the 2000
Olympics. That had to give them the motivation . . .''

 &HT;    Panther Pride in hurdles
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ When he picked up his cell phone, Angelo Taylor didn't
know what to make of the over-the-top banter ringing in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Here he was, an hour from the race of his life, prone on a
massage table, and Terrence Trammell was calling from inside the
Olympic Stadium, trying to pump him up like they were back in high
school and Buck Godrey was sending them out against their fiercest
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Lane 1, killer tight turns . . . nearly impossible to bring home
the gold from there?
</P>
<P>
   Panther Pride, baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crazy,'' laughed Taylor, basking in the glow of his
Olympic gold-medal run in the 400-meter hurdles. ``He was more
hyped than I was. He said a lot of things, like `bring it home to
Atlanta. Not just any medal _ the gold.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As it played out, Trammell had it all right. Nothing could keep
Taylor from his gold medal Wednesday. Not even the almost
disastrous, unlucky draw of having to navigate his angular,
6-foot-3 frame around the inside lane.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor put metro Atlanta's Southwest DeKalb High School in the
history books _ joining Trammell as the first high school teammates
to win track medals at the same Games _ dipping smartly at the
finish line to eke past Hadi Souan Somayli of Saudi Arabia before a
packed Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first ever Olympic medal for the Saudis, and it's
expected Somayli earned himself a king's ransom.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, Taylor shot a quick glance to his right at his
rival, and then cupped his hands while dropping to his knees in
prayer. ``I didn't know who won the race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell's silver medal sprint two days earlier in the 110-meter
hurdles. And it followed up on the gold medal effort in Atlanta
four years ago by training partner Derrick Adkins _ both under the
tutelage of Georgia Tech coach Grover Hinsdale, officially crowning
him the top intermediate hurdler coach.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor won in a personal-best 47.50 seconds, a blink of an eye
better than Adkins' clocking of 47.54 in Atlanta. Not surprising,
it was also the fastest time ever run out of Lane One.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't I tell you, man,'' screamed Trammell, hugging Taylor as
he came off the track, draped in the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lane One, baby,'' Taylor shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell had phoned Taylor at the adjacent warmup track,
determined to pump up his spirits about the draw of the inside
lane, which hadn't launched a winner since John Akii-Bua at the
1972 Munich Games.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they were joined near the finish by Taylor's fiance
Tangela Wobbleton, brother Corey and sister Alexandria _ all with
``Go Angelo'' painted in blue on their face. They abandoned their
seats deep in the upper-deck to stand along the rail on the first
turn during the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to find a way to get down and see my brother run,'' said
Corey Taylor, a hurdler himself at South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The support system was on full alert all day leading to the
race. Hinsdale called from Atlanta, exhorting Taylor to be
particularly careful to hold his form on the curves so the
centrifical force wouldn't pull him away from the inside rail and
eat up valuable time.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor spent the day holed up in the athlete village, selling
himself on the idea that location wouldn't be his demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he'd shock the world,'' Trammell said of his final
words. ``I told him he was in Lane One, because it represents
first-place. I know my boy, and he wasn't going to let anything as
simple as Lane One stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did he win the gold medal from Lane One, he ran a
(personal-best) from Lane One. That shows the world it doesn't
matter where you put Angelo Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Taylor managed to turn Lane One to his advantage. He
normally ends up in a middle-of-the-track lane, where his patented
late surge is in full view of the opposition. Because the lanes are
staggered and one starts further up the track than the others,
Taylor ran invisible to the field until the lanes evened down the
backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   He also caught a break when Somayli messed up his steps as he
approached the 10th and last hurdle. When he pulled back coming off
the hurdle, Taylor pounced and used his tremendous closing surge to
capture gold.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was so spent that rather than jogging a victory lap, he
walked around the oval. But in the end, Southwest DeKalb had its
second Olympic medal and Taylor also positioned himself for another
in the 1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on championship teams in high school,'' Taylor said
of he and Trammell's success here. ``Winning is nothing new to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both were talents the day they walked through the school door.
Together, they helped bring state titles in football and track.
Trammell was the top high school track athlete in the country his
senior year. Later, they earned national college track athlete of
the year _ Trammell twice.
</P>
<P>
   For years ago, Taylor only watched the Olympics after just
missing to qualify for the trials as a high school senior. That
summer, he and Dwight Phillips, his roommate who is in the
long-jump final Thursday, were part of a 1,600-meter relay that
broke the Junior Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 21, came here as the gold-medal favorite, though wiser
for a humbling experience at last summer's World Championships. In
a first-round race, he miscalculated the automatic qualifer to the
next round _ thinking it was the top four finishers when it was
three _ and never had the chance to win his medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching the final last year and knowing it should have been
mind, I took it to heart,'' Taylor said. ``But having the gold in
Seville or this, I'll take this.''

A RUNOFF IS ORDERED, GIVING MILOSEVIC A 2ND CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs to update, recast top of story; other changes
throughout)  By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ At about 2 a.m. on Thursday morning, just
hours after more than 200,000 people demonstrating support for
Vojislav Kostunica went home, the government of Slobodan Milosevic
suddenly announced that both candidates would have to meet in a
second round of presidential elections on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   This decision of the government-controlled federal election
commission, which was expected on Thursday night, was a shock to
the political system and showed that Milosevic would not leave
office without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to provoke anger here once people wake and a new
and explosive round of street demonstrations from Kostunica's
supporters, who believe he won the election with more than 50
percent of the vote in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica has vowed to boycott a second round and held out hope
that the commission would recognize his outright victory. In an
interview on Wednesday, he said of Milosevic, ``I think there is
now no way out for him. This is a situation that cannot last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know I won these elections,'' Kostunica said in the
interview. ``Why should I accept Milosevic's offer of a second
round? People won't understand it and will feel that I'm betraying
them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, to the massed and happy crowd, shouting and
swaying under a clear night filled with stars, Kostunica said: ``We
tell them from this place that there is no second round. There is
no market in votes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the announcement of the middle of the night, the electoral
board said that, ``Based on the final results from 10,673 polling
sites, presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica won 2,474,392
votes, or 48.96 percent, and Slobodan Milosevic 1,951,761 votes, or
38.62 percent,'' and therefore, it said, the second round of voting
would go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a decision but a joke,'' Zoran Djindjic of the
Democratic Opposition of Serbia said of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been silent since the vote on Sunday, making no
appearances of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the crowd in Belgrade on Wednesday night _ one of
the largest in memory here _ was a message to Milosevic, too,
backed by other large rallies in towns like Novi Sad, where 35,000
gathered, and Nis, with 25,000. In addition, 15,000 rallied in
Kragujevac and 10,000 in Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
   Before the commission announcement, Western governments were
passing the word to Milosevic that his options were fast running
out, senior Western officials said in telephone interviews.
</P>
<P>
   They told Milosevic through his intermediaries that he had a few
days to renounce power and leave the country without difficulty, to
settle where he would, but that if he delayed, he could face arrest
and a trial in The Hague on war crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``His choice is to fight or make a graceful exit,'' a senior
Western official said. ``His only hope of avoiding The Hague is to
say, publicly and irrevocably, that he's leaving.'' If he leaves,
Russia and Belarus appear to be possible destinations.
</P>
<P>
   No Western country would publicly bless an arrangement like
this, the officials stressed, given Milosevic's indictment by the
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, a creation of the U.N. Security
Council. ``But there are enough people indicating, to the extent
he's listening, that he has a little time to make a dignified exit
without interference,'' another senior Western official said. ``We
want him to hear it loud and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The representatives of a number of Western nations left Belgrade
before the NATO bombing began last spring, and from a distance have
been lobbying the Serbs to overturn Milosevic, with offers to end
economic sanctions and provide aid.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Kostunica said Milosevic could cling to power
now only through repression. ``Politically he has no future, and
I'm not sure he can count on repression, either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica told the crowd that he was sure of his victory, given
their strength, and he had a message for the army and the police,
who did not interfere on Wednesday night. ``Our message to the army
and the police is that we are one,'' he said. ``The army and the
police are part of the people; they exist to protect the people,
not one man and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd shouted, ``He's finished!'' about Milosevic,
Kostunica asked, ``Why would our army, which was so courageous last
year against NATO, be afraid now of one man?''
</P>
<P>
   People in the crowd were happy but slightly unsure that
Milosevic was beaten. There was a sense of self-discovery and
suspense, caught in an historical tide that had not yet reached its
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's finished, because of the people here,'' said
Ivana Petrov, a 25-year-old medical student. ``We hope he'll go.
But he won't go so easily. Things here can't change that fast, even
if he does go.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Panic, a 22-year-old economics student: said: ``I think
that finally we'll win.'' How quickly? ``It's going to be tough,''
he said. ``People will have to go out onto the streets for many
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandar, a middle-aged man who would not give his surname,
said the atmosphere was fantastic. ``But you never know what the
authorities here can do,'' he said. ``We've had big rallies in
Belgrade before.'' But then he brightened. ``Now, though,'' he
said, ``all of Serbia is like this.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife broke in, saying, ``I think he's finished, and we are
very, very happy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, state television ran a straight report of a
news conference by the opposition leader Zoran Djindjic, although
it came after the airing of an interview with Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic, who blamed the international media and NATO
propaganda for deluding the voters.
</P>
<P>
   For Milosevic, calling the elections proved to be a blunder; his
term extended to next July, but he called the election early,
apparently hoping to cement and extent his hold.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, the army chief of staff who supports
Milosevic, gave an interview in which he said the army would stay
out of politics. He said that Milosevic ``will never order the army
to intervene against the people'' and that the army would ``respect
the choice'' of Yugoslavs in the presidential election.

BLUE CROSS AIMS FOR EXPANDED AFFORDABILITY

<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- In an effort to provide affordable
insurance to the thousands of Californians dropping or losing their
coverage, Blue Cross of California is set to begin offering
low-priced health insurance, a company spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Cross PlanScope program will offer California residents
a choice of seven different options beginning Jan. 1, for an
average monthly price of $105 per member.
</P>
<P>
   ``By offering these new options, we are definitely responding to
consumer demand for choice and flexibility,'' said Michael Chee, a
spokesman with Blue Cross of California, a Thousand Oaks-based
subsidiary of WellPoint Health Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   By consolidating their business, Chee said the company was
looking to keep their members insured during a time of rising
costs, while being able to offer an affordable product to the
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers want choice and WellPoint is responding to that
demand,'' said William McKeever, an analyst with Paine Webber in
New York. ``It's going to help WellPoint achieve a larger client
base in California. I expect them to try this in other markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, Blue Cross expects 477,000 members to
experience an average price reduction of $19 a month. The remaining
individual PPO members, some 243,000 are expected to see an
increase of $9 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, director of the Santa Monica-based Consumers for
Quality Care, was skeptical that the new health plans would
actually offer coverage to those who can't afford health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Cross is trying to create a policy that helps no one but
Blue Cross, because most people will never be able to use it,''
Court said. ``This is a major medical policy that requires a 25
percent co-pay, which doesn't help the uninsured get preventative
care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' argued Chee. ``What he misses is the fact
that there are preventative care options offered. We are offering
first-dollar coverage for office visits and generic prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, those options have been subject to out-of-pocket
expenses,'' he said.

SONY SLASHES DEBUT SHIPMENT FOR PLAYSTATION 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Entertainment giant Sony said Wednesday its
release of PlayStation 2, billed as the biggest consumer
electronics launch in history, will be only half as big as the
company planned.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said its production schedule of PS 2 is lagging by about a
month because of a components shortage. The company trimmed its
estimate of the number of units available for the Oct. 26 launch to
500,000 from 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The news had a ripple effect on the stock market as shares of
video game software makers affiliated with Sony as well as Sony's
own shares dropped at the news. Among those dropping was THQ of
Calabasas, Calif., which will release its game Summoner in
conjunction with the platform's launch.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of THQ were down $3.38, or 13.8 percent, to close at
$21.06. Sony was down $9.63, or 8.8 percent, to close at $99.38 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks in general were down in anticipation of the negative
call from Sony,'' said Melissa Williams, an analyst who covers
retailing for brokerage Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
   Toy industry observers anticipate that PlayStation 2 will be
among the biggest holiday toy sellers, with the game platform being
virtually sold out through preorders even before its release.
Unlike the original PlayStation, the biggest-selling video game
platform ever, the new version can play DVD movies and will soon
offer broadband connections.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Sony to revise its estimate of available
units to approximately 700,000, Williams said. Even though the
revised estimate is lower, Williams expected stocks to rebound
today now that word is out.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Locke, THQ's executive vice president of North American
publishing, said the reduced shipments will have a negligible
effect on her company. THQ expects sales of Summoner, its only PS 2
offering, to account for no more than 5 percent of the video game
maker's total fourth-quarter sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said that despite the setback, it still plans to ship as
many as 1.3 million units by Christmas, sending an additional
100,000 units every week through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The production delay does not affect our initial projections
for worldwide output,'' said Sony Computer Entertainment
spokeswoman Molly Smith.

A PARTING GIFT FROM THE BOSS WHO CARED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Colo., Calif., Ill.)   By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Much has been made of the fringe benefits of working
for a dot-com company _ the free cappuccino, the concierge services
and the lucrative stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But for one day last week, working the production line for a
company that makes floor wax and carpet cleaner brought the perk of
a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 19, Charlie Butcher, 84, the chairman of the
family-owned Butcher Co. in Marlborough, Mass., handed out bonus
checks to his 325 employees that totaled $18 million, a hefty chunk
of his proceeds from selling the company the day before. ``Some of
the folks are big, strong, strapping machine operators, and they
just filled up with tears,'' said Paul P. McLaughlin, the company's
president. ``They would just throw their arms around Charlie and
give him a big hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Ouellette, 42, who has been an administrative assistant
for over 10 years, would not disclose her share, but she did say
that the checks were weighted according to seniority and salary.
She estimated that each worker received at least $1.50 for every
hour worked over the years. The average works out to over $55,000
each. ``Charlie really wanted to take care of the hourly folks and
people who put in a lot of years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The employees knew of the impending sale and had heard rumors
that they might be receiving a bonus. Still, they had no hint of
the size _ which for some totaled more than a year's salary _ until
Butcher and his wife, Jane, flew out from their Colorado home to
close the deal with Johnson Wax Professional and hand out the
checks. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Rutherford, 41, has worked on the production floor for 22
years, and has never had such a windfall. ``I was just shocked,''
she said. ``I went over and hugged him and his wife. I couldn't say
anything, I was too nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, her hand was steady enough to take the check to the car
dealership the same day, where she bought the blue Jeep she had
been eyeing. Her 15-year-old daughter now has the bedroom furniture
she had been promised.
</P>
<P>
   For Butcher, this may be the biggest lump sum of bliss he has
delivered in his career, but he said employee satisfaction had been
a shrewd business strategy for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are happy in their jobs, they are at least twice
as productive,'' he said in a phone interview from his home in
Colorado, explaining his belief in higher starting salaries,
flexible work weeks and freedom for people to change jobs if they
are unhappy. That, he said, leads to fewer mistakes, better
production and more money for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that other businesses will follow his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful, easygoing philosophy,'' he said. ``At the
same time, I get the pleasure of being thought of as a neat guy.''
</P>
<P>
   About 130 employees are based in Marlborough, about 30 miles
west of Boston, with the rest in plants in Compton, Calif., and
Alsip, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   William Taylor, president of the Alsip division who has worked
for the company for 15 years, said that Butcher would act as a
unique cheerleader for the sales team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would tell them, `I want you guys to make me money, because
I'm going to give it right back to you,''' he said. ``They would
say, `Yeah, yeah.'''
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, it was true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange feeling,'' Taylor said. ``To me and to others,
we felt like it was far more than we actually deserved.''

<P>
   Butcher's grandfather, Charles Butcher, an installer of parquet
floors in many of Boston's grand homes, founded the company in
1880. His product was a paste wax called Boston Polish, which is
still respected in Martha Stewart's circle. But when Charlie
Butcher took over the company from his father and uncle in the
1950s, he turned it into a competitive player in the commercial
cleaning business.
</P>
<P>
   Butcher retired as chief executive in the 1970s and moved to
Colorado, although he often flew back for sales meetings and the
company-wide parties, picnics and barbecues that Butcher is known
for.
</P>
<P>
   His employees know him as unabashedly affectionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he spoke to people on the phone, from executive level all
the way down, he would end the conversation with `I love you,'''

department, said. ``We all grew to understand that it was a sincere
and heartfelt remark.''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, the chairman decided to sell the company this year,
partly to free up money for the Lazy Eight Foundation, a charitable
research organization that he founded three years ago, and partly
because he did not have the capital to make necessary changes in
the company's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   He ruled out a stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I went public I wouldn't be able to give out $18
million,'' he said. ``Investors are very tight with their money. If
investors understood how much good it does to have happy, loving
and productive employees, they would agree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he told the employees of his intention to sell this summer,
it sent ripples of anxiety through the tight-knit company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I wasn't going to have a job,'' Rutherford said. ``I
didn't know who was going to buy us. It was kind of
nerve-racking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Butcher was, as usual, looking out ``for all the cars in the
parking lot.'' Although he said other companies offered him more
money, he chose to deal with the spinoff of S.C. Johnson &AMP; Son
Inc., another family-owned company with a 114-year history of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   J. Gary Raley, the president for North American operations at
Johnson Wax, based in Sturtevant, Wis., said the plan was to let
Butcher Co. operate independently, with the same name and
employees. As a welcome-to-the-family gesture, he has sent each
worker a basket filled with Pledge, Glade and Windex products.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the unexpected gain is as good as spent, workers said,
mentioning things like televisions, college trust funds, vinyl
siding and long-overdue prescription eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the money, they said, parting with Charlie will be
bittersweet.

MANY PARENTS SAY ISSUE OF VIOLENCE IN MEDIA WILL NOT INFLUENCE
THEIR VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich.)   (Eds: CORRECTS ``Kroger's'' to ``Kroger'' thruout)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAND, Mich. _ Overwhelmed by the competing proposals in a
tight presidential race, Michael Horst grabbed a sheet of paper
during the evening news the other night and drew a line down the
middle. He wrote ``Gore'' on the left, ``Bush'' on the right, and
then rated the candidates' positions, drawing a plus sign in the
Bush column next to capital punishment and a minus sign next to the
Texas governor's education record.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere did he mention an issue that has been the focus of
much moralizing on the campaign trail: sex and violence in movies
and popular music, and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Though Horst, 39, said he had agonized over how his 11-year-old
daughter and 8-year-old son were being affected by the seepage of
nudity and mayhem into what they watch and hear, he stressed that
he wasn't looking to politicians for answers. It was, he said,
something he could best grapple with on his own, however
imperfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't feel anything they say on this is going to
influence me one way or the other,'' said Horst, a theft prevention
manager for the Rite Aid chain of drugstores. ``What decision they
make is not going to affect what my children see.''
</P>
<P>
   Horst's sentiments echoed through more than a dozen other
interviews with parents of adolescents in Westland, a solidly
middle-class suburb of Detroit that, like the rest of this state,
is considered a battleground in the presidential race. Neither
Republicans nor Democrats dominate here _ Westlanders supported
President Clinton, a Democrat, in 1992 and 1996, and Gov. John
Engler, a Republican, in 1994 and 1998 _ and nearly everyone
interviewed said that they had not decided who they would vote for
in November.
</P>
<P>
   But as they shopped for milk at Kroger, ate ice cream at the
Westland Mall, sat in the bleachers at the Westland Sports Arena or
even waited for an adjustment at Shunkwiler Chiropractic, most
parents agreed that it was their responsibility _ and not that of
the president, Congress or even Hollywood _ to filter what reaches
their children. The candidates, they suggested, should save their
breath for the economy and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all of the parents conceded that they regularly crossed or
blurred the borders between acceptable and unacceptable content.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Palise, 44, a homemaker whose husband is a tool-and-die
maker at the Ford plant in Rawnsonville, said that she tried to
shield her son Anthony, 12, from nudity and bad language in movies.
But the other day, after skimming a review of ``The Watcher'' to
gauge its appropriateness for her son, she decided to take him to
see the R-rated film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was about a serial killer,'' she said,
loading groceries into her customized van. ``I thought it was about
a stalker.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Palise regretted asking Anthony to come along, he was
ambivalent. ``I fell asleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That even the sturdiest dams erected by parents can occasionally
spring holes was obvious as Phyllis Blackman shopped for gospel
records at Record Town in the Westland Mall with her 16-year-old
daughter, La Toya Hamilton. Blackman said she had a zero-tolerance
policy against rap _ unless it was the feel-good rap of the
Hollywood star Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't play the stupid stuff in the house,'' the mother
said.
</P>
<P>
   But as La Toya sought out a compact disc by the gospel singer
Yolanda Adams, an artist whom both mother and daughter adore, the
daughter said she also enjoyed the music of the slain rapper Tupac
Shakur, which, she admitted, is layered with references to ``sex,
bad-mouthing of some females, violence and killing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she had it,'' the mother said. ``It's not something she
continues to listen to on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Horst, the Rite Aid manager, said he ``blew my cork''
when he discovered that his 8-year-old son had seen a PG-rated
``Austin Powers'' video at a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything with Austin Powers has a sexual connotation, and I
got hit with a lot of questions an 8-year-old shouldn't be
asking,'' Horst said, watching from a bench at the arena as the boy
scrimmaged with his ice hockey team, the Westland Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Horst said he doesn't hesitate to allow his son to watch
the explosion-laden ``Terminator'' movies, which star Arnold
Schwarzenegger, and he took the boy and his 11-year-old sister to
see ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That had a moderately explicit scene,'' Horst said. ``My
daughter asked me, Dad, what are they doing? I said, He's an
artist. He's painting her. They're not actually doing any intimate
acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Horst, a self-described conservative who is a registered
Republican, and Palise and Blackman, both Democrats, said they
considered themselves ``strict.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost none of those interviewed here said that they wanted
Washington to censor Hollywood, or even Hollywood to censor itself.
The one pledge that they hoped Hollywood would make would be to
swear off marketing violent fare directly to teen-agers, the
subject of a congressional hearing Wednesday, and a Federal Trade
Commission report earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking against more regulation of Hollywood, the parents
repeatedly cited their belief in freedom of speech, and said they
themselves often enjoyed material that they'd prefer their children
not see.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Obsniuk, 48, a mail carrier whose children are 12, 14 and
16, said that any attempt by Washington to rein in Hollywood would
be ``a waste of time.'' As his youngest child, Jenna, twirled on
the ice during a skating lesson, Obsniuk described how he and his
wife, Debbie, an elementary school secretary, enjoyed watching
programs like ``The Sopranos,'' the bloody and often sexually
charged mob drama on HBO. But he said that they were careful to
change the channel whenever their children entered the room.
</P>
<P>
   Having voted for President Clinton in 1996 and 1992, and George
Bush in 1988, Obsniuk said he was undecided between Al Gore and
George W. Bush. But he said that his assessment of the economy, and
of which candidate presented the best chance for continued
prosperity, would drive his thinking.

</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the bleachers nearby, Kevin Beahon, 47, a quality
control inspector at the Ford national parts depot in Livonia, said
that he was eminently qualified to screen what reaches the eyes and
ears of his 13- and 16-year-old sons, and 7-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Beahon, a likely Bush voter who has barred his two younger
children from watching adult-oriented cartoons like ``The
Simpsons'' and ``South Park,'' said he had gotten pretty good at
navigating the music Web site Napster. When someone left a note on
the front door for his 13-year-old son, Stephen, imploring him to,
``Get Your Roll On,'' Beahon was puzzled. Stephen told his dad that
his friend was using the title of a song by a rap act called Big
Tymers to urge him to get going to a party.
</P>
<P>
   Beahon went straight to the Internet to retrieve the song, and
after listening to its rapid-fire references to oral sex, male
genitalia, adultery and prostitution, he concluded: ``This is the
crudest thing I've ever heard.'' Though he admits he can't control
what his son hears outside the home, he told the boy: ``I don't
want to ever hear that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he added: ``I don't think a president should be
delving into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Westland residents are fairly well educated, with many
working in the skilled trades or middle management at auto plants
in surrounding communities, few of those interviewed said they
recognized the name of Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore's running mate.
And fewer still were aware that, among the candidates on the two
national tickets, Lieberman has waged the loudest campaign against
what he describes as Hollywood's shrinking mores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me the name again, because I'm good with names and I'll
be sure to remember it,'' said one undecided voter and parent, a
saleswoman at a furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   Another parent, Tracy Hart, 34, whose presidential vote seesawed
from Michael Dukakis, a Democrat, in 1988, to George Bush in 1992
and then to President Clinton in 1996, was one of the only people
interviewed here who lamented that the issue of sex and violence in
Hollywood was ``not one of the major issues on the forefront, in
terms of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   As they loaded their car outside Kroger, her daughter, Hillary,
11, quickly corrected her mother, invoking the name of Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that?'' said Hart, a single mother who is an
administrator at a physical therapy and rehabilitation clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, citing an article in the Time magazine spinoff
``Time for Kids,'' responded: ``He doesn't think kids should be
able to go to R-rated movies and he thinks bad music is bad. He
wants to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the mother: ``Well, maybe we know who we're voting for
now.''

CALIFORNIA ECONOMY'S EXPANSION FORECAST TO CONTIUNUE APACE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Despite higher gasoline prices and a diminishing
supply of homes, California's economy is expected to continue to
expand in the coming years at a rate not seen in more than a
decade, a University of California, Los Angeles, survey predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Wednesday by the UCLA Anderson School of
Business also predicts nonfarm employment will rise 3.8 percent
this year, up from 3.1 in 1999. Employment is expected to grow 2.6
percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a truly stellar performance, particularly when you
realize that we didn't grow at all for the first half of the
1990s,'' said Rajeev Dhawan, director of econometric modeling at
UCLA and author of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rosy picture painted by the Anderson survey, one
prominent economist not associated with the survey warned that
Southern California's economic expansion could be curtailed by
increased gasoline prices, a prolonged bus drivers strike and
several possible strikes that are looming on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic fundamentals look rather good, but there is just
enough factors out there that now is the time for a more cautious
stance,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles
Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit group that tracks and
promotes the five-county Los Angeles area's business community.
</P>
<P>
   The Anderson survey sees few clouds on the horizon. Employment
grew by 2.2 percent for the year to date in Los Angeles County,
compared with 1.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of California's international markets will also
contribute to continued job growth for the rest of this year and
next in areas such as wholesale trade and transportation, said
Dhawan.
</P>
<P>
   A slower state growth rate, 2.4 percent, forecast for nonfarm
employment in 2002 should reflect an overall slowing in the
domestic economy, Dhawan said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the California economy has grown on average by 3.2
percent in the last five years, a rate not seen since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem is the housing market, which could create a
drag on the state's economy,'' he said. ``Affordability will become
an issue down the road, if high home prices prompt residents to
leave or prevent newcomers from settling in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser disagreed, saying affordability is already an issue. ``The
issue of home prices is already a problem if you go to the Bay
Area. It is starting to cause some distortions not only in Silicon
Valley, but in other parts of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, for example, has experienced an increase in home
prices because of refugee dot-com companies leaving Silicon Valley
and migrating to less expensive areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by the California Association of
Realtors, the median price of a home in the Golden State rose to a
record $255,580 during August. The price was 14 percent higher than
the August 1999 median price of $224,200.
</P>
<P>
   New residential construction in California for the first-quarter
of 2000 was the best seen in almost 10 years, the UCLA forecast
said. However, both sales and permits were down in April, they
picked up the pace in June in spite of the Federal Reserve's recent
interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Dhawan said some weakness was noted in the July numbers, but the
full impact of the Fed's rate hikes should be felt later this year.
</P>
<P>
   What helped save the housing sector this summer have been
rallies in the Nasdaq market and a drop in the 10-year bond rate
that lowered the mortgage rate from its highs in early summer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this year should turn out to be a good year for new
construction, with 150,000 new permits compared with 140,000 in
1999. The next two years will also be relatively good ones for
construction, with 145,000 new permits predicted for 2001, and
153,000 for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Construction employment, currently the highest in history, is
nearing 749,300 in California, and in August was 9.4 percent higher
than the year-ago total.
</P>
<P>
   California's employment growth has been double the national rate
for the last year and that trend is expected to continue, said
Dhawan. The state's unemployment rate, recently erratic but rising
and currently at 5 percent, will hold steady at this level for the
next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. unemployment rate is expected to rise from 4.1 percent
to 4.4 percent next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, central California continues to experience
double-digit rates of unemployment. Unemployment rates are highest
in Tulare County, 15.8 percent, and Fresno County at 14.1 percent,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The high unemployment figures reflect the fact that the region's
economy remains based on agriculture, said Kyser.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, inland Riverside and San Bernardino
counties continued to lead the state in employment growth an
increase of 5.2 percent through May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason this is going on is Southern California has always
had an area that was its hot zone,'' said John Husing, a regional
economist with Economics &AMP; Politics in Highland. ``Previously it
was the San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Valley and Orange County.
It just happens to be the Inland Empire's turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Husing said another reason for the amazing job growth is that
most of the rest of Southern California is running out of space to
build industrial or commercial facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a consequence of that if they want to build new facilities
they are almost forced to go to the Inland Empire, whether they
want to or not,'' he said. ``Because we have the space, it's also
cheaper to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending remains anything but cautious. As measured by
taxable sales, the survey predicts that sales will continue to
reflect strength in personal income and employment gains.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 increase of 9.9 percent in statewide taxable sales will
be followed by gains of 10.9 percent this year, 5.6 percent in 2001
and 5.3 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The survey predicts that total immigration will average slightly
less than 250,000 people annually through 2002 and the overall
population should grow by 1.6 percent per year for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   As for exports, Dhawan predicted the strong gains experienced in
2000 would continue to grow in 2001 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   After showing a modest gain of 2.4 percent in 1999, state
exports posted a 21.2 percent year-to-year increase in the second
quarter. Mexico continued to be the leading destination for
California exports, increasing 34.5 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   California's second-largest trading partner Japan showed a gain
of 18.3 percent in the second quarter, while Canada was third,
followed by South Korea and Taiwan.

FDA DECISION ON ABORTION PILL IS EXPECTED SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide by
Saturday whether it will approve the abortion pill, known as
mifepristone or RU-486, for sale in the United States. It would be
the first alternative to surgical abortion approved here.
</P>
<P>
   The drug allows women to terminate pregnancy within seven weeks
of their last menstrual period. It has been sold in Europe and
elsewhere in the world for more than a decade, and an FDA advisory
committee has recommended approving the drug for the United States.
The agency usually accepts such recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been stalled by abortion politics in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of legal abortion have urged that the drug not be sold
in the United States. They say it is more dangerous than surgical
abortions, causing severe bleeding in about 2 percent of women and
incomplete abortions in about 5 percent to 8 percent, making it
necessary for the women to have surgical abortions to complete the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights groups have urged that the drug be approved,
saying it would change the abortion landscape by making the
procedure a private matter between a woman and her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The drug's maker, the Roussel Ucalf unit of Hoechst AG, declined
to seek marketing approval for it in the United States, saying it
feared protests from opponents of abortion rights. In 1994, the
company gave the drug's patent to a nonprofit group, the Population
Council, which set out to get market approval.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA advisory committee recommended four years ago that the
drug be approved, and the agency, under its former commissioner,
Dr. David Kessler, wrote to the Population Council saying the drug
could be approved if certain conditions were met. But the council
has had difficulty finding a company to make the drug and one to
market it.
</P>
<P>
   Then six months ago, the Danco Laboratories, a company that was
formed to market the drug for the Population Council, submitted its
application to the FDA for approval. The agency nearly always
responds to such applications within six months, a deadline that
falls in this case on Saturday.

MARKET PLACE: NEWS CORP. AND LIBERTY MEDIA COMPLETE ASSET SWAP 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   News Corp. and Liberty Media Group confirmed Wednesday that they
had agreed to a complex stock and asset swap in which Liberty Media
would increase its stake in News Corp. and News Corp. would pick up
Liberty's Gemstar-TV Guide International holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar-TV Guide provides electronic program guides like VCR
Plus and develops and licenses proprietary technologies primarily
for consumers. It also owns TV Guide and TV Guide Online.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hatch, who follows News Corp. and Liberty Media for SG Cowen,
said he liked the deal because it should help News Corp. rapidly
deploy the programming guides on the digital satellite platforms
that it is consolidating around the world. That strategy, he said,
should ultimately enhance the value of both News Corp. and Liberty,
which will own a stake in the business after it is spun off.
</P>
<P>
   However, one analyst who requested anonymity was less
enthusiastic, saying that News Corp. was effectively paying a high
price for Liberty's 21 percent stake in Gemstar. The addition would
increase its total interest to 43 percent. Much of Gemstar's value,
the analyst said, is in patents that have yet to be tested.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., is intent on moving
ahead with the purchase, some analysts said, because it would
strengthen his hand in a bid for General Motors' Hughes Electronics
unit. Hughes owns DirecTV, the satellite TV service. News Corp. is
planning to spin off Sky Global Networks, its big international
satellite operation for pay TV, Internet and data services and is
interested in adding a U.S. satellite business to it.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is strategically important now because it helps put a
valuation on Sky Global of about $38 billion shortly before its
public offering, which is expected to take place by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Liberty would swap roughly 86.5 million
shares of Gemstar. At Wednesday's closing price of $72.94, the
value of the shares would total about $6.3 billion. Liberty would
also contribute some of its interest in South American cable
businesses worth around $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the company would receive 121.5 million nonvoting
News Corp. American depository receipts. They closed Wednesday at
$47.38, for a total value of $5.79 billion. That stake represents
80 percent of the payment the News Corp. plans to make, giving the
entire Gemstar stock purchase a value of around $7.2 billion.
Liberty's chairman, John C. Malone, has agreed to take the balance
in Sky Global stock worth $1.4 billion. And Liberty will get
roughly $400 million in additional Sky Global stock in exchange for
the South American cable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty will, therefore, receive a total of $1.8 billion in the
satellite business' stock. News Corp. said Wednesday that Liberty's
total payment in Sky Global stock would equal 4.8 percent of Sky
Global's total value, giving the business a total value of about
$38 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty also agreed to buy $500 million of Sky Global stock in
the initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the companies involved in the deal all rose Wednesday.
Gemstar was up $4.38 at $72.94 ; News Corp.'s regular American
depository receipts climbed $2.69, to $56.50; and Liberty Media
closed up 50 cents at $18.88.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty, which is a tracking stock of AT&AMP;T, is a collection of
programming assets that Malone assembled as he was building his
cable empire.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch of SG Cowan said two-thirds of the value of Liberty Media
was in publicly traded equities, many of which have dramatically
declined in the past 52 weeks. Liberty's holdings in Sprint-PCS,
for example, has sunk to $7 billion from its high of $14 billion
last March.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty also has interest in Liberty Digital, which had a value
of $16 billion last January but which has since sunk to about $4
billion. Its stake in Time Warner Inc., which had been worth as
much as $12 billion, is now worth $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said Liberty also had stakes in private cable programming
companies like Discovery Communications, owner of the Discovery,
Learning and other cable TV channels. Investors have been concerned
about the impact of advertiser spending on revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The swap of its holdings in Gemstar, whose stock price has
soared over the past year, does little to immediately enhance
Liberty's value. But Malone was apparently eager to increase
Liberty's stake in News Corp. from 6 percent to roughly 18 percent
of the company. That stake would make him the largest holder of
nonvoting shares. It would not, however, give him voting rights or
a seat on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch said in a conference call Wednesday that he would like
to have Malone on the board. But Malone's powerful role at AT&AMP;T
might be a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty is effectively controlled by AT&AMP;T, and regulators could
take issue with Malone sitting on the board of AT&AMP;T, now one of the
nation's largest cable operators, as well as on the board of News
Corp., the parent of Sky Global, which has a competing
direct-to-home satellite service.

 &HT;    Norwegians likely to be tougher this time
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The shock of a 2-0 drubbing at the hands of the United
States in the opening game of the Olympics on Sept. 14 had barely
set in for Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo when he expressed
gratitude the margin wasn't even larger.
</P>
<P>
   Equally surprised were the Americans, who had dropped three
games to Norway this year and who have a losing record all-time
against their Norwegian rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not look like the Norway team that we know,'' said
forward Tiffeny Milbrett, who scored the first goal and ran laps
around the unnerved Norwegian defense.
</P>
<P>
   Norway recovered to beat China and move out of group play, then
received the gift of an own goal with 10 minutes to play against
Germany in the semifinals for a 1-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   When they meet on Thursday at the Sydney Football Stadium for
the gold medal, it will be the second time in the five major
international women's tournaments that the U.S. and Norway have
slugged it out at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans beat Norway in the finals of the first Women's
World Cup in 1991, then Norway pulled off a surprise in the World
Cup semifinals four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the U.S. has prevailed, winning the first Olympic
gold medal in 1996 and its second World Cup last summer. Even with
the loss last week, Norway leads the series 14-13-1, and the teams
are tied 3-3-1 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been gaining confidence as they have gone along in the
tournament,'' U.S. coach April Heinrichs said. ``I have thought for
several months now that we were on a collision course with
Norway.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. beat Brazil 1-0 Sunday in a sloppily played semifinal
game, but found a way to endure. Mia Hamm scored a clutch goal for
the Americans, but their occasionally sputtering attack could be
cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   In their group match in Melbourne, the Norwegian offensive
combination of Marianne Pettersen and Hege Riise was marked out
effectively by a U.S. defense that has sparkled throughout the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Defender Gro Espeseth and goalkeeper Bente Nordby are among the
best in the world at their positions, but they didn't have an
answer for Milbrett, the most consistent U.S. scorer, the first
time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this game is going to be completely different,''
Milbrett said.

BLUE CROSS AIMS FOR EXPANDED AFFORDABILITY

   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- In an effort to provide affordable
insurance to the thousands of Californians dropping or losing their
coverage, Blue Cross of California is set to begin offering
low-priced health insurance, a company spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Cross PlanScope program will offer California residents
a choice of seven different options beginning Jan. 1, for an
average monthly price of $105 per member.
</P>
<P>
   ``By offering these new options, we are definitely responding to
consumer demand for choice and flexibility,'' said Michael Chee, a
spokesman with Blue Cross of California, a Thousand Oaks-based
subsidiary of WellPoint Health Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   By consolidating their business, Chee said the company was
looking to keep their members insured during a time of rising
costs, while being able to offer an affordable product to the
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers want choice and WellPoint is responding to that
demand,'' said William McKeever, an analyst with Paine Webber in
New York. ``It's going to help WellPoint achieve a larger client
base in California. I expect them to try this in other markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, Blue Cross expects 477,000 members to
experience an average price reduction of $19 a month. The remaining
individual PPO members, some 243,000 are expected to see an
increase of $9 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, director of the Santa Monica-based Consumers for
Quality Care, was skeptical that the new health plans would
actually offer coverage to those who can't afford health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Cross is trying to create a policy that helps no one but
Blue Cross, because most people will never be able to use it,''
Court said. ``This is a major medical policy that requires a 25
percent co-pay, which doesn't help the uninsured get preventative
care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' argued Chee. ``What he misses is the fact
that there are preventative care options offered. We are offering
first-dollar coverage for office visits and generic prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, those options have been subject to out-of-pocket
expenses,'' he said.

 &HT;    Hop, skip and jump for victory
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - He and his teammates had made their victory lap around
the ballpark like a bunch of laughing, hollering, got-no-cares
schoolboys. The had hopped and jumped, zig-zagged between each
other, waving their American flags as the ``U-S-A...U-S-A...U-S-A''
chants rained down on them from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   They passed beneath the outfield scoreboard that still burned
their 4-0 gold medal victory over Cuba into the Sydney night. They
passed the place in left-center where his home run had cleared the
fence. They tromped over the spot just inside the left field line
where he had made his dramatic, diving catch to end the game. And
then they had trotted past the opponents' dugout, where the
red-uniformed Cubans - their Olympic reign so unexpectedly ended -
stood sullen and slumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never played in the World Series, but who cares,'' said
Mike Neill, the 30-year-old American left-fielder. ``Right now this
is huge. This is my World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. players stood on the medal stand and each took his
turn bowing forward so the gold medal could be draped over his
head, you noticed Neill had the left side of his white warm-up
jacket pulled up over his ear. He looked like he was hiding
something, but as you watched him chatter and smile, you soon
realized he was talking on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called my mom back in Greensboro, N.C.,'' he'd explain a bit
sheepishly later on. ``I wanted her to know what happened and I
wanted her to hear the national anthem when it was played.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the crowd and all, it was hard carrying on a
conversation. I told her I hit a home run and we won. She thought I
meant I hit THE home run to make us win. I kept trying to tell her,
'No, Mom, it was just a regular homer. ``
</P>
<P>
   When he heard what Neill had said, American manager Tommy
Lasorda - a regular red, white and blue Uncle Sam when it came to
spouting his team's Olympic gospel - shook his head and pushed away
the idea like he was sending back a skimpy bowl of pasta.
</P>
<P>
   ``People asked me about the home run (Kirk) Gibson hit when we
beat the A's in the World Series,'' the former Los Angeles Dodgers
manager said. ``That was dramatic. It made all the Dodgers fans
happy. But to me this was bigger. I felt more excited for Mike
Neill and the team than I did with that first one. To me this was
bigger than the World Series. Today, Dodgers fans were happy and
San Francisco fans were happy and Cincinnati, too. Today the whole
United States of America can be happy.
</P>
<P>
   `` And it all goes back to Neill. His home run set the tone for
the night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban team - a power in international baseball for nearly 30
years - had won Olympic gold in 1992 and 1996, the only two Games
where baseball had been a medal sport. Even though their team is
now aging and its ranks have been thinned by recent defections, the
Cubans were heavily-favored to win the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   They had beaten the Americans, 6-1, in a nasty prelim game on
Saturday that had been filled with angry words, a beanball, a
spikes-high slide into American catcher Pat Borders and some
roughhouse tactics by U.S. first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz. After
subduing the Americans once, it was figured the Cubans would do it
again Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always the best team that wins or the strongest guy
who wins the fight,'' Lasorda said. ``It's usually the team that
wants it more than the other and tonight that was our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one wanted it more than Neill.
</P>
<P>
   He has played professional baseball for 10 years and has had
very few minutes in the spotlight. A career minor leaguer, he got
only one brief invite to the big leagues when the Oakland As called
him up in 1998. He played six games, got 15 at bats and then
dislocated his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he healed, the window had long closed. He was back
in minor league ball and no longer considered a prospect. That's
why the As offered him to Team USA to play in the Pan American
Games last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Used as a sub most of that tournament, he suddenly became the
hero when he came off the bench to hit the run-scoring single in
the 10th inning that beat Mexico and sent the U.S. to the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months later, Oakland waived him and in the
offseason, he managed to catch on with the Seattle Mariners.
Playing for their Triple A club in Tacoma, he again was not
destined for the big leagues and was given to Lasorda to help fill
the Olympic roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought Major League baseball didn't give us a good
team,'' Lasorda said. ``Well look what guys like Mike Neill did.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of his three home runs in the Olympic tournament was
in the opener, a 13th inning blast to beat Japan. Wednesday night
Neill bookended the masterful pitching performance of right-hander
Ben Sheets with the solo homer in the first and the diving catch of
Yasser Gomez' fast-falling liner down the line at game's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, a lot of us are nobodies,'' Neill said. ``But we all
believed in each other and lifted each other up. That's the best
thing I'm taking home from here.''
</P>
<P>
   But not the only thing.
</P>
<P>
   He reached into his back pocket and fished out a baseball.
``This is the one I caught and I wasn't going to let it go,'' he
said proudly. ``This ball is special.''
</P>
<P>
   He held it admiringly, he rubbed it and then he shoved it
securely back into his hip pocket. It meant baseball's best times
and he had waited a long time to catch it.

 &HT;    Jones' drive for five keeps her focused
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The longest day of Marion Jones' Olympics
used to be easy enough to identify. It would be Wednesday, Sept.
27, targeted for months in advance, with an ambitious schedule of
two 200-meter preliminary heats and a round of long jump
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, that's more than any athlete since Carl Lewis would
care to bite off. Getting those hamstrings up and humming three
times in one day, taking the heart and the mind into express-train
mode three times and then backing them off quickly onto a quiet
sidetrack, that's one challenge. Being the best in the world at
every event you try, that's the other.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Marion skip lightly through this killer schedule,
however, put a new perspective on a truly Olympian quest for five
gold medals. Her longest day wasn't Wednesday at all.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was a day spent with two cheering fan clubs in excess
of 100,000, which was the announced Stadium Australia crowd for the
evening session of track and field and the morning session, too.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, that was the day that wouldn't end, beginning as it did
with Marion's husband C.J. Hunter fingered by the International
Amateur Athletic Federation as a steroid cheat in shot put
competition earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was Tuesday, when Marion stepped into a Sydney hotel
banquet room that proved insufficient to hold all the reporters who
wanted to hunt down Hunter. Yeah, that was a pretty lousy day, too,
with her 330-pound hubby crying on camera and nobody really
swallowing what he said, which was that an iron supplement with
insignificant amounts of a banned substance called nandrolone that
C.J. says wasn't listed on the label.
</P>
<P>
   If having Johnnie Cochran in the room was supposed to be a
comfort for Marion, that didn't work too well either. All O.J.'s
lawyer did was introduce the probability of a numbingly technical
defense that could stretch on for months. Strengthened the
perception that C.J.'s got something to hide, too.
</P>
<P>
   What rhyme might Johnnie invent to turn the positive test
results into a joke? Perhaps ``If the nandro was hidden,
suspension's forbidden,'' or ``If the supplement's iron, it's the
wrong man you're trying.''
</P>
<P>
   All this for a world champion shot putter who says he'd like to
quit competing but then nobody would be willing to pay for him to
travel around the world with his famous track-star wife.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mess all right, but Marion had an escape route, at least
temporarily. She'd go to the stadium. She'd make short work of her
longest competitive day and busy herself with running and jumping
and winning, the three things that nobody yet has been able to make
troublesome for Marion.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. watched her from the media section of the stands Wednesday
morning, peeping with the enemy. In Marion's first 200-meter heat,
at 11:09 a.m., she was the sixth-fastest qualifier - 22.75 seconds
_ while running on cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that I don't have anybody in my heat tonight that wants
to run fast,'' Jones said, greeting reporters on her way off the
track with the same gracious smile she wore before the C.J.
scandal. ``I just want to take it easy but I will do what I have to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   A light meal, a quick nap and it was time to climb back into the
car for Sydney Olympic Park. She did run into someone who wanted to
run fast, but not nearly fast enough. Marion drew Australia's
Melinda Gainsford-Taylor in her Round 2 heat, which went off
promptly at 7:01 p.m. Jones broke out easily and settled into
something just above a trot over the last 10 meters. That gave the
Aussies something to cheer about as Gainsford-Taylor came
barrelling past in 22.49, one-tenth of a second faster than Marion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, I let up a bit too much,'' Jones said, all but
snickering about it. ``Everything that's happened in the last
couple of days, I've pushed it into the back of my head. It's all
about business now. I'd like to make my qualifying jump on my first
jump tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you know it, she did just that. Some ninety minutes
after Marion's second and final 200-meter heat, she took one smooth
sprint down the runway and one elegant flight into the long-jump
pit. No world record, but no foul, either. Her 6.78-meter effort,
slightly over 22 feet, was good enough to slide into Friday's final
without breaking a real sweat. Good enough, too, to rank third
overall behind 1992 gold medalist Heike Drechsler of Germany and
1996 silver medalist Fiona May of Italy, two single-minded
champions who jump for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all my days in Sydney, this has been the hardest,'' said
Jones, ``but I came away healthy and happy. Overall, it's been a
very good day for me. I just wanted to do the first jump and go
home. I can conserve energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the C.J. question is tossed her way at the end of what
has proved to be her most casual day at the Olympics, not the
craziest. Again the smile and the easy answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment,'' she said, ``I'm just concentrating on running
and jumping. It keeps my mind off everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Steers our minds back toward the track, too, and there is where
Marion will make her mark. Whether her spouse is a louse or
unfairly accused ceases to be a question the moment the starting
gun sounds, as it will tonight in the semifinals and final of the
200.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Marion turn what was supposed to be her longest
day into a lark, I'm more convinced than ever that this drive for
five will strike gold on every count. The only thing that can stop
her is a dropped baton or some other such nonsense in the two
relays at the end of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   The busier the better for Marion, that's the blessing here.
Under the circumstances, it's ideal that she has no more days off.
That all but guarantees the girl with the laughing feet will go on
and on and on.

SONY SLASHES DEBUT SHIPMENT FOR PLAYSTATION 2
</HEADLINE>

By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Entertainment giant Sony said Wednesday its
release of PlayStation 2, billed as the biggest consumer
electronics launch in history, will be only half as big as the
company planned.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said its production schedule of PS 2 is lagging by about a
month because of a components shortage. The company trimmed its
estimate of the number of units available for the Oct. 26 launch to
500,000 from 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The news had a ripple effect on the stock market as shares of
video game software makers affiliated with Sony as well as Sony's
own shares dropped at the news. Among those dropping was THQ of
Calabasas, Calif., which will release its game Summoner in
conjunction with the platform's launch.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of THQ were down $3.38, or 13.8 percent, to close at
$21.06. Sony was down $9.63, or 8.8 percent, to close at $99.38 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks in general were down in anticipation of the negative
call from Sony,'' said Melissa Williams, an analyst who covers
retailing for brokerage Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
   Toy industry observers anticipate that PlayStation 2 will be
among the biggest holiday toy sellers, with the game platform being
virtually sold out through preorders even before its release.
Unlike the original PlayStation, the biggest-selling video game
platform ever, the new version can play DVD movies and will soon
offer broadband connections.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Sony to revise its estimate of available
units to approximately 700,000, Williams said. Even though the
revised estimate is lower, Williams expected stocks to rebound
today now that word is out.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Locke, THQ's executive vice president of North American
publishing, said the reduced shipments will have a negligible
effect on her company. THQ expects sales of Summoner, its only PS 2
offering, to account for no more than 5 percent of the video game
maker's total fourth-quarter sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said that despite the setback, it still plans to ship as
many as 1.3 million units by Christmas, sending an additional
100,000 units every week through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The production delay does not affect our initial projections
for worldwide output,'' said Sony Computer Entertainment
spokeswoman Molly Smith.

CALIFORNIA ECONOMY'S EXPANSION FORECAST TO CONTIUNUE APACE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Despite higher gasoline prices and a diminishing
supply of homes, California's economy is expected to continue to
expand in the coming years at a rate not seen in more than a
decade, a University of California, Los Angeles, survey predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Wednesday by the UCLA Anderson School of
Business also predicts nonfarm employment will rise 3.8 percent
this year, up from 3.1 in 1999. Employment is expected to grow 2.6
percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a truly stellar performance, particularly when you
realize that we didn't grow at all for the first half of the
1990s,'' said Rajeev Dhawan, director of econometric modeling at
UCLA and author of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rosy picture painted by the Anderson survey, one
prominent economist not associated with the survey warned that
Southern California's economic expansion could be curtailed by
increased gasoline prices, a prolonged bus drivers strike and
several possible strikes that are looming on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic fundamentals look rather good, but there is just
enough factors out there that now is the time for a more cautious
stance,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles
Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit group that tracks and
promotes the five-county Los Angeles area's business community.
</P>
<P>
   The Anderson survey sees few clouds on the horizon. Employment
grew by 2.2 percent for the year to date in Los Angeles County,
compared with 1.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of California's international markets will also
contribute to continued job growth for the rest of this year and
next in areas such as wholesale trade and transportation, said
Dhawan.
</P>
<P>
   A slower state growth rate, 2.4 percent, forecast for nonfarm
employment in 2002 should reflect an overall slowing in the
domestic economy, Dhawan said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the California economy has grown on average by 3.2
percent in the last five years, a rate not seen since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem is the housing market, which could create a
drag on the state's economy,'' he said. ``Affordability will become
an issue down the road, if high home prices prompt residents to
leave or prevent newcomers from settling in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser disagreed, saying affordability is already an issue. ``The
issue of home prices is already a problem if you go to the Bay
Area. It is starting to cause some distortions not only in Silicon
Valley, but in other parts of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, for example, has experienced an increase in home
prices because of refugee dot-com companies leaving Silicon Valley
and migrating to less expensive areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by the California Association of
Realtors, the median price of a home in the Golden State rose to a
record $255,580 during August. The price was 14 percent higher than
the August 1999 median price of $224,200.
</P>
<P>
   New residential construction in California for the first-quarter
of 2000 was the best seen in almost 10 years, the UCLA forecast
said. However, both sales and permits were down in April, they
picked up the pace in June in spite of the Federal Reserve's recent
interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Dhawan said some weakness was noted in the July numbers, but the
full impact of the Fed's rate hikes should be felt later this year.
</P>
<P>
   What helped save the housing sector this summer have been
rallies in the Nasdaq market and a drop in the 10-year bond rate
that lowered the mortgage rate from its highs in early summer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this year should turn out to be a good year for new
construction, with 150,000 new permits compared with 140,000 in
1999. The next two years will also be relatively good ones for
construction, with 145,000 new permits predicted for 2001, and
153,000 for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Construction employment, currently the highest in history, is
nearing 749,300 in California, and in August was 9.4 percent higher
than the year-ago total.
</P>
<P>
   California's employment growth has been double the national rate
for the last year and that trend is expected to continue, said
Dhawan. The state's unemployment rate, recently erratic but rising
and currently at 5 percent, will hold steady at this level for the
next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. unemployment rate is expected to rise from 4.1 percent
to 4.4 percent next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, central California continues to experience
double-digit rates of unemployment. Unemployment rates are highest
in Tulare County, 15.8 percent, and Fresno County at 14.1 percent,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The high unemployment figures reflect the fact that the region's
economy remains based on agriculture, said Kyser.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, inland Riverside and San Bernardino
counties continued to lead the state in employment growth an
increase of 5.2 percent through May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason this is going on is Southern California has always
had an area that was its hot zone,'' said John Husing, a regional
economist with Economics &AMP; Politics in Highland. ``Previously it
was the San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Valley and Orange County.
It just happens to be the Inland Empire's turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Husing said another reason for the amazing job growth is that
most of the rest of Southern California is running out of space to
build industrial or commercial facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a consequence of that if they want to build new facilities
they are almost forced to go to the Inland Empire, whether they
want to or not,'' he said. ``Because we have the space, it's also
cheaper to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending remains anything but cautious. As measured by
taxable sales, the survey predicts that sales will continue to
reflect strength in personal income and employment gains.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 increase of 9.9 percent in statewide taxable sales will
be followed by gains of 10.9 percent this year, 5.6 percent in 2001
and 5.3 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The survey predicts that total immigration will average slightly
less than 250,000 people annually through 2002 and the overall
population should grow by 1.6 percent per year for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   As for exports, Dhawan predicted the strong gains experienced in
2000 would continue to grow in 2001 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   After showing a modest gain of 2.4 percent in 1999, state
exports posted a 21.2 percent year-to-year increase in the second
quarter. Mexico continued to be the leading destination for
California exports, increasing 34.5 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   California's second-largest trading partner Japan showed a gain
of 18.3 percent in the second quarter, while Canada was third,
followed by South Korea and Taiwan.

 &HT;    Farm-boy dreamer topples giant
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Rulon Gardner was an overweight child. Kids called him
``Fatso,'' or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the time he grabbed a branch at a Boy Scouts outing
and chased an older boy who teased him, Gardner never fought back.
He always has been able to achieve a state of calm that shuts out
external forces.
</P>
<P>
   That aptitude served him well against Alexander Karelin, an
almost mythical figure who is the uncontested all-time greatest
Greco-Roman wrestler. Of all the gold medals being doled out in
Sydney, none was regarded a certainty as much as Karelin's fourth
straight in the Olympic heavyweight (286-pound) class.
</P>
<P>
   But the former farm boy from a Wyoming town, where the major
mode of transportation is the tractor, can fight all right. Put him
in a singlet, give him some coaches, and point the way to the mat:
He can whup anyone.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he did Wednesday, leveling a legend 1-0 for the
gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a rough life,'' said Gardner, 29. ``Been an underdog
every step. One thing I learned _ don't ever quit. If you believe
it in your mind, the body can do great things.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the youngest of Virginia and Reed's nine children in
Afton, Wyo. (pop: 1,200). He wrestled with his four brothers, one
now deceased. He hauled bales of hay, milked cows and cleared rocks
off the field so crops could grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the worst,'' said Reed Gardner, 70, wrapped in an
American flag. ``That job (with the rocks) has driven more boys off
the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   But not Rulon Gardner, 29. ``Hauling rocks was actually fun,''
he said. ``We'd throw them in the truck, and they'd go ding.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, young Gardner wanted to flee the farm life, so he reached
for sports as his ticket out. With a barrel chest that makes him
``look like I ate a little kid,'' he went to the University of
Nebraska on a full ride for wrestling. He would have played on the
Cornhuskers' esteemed line had football offered more than a partial
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Gardner could not blame him for leaving. ``Owning a farm in
the U.S. is tough now,'' he said. ``We're not making any money.
We've struggled at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Because most of the Gardner kids moved away to college
educations and decent jobs, they could afford the trip to Sydney.
Mom and Dad are part of the 16-member entourage only through the
generosity of the community, which chipped in for their expenses.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the Games himself, Gardner had to conquer his first
legend, four-time Olympian Matt Ghaffari, at the U.S. Trials. For
all of Ghaffari's brilliance, he was 0-22 lifetime against Karelin.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner had confronted Karelin once, falling 5-0 in 1997, but
the match was scoreless after six minutes of regulation time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of frightened me to feel the strength he had,''
Gardner said. ``It was like pushing a horse or a cow. The only
problem is, (Karelin) is a little quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``I had this certain calm that was weird. I don't think
I've ever felt more like wrestling in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even against the menacing Karelin, a man right out of a
super-hero comic book? Who weighed 15 pounds at birth? Whose feats
of strength seem concocted? Whose trademark reverse body slam sends
foes flying feet-over-heels? Who had not lost a significant match
in 13 years? Who had allowed one point in a decade?
</P>
<P>
   ``I treat every wrestler the same,'' Gardner said. ``I don't
care if it's a junior high kid in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   To discourage stall tactics and passivity, Greco-Roman
instituted a rule since the Atlanta Games. If the first of two
periods is scoreless, the second begins with one man clinching
another's chest. If the clincher does not tally a point within a
minute, his opponent earns one.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin was applying a clinch when Gardner induced him to
release it. The tactic resulted in a point.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the lead, however, he was drawn into a three-minute
overtime because neither wrestler had accumulated the necessary
three points.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't matter. ``Rulon wrestled a perfect match against the
greatest of all time,'' said the U.S. coach, Dan Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner celebrated with a cartwheel. But he spoke reverently
later of Karelin. ``I still think he's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Not today. For eight minutes, 55 seconds, the man whose
nicknames include ``The Experiment'' could not decipher Gardner.
So, with five seconds left, he bent over in a stance of surrender
and fought no further, mumbling a few words in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Rulon Gardner, the Wyoming farm boy, doesn't speak the language.
But he took a stab at the translation.
</P>
<P>
   And what does he believe the baddest dude on the planet said?
</P>
<P>
   ``I give up.''

   MTV CUTTING ONLINE JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Viacom said Wednesday that it would cut the staff at MTVi Group,
the Internet division of MTV Networks, by 105 positions, or 25
percent. The company also postponed plans for a spinoff of the
year-old MTVi, whose 22 Web sites include MTV.com, VH1.com and
Sonicnet.com. A spokesman said that the 105 layoffs were part of a
move to consolidate the music sites and that MTVi's revenue is
expected to nearly double this year from $19.9 million in 1999. But
some analysts saw the move as a product of the market's cooling
toward Web companies that focus on digital entertainment. ``This
makes you notice how even major entertainment companies are
struggling to create successful online entities,'' said Stacey
Herron, an analyst at Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   SENATORS RAISE AOL CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee on telecommunications, trade and consumer
protection convened Wednesday to discuss interactive television.
But with Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online, present,
questions turned to issues standing in the way of the proposed
AOL-Time Warner merger. Members of the committee tried to tackle
thorny topics like whether Time Warner should be required to open
its cable network to all Internet service providers as a condition
of the merger and whether AOL would share its popular instant
messaging services. Case sought to assuage concerns, noting that
many Internet service providers are waiting until after the merger
to negotiate for access to Time Warner's cable systems and saying
the messaging technology could be compatible with other systems.
</P>
<P>
   BRICKS AND CLICKS CONVERGENCE?
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to bring together Internet and traditional
retailing, a company named in Los Angeles is introducing a series
of prepaid cards to be sold in retail stores that enable the card
holders to buy merchandise on the Web sites of e-commerce
companies. J. Michael Boh, chief executive at Prepay.com, described
the cards as a cost-effective method for dot-coms to acquire
customers as they ``search for ways offline to drive people
online.'' The cards can be used like gift certificates, entitling
the users to buy merchandise on the Web sites of dot-coms like
Aboutgolf.com, Beautyscene.com and Cigar.com. Boh said Prepay.com
would begin national sales of the cards through large retail chains
in late October.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC SITES DRAW AD SPENDING
</P>
<P>
   In what may be seen as a silver lining to the legal clouds
hovering over Internet music sites, data gathered by the
advertising measurement service AdRelevance suggests that the sites
have benefited from increased ad revenue in the wake of publicity
surrounding this sector. During the two weeks after the July 26
injunction against the music file-sharing service Napster,
advertising revenue at about 23 music sites monitored by
AdRelevance jumped 39 percent. Although for most music sites, the
spike was short-lived, a few, like Spinner.com and Sonic.Net, had
sustained increases in advertising revenue through early September.
But Napster itself does not stand to benefit from the effect, since
its Web site does not carry advertisements.

DEVERS DENIED ONCE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SYDNEY, Australia _ Gail Devers stopped in mid-interview, as
abruptly as she had done minutes earlier in mid-race.
</P>
<P>
   A giant scoreboard at Olympic Stadium was showing a head-on
replay of Devers' 100-meter hurdles semifinal. She stared at the
screen and when she saw herself run through the fifth hurdle, she
blinked. Hard.
</P>
<P>
   It took all her composure Wednesday to watch history repeating
itself. In the 1992 Olympic final in Barcelona, the former UCLA
standout clipped the last hurdle and stumbled out of the lead and
fell to fifth. But at least she finished.
</P>
<P>
   Devers knew she was doomed this time, though she did her best
not to show it. She went through the motions in warmup and tried to
ignore the twinges that told her the tear in her left hamstring was
getting worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
   She stepped into the blocks and tried to shake the injury out.
But a few strides into her semifinal race, she felt it. The pain
grew more pronounced with every hurdle she cleared. After the
fourth one, she could take it no more. Devers ran through the fifth
hurdle and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   The best year of Devers' career would not complete her, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, the woman who has dominated the sprint hurdles for
the past decade, who posted seven of the 10 fastest times this year
and lowered her own American record, is 0-for-the-medals in four
Olympic hurdling appearances. Her best finish in the event was a
fourth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somebody else's turn to shine,'' a philosophical Devers
said later in a post-race, post-mortem. ``That's why I'm not
sitting up here crying. I have to keep everything in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Devers' demise throws opened the window of opportunity for
Nigeria's Glory Alozie, who is competing here with a lithe spirit
and a heavy heart. Her fiance, 400 meters runner Hyginus Anayo
Anugo, was struck by a car here and killed two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alozie ran a front-running 12.68 in her semifinal heat, the
third- fastest time recorded in these Games behind Devers' 12.62 in
the first round and Olga Shishigina's 12.66 in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, in the final, Shishigina edged Alozie for the gold, 12.65
to 12.68. Melissa Morrison, Devers' U.S. teammate, took the bronze
in 12.76.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys want me to give you some sob story,'' said Devers in
a tone that made it clear she wasn't inclined to cooperate. ``I had
a slight tear in my hamstring. I was hoping to run through it. But
I felt it getting worse with every hurdle. End of story. End of
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Devers, 33, incurred the injury earlier this month at a meet in
Brussels and had to pull out of her last pre-Games tuneup, in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't have to run here. Goodness knows other athletes have
pulled out of these Games with flimsier excuses than the cellophane
paper on which the results of Devers' MRI were printed.
</P>
<P>
   Devers never considered not trying. She kept trying to convince
herselfthat this calamity would end happily, just like all of Lucy
Ricardo's escapades do in the ``I Love Lucy'' episodes Devers
devours in her free time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like it was my job and my duty to come in here and give
it my best shot,'' Devers said. ``This is the Olympic Games. This
is what you work for for four years. I wanted to chase after my
dream. That's what I tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Her dream isn't dead, she said, it's just on pause. She was
adamant that retirement is not yet in her vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only going to use the R-word one time. I still have it on
the shelf,'' Devers said. ``At 33, I've run faster than I ever have
in my life. Why would I retire? Just because I didn't get a gold
medal in the 2000 Olympics doesn't mean I don't have other goals
that can come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Her No. 1 goal? That's easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I have not had is one season that's injury-free,''
Devers said. ``That's my goal for next season.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Baptists in Texas, national groups vie
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By RICHARD VARA
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Relations between Texas Baptists and the Southern Baptist
Convention reached a crisis stage Wednesday after state leaders
proposed yanking $5 million from the national convention's
seminaries and two of its agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The 220-member executive board of the Baptist General Convention
of Texas is recommending a new budget for 2001 that redirects $4.3
million away from six nationally funded seminaries, including
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth. The
proposed budget also cuts nearly $1 million in Texas funds to the
national group's executive committee and its Ethics and Religious
Liberty Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be reallocated to three seminaries affiliated
with the Texas convention _ Baylor University's Truett Theological
Seminary in Waco, Logsdon School of Theology in Abilene and
Hispanic Baptist Theological Seminary in San Antonio _ and other
Texas ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Board members approved the proposals by an overwhelming vote
Tuesday. The budget will be decided by delegates to the state's
annual convention Oct. 30-31 in Corpus Christi. The budget actions
of the state convention, controlled by Baptist moderates, may be a
step toward disengaging from the 15.7 million-member national
convention, which is controlled by conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Baptists proposed the cuts in reaction to what they called
a ``doctrinaire fundamentalism'' in the seminaries' leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Wade, executive director of the Texas
convention, said the feeling is that leaders of the denomination's
conservative movement have gone too far with changes in the
seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In seeking to eliminate the perceived problem of liberalism,
they have willingly sacrificed liberty,'' he said, adding that
liberalism ``has never been a problem in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist General Convention of Texas is the largest of the
state conventions affiliated with the Southern Baptists, claiming
about 2.7 million members and 6,000 churches. It contributed $22
million to the Southern Baptist Convention in 1999, more than any
other state convention. The proposed budget leaves intact more than
$17 million in funding for two Southern Baptist missions agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received news of this development with extreme
disappointment and profound regret,'' said the Rev. Morris H.
Chapman, president of the national convention's executive
committee. ``It represents nothing less than a breach of the
historic relationship the Southern Baptist Convention has had with
the BGCT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fractious elements in Texas have driven an extremely poor
decision that is bad for the (state convention), bad for the
Southern Baptist churches in Texas, bad for the (national
convention) and bad for the common mission causes dear to our
hearts,'' Chapman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Campbell, pastor of Houston's Westbury Baptist
Church and chair of the state's seminary study committee, said the
proposed budget would cap contributions to the six seminaries at $1
million. The money would be divided according to the number of
Texan students enrolled at each seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern, which has produced many Texas pastors and
ministers, would receive the bulk of the funds, about $750,000, he
said. It would get $1.5 million under the current state funding
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seminaries have shifted theologically,'' Campbell said,
adding that the schools are governed by fundamentalist trustees who
interfere with curriculum content and faculties. The national
convention is moving away from Baptist doctrines such as the
individual's freedom to interpret Scriptures, local church autonomy
and basic beliefs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This week's recommendation is part of a 20-year bitter
theological dispute between conservatives and moderates in the
denomination. Texas has irked the national convention leaders by
developing its own educational-materials department and
establishing a missions program, competing with similar national
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paige Patterson, president of Southeastern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C., and past president of
the Southern Baptist Convention, predicted that if the budget were
ratified, the Baptist General Convention of Texas would lose a
number of large and influential churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a revolting development,'' said Patterson, a native
Texan. ``The only thing that surprises me is that they have misread
their own churches. ... They're going to find out these churches
consider themselves Southern Baptists first and Texas Baptists
second.''

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore challenged Gov. George
W. Bush Wednesday to agree to ban the use of unregulated party
money on television and radio advertising for the rest of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his offer Wednesday morning in separate telephone
calls to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Russell Feingold,
D-Wis., the authors of legislation that would ban so-called soft
money contributions altogether. On Tuesday night, Bush told CNN's
Larry King in a nationally televised interview that he was unlikely
to accept such a pact because he did not trust the Democrats to
abide by it.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday night, a Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer,
said, ``I just doubt that somebody who has recognized no
controlling legal authority over his campaign fund raising is going
to abide by a handshake now.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Democrats have raised far less soft money than the
Republicans and because Bush had all but declined before Gore
announced his acceptance, the vice president's offer would seem to
bear little political cost.
</P>
<P>
   But Feingold, in a telephone interview, said he remained hopeful
that a similar agreement between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep.
Rick Lazio, the candidates for U.S. Senate in New York, would
ultimately help press Bush to accept the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the momentum on something like this builds, it's hard avoid
it,'' Feingold said. ``We see a real sea change occurring in the
use of soft money. It's finally getting the taint it deserves.''
McCain could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his offer on a campaign day when both he and his
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, spent considerable effort
rebutting one of the very advertisements that the Democrats would
propose to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Medicare policy at a community center in Altoona,
Iowa, the vice president railed against a Republican National
Committee commercial that he said had mischaracterized his plan for
a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Lieberman, speaking at
a center for the elderly in Milwaukee, made the same charge.
</P>
<P>
   After a week when some polls have shown Bush gaining ground, it
was the first public indication that the Republican ads had
succeeded in placing the Democrats on the defensive. ``Our message
is getting through on Medicare, particularly in paid media,'' a
Bush aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's soft-money challenge to Bush builds on a similar position
taken by the vice president in March, when he proposed that both
campaigns forgo those contributions and campaign through frequent
debates rather than television advertising. While acknowledging at
the time that he was an imperfect messenger because of his role in
the Clinton administration's fund raising, Gore said he would make
campaign finance reform a priority of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But with no agreement reached at that point, both parties have
raised huge sums this year. The Republican National Committee
collected $153 million through Aug. 31 while the Democratic
National Committee raised an estimated $80 million to $100 million,
party officials said. Much of that money is soft.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ticket has been on a fund-raising tear for the
last five weeks. Wednesday night, less than eight hours after
issuing his challenge, Gore attended two fund-raisers in Washington
that raised $3.5 million for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidential campaigns have ended their own fund-raising
as a condition for receiving $68 million apiece in public
financing. But the parties can continue to raise unlimited sums,
with few restrictions on the size of individual gifts, and much of
that money can be spent on advertising that directly promotes the
candidates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McCain and Feingold sent a letter to Gore and Bush
encouraging them to join Clinton and Lazio in swearing off
advertising financed with soft money. After speaking to the two
senators this morning, Gore released a letter to them announcing
his acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Bush-Cheney campaign will take the same action with the
Republican National Committee, I will call upon the Democratic
National Committee to cease all soft-money radio or television
advertising that aims to influence the presidential election,'' he
wrote. ``And I will also call on all independent organizations to
do so as well.''
</P>
<P>
   When King asked Bush whether he would accept such an
arrangement, he responded, ``Probably not, but I'd have to see what
it says.'' He added, ``I don't trust him, to be frank with you.''
In his appearance in Altoona and a subsequent rally in Des Moines
Wednesday, Gore emphasized his prescription drug coverage plan as a
means of setting the policy stage for his first debate with Bush,
next Tuesday in Boston. Beginning Saturday, Gore plans to devote
three days to debate preparation in Sarasota, Fla., where Gore also
practiced for his 1996 vice-presidential debate with Jack F. Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman both raised objections Wednesday to the
Republican Medicare advertisement, which charges that Gore's
prescription drug proposal would require seniors to join ``a
government HMO.'' New Republican mailings to elderly voters in
crucial states make a similar charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what that refers to?'' Gore asked Wednesday. ``That's
the way they describe Medicare. There's no big government HMO.
That's the way they describe Medicare. Medicare's not an HMO. You
get to choose your doctor. You get to choose your pharmacy. You
have the choice.''

 &HT;    VP warns seniors about Bush's plan
 &HT;

 &HT;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTOONA, Iowa _ Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore hammered
on the Medicare theme for the third day Wednesday, warning Iowa
seniors that George W. Bush's plan would leave out 95 percent of
those who need prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its first phase, our opponent's plan provides no help at
all to any senior who makes more than $14,600 a year,'' Gore told
Iowans at a community center in Altoona and a rally in Des Moines.
``You can see why they want to point fingers in the other direction
when their plan leaves out 95 percent of the people who need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder the group that seems most excited about the other
plan is the pharmaceutical companies,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also released a letter the vice president sent
to Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ Feingold, D-Wis., praising
their proposal earlier this week to ban soft money from the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a stance he has taken since March, Gore wrote that if
his Republican opponent, George W. Bush, will agree to the
proposal, ``I will call upon the Democratic National Committee to
cease all soft money radio or television advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said that although Bush has so far
declined to ban soft money, ``maybe he will suddenly have an
epiphany and see the light'' now that McCain, a Republican who has
been pushing for campaign finance reform, is speaking out again on
the issue. A similar deal was sealed last week by New York senate
candidates Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But a deal on the presidential campaign level seemed unlikely.
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer called Gore's proposal ``nothing
new.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same tactic that Al Gore tried in March when he
said he would forgo soft money while he was raising millions of
dollars in soft money,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   So-called soft money, contributed to parties by individuals,
corporations and special interest groups, is supposed to be used to
push issues rather than individual candidates, with no limit on the
size of donations.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, during a town hall meeting on prescription
drug coverage, Gore told about 200 retirees in Altoona that too
many seniors have to choose ``between filling their prescriptions
and filling their shopping carts.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his $253 billion Medicare plan, he said, ``If you decide
to participate, you can go to your own local pharmacy and get all
the medicine your doctor prescribes for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Medicare plan would cover half the cost of prescription
medicine up to $5,000 annually, and would provide catastrophic
coverage so that no Medicare beneficiary would have to pay more
than $4,000 a year for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would offer incentives to private insurance
companies to provide prescription benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear,'' Gore said. ``You get to see your doctor,
and your doctor is the one who decides what medicine is right for
you. No HMO or insurance company can overrule your doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then took questions from the audience and listened to their
frustrations. One retiree, Winifred Skinner, said she is forced to
collect aluminum cans for the 5-cent deposit to supplement her
limited income so that she can pay for medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take welfare. I don't take food stamps,'' she told
Gore. ``I'm a proud person. I want to work and earn what I have.''

TENNYSON COMING INTO HIS OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Officially, UCLA's men's soccer team plays on
Frank Marshall Field, named after the Hollywood producer who was
part of the Bruins' first NCAA-level team in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   It should be called Tennyson Field. McKinley Tennyson has made
it his own.
</P>
<P>
   The senior forward from Indiana has four goals on the field
(Cliff McKinley has the other) and eight goals this season, ranking
him first nationally in goals per game (1.6) and second in points
per game (3.2) for the 6-0, No. 1-ranked Bruins, who play tonight
at Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Tennyson also has scored back-to-back hat tricks (Sept. 6
against San Diego State and Sept. 17 against San Francisco) _
believed to be the first time it has been done since UNLV's Doug
Borgel in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   And he has done it on a young UCLA team that starts six freshmen
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hot right now,'' Tennyson said. ``I'm a forward. I'm
supposed to score goals . . . (and) an inch can mean a goal. I've
scored off some crosses, I'm getting good crosses from Shaun
Tsakiris and Adolfo Gregorio. I've been fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Todd Saldana knows this is a make-or-break year for
Tennyson. He wasn't part of the under-20 World Cup team, nor did he
play in the Olympics, which is the under-23 world championship.
Saldana knows Tennyson would like to play at the national level, so
he told Tennyson to work on his fitness, strength and ability to
hold onto the ball when defenders pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``For his size (6-foot-2 and 190 pounds) he should never get
knocked off the ball,'' Saldana said. ``He's always been fast,
always been powerful. He has scored goals before.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennyson's favorite moment came during his freshman year, when
he scored against Indiana in the NCAA-championship game, which UCLA
won.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has been a consistent scorer but never as the
first option. When you play alongside forwards such as Seth George
and Sasha Victorine, midfielders look for them first.
</P>
<P>
   They have graduated, leaving Tennyson as the first option. He is
making the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that potential and now he's trying to prove it,''
Saldana said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Miscellaneous Troy: One reason USC is ranked No. 1 by
Volleyball Magazine: Jennifer Pahl, who was named Pac-10 player of
the week after hitting .615 in two matches with 16 kills and no
errors in 27 attempts. She also had 10 blocks and eight digs.
</P>
<P>
   But she's not the only one playing well. Janae Henry had 11
kills and 11 digs in the sweep of Stanford on Friday, ending the
Cardinal's home streak at 45 matches and giving USC its first win
at Stanford since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   By sweeping Cal the next night, USC tied a 23-year-old record of
opening the season by winning 27 consecutive games. The Trojans
will break the record if they win the first game against Oregon
State on Friday. A victory in the first !ital!two games would give
this squad the school record for consecutive games won.
</P>
<P>
   USC is 9-0 and one of four undefeated teams in the nation _ and
the only one that hasn't lost a game. The women figure to be in
good shape, considering no match has lasted longer than 1 hour, 28
minutes. &QL;

RAOUL BERGER, 99, CONTROVERSIAL SCHOLAR OF U.S. CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mass., Ill.)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raoul Berger, a widely read and widely debated authority on the
U.S. Constitution, died Sept. 23 at his home in Concord, Mass., his
wife, Patricia, said. He was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's interpretation of the framers' intentions thrilled
liberals when he castigated President Richard M. Nixon's assertions
of executive privilege in an effort to keep information from
Congress in the Watergate case and appalled them when he wrote that
the Supreme Court had overstepped its authority in ordering the
racial desegregation of the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote seven books and more than 100 articles covering such
topics as impeachment, executive privilege, judicial review and the
death penalty, thrusting himself to the center of the incessant and
tortuous national debate on constitutional interpretations. He did
it with a style that inspired the author Garry Wills in 1974 to
speak of his ``exuberance of pugnacious learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Law was Berger's second career. In the 1920s and 1930s he was a
violinist who appeared as a soloist with the Cleveland Symphony,
served as second concertmaster with the Cincinnati Symphony and was
first violinist with the Cincinnati String Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   But making a living in classical music was no easier then than
now, so he went to medical school. When he saw his first cadaver,
he knew his future was in law. He graduated from Northwestern
University's law school at 34, the oldest in his class. His largest
achievement, writing learned and influential books, began in 1969,
when at 68 he published his first book, ``Congress vs. The Supreme
Court.'' At 97, he was still writing articles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Israel Shenker, a reporter for The New York Times,
wrote: ``Raoul Berger thinks of himself as a Dutch housemaid
sweeping the dark corners of the Constitution. Impeachment, for
example, was a dark corner until Mr. Berger wrote the first
comprehensive book about it. Now the dust is flying around
executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every few months he lays his broom aside long enough to
testify before a Congressional committee, transforming himself from
Dutch housemaid into Dutch uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the forward to Berger's 1997 book, ``Government by Judiciary:
The Transformation of the Fourteenth Amendment,'' an expanded
edition of the 1977 version, the historian and legal scholar
Forrest McDonald wrote that Berger presented his recurring thesis:
while it is often necessary to go beyond the text of the
Constitution and its amendments to gauge the authors' intent, it is
wrong to assume ``ideas derived from `natural rights' dogmas or
other external values.''
</P>
<P>
   This strict constructionist view led Berger to a conservative
position on the scope of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th
Amendment. He said his research showed that the sole purpose of the
amendment was to prevent freed slaves from being shackled again
after the Civil War. Therefore, he criticized basing such
wide-ranging decisions on the amendment as those involving school
desegregation, abortion rights and the principle of one man, one
vote.
</P>
<P>
   These strongly expressed views have drawn the wrath of those who
believe the Constitution grows and changes organically, including
Justice Thurgood Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Kunstler, a civil rights and liberties lawyer,
accused Berger of ``a coldly sophisticated attempt to roll back the
clock to the America of 1787 insofar as constitutional law is
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Berger won liberal accolades for his attack on
Nixon for invoking ``executive privilege'' in the Watergate case.
Berger told a Senate committee in 1973: ``You don't need more
hearings, you need gumption. You'll be treated like office boys
until you stand up and kick them in the slats.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he wrote in The Yale Law Journal that Nixon's
impeachment defense was based on ``instant history'' and ``sheer
effrontery.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger called himself a moderate Democrat, and it sometimes
pained him that ``my conclusions are not infrequently at war with
my predilections.'' But it did not stop him. His advice was that
the people should change the Constitution rather than stretch its
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, he said that the constitutional sleuth is much
like the classical musician who strives to ``search for and lay
bare the meaning that is imprisoned in the little black dots which
weave their way across the music staves.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger was born in Russia on Jan. 4, 1901, and brought to the
United States at the age of 4. He had been named Raoul after a
character in Meyerbeer's opera, ``The Huguenots.'' As a youth, he
studied music in New York and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   After abandoning his musical career for law school, he practiced
in Chicago for two years. In 1938, he joined President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's New Deal as special assistant to the attorney general,
and held other posts. In 1946 he retired from government and for
the next 16 years practiced law in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, at 61, be began his teaching career as a law professor
at the University of California at Berkeley. Several years later,
he moved to Harvard, where he became the Charles Warren Senior
Fellow in American Legal History.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was not until he embarked on his journey as a
constitutional scholar that he began rising to greatness,''
McDonald wrote.
</P>
<P>
   His other books were ``Impeachment: The Constitutional
Problems'' (1973), ``Executive Privilege: A Constitutional Myth''
(1974), ``Death Penalties: The Supreme Court's Obstacle Course''
(1982), ``Federalism: The Founders' Design'' (1987) and ``The
Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights'' (1989).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Berger is survived by his son, Carl,
and two granddaughters. A daughter, Andrea Kalodner, died several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Berger never ducked an intellectual battle. When law reviews
bristled with critical reviews of his ``Government by Judiciary,''
he wrote 40 articles and one book-length rebuttal in response.
Quoting the philosopher John Locke, he said no response meant
victory was ``adjudged not to him who had the truth on his side,
but by the last word in the dispute.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ George W. Bush on Wednesday found what he called a
``beacon of hope'' in a violence-prone section of this city from
which to promote the role of faith-based groups in teaching
children how to behave.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahoney, the
Republican presidential nominee and Texas governor held a rally on

was shot five years ago.

<P>
   The teacher, Alfredo Perez, survived. The incident helped spark
a community-renewal effort that organizers say is a showcase for
the cooperative efforts of public, charitable and faith-based
partnerships in developing safe classroom environments in the inner
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I came to this school is because I love to
highlight beacons of hope, centers of excellence that challenge the
odds,'' Bush said, against a backdrop of Hispanic and
African-American schoolchildren who welcomed him to South Central
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said that the neighborhood around Ascension Catholic
School and the Figueroa Street School, where Perez taught,
experienced more than 20 drive-by shootings over the past three
months. But he said the two schools themselves are now safe places
for children to learn.
</P>
<P>
   He said students at both schools ``now enjoy and benefit from a
safe school environment, counseling services, health screening,
after-school care, extended-learning opportunities and the security
of a supportive community.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney, who delivered the invocation at the beginning of the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles last month, also has
invited Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, to visit
the two schools. But Gore hasn't responded.
</P>
<P>
   Perez attended Wednesday's rally but didn't speak.
</P>
<P>
   Bush used the occasion to promote his educational priorities,
including ``zero tolerance'' for disruptive behavior in the
classroom and a greater role for church-based groups in
after-school care and mentoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perez was struck by a shot fired from outside his
school, Bush said that classrooms need to be ``safe havens''
offering all children an opportunity to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he appreciated the discipline and behavior standards
imposed by Catholic schools and wanted similar standards to be
adopted in all public schools. He cited Texas' system of
alternative schools to which disruptive students can be
transferred.
</P>
<P>
   While in Los Angeles, Bush was greeted by the latest Los Angeles
Times Poll, which showed him with a national lead of 6 percentage
points over Gore, mainly because of a gender gap.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted Saturday through Monday, indicated Bush was
favored by 48 percent of likely American voters, compared with 42
percent for Gore. Although Gore had a 7-point lead among women, the
Texas governor had a 22-point lead among men.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times Poll, which had a margin of error of plus
or minus 4 percentage points, gave Bush a wider lead than other
surveys released this week. But other polls either show Bush with a
slight edge or indicate the race is even after Bush had trailed
Gore during most of the period since the Democratic National
Convention.

A DEMOCRAT WHO DOESN'T ADVERTISE IT LEADS IN HOSTILE TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ In this overwhelmingly Republican state,
Democrats have to tread carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the 1st Congressional District, Kathleen
McConkie-Collinwood is bringing in the president on Saturday to
help her sagging efforts against the Republican incumbent, James V.
Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, not the real president. Utah residents do not especially
like President Clinton. Her guest is Martin Sheen, the actor who
plays a president on ``The West Wing'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheen's appearance is worth noting. As a cautionary tale
about what it means to be a Democrat in Utah, it illustrates how
carefully many Democrats package themselves to achieve any measure
of elective success.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the 2nd District, which includes part of Salt Lake City
and adjoining suburbs, Jim Matheson, the Democrat running for
Congress, has made no such overture to presidents of any kind. He
has one advantage that McConkie-Collinwood lacks: widespread name
recognition as the son of a former _ and immensely popular _
two-term Democratic governor, Scott M. Matheson.
</P>
<P>
   It is a major reason that polls show Matheson far ahead of the
Republican candidate, Derek Smith, in a race to fill an open seat.
Smith defeated the two-term incumbent, Merrill Cook, in a rowdy
Republican primary this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But even here in the one region of Utah where Democrats can be
found in significant numbers, Matheson has tailored his campaign to
play down his party affiliation and loyalties to suit a district
that has swung back and forth over the last two decades but never
far from core centrist values that Utahans hold dear.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy appears to be working. The latest poll, conducted
for Salt Lake's Deseret News and KSL-TV, the NBC affiliate, and
released last Sunday showed Matheson leading Smith, a
self-described conservative, by 46 percent to 32 percent, well
outside the margin of sampling error of 7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   That was encouraging news for the Democratic Party, which is
counting on a Matheson victory as one of several turnovers that
Democrats need to regain control of the House. The current
breakdown is 222 Republicans, 210 Democrats, 2 independents and 1
vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   But if Matheson is elected and follows through on his campaign
promises, House Democrats should not necessarily count on blind
loyalty from him. For example, he says he does not support the
registration and licensing of guns, a proposal Vice President Al
Gore favors and most Republicans oppose, and he contends that
Gore's plan to include prescription medicine as a Medicare benefit
may be too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Matheson said he disagreed with the way the Clinton
administration had used the Antiquities Act to create national
monuments, a position held by legions of Republicans throughout the
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Democrat; I don't deny that,'' he said in an interview
here this week. ``At the end of the day, everybody knows your party
affiliation, and that's fine. But I would like to emphasize an
approach that goes beyond singular partisan politics for how to
address public policy. I would like to get away from the partisan
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Matheson's campaign literature underscores what he calls a
``common-sense approach'' to solving problems. One brochure says,
``I'll reach across party lines, work with everyone and do what is
right.'' Nowhere does it identify him as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Matheson, 40, a former energy company consultant, sought
out high-profile Democrats to visit the district on his behalf.
Only one of national stature has, Sen. Russell D. Feingold of
Wisconsin, a friend since their days at Harvard, and no one else is
expected. At one campaign event this week, Matheson greeted voters
at the home of his close friend Eric Leavitt, a Republican and the
younger brother of Utah's Republican governor, Michael O. Leavitt,
who is supporting Smith.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Smith, 35, who built a successful high-tech
company, has shared a stage only with members of his own party, a
steady stream of stalwarts that includes Speaker J. Dennis Hastert,
Rep. Dick Armey, the majority leader, and Rep. Tom Delay, the
majority whip. More are coming, Smith said, including Sen. John
McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   For Matheson, the accent on policy, not politics, is vital to
win support from the fast-growing number of suburban voters in a
district that President George Bush and Bob Dole carried in the
last two presidential elections and that Gov. George. W. Bush of
Texas is expected to win this year.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, it has given Smith a convenient way to
argue, in effect, that if voters support moderate or even
Republican positions they should vote for a Republican, not a
Democrat reaching for the political center. And besides, he
emphasized, even Utah Democrats act like Washington Democrats after
they win election.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, even though he supports traditional
Republican issues in his fight for the middle, it won't matter much
what he feels about them,'' Smith said of his opponent. ``The
Democratic leadership is going to determine the issues that see the
light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he expected to overtake Matheson in the closing weeks
of the campaign as voters became more familiar with him and his
policy positions, like supporting tax cuts and education reform
that provides more local control over spending federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Congressional Committee is helping with
nearly $1 million for television advertisements, about four times
what the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is spending
for Matheson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closing,'' Smith said, mindful of a Salt Lake Tribune
poll three weeks ago that failed to mention party affiliation and
showed Matheson leading by 27 points. ``He has a famous last name,
but when Republican and independent voters become more familiar
with me, I think they'll come over to my camp.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hollywood executives pledged Wednesday to reduce
their marketing of violent movies to children, but their proposals
drew skepticism from senators concerned that profits drive the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Amid bitter criticism of their advertising practices, eight
movie moguls said they will take steps to ensure their efforts to
entice adults to the theater are not misdirected at children. But
they stopped short of promising an absolute end to the
controversial advertising, saying that some violent movies carry
inspirational messages that should be marketed to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., assailed what he called the
industry's half-hearted attempts. Pressing the executives to ``work
a little more assiduously'' to monitor their advertising, McCain
said Congress will be keeping a close watch on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of your business lies in your hands,'' said McCain,
who invited the executives to appear before the Senate Commerce
Committee, which he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the executives said they will end the test
marketing of violent R-rated films to children under age 17, unless
the child's parent is at the movie screening. They also said they
will not show coming attractions of violent, R-rated films before
audiences awaiting the start of a G-rated movie, which is aimed at
all ages.
</P>
<P>
   The executives' appearance before the Commerce Committee
followed the release of a Federal Trade Commission report Sept. 11
that found widespread and aggressive marketing of violent movies to
children. For example, the FTC found advertising of the films
during television shows popular with children, including ``Xena:
Warrior Princess'' and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The pervasive advertising to youngsters belies the industry's
efforts to help parents monitor what children see and hear by
rating the age-appropriateness of its products, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the FTC's findings, the executives stressed their
concern about exposing underage viewers to violent movies. Five of
the company officials noted that they themselves are parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all appreciate the challenges of raising children today,''
said Paramount Pictures' Motion Picture Group Vice Chairman Rob
Friedman. ``I work hard to meet these challenges, at least in part
by helping (my) children make decisions regarding what movies and
television programs they watch, what music they hear and what games
they play. That's our job as parents, and we take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The others making note of their children were Fox Filmed (CQ)
Entertainment Chairman Jim Gianopulos, Warner Bros. President Alan
Horn, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Vice Chairman Chris McGurk and Universal
Pictures Chairman Stacey Snider.
</P>
<P>
   In their joint pledge, the executives said they will each
appoint a corporate officer to regularly review their companies'
marketing efforts for violent films to ensure they are not
``inappropriately specifically targeting children.''
</P>
<P>
   They also said they will do more to encourage theater owners to
comply with industry guidelines barring the admittance of children
under age 17 to R-rated movies without a parent. But the executives
declined to say what specific action they would take.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptical Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, tried to prod
the executives into beefing up their efforts. She suggested that
Congress might pass a law to prohibit them from allowing children
under age 17 from attending R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   Although such a law might violate constitutional free-speech
rights, Hutchison told the executives they should regard her
comments as ``a signal across the bow'' that Congress is seriously
considering what it can do to help parents protect children from
the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are throwing up their arms in frustration,'' Hutchison
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney President Robert Iger, however, cautioned the
senators against regulating advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would object vehemently if the government steps in'' and
tells the industry what it can and cannot distribute to viewers, he
said. ``It is not appropriate for the government to make
programming decisions for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In defense of advertising, Sony Pictures Entertainment President
Mel Harris said marketing violent films to youngsters is valid when
the movies' message is uplifting. Parents, not government
officials, should be the arbiters of what is appropriate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Harris said his company's recent R-rated release
``The Patriot,'' contained graphic depictions of war but also an
inspiring message about the American Revolution that many parents
would welcome their children experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Harris, DreamWorks SKG executive Walter Parkes said his
company's R-rated drama ``Saving Private Ryan'' won praise from
parents and educators for its depiction of the violent heroism of
the Normandy invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Committee members agreed that much of what the movie
industry produces has merit but said company leaders must do more
to ensure that their advertising is directed at parents and not
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're part of the solution,'' Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.,
told the executives, ``and part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said ``violence pays.'' However,
he added that perhaps federal regulators can stifle advertising of
violent films to children the same way they legally block obscene
material from being shown on television.
</P>
<P>
   The movie executives had spurned Commerce Committee Chairman
McCain's invitation to attend an earlier hearing on the advertising
issue, prompting the Arizona Republican to fire off a second round
of appearance requests, which they accepted.

EFFECT OF PRISON BUILDING ON CRIME IS WEIGHED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., N.Y.)   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first studies to look at the link between the enormous
growth of incarceration and the significant drop in crime in the
1990s show that the United States' prison-building boom has
accounted for 5 percent to 25 percent of the eight-year decline. In
light of those findings, some of the researchers questioned whether
the benefits from the growth of incarceration were worth the cost
to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The studies found that the number of inmates in jails and
prisons quadrupled over the past two decades, to 2 million, and now
cost about $40 billion a year. To avert one killing in the 1990s,
it required locking up an additional 670 prisoners, at a cost of
$13.4 million a year, according to an estimate by Richard
Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri
at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld's findings are included in the most comprehensive of
the new studies, a book called ``The Crime Drop in America,'' to be
published next month by Cambridge University Press. Written by a
group of academic experts, the studies found that ``no single
factor can be invoked as the cause of the crime decline of the
1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the authors conclude, ``the explanation appears to lie
with a number of factors,'' which interacted with one another,
making ``it difficult to isolate the relative contribution of any
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Among these factors, in addition to the growth in incarceration,
the authors said, were the ebbing of the crack epidemic, innovative
efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, new police
tactics and an improved job market. The authors said it was
difficult if not impossible to determine how much these factors
contributed to the drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rosenfeld said, the country may be undergoing a
cultural change in which people have become less tolerant of
certain forms of violence, particularly domestic violence, which
has helped account for a decline in killings by adults every year
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that American adults are becoming, in a word,
more civilized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar cultural change beginning in the late Middle Ages in
Western Europe, with the spread of courts of law and better
manners, helped reduce crime so that homicide rates there today are
only about one-tenth of what they were in the 14th century, other
scholars have found.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, released Thursday by the Sentencing Project, a
research and advocacy group in Washington, found that states that
had increased the number of prison inmates the most in the 1990s
actually had smaller reductions in crime than those states with
below-average increases in incarceration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Texas led the nation with a 144 percent increase in prisoners
from 1991 to 1998 and had a decrease in crime of 35 percent, the
study said. But two other populous states, California and New York,
which had much smaller increases in incarceration _ 52 percent for
California and 24 percent for New York _ had even sharper drops in
crime. In California, the drop was 36 percent and in New York, 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In another recent study, of the impact of the growth in
incarceration on the drop in crime, Anne Piehl, an associate
professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, drawing on changes in crime and
prison data for each state, found that the increase in
incarceration from 1989 to 1999 accounted for only about 5 percent
of the drop in overall violent and property crime.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle Moody, a professor of economics at the College of
William and Mary who has long studied the link between
incarceration and crime, criticized the new estimates of the effect
of imprisonment, saying they were far too low because they did not
take into account the recent history of prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The rate at which criminals were incarcerated remained
remarkably stable from about 1900 to the mid-1960s, as did the
crime rate, Moody said, but then, with a sharp increase in crime in
the mid-'60s, there was not an equivalent buildup in incarceration.
The rate of incarceration has only recently begun to catch up with
the crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure these other people are underestimating the
effects of incarceration on crime because they are ignoring the
historical changes,'' Moody said. ``Prison has a much greater
effect on crime than anything else, like employment or policing.''
</P>
<P>
   The new book contains two studies of the impact of the growth in
incarceration on the crime drop in the 1990s. Besides the study by
Rosenfeld, who estimated that incarceration reduced homicides by
adults by 26 percent, a study by William Spelman, a professor of
public policy at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at
the University of Texas, calculated that it reduced violent crime
by 25 percent.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Military units ready to fight, but at `high risk,' officers say
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By MICHAEL HEDGES
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tip of America's war spear remains sharp, but
the supporting shaft has been greatly weakened by budget cuts and
the demands of numerous overseas deployments, top officers told
Congress Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If forced to fight two major wars at the same time, the U.S.
military would be at a ``high risk,'' Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Combat units forming the military's spearpoint have been kept
ready to fight by sacrificing what Shelton described as the shaft
of the spear: support unit readiness, new equipment and upgraded
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk associated with the most demanding scenario (of wars
in two places, like Korea and Iraq) has increased over the past
several years,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take us longer to respond to hostilities. In turn,
this can mean territory lost and more potential for a longer fight
and increased casualties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has been particularly hard hit by shrinking
budgets during the time when they were mounting bombing campaigns
in Kosovo and Iraq, said Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall combat readiness of our combat units is down 23
percent since 1996,'' he said. The average aircraft in the Air
Force is now 22 years old, and aircraft will average 30 years old
by 2015, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate hearings came in a politically charged
atmosphere, as presidential candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore
have continued to spar over the issue of the military's readiness
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has criticized the Clinton-Gore administration, claiming it
has eroded the effectiveness of the military with budget cuts while
increasing far flung peace-keeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has responded by saying the military reductions started
under Bush's father, former President George Bush, but noted that
the U.S. military remained by far the strongest on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearings Wednesday, both candidates said their
positions were supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's testimony supported Governor Bush and Secretary
Cheney's assessment of our military forces today, and the need for
new leadership to prepare and transform our military for future
generations,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our troops are overdeployed, morale is low, and Governor Bush
has a plan to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore team saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony of the joint chiefs confirmed that what Al Gore
and Joe Lieberman have been saying about military readiness is
right, that America does have the greatest military in the world,''
said Jano Cabrera, a Gore spokesman. ``George Bush's claims of a
military in decline were not supported by the joint chiefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Charts used by the joint chiefs at Wednesday's hearings showed a
sharp decline in military spending which began after the collapse
of communism and continued after the Persian Gulf War, which were
the final years of the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Spending has remained at roughly 1993 levels throughout the
Clinton-Gore years, while military deployments in places such as
Somalia, Bosnia and Kosovo have put added strain on the military,
the generals testified.
</P>
<P>
   The military had a budget for $295 billion for this year. Of
that, $60 billion was for procurement _ buying and maintaining
weaponry, from ships and planes to artillery and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Military budgets began falling from Reagan-era peaks of roughly
$325 billion a year, when the Cold War ended and politicians in
both parties began talking about a ``peace dividend.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the military has been reduced from 1,913,750 people
on active duty to 1,371,500.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said the military supported Congressional Budget Office
estimates that an increase of $30 billion a year in procurement,
and about another $30 billion in general annual budget increases,
would be necessary to return the military to a strength needed to
assure ``overwhelming superiority'' in possible combat scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The top leaders of the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force assured
Congress that combat units such as Army and Marine divisions, Navy
carrier battle groups and fighter and bomber squadrons are ready to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the much more numerous parts of the military that
supply, support and reinforce the first-strike units are in worse
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we reduce our discussions to sound bites we talk only
about the first to go forward, the first to fight, and as I say
they are ready,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you look below these depths you find there are many
other units that are vitally important to war fighting,'' Shelton
said. ``They are not as ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The heads of the four branches of the armed services described
what one called a ``death spiral.'' They said money was being taken
out of weapons procurement and infrastructure maintenance to assure
units deployed to places such as Kosovo, Bosnia and the Persian
Gulf are at peak fighting condition.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, planes, ships and helicopters got older, support
units were thinned and bases became worse places to live and work,
they said. Shelton said such ``robbing of Peter to pay Paul'' is
``mortgaging our future readiness.''

REPUBLICANS CALL GORE SOLICITATION MISLEADING
</HEADLINE>
  By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Gore-Lieberman campaign is raising millions of
dollars for an obscure fund that is supposed to pay only for legal
and accounting costs and not television advertisements or other
political costs.
</P>
<P>
   But recent solicitation letters for the fund suggest that a
donation to it will help the Gore-Lieberman campaign attack the
Republicans, leading some campaign finance experts and Bush aides
to say the messages are misleading and run afoul of federal
election law.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of letters sent to supporters, including one sent this
week, Gore says that contributions of $1,000 or less to the fund
will be used to ``expose the Bush-Cheney voting record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are working hard to cloud their record and
their real views,'' Gore writes in one message. ``The campaign
urgently needs your support to expose their real agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such suggestions that the contributions will help pay
for attacks on the Republicans, the Federal Election Commission
prohibits money given to that committee to pay for anything other
than campaign lawyers and accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gov. George W. Bush accused the vice president's
campaign Wednesday of using the fund-raising solicitation messages
to ``mislead contributors'' about how the money would be spent and
``attempting to skirt federal campaign spending limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president, after his protestations that he would be
the messenger for campaign finance reform, has found a shady way to
circumvent federal election spending limits, an apparent violation
of FEC regulations,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush.
``These are deceptive fund-raising solicitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said the
solicitations were not deceptive and were entirely legal. He
stressed that a computerized link in the messages, which were sent
by e-mail, leads the reader directly to another computerized page
that allows the use of a credit-card to make a donation of up to
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   On that page, a disclaimer required by the FEC appears, stating
the contributions to the General Election Legal and Accounting
Compliance Fund, also known as Gelac (pronounced GEE-lak), will be
used to pay the Gore-Lieberman campaign's lawyers and accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani added that contributors cannot make a donation without
being led to the page that clearly states the donations will pay
the fees of lawyers and accountants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-mail goes to the link and the link very clearly sets out
the FEC language,'' Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts on federal election law were troubled that the
message strongly implies that the money will help the
Gore-Lieberman ticket pay for issue advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm troubled by the language, because it is so clearly an end
run around the purposes of the FEC regulation,'' said Trevor
Potter, a former FEC chairman who was a lawyer with Sen. John
McCain's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's presidential exploratory committee began raising money
for the Gelac in January 1999. The committee has already taken in
more than $7 million and spent $547,700 on fund-raising consultants
and direct-mail costs, FEC records show. Fabiani said all of that
money was spent on Gelac solicitations, which federal election
guidelines permit.
</P>
<P>
   For his Gelac, Bush has raised $4.3 million and spent $68,193 on
fund-raising costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month and earlier this month, the Gore-Lieberman campaign
sent, by e-mail, at least four letters seeking donations to the
committee. A spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign said the
campaign was considering whether to file a complaint with the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Striton, an FEC spokesman, declined to say if the agency was
examining the Gore-Lieberman Gelac solicitations. ``The campaigns
are audited after the election to check out what has occurred
within the fund,'' Striton said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bush and Gore campaigns in August accepted $67.5
million federal taxpayer dollars to pay for the general election
campaigns, the candidates vowed not to raise any more ``hard
money,'' the $1,000 checks from individuals. But the Gelac
committees can continue to raise donations of $1,000 from
individuals to pay for legal and accounting costs, even from
contributors who have already given the legal limit of $1,000 to
the candidates' primary campaigns.

ANALYSIS: DESPITE UPS AND DOWNS, SURVEYS SHOW RACE IS TIED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANET ELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After watching his opponent's popularity rise in the polls over
the last month, Gov. George W. Bush got a dose of good news over
the last few days. The momentum is now his, with three new
nationwide polls showing that he has regained some of the ground he
lost to Vice President Al Gore. Bush seems to have the edge in at
least two of the polls. But is it real?
</P>
<P>
   The basic fact is, no one is ahead. When the polls are looked at
together, the presidential race is so close that it is impossible
to give either candidate an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got his most encouraging news from The Los Angeles Times,
which reported Wednesday that thanks to a 22-point advantage among
men, Bush was now leading Gore, 48 percent to 42 percent. But since
the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points,
the findings have to be considered a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, three out of four people interviewed said the
coming debates would affect their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Polls differ in the samples they use, the questions they ask,
the ways they interpret the numbers and the ways they report the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls report the preferences for all registered voters,
which represents the views of about 80 percent of all American
adults. But based on voter turnout in years past, not all 80
percent are going to vote in November, so some polls use a series
of questions to determine who is most likely to vote. This group
accounts for about 50 percent of all adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll is reporting the results of a
daily tracking poll, which involves taking separate national
samples for each of three days and averaging them. Each day, they
add a new sample and drop the oldest one. Tracking polls usually
are very short, often with as few as 10 questions. Other recent
polls, like those of Newsweek and The Los Angeles Times, use one
sample over several days and have much longer questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Not all polls word their questions the same way _ even on the
most basic question. When asking voters whom they now support, some
polls use only the names of the presidential candidates while
others include the names of the vice-presidential candidates as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the margin of sampling error, which unavoidably
occurs from randomly sampling the active residential telephone
exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   A margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points,
for example, refers to 3 percentage points on each candidate's
number. So in a hypothetical race where there is a two-point gap,
say of 44 percent for John Smith and 46 percent for Bill Jones, the
race could be as far apart as 41 percent for Smith and 49 percent
for Jones, or the advantage could fall to Smith, 47 percent to 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll reported a nationwide
telephone tracking poll taken Sept. 24-26, with 696 likely voters.
Gore was the choice of 44 percent of the respondents, while Bush
was the choice of 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton Survey Research Associates took a nationwide telephone
poll for Newsweek from Sept. 20 to Sept. 22 with 766 likely voters.
In that poll Gore was the choice of 47 percent and Bush was the
choice of 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Los Angeles Times poll, the two have a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. When the polls
are averaged, Gore has 44 percent and Bush has 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing to keep in mind is that when pollsters ask
people about their votes, they usually ask whom they would vote for
``if the election were being held today.'' But nearly six weeks
will pass, and many polls will be taken before anyone votes.

SPORTS COLUMN: EWING'S MISSED OPPORTUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ And so, as the late autumn, if not the hoary winter,
of his career is upon him, Patrick Ewing, at age 38, with his
7-foot body battered but still willing after 15 bruising seasons
with the Knicks, looked back on his professional basketball life.
``Athletically,'' he said, ``I'm not where I was back in my prime,
but mentally I'm much better. When I think about what I knew back
then and what I know now, I realize how great I could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   This candid, even surprising, observation from him occurred
Monday at the news conference in Seattle that introduced Ewing,
fresh from the recent trade, to the fans of his new team, the
SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   The concept that youth is wasted on the young is less than
original. Most of us have had it, but for many, what we missed we
missed because of a combination of arrogance and ignorance: We
didn't know, were never told, were certain we knew better, or let
personal considerations outweigh anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing seemed to have shared some of those characteristics. A
wondrous talent, a superb scorer and one who often played hurt and
invariably hard, he missed opportunities to become a champion, or
to set himself into a better position to become a champion.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely seemed to trust his teammates, for example, or some of
his coaches, believing that he was the one who knew how to win a
championship, that he must carry the team on offense. But the goal
of a title has thus far eluded him. Michael Jordan, who knew
something about winning and is a friend of Ewing's, told him a few
years ago, ``Patrick, you'll never win a championship until you
learn how to pass out of the double team.'' It took Ewing until
near the end of his Knick career to be willing to pass the ball _
and not just under duress _ to the open teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and the rest of the Bulls have generally agreed that
Chicago would not have won its first three championships without
Bill Cartwright, a limited player physically but a highly
intelligent one. The Bulls needed a force at center, and Cartwright
provided it. He was traded to the Bulls by the Knicks for Charles
Oakley, a power forward. Early on, the Knicks had hoped to play
Ewing at power forward and Cartwright at center, because Ewing,
though a dominating center in college, had more versatility than
Cartwright. Ewing balked at the suggestion. And management, for
essentially and, it turns out, unfortunately, the whole of his
career, submitted to Ewing's demands. And Ewing's best moves
evolved into power forward drives and medium-range jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing liked to get the ball so much that when he took a
defensive rebound, he rarely threw the outlet pass to start a fast
break but had a guard circle around to take a hand-off, allowing
him time to get downcourt and set up, frustrating a long line of
up-tempo teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Patrick, personally,'' said Dave DeBusschere, who, as
general manager, drafted Ewing in 1985. ``But if I were playing,
there were times I'd have said: `Patrick, clear out of the center
and go to the other side. Open things up!' I thought he cared too
much for offense when he could have been an overwhelming force on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   When Don Nelson became coach of the Knicks, he told Ewing that
he wanted him to be a better passer. Ewing was shocked. ``I am a
good passer,'' he said. The Knicks opened the season on a winning
streak. They were running and moving the ball. Ewing went to
Nelson. ``I'm not getting enough touches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Patrick,'' Nelson said, ``we're on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Ewing said. ``I'm not getting enough touches.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ewing for 15 years with the Knicks, one had occasion to
wonder what he could be thinking. Coach after coach on the sideline
hollered, on defense, ``Stay down, Patrick, stay down!'' But time
after time, he went for the fake. Other actions were equally
baffling, like his roaming off the bench when there was a scuffle
against Miami in the playoffs in 1997, despite his knowing the
rules. It earned him a game suspension and contributed mightily to
the Heat's victory in the series.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has anything to do with Ewing's personality off the
court _ his interaction, or lack of it, with the fans or the news
media. That was purely his business. In the end, though, Ewing
cheated not only himself of being, as he said, as great as he could
have been, but he also, to a significant degree, deprived fans and
his teams of a better, more satisfying kind of basketball that he
was capable of providing.
</P>
<P>
   Now Patrick Ewing turns a new page in his career. It is never
too late to learn. The genuine hope here is that, finally, he does.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On her fourth day as a teacher, Donna Moffett would
not _ could not _ stop smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that only eight of her 21 first-graders had shown up
on time to follow her, ducklinglike, from the schoolyard to her
muggy second-floor classroom at Public School 92 in Brooklyn. Or
that one little boy, with rumpled curls and a sullen gaze, rolled
his eyes and disparaged her every move.
</P>
<P>
   Moffett, 45, peppy and crisp in a navy dress, forced herself to
keep smiling, even when the 6-year-olds booed her choice of a
second story to read out loud. Even when, as the children lined up
for lunch, one of the more impulsive students dropped to the
ground, attached herself to Moffett's ankles and shrieked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be polite, show respect and use our inside voices,''
she said, reciting her newly minted class rules. ``We will work
hard and come to class prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Moffett, who entered teaching on Sept. 7 with hardly any
preparation at all, has a bumpy ride ahead. In July, she abandoned
her comfortable longtime job as a legal secretary near Wall Street
to be one of 320 ``teaching fellows'' _ people with little or no
teaching experience, hired by Schools Chancellor Harold Levy to
fill chronic vacancies in New York City's most troubled public
schools. In August, the fellows took a crash course in teaching and
eight hours of certification exams.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to teaching was a bold move for Moffett, a sensitive and
meticulous woman who has spent most of her adult life performing
administrative tasks in orderly offices. She is used to a 9-to-5
schedule, a comfortable salary and a quiet, childless existence. So
why take this frightening leap?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leading a pleasant life with very little risk,''
Moffett, a petite woman with curly brown hair, said last week.
``This school and these children, they may take everything I have.
But there's a really deep well in me, and it's time to draw on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she agreed to let a reporter observe her during this
uncomfortable first year because she believes so strongly in the
importance of teaching, and in the potential of the teaching
fellows program.
</P>
<P>
   Moffett was assigned to P.S. 92, a hulking brick building that
takes up almost a block in the Flatbush section, a working-class
neighborhood increasingly populated by Caribbean immigrants. The
state has been monitoring the school since 1989, long before
Moffett's pupils were born, and has repeatedly threatened to close
it. The school has been through five principals in five years.
Although scores on city and state standardized reading tests rose
sharply last year, nearly three-quarters of the students still read
below grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Moffett used to read these statistics in newspapers and discuss
them with civic-minded friends. Now she is discovering what the
numbers mean, up close and in painful detail.
</P>
<P>
   She is under tremendous pressure not only to start her young
charges reading and writing, but also to prepare them for the tests
that they will face in later grades _ tests that make or break
schools like P.S. 92. Yet Moffett has barely begun learning how to
teach. The teaching fellows program is paying her tuition for
weekly graduate classes at the City University of New York, which
will eventually lead to a master's degree in education. But most of
her lessons will come on the job, at a school that cannot afford to
allow many more mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope that all my students will be reading by the
end of first grade,'' she said two days before school started.
</P>
<P>
   But first, as experienced teachers warn repeatedly, Moffett's
students need to learn the classroom rules. She recited them
constantly during the first week of school, asking the children to
chime in. In addition to working hard and being polite, they are
expected to come to school by 8, to enter and leave the room
quietly, to sit in their seats and listen carefully, and to raise
their hands when they want to speak.
</P>
<P>
   But on Day 4, plenty of rules were still being broken. Students
lingered at the pencil sharpener and fooled around as Moffett took
attendance. Some straggled in as late as 8:40. As Moffett, still
smiling, went over the months of the year, Daysha, a restless,
bright-eyed girl, raced to the front of the room and grabbed the
chalk, ignoring Moffett's command to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   As the teacher dealt with the disruption, her aide, Ruth
Baptiste, asked Larry, the sullen boy, what month came after May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to guess?'' Baptiste asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' Larry replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' the aide persisted as horns honked incessantly outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's stupid,'' the boy grumbled, pounding his fist on
his desk.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid overcrowding in the cafeteria, first-graders at P.S. 92
go to lunch at 10:15. But on Day 4, Moffett held the girls back
because they would not line up quietly. After three attempts, they
still did not have it right.
</P>
<P>
   Her smile was growing tight.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When Donna Moffett graduated from Christopher Columbus High
School in the Bronx in 1972, her yearbook predicted she would
become a teacher. But family turmoil prompted her to drop out of
Lehman College during her sophomore year and leave home. She moved
to Boston, working as a secretary at Harvard, and then to Chicago,
where she helped run a feminist bookstore and worked for a lawyer
who had written domestic violence legislation for Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Moffett did not return to New York until 1989. Still lacking a
college degree, she joined Flemming, Zulack &AMP; Williamson, a
corporate law firm near Wall Street, where she was a legal
secretary for a senior partner. She attended night classes at
Baruch College, and in 1998 she received a bachelor's degree in
literature.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although she liked her job, Moffett said, she increasingly felt
as if she was not ``the kind of person I wanted to be,
character-wise.'' Her literature classes made her think a lot about
teaching, and last fall she took a graduate education course at
Hunter College. When a friend told her about the teaching fellows
program in July, she immediately sent for an application.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just seemed so much about it that seemed custom-tailored
for me and my circumstances,'' she said. ``I basically thought if I
didn't make a move and make a sacrifice, then I would have to
question my own authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   Moffet will earn just under $37,000 this year, compared with her
previous salary of $60,000. That not only means fewer dinners out,
shopping trips and Broadway plays, but in all likelihood exchanging
her apartment in Chelsea for more modest quarters in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking to my students about rewards and
consequences, and the same is true for me,'' Moffett said after
receiving her first paycheck last week: $686 after taxes for two
weeks of work. ``One consequence for me is living with a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many first-year teachers in New York City, Moffett and
the other teaching fellows are not going it alone. She cannot stop
praising the support she is receiving from colleagues, including a
teacher with 15 years of experience who is Moffett's official
mentor. Some co-workers invite her to observe their classes, while
others share lesson plans and tips on discipline.
</P>
<P>
   By the second week of school, Moffett's techniques had evolved.
She spoke more loudly and succinctly. When necessary she scowled.
At lunch time, she did not insist on complete silence as the
students lined up. Her strategy the previous week _ holding the
students back when just one misbehaved _ was ``a big mistake,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to establish routines and reward good
behavior,'' she said. ``But I'm not allowed to keep these children
from their lunch. Everything here is on a schedule, and you have to
abide by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moffett rises by 5 a.m. these days and often works on lesson
plans past midnight. Instead of staying at work as late as she
wants, she is kicked out of P.S. 92 by 5 p.m. for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Her students especially love the ``library,'' a corner of the
room where they sit on rubber place mats that Moffett brought in
and listen to a story before lunch. On Day 4, it was ``Jamberry''
by Bruce Degen, about a bear in search of berries.

   Afterward, a quiet girl named Paula read the book to herself,
pronouncing each word perfectly. Moffett has not yet determined how
many others can read, but she clearly has a long way to go toward
her goal of every student reading by June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how a teacher, no matter how committed, strong,
bright, creative, can do this alone,'' she said in a late-night
phone conversation. ``I feel as though I should not sleep.''

BELANGER'S STATUS UP IN THE AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Eric Belanger could be the Los Angeles
Kings' No. 1 center opening night in Washington D.C. or he could be
playing for the Minnesota Wild.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of holdout Jozef Stumpel continues to plague the
club's ability to plan for the regular season. Belanger, who scored
15 goals and 40 points last season for minor-league Lowell, Mass.,
is listed with Brad Chartrand on the Kings depth chart as the
first-line center.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger also is on a list of 10 players the Kings have made
eligible for Friday's waiver draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking a calculated risk leaving Eric off the protected
list,'' said Kings GM Dave Taylor. ``We can lose only one player
and we don't think he will be the one.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger and Chartrand are not familiar names, but the club said
it is not ready to trade for a front-line center. Stumpel is
seeking a three-year, $9 million contract. The Kings are offering
$1.8 million less. He is playing in his native Slovakia, but if an
agreement is not reached by Oct. 5, Stumpel will be lost for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were able to protect 18 skaters and two goaltenders
for Friday's waiver draft, which also adds to confusion in goal.
</P>
<P>
   With injured Stephane Fiset (sprained left knee) not expected to
be ready for the Oct. 6 season opener, offseason acquisition Steve
Passmore will back up Jamie Storr. But Passmore, who played for
Chicago last season, also is on the waiver list and there is a good
chance he could be claimed.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Marcel Cousineau, who appeared in five games for
the Kings last season, would back up Storr until Fiset returns.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray is set on the second line of Bryan
Smolinski at center, Glen Murray at right wing and Luc Robitaille
at left wing. Although he wasn't pleased with the effort of the
second unit during exhibition games against San Jose and Phoenix,
Murray wants to keep them together.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he did the same, leaving Smolinski on the second
unit when Stumpel was injured and using journeyman Len Barrie
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year when our first line went down, they really carried
the offense for us,'' Murray said. ``But I've told them they just
can't turn it on and off and expect to be there. I think it's best
to juggle the lines as little as possible. There is a need to
maintain some continuity, but they need to pick it up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, however, concedes that Robitaille, who led the team last
year with 36 goals and 74 points, could be moved back to the first
line if newcomer Tomas Vlasak falters.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: An MRI on the right index finger of Ziggy
Palffy revealed a small fracture at the tip. Palffy, who was struck
by a stick Saturday in Bakersfield, will not play Friday in San
Jose or Saturday in Las Vegas but is expected to be ready by the
start of the regular season. Fiset reported improvement in his left
knee, which he sprained Friday. Fiset is riding an exercise bike
and said he can walk without pain but has trouble climbing stairs
and could be a week from on-ice workouts.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick whistles: The Kings are not expected to claim anyone
off the unprotected list. But just in case, they must be prepared
to drop a player from their protected list. Defenseman Peter Hogan,
who played 23 games for Lowell last season, would be that player.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WAIVERING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kings players eligible for Friday's NHL waiver draft. Teams can
protect 18 skaters and two goaltenders from a list of players with
more than 160 games of NHL experience. Players with less than three
years professional experience are exempt from the draft.

   DOCOMO-AOL PARTNERSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Japan's leading cellular phone company, NTT DoCoMo, and America
Online announced a widely expected strategic partnership Wednesday
that they said would propel the two companies into the forefront of
global wireless Internet services. DoCoMo will take a 42.3 percent
stake in AOL Japan and will feature AOL mail and Instant Messenger
on DoCoMo's i-mode service, the largest wireless Internet service
in the world, with more than 12 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership will catapult AOL Japan, a laggard among
Japanese fixed-line Internet access providers, into a leading
position in the Japanese market and give AOL's content to wireless
users with a DoCoMo phone. Kiyoyuki Tsujimura, managing director of
global business development at DoCoMo, said the partners would
collaborate on new ways to integrate wireless and fixed-line
Internet services, so that, for example, a bidder in an online
auction could participate via mobile phone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WIRELESS FINANCIAL SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   Extending its Internet information service to wireless
distribution in Japan and Europe, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said
Wednesday that it planned to give its institutional customers
access to research, stock recommendations and financial news over
mobile telephones. Called Radar, the service is expected to become
more sophisticated and widereaching over time, so that a customer
might, for instance, be able to order a phone that would be able
communicate sudden movements in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL GAS INFLATION COULD HURT MEXICO
</P>
<P>
   A leading Mexican industrial group warned Wednesday that at
least 500 Mexican glass, steel and ceramic plants might be forced
to lay off 250,000 workers this winter because of rising natural
gas prices. The trade group, known as Canacintra, blamed the
state-run oil monopoly, Pemex, for raising natural gas prices in
the absence of competition. Pemex, which is expected to earn a
windfall from Mexican oil and gas production this year, said
increased demand had forced it to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL AIRLINE GOES FOR CARGO
</P>
<P>
   Varig, Brazil's leading airline, said Wednesday that it would
spend $100 million to spin off and expand its cargo unit into a
logistics company that will include distribution, delivery,
packaging and storage services. The new company, to be called Varig
Logistica, or Varilog for short, is expected to account for 30
percent of Varig's revenue, or about $500 million this year. The
company is expected to compete with FedEx and DHL, which have
stepped up investments in Latin America in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   RANK GROUP SELLING UNIT
</P>
<P>
   The British conglomerate the Rank Group said Wednesday that it
would sell its holidays division, which includes hotels and camping
parks, to the Bourne Leisure Group for as much as 700 million
pounds, or about $980 million. Privately held Bourne Leisure, which
runs parks throughout Britain, said it would pay 650 million pounds
upfront and an additional 50 million pounds in two years if Rank's
Butlin's resorts unit meets profit targets. Rank's shares rose 5.9
percent, to 161 pence, or about $2.24. Rank has been divesting
businesses, like Odeon cinema and a stake in Universal Studios
Escape, to pay down debt.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE SPANISH UTILITY MERGER
</P>
<P>
   Endesa, the leading Spanish power company is in talks about a
possible merger with the country's second-largest electricity
producer, Iberdrola, which would create one of the biggest
utilities in Europe and be among the top 10 in the world. Spanish
government regulators are expected to examine the details closely
to ensure it does not violate competition rules. Earlier this year,
the government blocked a merger of the power companies Unin Fenosa
and Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico over antitrust concerns. Endesa
and Iberdrola control more than 80 percent of the electrical power
market and have a combined value of more than $31 billion.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPEANS DELIBERATE ON DEALS
</P>
<P>
   European antitrust regulators met in Brussels Wednesday to
decide whether concessions submitted by Time Warner and its
proposed partners, America Online and the EMI Music Group, were
sufficient to allay European concerns that the planned deals would
choke competition in the Internet distribution of music. The
regulators, from the national antitrust agencies of the 15 European
Union members states, were expected to issue a recommendation
whether to accept or reject the concessions, or possibly to seek
further clarification from the companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WEAK RESULTS AT BANK OF SCOTLAND
</P>
<P>
   Restructuring costs and provisions for bad debt contributed to
weaker-than-expected first-half earnings at the Bank of Scotland,
which recently lost to the Royal Bank of Scotland in a bidding war
for National Westminster Bank. Bank of Scotland shares fell 4.9
percent Wednesday, to 580 pence, or about $8.12, after the bank
said it had earned 469 million pounds, or about $657 million, in
the first half of the year, compared with 471 million pounds a year
earlier. The bank is facing pressure on its profit margins as
competition grows, and it has been the rumored target of takeover
speculation recently.

U.S. ADJUSTS INFLATION RATE UPWARD FOR A SMALL ERROR
</HEADLINE>
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government said Wednesday that inflation rose a bit faster
in the first eight months of this year than it had previously
reported, a mistake whose correction means slightly higher payments
for recipients of Social Security and other federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And while economists said that the error, one-tenth of a
percentage point, was not large enough to significantly alter their
view of the nation's economic performance, it was nonetheless in
the direction of faster inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's acknowledgment by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
said that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.7 percent through August
of this year instead of the 2.6 percent it initially reported.
</P>
<P>
   It attributed the understatement to a recently discovered error
in software used to calculate the index's residential rent
component and a gauge for home ownership. Because these items
account for just over one-quarter of the index, this implies they
were understated by about four-tenths of a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the corrections were large enough to require
re-publication, the general pattern of consumer price behavior this
year was little affected,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   But the bond market stumbled on the news, and economists did not
completely dismiss the error.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not dramatic, but this is an important component of the
CPI,'' a trend-setting one that fluctuates little from month to
month, said Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman, Sachs. ``It
reinforces the pattern of gradually accelerating core inflation
that we've seen and makes it even less likely the Federal Reserve
will be cutting rates anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
called the mistake too tiny to affect perceptions of inflation or
economic growth but said it was ``sort of amazing they could make a
mistake like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The errors were understood to involve double counting of
improvements in the quality of shelter, a process commonly used to
adjust the figures so that, say, a new generation of more costly
but better standard furnaces does not necessarily raise the
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which declined to elaborate on
its statement Wednesday, is expected to conduct a briefing on the
revision at 9:30 Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Social Security Administration said that a
rise of one-tenth point in the CPI for a full year would raise its
outlays by about $400 million, or an average payment increase of 74
cents a month for each of its 45.2 million elderly and disabled
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Many private contracts are also linked to the CPI as is the type
of government bond intended to be inflation-proof. The Treasury did
not respond to an inquiry about how inflation-indexed bonds would
be handled but the guess on Wall Street was that their value at
maturity would simply be increased accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Swonk, immediate past president of the National
Association for Business Economics, seized on the mistake to
complain of what she called chronic, severe underfinancing of
federal statistical agencies. ``Data appears to be the least
interesting and least provocative four-letter word in the English
language,'' she said.

CRIKEY, BUT OUR MARION IS FAIR DINKUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ They write a little differently about their
sports stars here. How to speak Australian about Marion Jones:
</P>
<P>
   Our girl competed Wednesday as she always does, with a minimum
of fuss and a maximum of grace and courage.
</P>
<P>
   Marion, the All-America girl every mother would love to call her
daughter and every father would like his son to marry, had every
reason to fall into the psychological abyss after the man she did
wed, shot putter C.J. Hunter, was exposed as a suspected drug
cheat.
</P>
<P>
   And yet one day after watching Hunter weep and whimper as he
professed his innocence, Thousand Oaks High's darling did not go
down like a lead balloon. She must have been spewing about this
embarrassing family development and yet she proved herself to be a
tall poppy.
</P>
<P>
   Facing more pressure than one could poke a stick at, Marion
produced her finest moment. Our Marion made us proud, running two
rounds of the 200 meters with a light heart and capturing our
admiration with a single leap in qualifying for the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, she made a clinic of the 200 meters, clocking a
22.75 while hardly breaking a sweat. The Olympic Stadium crowd
dipped its lid to her in response to the effortless manner in which
she left it entertained.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, our Marion showed why we love her like no other.
In an hour's time she rubbed out two days of people reacting to her
husband's doping charge by rubbishing her name.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the strength and steel of our 24-year-old
national treasure that she did not relinquish her girlhood dream of
winning five gold medals. She was not content to let her legacy
rest on her inspiring gold-medal effort last Saturday in the
100-meter dash.
</P>
<P>
   First, she showed no weakness in the quarterfinals of the 200
meters, clocking a 22.50 that was as brilliant as the sun poking
through the clouds after Tuesday night's nasty weather. Australian
Melinda Gainsford-Taylor's 22.49 effort in the same heat looked in
strife next to our Marion's rapt run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, that was the easiest 22.5 I've ever run,'' she said as
she floated through the mixed zone, flashing for a phalanx of
cameras the toothy smile that is uniquely hers. ``It was great. I
might have let up a little too much at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, our Marion was off to steady herself for her next
challenge. It was a daunting one. So often she gets the Greg Norman
staggers in the long jump. Our girl has the speed and spring; her
dodgey form is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Olympic Trials in July, she fouled on her first two
attempts and was one more red flag from carking it. This time she
raced down the runway, exploded into the air like fireworks and
landed 22 feet, 3 inches down the sand pit. To our Marion's glee,
she automatically advanced to Friday's final with the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Her long jump was a lovely end to a long and trying day.
</P>
<P>
   Our girl is so brave. Why, her heart must go close to filling
her entire chest cavity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come out this evening and pop the qualifying jump on the
first (try), I'm pleased with that,'' our girl said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, showing the sense of humor that makes us all bonkers,
Marion added that after she landed in the sand, ``I turned around
just expecting a red flag. But no worries at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion's mates back home have been a huge help to her the past
couple of days. They've been sending her e-mails telling her, ``We
believe in you 100 percent. Prove `em all wrong. Go out there and
win all your golds.''
</P>
<P>
   Our Marion seems born to the challenge of being a champion. All
the world's stage is her comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I love to be,'' she said. ``I love to be out
there in front of the fans, in front of the lights. It kind of gets
my mind off everything. There is so much going on right now, which
we'll all deal with once the Sydney Games are done. But this is
what I love to do. And it was a good day overall.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens the rest of the way, our Marion's first
Olympics is no failure.

AMERICA'S BUSIEST FAMILY HAILS FROM TEXAS
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good thing the Chanceys were sitting down when they got the
news.
</P>
<P>
   The Denton family of four had taken a breather Tuesday morning
on a sofa in a New York hotel when a cordless telephone rang _ the
signal that they had won the title of America's Busiest Family.
</P>
<P>
   Confetti flew. Callie Chancey, 9, jumped up and down. Stunned
mom Karen Chancey exulted about one prize: housecleaning for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a blast!'' said dad Keith Chancey, youth minister at
Denton Bible Church. ``Who would have thought it?''
</P>
<P>
   They bested more than 200 families, who had telephoned contest
sponsor Siemens Cordless to describe their hectic lives.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens flew the Chanceys and other finalists _ a Nebraska
family and an Arizona family _ to the New York Marriott Marquis in
Times Square, where a judge questioned them. Then they waited _
each family left with a cordless telephone _ for the winner's phone
to ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chanceys are amazing, not only because of their own
schedule, but because of college students living with them,'' said
judge Kathy Peel of Dallas, a family management expert. ``They have
people in their house all the time. But they've found a balance to
take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To go to New York, the family had to juggle school, sports,
theater, ballet and Keith's time with youths and families. During
the weeklong, expenses-paid trip, the Chanceys will sightsee,
including at what Cameron, 7, calls ``the Entire State Building.''
</P>
<P>
   The pampering will last a year. Other prizes are monthly in-home
meals by a chef and a cordless telephone system with four handsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith's afraid the housecleaning is going to spoil me,'' Karen
Chancey said. ``But I say, `Bring it on!' ''

margin outspending both special interest groups and the Bush and
Gore campaigns on television in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say this trend is transforming the parties
this year from supporting players into full partners in the
advertising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The basic strategic shift, say researchers who monitor
television spending in the presidential race, is a departure from
previous election cycles, when the candidates themselves ran the
majority of commercials and spent far more money than the parties.
And it means that this year, if the trend continues, the
advertising campaigns will have been financed to a much larger
degree by the unregulated soft money donated to the parties by
corporations and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The use of soft money has become an issue this year in many of
the highest profile political campaigns, including the New York
Senate race, where Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio have
tentatively agreed to a ban on soft money in campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Vice President Al Gore, in response to a call by
two senators for similar limits in the presidential race,
challenged Gov. George W. Bush to accept such a ban. Bush has said
he does not favor soft money restrictions, because he does not
trust the Democrats to abide by them.
</P>
<P>
   The latest indication that the national parties are the major
advertisers for Gore and Bush this year came in a study on
television spending on Wednesday by the Brennan Center for Justice
at New York University School of Law. The report showed that
between June 1 and Sept. 20, the two parties had spent more than
$52 million on commercials, while the Bush and Gore campaigns had
spent less than half that _ about $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   The study, produced jointly with Ken Goldstein, a political
science professor at the University of Wisconsin, found that the
trend was continuing to hold up this month, traditionally the time
when the candidates, flush with the proceeds from the federal funds
allotted them after the conventions, have taken over much of the
responsibility for running commercials
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, for example, Bob Dole's campaign ran 6,100 spots
and President Clinton's 3,600 spots the first full week after Labor
Day, the Brennan Center found. That same week, the Republican Party
ran just 147 commercials and the Democratic Party a mere one.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the parties have shown no sign of letting up
after Labor Day. Brennan Center researchers found that in the seven
days that ended Sept. 20, the two parties were still the biggest
spenders: The Republican Party spent nearly $2.3 million on
television during the week, or $300,000 more than the Bush
campaign. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, spent $1.8 million, or
about $800,000 more than the Gore campaign. Special interest groups
spent a total of about $1.1 million on both candidates across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's confirmed this week is that for the first time in
history, the political parties are dominating the ad wars in the
presidential campaign,'' said E. Joshua Rosenkranz, president of
the Brennan Center, a legal and research center that has developed
a specialty in campaign finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   The data also highlight the evolution over the years in the
roles of the Democratic and Republican national committees, which
once had little to do with the marketing of a nominee. ``Twenty
years ago, I don't know if the RNC and DNC were doing much more
than sponsoring brochures,'' said William Benoit, a professor of
communication at the University of Missouri who has studied 50
years of campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials on both sides maintain that the parties and
campaigns operate independently, others acknowledge privately that
the issue of which entity is spending the money has become
meaningless. Last month for example, the Republican National
Committee withdrew a commercial questioning Gore's veracity after
Bush objected to it, even though some of his advisers had wanted it
to run.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party disputed the Brennan Center's findings, but some
officials cautioned that the portrait of spending could change as
Election Day draws nearer, and the campaigns more aggressively
spend down the remainder of the $67 million in federal funds, or
hard money, each has been allocated for the fall campaign. The
Brennan Center study noted that the Bush campaign has spent $13
million on television since June 1, and the Gore campaign $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to have money in the bank at the end of this
campaign,'' a Republican official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a general acknowledgment on both sides that the
parties have become more active now in selling the candidates than
ever before, and have been elevated at the very least to a
partnership with the campaigns on advertising, the single costliest
aspect of a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The likely outcome in November, said another Republican campaign
official, is a kind of parity among the parties and campaigns, with
each of the four entities spending between $40 million and $50
million on advertising. That would still represent a heightened
participation this year by the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The competitiveness of the campaign may also be a factor in the
ratcheting up of party advertising. Joe Andrew, national chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, said the party initially had
no plans to continue running spots after the conventions, but the
strategy changed because the Republicans were advertising so
heavily at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose to run issue advertising after the convention and
we chose to defend our record and continue,'' he said.

 UNDATED: continue,'' he said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republicans say they expect no respite, either. ``What we're
seeing here is a sustained effort by both the party and the
campaign, and it's unlikely that it will let up until the last
ballot is cast,'' said Clifford D. May, the communications director
for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say that the parties' intensifying roles have
not only further blurred the distinctions between the candidates
and the parties, but also between the kinds of commercials that
each makes. Political parties are barred from running commercials
that engage in electioneering, an activity that has been defined by
the courts as employing such explicit terms as ``vote for'' or
``defeat.'' They are instead supposed to run only ``issue ads,''
commercials intended for such activities as party-building.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctions were all but erased in the last presidential
campaign, when President Clinton's advisers devised a way of
running spots for his re-election early without depleting the
campaign's own money. Featuring Clinton _ but not those magic
words, ``vote for'' _ the strategists were able to pay for the
commercials with Democratic Party funds. The Republicans eventually
copied the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the practice was challenged by Common Cause, a group
that advocates campaign finance reform, no action was taken. In
1998, the Federal Election Commission rejected the recommendation
of its own auditors and general counsel that the Clinton and Dole
campaigns be forced to repay $25 million for what they concluded
was the illegal coordination of their advertising with their
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell West, a Brown University political scientist who
analyzes campaign commercials, said enforcement is so lax that the
parties are now essentially engaging in ``direct candidate
advocacy'' with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that soft money was designed for party building
and get-out- the-vote efforts,'' he said. ``Now we've ended up in a
situation where much of the ad money is being funneled through the
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   To some who have been monitoring the process, the blurring of
the lines only makes stronger the arguments of those who contend
the next president will be beholden to special interests. ``The two
major party presidential candidates made a deal with the public,
and the deal is we will accept an enormous amount of federal money
in return for the promise not to raise private money for our
campaigns,'' said Rosenkranz of the Brennan Center. ``That deal has
broken down.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, the Democratic chairman, said that his hope had been
that the party ``would be a full partner in the campaign.'' But he
added, ``It's not a positive development that we're spending so
much money to do that.''

   The government said that a software error caused it to slightly
underestimate inflation during the first eight months of the year.
Revision of the data means somewhat higher payments for recipients

said that the error, 0.1 percent, was not large enough to
significantly alter their view of the nation's economy, it was
nonetheless in the direction of faster inflation.

MRS. CLINTON OFFERS DEBT-REDUCTION PLAN; LAZIO QUESTIONS ITS VALUE
</HEADLINE>
 By DEAN E. MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Supported by Robert Rubin, the former secretary of
the Treasury Department, and Warren Buffet, the billionaire
investor, Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged Wednesday to protect the
federal budget surplus from Republican ``tax schemes'' by proposing
legislation to limit tax cuts and new spending.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, laying out one of her most detailed plans for the
budget surplus since entering the New York Senate race, proposed
mandatory ``debt-reduction caps'' that would make it more difficult
for Congress to use expected budget surpluses for cutting taxes or
paying for new programs.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan, similar in general terms to the one proposed by Vice
President Al Gore, goes further than Gore's by setting aside more
money for debt reduction and imposing legislative hurdles for
making exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan, 20 percent of the budget surplus each year
over the next 10 years, apart from money for Social Security and
Medicare, would be reserved for reducing federal debt. That would
create a pool of about $360 billion, her campaign staff estimated.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress wanted to spend that money or use it to offset tax
cuts, it would have to do so by a vote of three-fifths of the
members of both houses, she said. In addition, the estimated $2.7
trillion surplus in the Social Security and Medicare accounts would
be set aside for debt reduction, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to her campaign staff's estimates, Clinton's proposal
would devote about $60 billion more over the 10 years for debt
reduction than would Gore's budget-surplus plan. Gore's plan also
does not require a three-fifths vote for breaking the spending and
tax cut limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put first things first and be conservative in how
we use this surplus and project our expenditures,'' Clinton said
during an economic forum at Columbia University, where Rubin and
Buffet offered their support for her plan. ``I would propose that
we set some limits on what we can do with the surplus and just keep
everybody on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans said the spending habits of Clinton and the
Democrats, not their party's proposed tax cuts, are the biggest
threat to the surplus. Rep. Rick Lazio, speaking in Newburgh after
touring a riverfront development project, suggested that Clinton's
policy proposals would leave little of the surplus left to apply
toward reducing the debt. He cited a report by the National
Taxpayers Union, a conservative group, that said her economic and
education plans would nearly wipe out the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it's fine rhetoric, but when you add up the numbers, it
doesn't add up,'' Lazio said. ``My economic plan would reserve
three-quarters of the surplus to protect Social Security and
Medicare, pay down the debt and also invest in some important
priorities, like education.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used her budget-surplus proposal as an opportunity once
again to criticize Lazio's tax plan, which she says would give back
too much of the projected $4.5 trillion surplus to taxpayers, and
which Rubin said would ``reject fiscal discipline.'' Speaking to an
audience of students organized by the university's College
Democrats club, Clinton said they must look beyond their immediate
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent the day in the Hudson Valley, touring businesses and
the Newburgh waterfront and speaking at a business breakfast in
Rockland County. The visits were intended to highlight the
potential for his plan for improving the economy through an
increase in partnerships between the federal government and the
private sector, and through lower taxes that Lazio says will
stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing here is we're demonstrating that there is one
candidate in this race who has got the capacity to build the kind
of partnerships that will be necessary to improve the quality of
life for New York,'' Lazio said.

JUDGE RULES FOR PUBLIC ACCESS TO FIRESTONE DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD with KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ A federal district court judge here ruled
Wednesday that the public should have access to extensive
information on tire technology that Firestone was compelled to turn
over during a lawsuit over a fatal accident. The company claimed
that releasing the documents would amount to giving up trade
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial secrecy has emerged as a major issue in Washington as
Congress tries to craft new laws improving the ability of
government regulators to monitor safety trends. Officials at the
Department of Transportation say the sealing of documents in
settled lawsuits is one reason they did not spot the pattern of
scores of rollover deaths in Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone
tires that failed.
</P>
<P>
   In a biting ruling in favor of four news organizations that had
sued for release of the documents, Judge Anthony A. Alaimo
dismissed Firestone's assertion that the information would be
valuable to its competitors. ``A competitor would not want to
replicate the designs or processes used to make a tire that has now
been recalled in countries around the world,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge delayed release of the documents for a week to
give Firestone time to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Karbowiak, a spokeswoman for Firestone, said in a
telephone interview that even if the information was about tires
being recalled, it could be valuable to competitors. ``It's
traditional know-how that in many, many manufacturing contexts is
know-how that should be protected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before House and Senate committees this month, two
vice presidents of Firestone, a unit of the Bridgestone Corp. of
Japan, promised to drop secrecy provisions in lawsuits except as
they concerned trade secrets. One proposal before Congress would
make manufacturers tell the government if they had been sued three
times over defects in the same product.
</P>
<P>
   The documents in the Georgia case, involving a 19-year-old's
death in an Explorer, are being sought by lawyers for The Los
Angeles Times, CBS News, The Chicago Tribune and The Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, documents released Wednesday by congressional
investigators show that in the year before the Ford Motor Co.
stopped buying tires from Goodyear for Explorers, the automaker
pressed Goodyear to cut its prices to match those charged by its
rival Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodyear tires, which were used on half of Ford's 1996 and
1997 Explorers, have subsequently proved much more reliable, a
distinction that has drawn the interest of Congress as it seeks
explanations for the scores of deadly accidents involving Explorers
equipped with Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vaughn, a Ford spokesman, said that Ford routinely
negotiates with all its suppliers for the best available prices.
But Ford, he noted, also demands that suppliers meet extensive
technical specifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firestone was selected, as a single source in this case,
because it met our requirements between cost, quality and
production capability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Firestone had made any quality-related production
decisions in order to bid lower than Goodyear, Karbowiak, the
Firestone spokeswoman, responded in a statement that ``we would
never take any steps that would impair the safety of those tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal crash records show that through the end of last year,
there were only three tire-related deaths in 1996 and 1997 Ford
Explorers equipped at the factory with Goodyear tires, compared
with 26 such deaths involving Explorers from those two model years
equipped with Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone supplied all of the tires for new Explorers for the
1991 through 1995 model years, split the contract with Goodyear in
the 1996 and 1997 model years, and resumed supplying tires for all
new Explorers in the 1998 through 2001 model years.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana
Republican who is leading the House investigation of 101 deaths
attributed to Firestone tires, said Wednesday night that ``Ford has
never satisfactorily explained to us why they dropped Goodyear as a
supplier of tires for its Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman for Goodyear, said that the tire
maker had lost the Explorer contract because it had been unwilling
to sell tires for as low a price as Ford was ready to pay.
</P>
<P>
   One of the documents released Wednesday by Tauzin was a letter
from Ford to Goodyear dated Jan. 26, 1996, turning down a request
for higher prices. Ford told Goodyear that it was already charging
more than its competitors for eight tire models, including the
tires for the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford memorandum dated April 4, 1996, also released by Tauzin,
said that Ford had ``challenged Goodyear to become price
competitive'' on five tire models, although it was not clear if
these included the Explorer tires. The document said that Goodyear
had responded by proposing changes in tire construction of the
tires that would save $500,000 to $700,000 that year.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to Firestone, the tire maker said Wednesday that
Saudi Arabia had banned the import of all Firestone brand tires.
The failure of 16-inch Firestone tires on Ford Explorers there has
been linked to several deaths over the last three years, and was
one of the first warnings of tire problems on Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone criticized Saudi regulators for the decision. ``We
feel the scope of this action is uncalled for and extreme given the
voluntary worldwide recall'' of 15-inch tires for Explorers, the
tire maker said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford began replacing 16-inch Firestone tires on Explorers in
Saudi Arabia at its own expense, after Firestone refused to do so;
the tire maker contended that part of the problem was that
Explorers were too prone to roll over. A Ford memo obtained by
congressional investigators said Firestone was leery of recalling
the tires partly for fear that it would be banned from the Saudi
market.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: ANOTHER LOOK AT GORE THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Gore-Lieberman campaign began broadcasting a new commercial,
titled ``Veteran,'' this week that highlights stands on several
issues, including tax cuts, welfare, child support and Internet
pornography, that are the kinds Republicans have used in the past
against Democrats. It is being broadcast in 17 swing states,
although the Gore campaign would not identify them.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: The Campaign Company
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The 30-second commercial begins with a black and
white picture of a young Al Gore in Vietnam and then switches to
color footage of Gore with his family and with his wife, Tipper,
and campaigning. It then moves to color footage of workers and
families.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``Vietnam veteran. Father of four. Married 30 years.
Al Gore will fight for families. Tax cuts for middle-class families
including a $10,000-a-year tax deduction for college tuition.
Continue welfare reform with time limits, work requirements. Force
deadbeat parents to take responsibility for their children. A crime
victims' bill of rights to protect victims, not just criminals.
Fight violence and pornography on the Internet, helping parents
block out what children shouldn't see. Al Gore. He'll put his
values to work for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Gore does have proposals in the areas he mentions, and
President Clinton did sign an overhaul of the welfare system into
law in 1996, establishing time limits. Republicans argue that in
several cases their proposals are tougher or more rigorous than
Gore's. What Gore does not say is that his $500 billion tax relief
plan would not help all middle-class families. It is intended to
give tax relief for certain social goals; to benefit, a family must
meet certain criteria, like having a parent in long-term care or a
child in college or a child in day care.
</P>
<P>
   SCORE CARD: Although this Gore advertisement is ostensibly about
individual issues, its real purpose is signaled in its tag line,
``He'll put his values to work for us.'' Republicans are
traditionally viewed as more mainstream on cultural and social
values than Democrats, and that perception was only strengthened by
the president's affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever mentioning Clinton, Gore distances himself from him
somewhat in this commercial. He mentions his service in Vietnam.
(Neither Clinton nor Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee,
served in Vietnam.) And by boasting of his 30-year marriage, Gore

   The issues the advertisement covers _ tax cutting, welfare,
child support, crime and fighting pornography _ are ones the
Republicans had been capitalizing on for years until Clinton began
to move his party to the center and stole some of their thunder.
This shows Gore also setting down markers to fight off accusations
that he is a big spender or that he is soft on crime or welfare.

 McSORLEY SAYS HE WANTED TO FIGHT, NOT INJURE  
 By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Offering more reasons than
remorse, Marty McSorley testified Wednesday that his stick-swinging
against Donald Brashear in a game last year was little more than an
unfortunate accident between National Hockey League enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the questioning of his lawyer, Bill Smart, McSorley spent
the entire third day of his trial on the witness stand and attacked
the assault charge. At issue is whether violence in a hockey game
can constitute criminal assault, but McSorley labeled such a
confrontation as common when emotions on the ice run high.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley testified that he did not mean to smash Brashear's head
with the blade of his stick in a game last Feb. 21 and that a
combination of bad aim and bad luck, including the path Brashear
took, contributed to the seriousness of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley admitted wanting to provoke a second fight late in the
game _ McSorley, then a defenseman with the Boston Bruins, and
Brashear, playing for the Vancouver Canucks, had fought in the
first period _ and send a larger message to the Canucks that the
Bruins were playing until the final horn of a 5-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had told him, `Donald, you're going to have to fight me
again,''' McSorley testified. ``He said: `We're up 4-0. I don't
have to fight you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brashear, 28, a wing who was in his seventh season in the NHL,
hit the back of his head on the ice after McSorley hit him, got a
concussion, lost consciousness briefly while on the ice and
suffered lapses in memory. He returned to play several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley received the biggest fine and suspension in NHL
history, $72,000 and the final 23 games of last season. McSorley,
now a free agent, must meet with Commissioner Gary Bettman if he is
to play again.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments are scheduled for Thursday before Judge
William Kitchen of Provincial Court, who is expected to render his
decision on Friday. If convicted, McSorley could be sentenced to up
to 18 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Smart argued Wednesday that injuries to McSorley's left shoulder
and wrist affected control of his stick and caused him to miss his
target, which McSorley described as shoulder level, just above the
number on Brashear's right sleeve. McSorley, 37, has since had
surgery on his shoulder and said doctors recommended that his wrist
needs fusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I think I was going to miss?'' he said. ``No, it never
entered my mind. I've never missed like that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hicks, the regional prosecutor for Vancouver, hammered on
McSorley's talent and work ethic, which have produced a 17-year
career in the NHL. Hicks also contended that as a veteran player,
McSorley should have easily adjusted to Brashear's change in
position on the ice, and noted that Brashear said he did not want
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley responded that his action was an instinctive move to
lure Brashear into another fight, then engaged in a heated exchange
with Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McSorley, are you responsible for your stick on the ice?''
Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do the best you can,'' McSorley said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks repeated the question in a firmer voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hicks, do you know how many guys get cut over the course
of the season?'' McSorley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McSorley,'' Hicks said, ``how many players get hit with a
stick across their head and get knocked unconscious during a
season?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been instances, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hicks accused McSorley of deliberately attacking Brashear
in anger, McSorley said, ``Mr. Hicks, that is absolutely not true
and there has been no indication of that in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley and Smart explained that McSorley's hands never came
together on his stick, a distinction to show he did not maliciously
grip the stick to use it as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley testified that he intended to hit Brashear with the
shaft, a foot or so above the blade, in the manner of a
cross-check, and thought that was what he had done. The slow-motion
videotape, though, clearly showed McSorley striking Brashear with
the heel of the blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see, as Donald comes across me, the harder he cuts, the
more he bends his knees and the more he tilts his shoulder,''
McSorley said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky, who is not expected to be called as a witness,
created a buzz outside the courtroom when he arrived at McSorley's
trial. At one point, deputies taped white paper over the small
courtroom window to keep a growing crowd from trying to catch a
glimpse of Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to support my friend,'' said Gretzky, who played with
McSorley on the Edmonton Oilers' championship teams of the 1980s.

ADVERTISING: INTERPUBLIC NAMES COORDINATOR OF ITS DIVERSE UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A seasoned executive with experience in the account,
creative and strategic realms of agency operations is being named
to a new top post at Interpublic Group of Cos. in New York. The
executive, Bruce S. Nelson, will coordinate efforts to manage the
increasingly diversified Interpublic units specializing in
interactive and direct marketing, public relations, media services,
research, programming and consulting as well as traditional
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Nelson, as executive vice president and chief
marketing officer at Interpublic, is indicative of the growing
importance of nonadvertising holdings to the Madison Avenue giants.
About half of Interpublic's revenue for 2000 will be derived from
fields outside the creation of television commercials and print
advertisements, compared with about a third two years ago and less
than a quarter four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, just last week, Interpublic realigned its public
relations agencies to form a shop, Weber Shandwick Worldwide, that
will become the world's largest in revenue, at an estimated $320
million, overtaking the Burson-Marsteller unit of Young &AMP; Rubicam
Inc., which is being acquired by the WPP Group. Recent Interpublic
acquisitions in nonadvertising fields include Adair-Greene, a
health care communications agency; Brands Hatch, a sports marketing
company; Capita Technologies, an e-business company; Cassidy Co., a
public relations agency; NFO Worldwide, a research company; and
Waylon Co., a sales promotion agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our industry has migrated from advertising solutions to
integrated marketing solutions,'' said John J. Dooner Jr.,
president and chief operating officer at Interpublic. ``All the
different marketing disciplines need to be rationalized so the
impact clients are looking for will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Bruce's responsibilities will be to take a look at our
portfolio of brands to be sure they are positioned properly,'' he
added, ``examining how can and should they be put together.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 48, will report to Dooner, who is to become chief
executive at Interpublic on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a sense the top guy's behind this,'' Nelson
said, because his new job calls for him to roam across the
Interpublic organizational chart, seeking ways to encourage the
disparate units to cooperate with each other if so required by
clients.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on nonadvertising operations ``represents a different
business model that we think will be huge,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic will rank No. 2 among agency companies in billings,
at $47.1 billion, and No. 3 in revenue, at $5.1 billion, after WPP
completes its pending acquisition of Y&AMP;R. The principal Interpublic
divisions are Draft Worldwide, Initiative Media Worldwide, Lowe
Group and McCann-Erickson World Group.
</P>
<P>
   In joining Interpublic, Nelson is returning to advertising after
taking a year off to spend more time with his family, he said.
Nelson left Y&AMP;R in September 1999 after 18 months there as vice
chairman and chief knowledge officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he saw the light not to do that for very long,''
Dooner said, laughing, referring to Nelson's stint at the rival
agency company.
</P>
<P>
   During his time off Madison Avenue, Nelson said, he became
involved with the dot-com world, becoming a director of three
companies: Official Payments Corp., Pcsupport.com and Zeborg Inc.
He will continue on those boards after joining Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   Dooner said he knew Nelson from the time they both spent at
McCann-Erickson. Dooner worked there from 1984 until he left for
Interpublic in April, and Nelson worked there from 1979 until he
left for Y&AMP;R in 1998, holding posts that included group creative
director; co-leader of an agency within the agency named Ira
Madris, Bruce Nelson &AMP; Colleagues; director for worldwide accounts;
and worldwide director for strategic creative development.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson recalled that Dooner called him ``during the summer and
said: `It's a brand-new company, and we're looking forward to where
we're going to go. And with half our interests outside advertising,
they're of a size now that we need someone to look at our
portfolio.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people know me'' at Interpublic, Nelson added, ``and
know I have sat in their seat or in the seat next to theirs, so
this is not a theoretical sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   While at McCann-Erickson, Nelson worked for and with marketers
like American Express, Coca-Cola and Nestle.
</P>
<P>
   Dooner said that in his new post, Nelson would ``also be
available for some clients that need marketing strategy help _ and
he's already getting calls.''  &QL;

GLOBAL CROSSING'S WEB HOST MAY BE SOLD TO RIVAL EXODUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.)  By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that would advance its lead in the business of storage
and maintenance facilities for company's Web sites, Exodus
Communications is close to acquiring the Web host division of
Global Crossing for about $6.5 billion in stock, people close to
the companies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' boards planned to meet to discuss the complex
transaction, which would potentially make Global Crossing, the
operator of a global fiber optic communications network, the
largest shareholder in Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   Although most points of the transaction have been agreed upon by
the two companies' management, it is not yet clear whether a
definitive agreement will be reached. Talks on a similar deal
collapsed in July.
</P>
<P>
   Within the cutthroat Web host business, the potential
transaction signals further consolidation. Similar to other parts
of the telecommunications industry, it is increasingly a business
of size and scale in which smaller companies are priced out of
contracts by large competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Size is everything because a larger Web-hosting company can
offer a larger array of services at lower cost,'' said Fred Moran,
an analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``Exodus is at the head of the pack,
but it must have been feeling the heat lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Exodus and Global Crossing may have felt pressure to pursue a
deal after WorldCom acquired Intermedia Communications for about $6
billion in stock and debt earlier this month, giving WorldCom
control of Digex Inc., another large manager of Web sites.
Intermedia rejected offers from Exodus and Global Crossing before
accepting WorldCom's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the transaction being discussed by Exodus and Global
Crossing, Exodus would issue new shares valued at approximately
$6.5 billion to pay for Global Center, Global Crossing's Web site
host unit. Effectively, this would give Global Crossing a 20
percent stake in Exodus, making it the company's largest
shareholder, people close to the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in a part of the transaction potentially worth
billions of dollars, Exodus would designate Global Crossing as its
primary network carrier for 10 years, committing to buy at least
half of its network needs from the company, which is based in
Hamilton, Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   And in Asia, Exodus and Global Crossing would form a separate
venture with Asia Global Crossing, a company controlled by Global
Crossing with partners including Microsoft and Softbank of Japan.
Exodus would control two-thirds and Global Crossing one-third of
the venture, people close to the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   For Global Crossing, the deal would help save about $1 billion
needed to build out its own network of data centers where clients
store their Internet servers in vaults. The relatively dim
prospects in the short term for a public offering of shares in its
Global Center unit may also have contributed to its eagerness for a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   For Exodus, of Santa Clara, Calif., the transaction would allow
the company to have guaranteed access to Global Crossing's network
instead of seeking out capacity on the networks of other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Exodus has more than 2.3 million square feet of Web host space
at more than 20 centers across the country, where clients like
Yahoo and eBay store their servers on racks in vaults.

AT STREISAND'S ALMA MATER, FUNNY GIRL IS AN UNKNOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They couldn't quite place the name. There was
something slightly familiar about the photo. As for naming their
favorite Barbra Streisand song, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say, the students at Erasmus Hall High School, the
alma mater of the famous Brooklyn girl who made good, were not
among those clamoring to fork over up to $2,500 to see the first of
her New York shows at Madison Square Garden, which has been billed
as Streisand's last round of concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Though Streisand's portrait (with permed hair, circa ``Yentl''),
is part of a hallway mural celebrating the school's bicentennial in
1987, Jennifer Lino, 15, and Karla Moncayo, 14, froze behind their
hot fudge sundaes when asked if they knew who she was, and looked
awfully like they were trying to avoid being called on in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who? Who's that?'' asked Stacey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline William knew. ``Barbra Streisand, that lady, with the
funny nose,'' she told her fellow freshmen. ``She sings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who y'all talking about,'' Crystal Ulett said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline tried again. ``She's white. With the gold hair.'' She
did not mention the 26 platinum albums, two Oscars or eight Grammy
awards.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph was produced. ``You know her face from somewhere,
right?'' Jacqueline said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Garden Wednesday night, one woman told a television
reporter that her hands were shaking from excitement. She offered
to sing ``Papa'' for the evening news, but broke off nervously,
suddenly forgetting the words.
</P>
<P>
   Two couples, the Turners and the Margetts, paid $475 for each
ticket and flew in from Derbyshire, England, for the concert. They
almost hired a limousine to take them, said Marlaine Margetts,
until they realized that their room, at the Hotel Pennsylvania, was
right across the street from the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Robin and Victor Nekrasovas and Gloria and Steve Salmanowitz
came from Monroe, N.J. The ladies did not care that their $225
tickets weren't so good. ``We're sitting in Queens, actually,''
said Nekrasovas. `` `Evergreen' is my wedding song.''
</P>
<P>
   But the men were less enthusiastic. ``If somebody comes up and
offers me $1,000,'' said Salmanowitz, ``they can have my ticket.
I'm going to Nathan's.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gubernot, 51, had surprised Evan Myron, 41, with tickets for
their 20th anniversary. Myron knew what to expect, down to the set
list. ``I'm a Barbra person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone said they loved Barbra. For some people, tickets were a
dream come true. But Peter A. Ciarlo of Middlebury, Conn., said he
was just making his wife, Debbie, happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband loves the way she sings but he doesn't love her
politics,'' Ciarlo said of the singer, who is known to support many
liberal causes.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Flatbush, William had an idea how to help Streisand
raise her profile. Streisand, she said, should come back to her old
high school. ``Mariah Carey found time to go back to her old
school,'' Jacqueline said. (Streisand did give Erasmus $25,000 in
1994, one of the principals, Carolyn Wagner, said later.)
</P>
<P>
   But if Streisand did pay a visit to Erasmus, would anyone
recognize her?
</P>
<P>
   Karim Smith, 15, thought he knew who she was. ``She was in that
one with the three witches? The thing on the Disney Channel?''
</P>
<P>
   Um. Maybe he meant Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Garcia, 18, knew precisely. ``That lady with the big
nose? She got married and the wedding was private, and nobody could
go to it?''
</P>
<P>
   Guests at the concert Wednesday night included Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, Christie Brinkley, the model, and Rosie
O'Donnell, the talk show host. Many of those who clutched tickets,
like Sue Booker of Walsall, England, whose husband had surprised
her with tickets last Sunday, had never seen the legend live
before.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand did not strike out everywhere in Brooklyn. ``I like
her, she's a nice girl,'' said Sydney Adams, 45, as he shaved
sugarcane with a knife on the corner of Church and Flatbush
Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a man selling CDs on a folding table said he had sold
out of Barbra albums just that morning. ``I only had three,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Williams, 23, pulled her gospel-blaring earphones out of
her ears to talk while she was on her way to her work at a day care
center. Yes, she nodded, she had a Streisand album. ``The one with
the Jewish song on it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Erasmus, the spirit of the singer lived on.
</P>
<P>
   Ebony Hogue, a sophomore in Erasmus' humanities and performing
arts program, refused to be daunted by her lack of familiarity with
the superstar. ``You know her?'' said the teen-ager, who wants to
be an actor. ``You could hook me up with her.''

   Nearby, a man selling CDs on a folding table said he had sold
out of Barbra albums just that morning. ``I only had three,'' he
said.

   Stacey Williams, 23, pulled her gospel-blaring earphones out of
her ears to talk while she was on her way to her work at a day care
center. Yes, she nodded, she had a Streisand album. ``The one with
the Jewish song on it,'' she said.

   Even at Erasmus, the spirit of the singer lived on.

<P>
   Ebony Hogue, a sophomore in Erasmus' humanities and performing
arts program, refused to be daunted by her lack of familiarity with
the superstar. ``You know her?'' said the teen-ager, who wants to
be an actor. ``You could hook me up with her.''

   A CHALLENGE MADE AND DISMISSED
</P>
<P>
   Washington state's candidates for the U.S. Senate have gotten
into a spat over the use of so-called soft money by outside groups
in their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic aspirant, former Rep. Maria Cantwell, wants all
independent groups that have been advertising on her behalf, as
well as the Democratic Party, to cease doing so. She also wants the
Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton, to issue such a pledge himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather lose without the benefit of soft money than win
with it,'' Cantwell said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton said the vow amounted to a ``phony pledge'' because
the great majority of the campaign spending by Cantwell, who made a
fortune estimated at $40 million as an Internet executive, has come
from her own bank account.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Cantwell's appeal, Gorton challenged her to make a
different pledge: to agree that at least 70 percent of her campaign
money would henceforth come from individual contributors other than
herself. Cantwell countered: ``Unlike Senator Gorton, I have only
one special interest _ the interest of the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   GENTLE RIBBING BY GORE
</P>
<P>
   Like many politicians, Vice President Al Gore has a long memory.
On a trip to Iowa on Wednesday, it stretched back to last winter
when Gore was campaigning against former Sen. Bill Bradley in that
state's caucuses. Iowa's Democratic governor, Thomas J. Vilsack,
remained studiously neutral at the time, while his wife, Christie,
enthusiastically backed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech at a community center in Altoona on Wednesday,
Gore acknowledged the presence of Vilsack, who now travels
regularly with the vice president on his visits to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to seeing Christie a little bit later,''
Gore said. ``Now, I'm glad to see you, Governor. But I've never let
him forget that Christie had just a little bit better political
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   During Gore's discussion on Medicare, 79-year-old Winifred
Skinner, a retiree from Des Moines, rose to tell Gore that she
collects aluminum cans several hours a day because her Social
Security and pension benefits will not pay for both her living
expenses and her prescription costs of $230 a month. ``How much do
you earn a week?'' Gore asked. ``You're not going to tell the
government, are you?'' Skinner answered, sending both Gore and the
audience into convulsions of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   BIG MONEY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   With Election Day now less than six weeks off, fund-raising is
more frenetic than ever. Just Wednesday night, Vice President Al
Gore raised more than $3.5 million for the Democratic National
Committee, bringing his total take for the party in the last 16
days to nearly $25 million and his total take since January to more
than $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attended two events, starting with a reception at a
downtown Washington hotel for the Women's Leadership Forum. More
than 800 people, paying $125 each, contributed about $500,000. He
then took his motorcade to a dinner at the Washington home of Sen.
Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., where about 300 people, paying a minimum
of $5,000 each, contributed more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   THE TRAVEL LOG
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore continued his swing through the Midwest, talking health
care in Iowa and questioning George W. Bush's commitment to
improving the system. Bush, meanwhile, continued to work the West
Coast, talking education in Los Angeles and questioning Gore's
commitment to improvement. At the end of the day, both headed for
home, Bush back to Austin and Gore back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The stats:
</P>

WEST NILE CLAIMS FIRST KNOWN U.S. VICTIM THIS YEAR IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey officials announced Wednesday that an 82-year-old man
died of the West Nile virus two weeks ago, the first person known
to die of the disease in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe it is most likely that the man was bitten in
August. He fell ill on Sept. 3, was admitted three days later to
Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, and died there on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis of West Nile was delayed while blood and tissue
studies were conducted. The man had chronic illnesses as well,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Gov. Christie Whitman and other state
officials did not name the man, but said he lived in Little Falls.
he was identified as Anthony Opalka by The Herald News of West
Paterson, The Associated Press reported Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there have been four cases of West Nile in New Jersey
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would call this an epidemic,'' Dr. Eddy A.
Bresnitz, the deputy state commissioner of health, said Wednesday
at the news conference in Hackensack. ``I think what we do have is
an outbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   A 72-year-old woman from Bayonne also contracted the disease in
the last few months, but she is already home recovering, officials
said. The other human cases previously confirmed in New Jersey
involved a 43-year-old man from Jersey City and a 54-year-old man
with homes in Cliffside Park and Brooklyn, N.Y. Both men were
hospitalized for treatment and are recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests were performed on 18 other people in the state whose
illnesses resembled West Nile, but the results are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, West Nile has been diagnosed this year in 13
people, including a 73-year-old woman from Queens who the city
announced Wednesday was hospitalized but recovering. Among the
other cases, eight were treated and released and four remain
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of birds and other animals have contracted the disease
this year, so many that many health care officials have been
surprised that more human cases did not emerge. Theories about why
that is range from crediting state prevention campaigns to musing
about the weather: Did cold air keep people inside? Did the wet
summer keep birds around so mosquitoes were drawn to them instead
of to humans?
</P>
<P>
   While state officials never like to have any cases in their
areas, the New York region has fared far better than Israel, where
14 people have died of West Nile this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, West Nile killed seven people in the New York region
and severely sickened 55 others.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said Wednesday that New Jersey would re-evaluate its
West Nile control plan, which has included spraying insecticide to
kill adult mosquitoes in every county.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is a disease that's going to be with us for
some time,'' Whitman said. ``And I intend after this season is over
to ask the relevant cabinet members, including the secretary of
commerce and economic growth, the secretary of agriculture, the
commissioner of health and senior services, to get together and to
reassess everything that we have done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Insecticides have been sprayed this year in all five New York
City boroughs and in Westchester and Rockland Counties, on Long
Island and in Connecticut and New Jersey, though not always to the
satisfaction of New York City officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani complained earlier this year that
northern New Jersey and Nassau County were endangering public
health by not spraying aggressively enough.

ADM. HORACIO RIVERO JR., 90, VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Puerto Rico, Calif.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adm. Horacio Rivero Jr., a former vice chief of naval operations
and ambassador to Spain, died Sept. 24 at his home in Coronado,
Calif. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Rivero was vice chief of naval operations from 1961 to 1968. A
fluent Spanish-speaker who was born in Puerto Rico, he was NATO's
commander in chief in southern Europe from 1968 to 1972, when he
retired from the Navy, and ambassador to Spain from 1972 to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He was promoted in 1964 from vice admiral, with three stars, to
admiral, with four stars, and is widely said to have been the U.S.
Navy's first four-star admiral of Hispanic descent. David G.
Farragut, whose father was an immigrant from Spain, was promoted to
admiral in 1866, when the rank of four-star admiral did not exist,
and is often cited as the Navy's first admiral of Hispanic
ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   While Rivero held the southern European command, he directed the
land, sea and air forces of five nations deployed in the
Mediterranean area: Italy, Greece, Turkey, Britain and the United
States. He declared in 1971 that any withdrawal of U.S. troops from
West Germany could be considered by the NATO allies as ``a first
step in a continuing process'' that might in time affect the
strength of the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. At the time,
some 215,000 of the 310,000 American troops in Europe were
stationed in West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1962 the Soviet Union decided secretly to set
up ballistic missiles in Cuba. On Oct. 15, 1962, Rivero was given
command of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet's amphibious force. On Oct. 22,
1962, in the Cuban missile crisis, President John F. Kennedy
publicly denounced the secret building of missile launching sites
on Cuba, which had been detected by U.S. reconnaissance flights.
Kennedy imposed a naval blockade on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Rivero was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and was appointed in 1927
to the U.S. Naval Academy, where he graduated in 1931 as one of the
highest-ranking students in his class, and also the shortest. It
has been said that the academy waived its minimum-height
requirement in his case. His family says he was about 5 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   At the academy, an officer had trouble reading the future
admiral's name on his uniform and asked gruffly, ``What's your
name? Rivets?'' And so young Horacio acquired the nickname Rivets.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to specialize in ordnance engineering and,
subsequently, in nuclear weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, he served in the Pacific as a gunnery officer
and won a Bronze Star. For part of the Korean War, he was the
commander of the amphibious transport Noble.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement he was on boards that advised the chief of naval
operations, the Naval Academy and the Naval War College.
</P>
<P>
   The other decorations he won included three Distinguished
Service Medals and the Legion of Merit. He also received medals
from the governments of Brazil, Ecuador, Greece, Italy, Spain and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   He married Hazel Hooper in 1941; she died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Mary Lynn Hogan of Bellevue,
Wash.; two grandchildren; two great-grandchildren, and two sisters,
Sara and Lydia, both of Puerto Rico.

RED CROSS PAUS BACK FROM INJURY AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cory Paus will get back on his bike Saturday night
and start riding again. One of these days, he's bound to make it
around the block. Isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   Paus is 6-foot-2, a solid 206 pounds and has the mindset of a
linebacker. Unfortunately, he's as frail as a kicker. He has
started eight games in his brief career and finished just four.
</P>
<P>
   Paus returns to the starting lineup again Saturday night against
Arizona State at the Rose Bowl, four weeks after his latest injury
_ a separated right throwing shoulder he suffered on the first play
of the first game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If Paus has the luck of Wile E. Coyote, at least he has the
resiliency to match.
</P>
<P>
   If Paus sits on a keg of dynamite or is flattened by a boulder,
he dusts himself off and gets back to the chase. One of these days,
he's bound to get the Roadrunner. Isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like my rebirth,'' said Paus, a redshirt sophomore from
New Lenox, Ill., of Saturday's start. ``I feel like it's the first
game again. I was super excited before the first game and really
pumped, amped and ready to go. That's the way I am right now. I
just looked at (the injury) as a temporary setback.''
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is a reflection of Paus' unfailing confidence.
Part of it comes naturally and part of it comes from earning the
starting position from Drew Bennett last year and taking it twice
from Ryan McCann this season.
</P>
<P>
   His injuries aren't a matter of one faulty part. Each one has
been different.
</P>
<P>
   There were bruised ribs against Fresno State, a separated left
shoulder against Oregon State and a season-ending broken collarbone
against Washington. Paus had surgery last winter to tighten up the
left shoulder socket _ he also separated it in the final game of
his high school career.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a eight months of rehab and work, he went down on
the first play of the season opener _ and on a borderline late hit
by Alabama defensive end Jarret Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to feel like Nancy Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as `Why me?' '' Paus said. ``I was just
frustrated. I was upset. I just wondered 'Oh, what did I do?' I was
basically upset, but I never really thought `Why me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said his mother, Nancy, laughing: ``We're kind of worried that
another injury might put him in a body bag. You want to be angry,
but it's the nature of the beast. Who can you be angry at? Your son
plays a sport where you're always an injury away from playing or
not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The night he was injured, Paus was devastated. The next day, he
was plotting his return. The question was: to what?
</P>
<P>
   While Paus spent the first week after the injury watching
practice in glasses and his right arm in a sling, UCLA coach Bob
Toledo was suggesting that if the Bruins continued to win with
McCann, who came in to lead them to a 35-24 upset of No. 3-ranked
Alabama, he would keep the job. McCann was benched against Fresno
State but came back to help the Bruins beat No. 3 Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I thought about it a little bit,'' Paus said. ``We won
our first three games and a lot of people say if it's not broken,
don't fix it. But I was really, really, really concentrating all my
effort on just getting back to the point where I could play if I
was ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus spent much of his time with his girlfriend, UCLA
cheerleader Joelle Cosentino. He also leaned on his parents, Nancy
and Rick Paus, and his roommates, Rusty Williams and Rob
Kolaczynski.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tried to keep him in good spirits,'' said Williams, a
defensive end. ``We'd tell him we were confident in him, that he's
still the starting quarterback. The first two days he was
devastated, but he's real positive about everything. It's not like
him to sit around and mope. He just looked at it like it was a
matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents, who will be at the Rose Bowl on Saturday, tried to
talk about anything but football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, 'Hang in there honey, there is a reason for all of
that. You dont always know how it is. Adversity breeds character.'
You know, all the things you're supposed to say,'' Nancy Paus said.
``But it got to the point where he didn't want to hear about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus began playing light catch last week and was cleared
Thursday to resume practicing this week. After each workout, he
ices the shoulder. It gets more comfortable each day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All through his rehab, Paus never asked Toledo or offensive
coordinator Al Borges about his status and they never told him.
Both Paus and Toledo said it wasn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knew where he stood,'' said Toledo, who told Paus
Monday morning that he would likely start this week.
</P>
<P>
   Paus has displayed few signs of rust the past two days in
practice. He's throwing the ball decisively and accurately if not
always with as much zip.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who saw him last year saw someone going through a lot
of growing pains,'' Toledo said. ``They didn't see him in spring
ball when he was much improved and they didn't see him (in fall
camp). Nobody's seen him yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's that kind of guy (who will respond to the spotlight). He
likes pressure. He thrives on pressure. That's why he's a good
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't he?

METS CLINCH WILD CARD WITH WIN OVER BRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last Atlanta Braves pitcher to work Wednesday
night was Kevin McGlinchy, the one Brave whose name evokes warm
memories for the Mets' faithful. It was McGlinchy who served up
Robin Ventura's grand slam single in the final home game last
postseason, when the Mets beat the Braves and anything seemed
possible in October.
</P>
<P>
   October became a reality again Wednesday night, when the Mets
beat the Braves, 6-2, to capture the National League wild-card
berth for the second year in a row. They will not be the National
League East Division champions _ the Braves won that crown at Shea
Stadium on Tuesday _ but the Mets have now reached the postseason
in consecutive seasons for the first time in their 40-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are in, at last, and they did it against their nemesis,
Atlanta, which eliminated them in the regular season in 1998 and
the postseason in '99, and which won seven of their first 11
meetings this year. For the Mets, there will be no cardiac finish,
as there was last year, when it took a one-game playoff victory in
Cincinnati to clinch the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night's victory, as usual, did not come easily;
the first nine Mets to come to bat made outs, and the Braves
threatened in the ninth with a leadoff home run by Andres
Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   But when Armando Benitez closed things out by fanning Keith
Lockhart, the crowd of 48,858 people stood in appreciation, and
there were hugs and wide smiles up and down the handshake line in
the infield. Things were bound to be more festive inside: While
Benitez finished up, the Mets' lockers were being covered with
plastic in preparation for a Champagne celebration.
</P>
<P>
   There was reason for elation, even if a party had been in doubt
a few days ago, when General Manager Steve Phillips reminded
everyone that the Mets should not celebrate when first place was
still undecided. But with the Braves having clinched on Tuesday,
the Mets were allowed to do as they pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, they're more than welcome to,'' said Phillips, who joked
that his young children had nonalcoholic champagne waiting to be
popped at home. ``No restrictions, feel free, go for it. I don't
think it's weird. It's kind of the way the game is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, some players openly wondered what the protocol
would be, considering the unusual circumstances and, perhaps, the
fact that the Mets have played so poorly for much of this month.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Todd Zeile was on the Orioles in 1996 when they
won the wild card and became Baltimore's first playoff team in 13
years. Zeile remembers celebrating the accomplishment, feeling good
about it. The feeling around the Mets is a bit different, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, because of the fact that we were striving for something
else, that seems to be somewhat of a disappointment at this
point,'' Zeile said of the wild card. ``I think the celebration
seems anticlimactic, in a way. I guess the wild-card berth seems
anticlimactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile was being realistic; after all, when the Braves clinched
first place at Shea Stadium on Tuesday night it meant the Mets
would have to settle for second. But Zeile thought banning any
celebrating would demean what the Mets had done. ``Just by virtue
of the fact that we didn't win the division, we shouldn't feel like
we're not entitled to congratulate ourselves for working hard
enough to win enough games to be in the playoffs, one way or the
other,'' he said.

   NEW YORK _ Most privately owned public spaces in New York City,
created in a tradeoff that was meant to give pedestrians a little
extra breathing room as developers got extra-large buildings, have
failed in some way, large or small, a new study has found.
</P>

   Some spaces were uninviting from the start. Others have lost
their allure. Gates that should be open are padlocked. Ledges that
should be welcoming are lined with spikes. Plazas are filled with
Dumpsters. Drinking fountains are dry. And chairs and tables meant
for the public are taken over by restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``At their worst, by design and operation, the spaces have been
hostile to public use,'' wrote Jerold S. Kayden, an associate
professor in the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, who
directed the study. ``Brasseries bulge, cafes creep and trattorias
trickle into adjacent public space, confusing users who think that
they must pay the price of a meal or drink to sit at a table and
enjoy the space.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1961, zoning rules have allowed developers to put up
bigger buildings _in essence, adding valuable floors at the top _
if they provide the public with plazas, atriums, arcades and
walkways down below.
</P>
<P>
   While several hundred spaces have been created, some quite
successfully, the city has had no meaningful way to assess the
policy because there was no systematic accounting. Officials did
not know exactly how many spaces had been created or where they all
were.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the first comprehensive survey and analysis, undertaken by
Kayden, the New York City Planning Department and the Municipal Art
Society, has found 503 spaces at 320 buildings. All but 22 of the
buildings received a zoning bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Based on site visits in 1998 and 1999, the study concludes that
nearly half of the buildings' public spaces do not comply with city
rules, and that 41 percent of the spaces are of only marginal value
even if they do meet the design requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the findings, the Giuliani administration sued the
owners of three buildings this month and issued notices of
violations against the owners of eight others. The owners could be
fined if they do not comply.
</P>
<P>
   Planning officials say that the enforcement effort could involve
many more buildings, but that they hope first to gain voluntary
compliance from owners.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings that are subject to the lawsuits _ 40 Broad St.,
Parc East Tower and Worldwide Plaza _ were chosen as representative
of the three major categories of violation: lack of amenities,
reduced access and annexation by commercial tenants.
</P>
<P>
   At 40 Broad St., an office building near Exchange Place, there
are supposed to be planters, benches and trees in a
1,498-square-foot plaza along the building's New Street facade. And
there once were. But they are all gone now, leaving a barren, wide
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls Monday and Tuesday to the management office were
not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Parc East Tower, an apartment building at 240 E. 27th St., at
Second Avenue, is supposed to provide midblock access from 27th
Street to an attractive minipark and waterfall on 26th Street,
designed by Lawrence Halprin, who was also responsible for the
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Philip Schneider of the planning department,
is that the midblock passageway is often locked and used to park
cars and store debris, an assertion borne out by a visit Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   JoAnn Sher, a principal in the Merit Operating Corp., which
manages the building, said she could not comment on a matter in
litigation. But the building's owners, she said, want the minipark
``to be a wonderful amenity for the community and expect to do
everything we can to make it such.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide Plaza on Eighth Avenue, between 49th and 50th Streets,
earns overall praise in the survey. But David Karnovsky, counsel to
the planning department, said the movable chairs and tables that
are required as a public amenity had become the ``exclusive
province'' of the restaurants on either side of the space.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, all the furniture was arranged within low walls
enclosing outdoor space in front of the restaurants, clearly
conveying the impression that it was private, although a visitor
was allowed to sit at both places without ordering.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the owner of Worldwide Plaza, Equity Office
Properties Trust, said that as a matter of policy, the company
could not comment on a pending lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not every public space is restricted, ambiguous or
disagreeable. The survey found that 16 percent of the spaces were
so well designed and maintained that they drew visitors from
throughout the neighborhood and the city.
</P>
<P>
   Among those favorably noted were 30 Lincoln Plaza, with a
meandering waterfall and pool set in a grove of trees off Broadway,
between 62nd and 63rd Streets, designed by M. Paul Friedberg; and
One East River Place, a park at 72nd Street near the Franklin D.
Roosevelt Drive by Zion &AMP; Breen, architects of the famous Paley
Park at 3 E. 53rd St.
</P>
<P>
   All told, there is a total of 3.58 million square feet, or 82.28
acres, of privately owned public space in the city _ roughly equal
to the section of Central Park below 64th Street.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the equation, the developers of 298 office,
apartment and hotel towers have been allowed to build an extra 16
million square feet of floor area, about the equivalent of seven
Empire State Buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we get what we bargained for?'' asked Kent L. Barwick,
president of the Municipal Art Society. ``The answer is
overwhelmingly no.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, owners have had to cope with encampments of
homeless people, drug trafficking and vandalism in their spaces.
But they have also benefited from the extra floor area, even when
the rules are broken. And enforcement of the requirements has been
hampered by the lack of reliable information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having this inventory can assist us in identifying enforcement
and compliance issues as they arise,'' said Joseph B. Rose,
director of the planning department and chairman of the City
Planning Commission. ``Where there has been a deal and the public
is entitled to an amenity,'' he said, ``we want to make sure we get
that amenity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose said the survey was part of the administration's focus on
neighborhood quality of life. It also comes as city planners have
proposed eliminating the automatic development bonus for public
spaces in high-density residential districts.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the three-and-a-half-year survey will be
published on Oct. 20, in ``Privately Owned Public Space: The New
York City Experience'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons). An accompanying
database is to be posted on the planning agency's Web site.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rose said the survey would provide landlords as well as block
associations with a guide to the required features. ``We expect
that getting some attention paid to these spaces will in most cases
yield voluntary compliance,'' he said. ``The idea isn't to have a
witch hunt. Owners may not have known just what their obligations
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a new three-level enforcement program by the city's
planning, buildings and law departments, letters will be sent to
owners pointing out potential violations, in the hope of enlisting
their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   More serious problems will be turned over to the Environmental
Control Board for enforcement, Karnovsky said. And the most serious
could result in more lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The Municipal Art Society will examine the best and worst plazas
and atriums in an exhibition, ``The World's Most Expensive Public
Space,'' from Friday through Nov. 18 at the Urban Center, 457
Madison Ave., between 50th and 51st Streets.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, the society will send out volunteers to record
conditions at public spaces to supplement the field surveys
conducted in 1998 and 1999. The canvassing is envisioned as an
annual event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the book and database,'' said Ellen Ryan,
director of planning issues at the Municipal Art Society, ``is that
it creates a whole cadre of civilian enforcement officers.''
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the survey, Kayden has occasionally played the role
of enforcement officer himself. For instance, the public atrium
just inside the front entrance of the Henri Bendel store, on Fifth
Avenue between 55th and 56th Streets, is supposed to be
unobstructed and not used for retail activity.
</P>
<P>
   On finding the space filled with merchandise during one of his
site visits, Kayden raised his camera. ``You're not allowed to take
pictures here,'' he said a Bendel employee told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not allowed to have a department store in here,''
Kayden replied.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the New York Tower, 330 E. 39th St., where
ornamental gates are padlocked _ despite a sign reading ``Courtyard
open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily'' _ Kayden said: ``It's a slap in
the face.''
</P>
<P>
   In the plaza of the Highgate apartment tower, 182 E. 95th St.,
Kayden found recycling Dumpsters chained to spiked rails on ledges
that were supposed to be used for seating. ``There's no surface
that's sittable anywhere,'' he noted, acknowledging one exception:
a lamppost nearby where a pigeon was perched.

THE FIRST LADY HEADS WEST TO RAISE MONEY, BOTH HARD AND SOFT
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Okla., Nev., Calif.) By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton began a three-day fund-raising trip
outside New York Wednesday with a visit to Oklahoma City, where her
host was a former state attorney general who came under scrutiny in
one of the fund-raising investigations involving her husband's
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then held an event in Las Vegas on Wednesday night, and
after that travels to the Los Angeles area for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, has criticized her for relying
heavily on contributions from Hollywood celebrities, a traditional
fund-raising source for Democrats, and at first, her aides would
not disclose the names of sponsors of the California events.
</P>
<P>
   They later acknowledged that one host would be Cher. The others
include the financier Marvin Davis and his wife, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money from the fund-raising trip is expected to go
to Clinton's Senate campaign, but she also plans to collect soft
money for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York contest, she and her Democratic allies have
tentatively agreed not to spend soft money _ the largely
unregulated contributions collected by parties in an effort to
circumvent contribution limits _ under an arrangement with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, who headed West after addressing an economic forum
at Columbia University on Wednesday morning, has said she will
continue to raise soft money, which would be used to help other
Democrats, not her candidacy, as long as the New York arrangement
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Clinton has received about 60 percent of her campaign
contributions from out of state, more than Lazio or most Senate
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Lazio has a clear financial advantage in this race
because he has raised millions out-of-state with his insult-filled
direct mail,'' said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton
campaign. ``As a result, we have to work harder to be
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma City Wednesday, the host for a fund-raising luncheon
for Clinton was Michael Turpen, the former state attorney general
and one of the state's most prominent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Turpen's fund-raising activities were examined by congressional
Republicans in 1997 after he raised a large donation for the
Democratic National Committee from an Indian tribe in Oklahoma that
has sought to reclaim federal land that the tribe believes was
stolen from it.
</P>
<P>
   Turpen had been hired as a lobbyist by the tribe, the
Cheyenne-Arapaho. He suggested to tribal leaders that they could
gain access to federal officials if they pledged a $100,000
donation to the Democrats, tribal leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders were soon invited to a lunch with President Clinton
at the White House, where they asked him for help on the land
issue. The president, according to the tribal leaders, said he
would look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president ultimately took no action, and after the
circumstances surrounding the donation were publicized, the
Democratic National Committee returned the money. But Republicans
in Congress who investigated the affair called it part of a pattern
of Democratic fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, the spokesman for Clinton's campaign, said the
fund-raiser sponsored by Turpen Wednesday was ``perfectly legal and
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Turpen did not respond to two messages left for him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, sent
a letter to the National Abortion Rights Action League, requesting
that it refrain from airing any advertising attacking Lazio for his
position on abortion, in deference to the agreement between the
Lazio and Clinton campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the group had initially chafed at the deal, arguing
that it interfered with their rights. After meeting Wednesday,
board members said they would unveil a new advertisement Thursday,
but pointedly did not say whether the advertisement would be aired.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said Wednesday night that it was likely that
NARAL would unveil the ad Thursday, expecting that it would be the
subject of news reports, but would not buy ad time in deference to
the deal.

HEBERTO PADILLA, 68, CUBAN POET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ohio, N.Y.)   By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heberto Padilla, an acclaimed Cuban poet whose criticism of
Fidel Castro's rule landed him first in jail and later in exile,
died Sept. 25 in Auburn, Ala., where he had recently become a
writer in residence at Auburn University. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla was found dead in his apartment on Monday by a colleague
who went searching for him after he had missed three classes, a
university spokesman said. Police said that Padilla had died of
natural causes. Friends reported that he had had a history of heart
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla, an early supporter of the Castro revolution known for
his cool, ironic style, became famous abroad in 1971 when he was
jailed on charges of having ``plotted against the powers of the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be forever known as the first poet to have the stature
and courage to object to the repression of Fidel Castro's regime,''
said Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria, the Sterling professor of Spanish
and comparative literature at Yale University, and chairman of the
department of Spanish and Portuguese literature. ``And he suffered
immensely for it, not the least being his death in exile, alone in
Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1971 Padilla was released after a month of brutal
interrogation during which he was forced to make a humiliating
4,000-word public confession.
</P>
<P>
   His jailing and the ``confession'' that followed set off an
international protest as writers around the world, from Jean-Paul
Sartre to Alberto Moravia to Susan Sontag, rose to his defense: for
some left-leaning authors, it was the event that forever changed
the way they viewed Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After 1971 Padilla's works were banned in his native country.
For the next nine years he managed to earn a living by translating
English poetry and ghostwriting. In 1980, after another campaign
led by Robert B. Silvers, editor of The New York Review of Books,
he was finally given permission by Castro to leave Cuba and join
his wife, other members of his family and the poet Belkis Cuza Male
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoirs, ``Self-Portrait of the Other,'' published by
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux in 1990, Padilla recounted his last
conversation with Castro, a man he had known since his youth.
</P>
<P>
   After telling Padilla he was free to leave Cuba, Castro added:
``Stay as long as you want, and when you want to come back, give me
a call. If you are a true revolutionary, you will want to return.''
Castro went on to characterize those who dared to stray from
official orthodoxy. ``People who criticize a revolution may be
mistaken, they may be sincere, but they are dangerous
nonetheless,'' Castro was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla maintained a detached view of the Cuban leader, whom he
described in his book as an anachronism who had grown deaf to the
opinions of his own countrymen and was stuck like a fly in the
amber of an outdated Marxist-Leninism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 Padilla, then 27, had enthusiastically embraced the
revolution, which brought him back home from the United States,
where he had been working as a radio commentator and translater. He
became one of the founding editors of Lunes de Revolucion, a
literary journal, and worked for Prensa Latina, the Cuban news
agency, and Granma, the Cuban Communist Party newspaper, as a
foreign correspondent based in Moscow and London.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1968 his relations with the Castro government and its
cultural commissars had begun to sour, and he was recalled to
Havana. When his book of poetry, ``Out of the Game,'' won a
first-place prize in a literary competition, he and the book were
denounced by the Cuban Writers Union as ``counterrevolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Giselle and Maria; two sons,
Carlos and Ernesto; a sister, Martha; a brother, Gilberto; and his
companion, Lourdes Gil, a faculty member at the New School
University (formerly known as the New School for Social Research)
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mazzotti, a professor of Latin American literature at
Harvard University, described Padilla as one of the Latin American
poets to develop a ``conversational'' style with strong visual and
sensual images that was to mark a break with earlier European
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrival in the United States, Padilla resumed work on
a novel, ``Heroes Are Grazing in My Garden,'' which he had begun in
Cuba but which had been confiscated by the authorities. The book
was published in 1983. In 1982 the first book-length collection of
his poetry, ``Legacies: Selected Poems,'' was published for the
first time in English. A book of new poetry titled ``A Fountain, a
House of Stone,'' was published in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   While living in Princeton, N.J., Padilla and his wife published
a literary journal, Linden Lane, that became a forum for young
Latin American writers. Padillo taught literature at a number of
institutions in the United States, including Ohio State University,
Bowdoin College and New York University's New York Institute for
the Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   At Auburn University, where he had begun working five weeks ago,
Padilla taught undergraduate courses in Spanish composition and
conversation, as well as a graduate seminar in Hispanic literature
and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``His poetry reflected and reflected upon the ongoing historical
process,'' said Gonzalez Echevarria. ``But he proved Plato was
right when he said poets are not welcome in the republic when they
say uncomfortable things about the tyrants.''

SYDNEY ON HIS MIND

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marques Anderson is in Westwood, but his heart is
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the Bruins' strong safety who will be sidelined
Saturday against Arizona State, will be thinking of his sister,
Andrea, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   She is running a leg on the United States' 1,600-meter relay
team during the preliminary heats, which begin Friday night on the
West Coast. It is uncertain whether she will run in Saturday's
final should the U.S. qualify as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my sister are like best friends,'' said Anderson. ``I
hate missing that experience, but I've got obligations here.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's parents, Maurice and Susan, flew to Sydney on Monday.
They also have Marques' cell-phone number so he won't have to wait
for the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they better call,'' he said. ``I don't want them
to leave me out of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Been there, done that: When Ryan McCann was a senior at
Agoura High, he suffered the same injury that sidelined Cory Paus
for four games _ a separated throwing shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   McCann said his was a second-degree separation, slightly worse
than Paus' injury. He missed 4 games and was able to return for the
final two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stiff,'' McCann said of his left shoulder. ``But I
played through it. I felt sore and I didn't have as much on the
ball. A week after, it was much better.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Krohn ill: Arizona State quarterback Jeff Krohn missed
practice Wednesday night because of flu symptoms, leaving his
status for Saturday's game in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   If Krohn is unable to start, the Sun Devils can turn to
fifth-year senior Ryan Kealy.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy, a three-year starter, has thrown for 6,361 yards and 45
touchdowns. He missed spring practice after his fifth knee surgery
and was suspended during fall camp and the first two games for
testing positive for marijuana following a traffic stop by police.
</P>
<P>
   __ True Numbers: UCLA has used just three freshmen this season _
receiver and kick returner Tab Perry, reserve linebacker Brandon
Chillar and reserve cornerback Keith Short. Barring injuries, the
rest of the freshman class will redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, this would be the fewest number of freshman to play
since 1992, when quarterback Ryan Fien, running back Sharmon Shah
and tackle Jonathan Ogden all played.
