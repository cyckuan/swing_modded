<HEADLINE> Ag Processing Plants Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PIERRE, S.D. (AP) -- A proposed lamb slaughter plant at Platte is  
the first project to receive state assistance through a new program 
aimed at getting more agricultural processing plants started. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Stearns, agriculture development specialist in the state  
Economic Development Office, said a $7,800 loan has been made to 
American Livestock and Grain for a feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
	If it's built, chilled lamb carcasses will be shipped to a  
processor in Los Angeles, where the meat will be cut up for sale to 
consumers. The California company has even indicated an interest in 
locating its final processing operations at Platte, Stearns said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first use of a new law setting up a special $3 million  
account for agricultural processing by shifting the money from the 
state's main economic development fund. The money may be used for 
feasibility and marketing studies for plants that process crops and 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to see this thing get off the ground,'' Stearns said  
of the new program approved by this year's Legislature. ``This was 
a very good project to start it with. It looks very doable, and it 
was one where they had their ducks in a row and had some marketing 
work done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The feasibility and marketing program also will receive ongoing  
revenues of about $400,000 a year by keeping 3 cents a gallon on 
refunds that go to farmers and others who use fuel for field work 
and other off-road purposes. That cuts fuel tax refunds to 15 cents 
a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Program rules allow the state Economic Development Board to  
provide up to half the cost of feasibility and marketing studies. 
The assistance may be provided as loans or as grants that will not 
have to be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	State assistance may be used for salaries, consultants, services  
and supplies needed for feasibility and marketing studies. The 
loans and grants cannot be used for construction expenses or land 
and equipment purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Stearns said other projects also have applied for assistance,  
and the board will consider them at its October meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of inquiries, and I've sent out a lot of  
application forms,'' he said. ``As soon as the harvest is done and 
the combines and tractors are put away, I think we'll see a lot of 
applications come in.''

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Changes Ad Payment Setup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., one of the nation's  
biggest advertisers, will change the way it pays advertising 
agencies, linking their compensation to the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning July 1, P&AMP;G will pay agencies a percentage of global  
brand sales instead of commissions based on media spending. P&AMP;G, 
one of the nation's biggest advertisers, spends more than $3 
billion each year to promote its 300 consumer product brands like 
Tide, Crest and Folger's. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really simple: As we grow, our agencies grow,'' Bob  
Wehling, the company's global marketing officer, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G now pays ad agencies a percentage of what it spends to  
advertise its products on television, radio, magazines, newspapers 
and other media. That results in marketing plans skewed toward 
traditional forums of television and print to the exclusion of the 
Internet and direct mail, P&AMP;G and ad agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, an increasing number of companies have  
adopted similar plans for agency compensation that tie agency pay 
to sales or other measures of advertising performance like brand 
awareness. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble has taken the lead in pushing the advertising  
and Internet industries to provide more advertising opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Edwin Artzt, then the company's chairman and chief  
executive, warned in a speech that the advertising industry was 
being left behind by rapidly changing technologies and the growing 
importance of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, P&AMP;G sponsored a meeting of advertisers and  
Internet industry leaders to discuss strategies for online 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is also pushing ahead with its own Internet  
ventures. On Monday, P&AMP;G announced it is teaming with the 
investment firm Institutional Venture Partners to create a Web site 
called reflect.com to sell customized beauty care products. The Web 
site is to begin operating later this year.

<HEADLINE> New Raymond Carver Stories Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) -- It took more than a decade after  
writer Raymond Carver's death for his widow, poet Tess Gallagher, 
to sit down and sort through the old papers in his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	But when she finally felt the time was right, Gallagher  
unearthed a treasure -- three unpublished stories Carver revised 
several times but never polished. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the stories have been published in Esquire, and the third  
will appear next year in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``These will be the last writings of Ray's to offer of this  
nature. It's been lovely to have his stories in the house again, of 
course. A great excitement and a pleasure,'' Gallagher said this 
week in an e-mail interview from Italy, where she is attending a 
literary festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Carver's death from lung cancer at age 50, his fans have  
wondered whether more of his work existed. Many literary critics 
say the blue-collar author of such award-winning works as 
``Cathedral,'' ``Where I'm Calling From'' and ``Short Cuts'' died 
at the height of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher suspected Carver's desk might contain something  
special, but she had some misgivings about searching through it. As 
executor of his estate, she feared new unpublished tales would lead 
to a protracted bidding war. An award-winning writer herself, she 
suspected the resulting hubbub would leave her no time to work. 
</P>
<P>
	So she put off the task until she could find an editor she  
trusted. That person was Jay Woodruff, a friend and senior editor 
at Esquire. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Woodruff flew from New York to Gallagher's rustic Port  
Angeles home at the foot of the Olympic Mountains to spend a day 
rummaging through Carver's desk. It wasn't until evening, and the 
last drawer, when Gallagher found the three stories dating back to 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``As someone who has read almost everything that Carver had ever  
published, everything was fascinating to me,'' Woodruff said. ``The 
notes, the scraps, the fragments and pieces of a working writer's 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodruff didn't need to do much editing -- just ``light  
housekeeping,'' as Gallagher put it. 
</P>
<P>
	``These aren't stories he wrote when he was 20 and put aside,''  
Woodruff said. ``These are stories he was writing in the mid-80s 
when he was at the absolute peak of his power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first tale, ``Kindling,'' was published in Esquire's July  
summer fiction issue. In the story, a recovering alcoholic purges 
himself of his past through the metaphor of chopping wood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vandals,'' which appears in Esquire's October issue, examines  
the definition of vandalism as the story twists and turns through a 
love triangle. A third piece, ``Dreams,'' will be published 
sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The three stories and two other unpublished Carver works will be  
published by Knopf in a soon-to-be expanded edition of ``No Heroics 
Please,'' a collection of Carver's stories. 
</P>
<P>
	The two other stories were found this summer in the Charvat  
Fiction Collection at Ohio State University, where Carver used to 
sell some of his papers when he was low on money. William Stull, 
who edited Carver collections and wrote his biography, made the 
discovery along with his wife, Maureen P. Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to say that none of them would rank with his  
greatest stories,'' said Gary Fisketjon, editor at large at Knopf 
publishing, ``but collectively, the five were very strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time that Carver's writings have come under  
scrutiny. For years, there have been suggestions that his 
minimalist style was greatly the work of his former editor, Gordon 
Lish. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher herself also claims that Carver ``scooped'' her on a  
few of her own story ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Port Angeles library, where a meeting room is dedicated  
to Carver, librarians say Gallagher was wise to wait. In light of 
recently published ``lost'' works by Ernest Hemingway and Louisa 
May Alcott, they say a good editor is essential. 
</P>
<P>
	``With some authors, their books became formulaic and maybe they  
shouldn't be published unless it's different from what they 
normally do,'' said Genie Devine, a reference librarian who was 
pleased with the newly discovered Carver works. 
</P>
<P>
	Devine said fans from as far away as Japan and Australia come in  
to ask where Carver is buried. Some borrow first editions and end 
up keeping them as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Carver's grave, which overlooks the Strait of Juan de Fuca  
from a wind-swept bluff, visitors from around the world leave their 
thoughts in a notebook inside a small metal box. Gallagher, whose 
black granite headstone already rests next to Carver's, writes back 
to them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also promised him on his death bed that I would look after  
things,'' she said. ``I keep that promise every day.''

<HEADLINE> Provision Requires Travel Repayment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday night to require  
challengers for federal office to reimburse the government for the 
actual cost of their political travel, a provision that Democrats 
complained was aimed solely at first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 261-167 in favor of the provision, advanced by Rep.  
John Sweeney, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney said the proposal was designed to make ``potential  
candidates more accountable to taxpayers.'' He said constituents 
had raised Mrs. Clinton's use of government aircraft to conduct her 
unannounced Senate campaign from New York ``as an equity issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady makes use of government aircraft, and Democrats  
said the amendment was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is petty and unchivalrous,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren,  
D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of government aircraft is far more costly than a  
first-class commercial airplane ticket, on which customary federal 
reimbursement rules are based. As first lady, Mrs. Clinton travels 
with a larger retinue than is customary challengers for federal 
office. These include not only her staff but Secret Service agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting in favor of the measure were 215 Republicans and 46  
Democrats. Opposed were 164 Democrats, two Republicans and one 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision was inserted into legislation to overhaul the  
campaign finance laws.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs New Kidney Transplant Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People receiving kidney transplants will have  
a new drug available to help prevent organ rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapamune won approval Wednesday from the Food and Drug  
Administration as an addition to the drugs used to suppress the 
immune system in order to prevent rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA termed the drug an important addition to the limited  
number of immunosupressants available for use in kidney 
transplants. It is made by Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval followed two clinical studies -- one involved 719  
patients in the United States, the other with 576 patients in 
Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said side effects of the drug included an increase in  
cholesterol in the blood, which required treatment with 
lipid-lowering drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said drug comes in liquid form and the daily dose can  
be mixed with water or orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapamune is taken along with cyclosporin, another  
immunosuppressant, and corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation 
and also suppress the immune system, the FDA added. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval comes as good news for Wyeth Ayerst's parent  
company, American Home Products. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP faces lawsuits over the diet drugs Redux and Pondimin and  
recently had a recall of subpotent emergency injection kits for 
severe allergic reactions. Last summer, the company had to stop 
selling a diarrheal vaccine while the government investigated a 
possible link to dangerous bowel obstructions.

<HEADLINE> Dime Bancorp To Buy Hudson United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dime Bancorp Inc. is acquiring Hudson United  
Bancorp for $1.58 billion to create one of the largest regional 
banks in the Northeast with $32 billion in assets, the companies 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 330 branches of the combined bank will operate under the  
DimeBank name in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and 
Pennsylvania. The parent company, Dime United Bancorp Inc., will be 
based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence J. Toal, chairman and chief executive officer of Dime,  
said the new bank will ``have the resources to compete effectively 
as a top-tier regional bank in attracting new business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toal will keep his titles at the new bank for three years.  
Kenneth T. Neilson, currently chairman, president, and chief 
executive officer of Hudson United, will serve as president and 
chief operating officer of the combined company. Neilson will 
replace Toal on Jan. 1, 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	By combining operations, the Dime United expects to cut $78  
million in annual costs, though few branches are expected to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement, a new common stock will be  
created and exchanged for shares in both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of Hudson United will get one share of Dime United,  
worth about $30.25, for each Hudson United they hold. Shareholders 
in Dime will receive 0.585 share in the new company, worth about 
$17.70, for each share of Dime. 
</P>
<P>
	After the deal closes early next year, Dime United will pay a $1  
per share cash dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	Dime will control 13 seats of the new board of directors, while  
Hudson United will get 12. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading, shares of Dime rose 18 3/4 cents to $17.93 3/4  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares of Hudson United were 
up 43 3/4 cents to $30.56 1/4.

<HEADLINE> China To Increase Deficit Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China will increase deficit spending in the next  
year to help pull the economy out of its deflationary spiral, a 
senior official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boosting of internal demand will be a long-term policy,''  
said Li Rongrong, vice chairman of the State Development Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Li said China would issue more government bonds to ensure that  
projects begun under a $1.2 trillion state-backed spending program 
would be completed and put into operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Li declined to say how much additional debt would be issued,  
saying it would be determined by international and domestic 
economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the government issued 100 billion yuan ($12.10  
billion) in special treasury bonds to stimulate the economy. 
Earlier this month, Beijing sold an additional 60 billion yuan 
($7.27 billion) in special bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Li said that the increased debt will not create an intolerable  
burden for the government because sources of revenue are being 
improved and other spending has been cut through bureaucratic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has made arrangements for increasing revenue on  
the one hand and saving expenditure on the other,'' Li said.

<HEADLINE> Philly is Back for Moviemakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- To hear locals talk about it, a new movie  
about dead people walking around Philadelphia is the best thing to 
happen since a little-known boxer named Rocky trained on the Art 
Museum steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly every scene in ``The Sixth Sense'' is anchored by the  
city's recognizable brick sidewalks and wrought-iron fences. A 
teacher extols the history of the city, telling a class it was once 
the capital of the United States. Even the troubled main character 
lives in a cozy South Philadelphia row house. 
</P>
<P>
	Is this the same trash-strewn city where Bruce Willis roamed a  
deserted plague-stricken Earth in ``Twelve Monkeys'' and Eddie 
Murphy played a fake-blind beggar in ``Trading Places''? 
</P>
<P>
	Though movies made and set in Philly are nothing new, the city's  
stock on theater screens has skyrocketed with the success of ``The 
Sixth Sense,'' which has earned more than $176 million to date. And 
with more movie productions fleeing Los Angeles for cheaper 
locations here and overseas, Philadelphia is happy to grab part of 
the windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Philadelphia is photographed so beautifully and with so many  
people coming to see the movie it can't help but help us,'' mayor's 
spokesman Kevin Feeley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has long been the backdrop for stories about  
blue-collar heroes earning respect, from Paul Newman's social 
climber in ``The Young Philadelphians'' to Jimmy Stewart's snobby 
writer pining after Katharine Hepburn's debutante in ``The 
Philadelphia Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even ``Rocky'' and ``Trading Places'' were about bottom-skimmers  
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. In between have been 
movies using the city to look like somewhere else -- ``Independence 
Day,'' ``The Peacemaker'' and ``Seven,'' and films like ``The Age 
of Innocence'' and ``Beloved'' that filled the streets with dirt to 
recall the city's 19th-century heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia credits its latest bout in the limelight to native  
son M. Night Shyamalan, a 29-year-old who wrote and directed ``The 
Sixth Sense.'' He also filmed last year's ``Wide Awake,'' about a 
10-year-old boy's search for God, in the Philadelphia suburb of 
Bryn Mawr. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a strong affinity for this place,'' Shyamalan said from  
his office in Conshohocken, outside Philadelphia. ``It's a city 
where you can borrow its natural character or use it as a stand-in 
for other cities. You can literally do anything here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz around Philadelphia can only help Shyamalan and other  
hometown directors such as Brian De Palma and Elaine May, because 
every movie strengthens the city's infrastructure of crew, 
production support and experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's 'Philadelphia' or 'Sixth Sense,' it gives  
Philadelphia an identity as a feature film place. It's entertaining 
people and it's giving them just a hint of what is here and that's 
a nice benefit,'' said native Philadelphian and director Eugene 
Martin, who has made two independent films here. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Steve Buscemi is directing his second movie, ``Animal  
Factory,'' with Willem Dafoe and Edward Furlong at Holmesburg 
Prison in suburban Philadelphia; NYPD Blue-director Darnell Martin 
is planning his movie, ``Prison Song,'' here. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Philadelphia continues to compete with other locations,  
especially Canada, where the exchange rate and cheaper labor can 
cut costs by up to one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that we're losing a number of films to  
Canada, and every film commission is trying to address that 
problem,'' said Baltimore Film Office spokeswoman Rose Greene. ``A 
successful movie at the box office is a big help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore's biggest film asset so far has been from its  
successful hometown boys, directors John Waters and Barry Levinson. 
Waters makes all his movies in Maryland, and Levinson has made four 
films in the city and helped bring TV's ``Homicide: Life on the 
Street'' to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came here and (made movies), then they told people, `Hey,  
you can do it here,''' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has always had a stable of homegrown stars, from  
W.C. Fields and Grace Kelly to Bill Cosby and Sylvester Stallone. 
Kevin Bacon, Richard Gere, Blythe Danner and Linda Fiorentino were 
all born in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Native son Will Smith has proposed a sound stage and production  
studio in South Philadelphia -- a plan that has gained momentum 
because of ``The Sixth Sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine anyone on this planet who would benefit more  
from what they are planning than myself,'' said Shyamalan, who 
anticipates making a movie every 18 months. He said he planned to 
talk with Smith's brother, Harry, about supporting the project. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, any movie featuring Philadelphia is good, as far as  
the city's film office is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``People's attitudes about a place are very much influenced by  
movies, and when the world gets to see Philadelphia on the big 
screen, it almost doesn't matter what movie it is,'' said Sharon 
Pinkenson, executive director of the Greater Philadelphia Film 
Office. ``The more movies the better.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  DaimlerChrysler Has Big Tech Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler plans to invest more  
than $49 billion by 2001 to develop new technologies that would set 
it apart in the fiercely competitive auto market, the co-chairmen 
of the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-American automaker plans to introduce 64 new  
passenger car and commercial vehicle models worldwide before the 
year 2004, co-chairmen Robert Eaton and Juergen Schrempp said at a 
news conference at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. 
</P>
<P>
	The company revised upwards its full-year sales projection to  
$155 billion from $148 billion on the basis of increased sales in 
the first eight months of the year. The company said it will sell 
more than 1 million passenger cars for the first time from the 
Mercedes-Benz and Smart brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp said the company aims to ``set the pace for further  
consolidation of the auto industry,'' adding that ``no one knows 
how many companies will be left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the United States, the executives said the next generation  
of sport utility vehicles, high-performance SUVs, are now in the 
works. There are also plans on the next series of models under the 
Jeep brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Both DaimlerChrysler leaders defended the company's Smart  
division, which produces tiny two-passenger cars that have had 
disappointing sales in their first year in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Smart is an innovative mobility concept which is more  
needed now than ever before,'' Eaton said. ``We believe in the 
future of Smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the news conference, the two men posed for photographs in  
front of a new Smart convertible model. The new City-Cabrio, to be 
available in March, was unveiled at the show along with a new 
diesel version. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential future for Smart was shown in a concept roadster  
that breaks out of the boxy coupe shape of the original Smart. 
Schrempp also said ``we have ideas about four-seaters'' for the 
brand. 
</P>
<P>
	A diesel version of the Smart that gets 90 miles per gallon from  
a 0.8 liter direct injection diesel engine will sell for $10,100. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has no plans to sell Smart cars in the United  
States, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation disclosed Tuesday of Lars Brorsen, the head of  
the Micro Compact Car subsidiary that makes the Smart, will not 
derail development of the brand, the executives said. A successor 
will be named later this week or early next week from inside the 
company, Schrempp said 
</P>
<P>
	The Frankfurt International Motor Show opens to the public  
Thursday, but automakers held media preview days Tuesday and today 
to showcase their latest models. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frankfurt show is typically a showcase for designs aimed at  
European demands: fuel efficiency and an ability to fit into tight 
parking spaces. Automakers emphasized the small bodies of their 
models while boasting of increased interior room for passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler made moves to enter the European market in a stronger  
way with its brand, showing off its new Neon model and PT Cruiser 
and a concept Java design. 
</P>
<P>
	The Java, which is in the same aerodynamic ``one-box'' profile  
as many of the other new models, features rear seats that are 
positioned higher than the front. The design is similar to theater 
seating, giving back-seat passengers a better view of the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other announcements at the show Tuesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Audi showed the new A2 with an all-alumimum body, making it 40  
percent lighter than if it were made of steel. 
</P>
<P>
	--VW tried to build on the success of the New Beetle in the  
United States by unveiling a lower-priced model, along with a 
higher-end turbo. The cheaper version cuts about $2,700 off the 
base price of $18,900. 
</P>
<P>
	VW's Concept D car gives a look at what a luxury car from the  
German automaker known for affordability would look like. The 
smooth contours of a sedan conceal a V-10 engine. 
</P>
<P>
	--BMW's Z8 roadster builds on the James Bond-appeal of its Z3.  
The car also comes with James Bond-like gadgets -- a 
``Multi-Information Radio'' allows drivers to use one control unit 
to operate the stereo, satellite navigation system and telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The X5 takes aim at the frenzied sport utility vehicle-market in  
the United States. The frame is based on a passenger car, which the 
carmaker says maximizes safety in case of a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	--Porsche said it will announce in a few days where it plans to  
build a new sport utility vehicle. Porsche and VW have said they 
would jointly develop an SUV for a 2002 launch under both 
companies' different brands.

<HEADLINE> Giants Grass Decision Said Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Sports and  
Exposition Authority and its tenants at Giants Stadium will meet 
Friday to discuss their second experiment with a grass field and 
the possibility of installing it on a full-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Giants of the NFL and the New York-New Jersey  
MetroStars of MLS said they would support a change from the current 
artificial turf to grass, but the question has been how the NFL's 
New York Jets would vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries the past two weeks to quarterback Vinny Testaverde  
(Achilles'), receiver Wayne Chrebet (broken foot) and running back 
Leon Johnson (knee) while playing on the Astroturf might convince 
the Jets to make the switch. Testaverde and Johnson were both lost 
for the year in Sunday's season-opening loss to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know what their position is,'' Giants executive  
vice president John Mara said of the Jets on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mara said the Giants and MetroStars want grass, and that the  
authority will do what the teams want, provided the three agree. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mara hopes the teams and their landlord could finalize  
plans for a grass field on Friday, authority spokesman John 
Samerjan said that is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they agreed to experiment with a grass field, it took  
them six months to make the deal,'' Samerjan said. ``I'm trying to 
lower the expectations. I think it will take a few more meetings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the teams agree to a grass surface, they then will have  
to agree to the costs for installing and maintaining it, Samerjan 
said. It is expected installation will cost about $1 million per 
team while maintenance is estimated at about $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars put up almost $2 million to pay for the grass  
field experiments, team general manager Charlie Stillitano said. If 
a grass field were put in on a permanent basis, they would only 
have to pay a share of the annual upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark Companies of Delhi, N.Y., installed the two fields used in  
the grass experiments. Scott Clark, the president of the company, 
is also expected to attend Friday's meeting, which was called to 
review this second experiment with grass. 
</P>
<P>
	That experiment ran from the spring until late August.  
</P>
<P>
	The grass field, which consists of 6,000 trays of grass put over  
the existing artificial field, was put to its biggest test from 
Aug. 20-29 when four football games were played along with a 
MetroStars' game. 
</P>
<P>
	The grass in the middle of the field turned brown and the team  
logos painted in the end zones were a little worn toward the end of 
the last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Mara felt the field held up very well, considering the  
groundskeepers were told not to do anything to make the field look 
better, such as painting the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the selling points of the tray system is that the most  
used portions of the field could be replaced up to three times 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The current artificial surface would be kept, just in case  
something goes wrong.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Sehorn Playing Vs. Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Cornerback Jason Sehorn worked out  
Wednesday without feeling any pain in his injured left hamstring 
and said there is a chance he will play in the New York Giants' 
home opener against the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	All Sehorn has to do now is convince coach Jim Fassel, which may  
not be so easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have sat around enough,'' Sehorn said standing outside the  
Giants locker room. ``I am tired of watching football. I'd much 
rather play the game. In my eyes, if I am ready to go, I want to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is still some question whether Sehorn is ready. After  
missing all of last season with a knee injury, he pulled his 
hamstring a week before training camp opened and did not get back 
on the field until Friday, two days before the Giants' 
season-opening 17-13 win over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn ran -- if you can call it that -- a couple of plays with  
the Giants' scout team on Wednesday, but it wasn't much more than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	And just to make sure it wasn't much more than that, Fassel had  
a trainer watch him every moment just to make sure he didn't do too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	While he said he felt fine running, Sehorn admitted he still  
felt something in his hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to run full speed,'' he said. ``Someone has to test me  
in practice. That's not the same as game speed. It's running around 
but it's not the same. Once the game begins and I have a chance to 
run, we'll know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel has not pushed Sehorn to get back on the field, so it  
seems to be a stretch to think the coach would let him play this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor weighing against a return would be the play of  
the defense last week. It limited the Buccaneers to 254 total 
yards. The secondary also picked off four Trent Dilfer passes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Washington gained 504 yards in total offense  
in a 41-35 overtime loss to Dallas. Quarterback Brad Johnson 
completed 20 of 33 passes for 382 yards and two touchdowns. Michael 
Westbrook had five receptions for 159 yards and two TDs, while 
fellow receiver Albert Connell had four catches for 137 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his knee injury, Sehorn was one of the top cover corners  
in the league, capable of taking any receiver out of a game. 
</P>
<P>
	In his own mind, Sehorn rated his chances of playing at 75-25 in  
favor. He said that translates to 50-50 for the coaching staff, 
which is precisely the way the Giants listed him on their injury 
report Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll play,'' Sehorn said. ``I have a little  
persuasiveness to me. I'm not returning kickoff. I don't have that 
much persuasiveness to me. I think if I am healthy enough to play, 
they will let me play. I can convince him, I have to be honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn, who injured his knee last year experimenting on a  
kickoff return, said that at no point has he asked Fassel to play 
yet, saying he has not felt right. 
</P>
<P>
	But if he does this weekend, it will be because he feels ready  
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a player tells you he can play, you go OK,'' Sehorn said.  
``You have to take his word for it.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Are Lett-Less for 8 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- When the Dallas Cowboys put together their  
defensive depth chart in April, it looked pretty good. Midway 
through September, it's a mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Scratch out starting strongside linebacker Quentin Coryatt, who  
decided Tuesday he won't play this season. Nagging injuries likely 
have forced the No. 2 overall pick of the 1992 draft into 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Put a thin line through defensive tackle Leon Lett, who made the  
Pro Bowl last year. Lett was suspended June 4 for his fifth 
violation of the league's substance abuse policy and learned 
Tuesday he'll have to miss the first eight games. He can return for 
the Nov. 14 home game against Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Circle cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith and put  
question marks next to their names. Sanders is recovering from a 
severely sprained left big toe and Smith has a bad back. When 
either will return is a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coryatt news was a bit surprising, but not totally  
unexpected considering he hadn't worn pads since early in training 
camp. Among his aches and pains were a reconstructed shoulder and a 
strained Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had several candid discussions over the last several  
weeks,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ``We really wanted him to 
get comfortable in his mind with where he was with his injuries. He 
arrived at the decision that he will not be playing this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas had been playing a waiting game with the NFL regarding  
Lett. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue had told Jones he'd set the 
suspension by the opener, but took an extra week. 
</P>
<P>
	The length of Lett's previous suspensions were set by the  
league's substance abuse policy. This one was at the commissioner's 
discretion and could have been a lifetime ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was hoping for a four-game punishment, the same Tagliabue  
gave the previous five-time offender, but he ended up doubling that 
in what will likely be a precedent-setting decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commissioner was looking for a long-term way to handle  
these types of circumstances,'' Jones said. ``I think that's what 
caused the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was looking to potentially establish a standard that would  
publicly point out the seriousness and importance the league is 
placing in this area of substance abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue told Jones this suspension was half as long as Lett's  
previous penalty partly because he's cooperated with the after-care 
program. He'd been tested up 10 times a month for the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leon was rewarded for some of the things he has been doing,''  
Jones said. ``His genuine participation in the program, his 
continued improvement, earned him the right to get to play this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders practiced last week in hopes of playing in the  
season-opener Sunday in Washington. Instead, he watched from the 
sidelines as the Redskins passed for 382 yards. Dallas' offense 
bailed out the defense with a miraculous comeback for a 41-35 
overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders may try to return Monday night against the Atlanta  
Falcons -- a prime time game against his former team, who also are 
the reigning NFC champions. But with the Cowboys having a bye the 
following weekend, there's a good chance he won't return until an 
Oct. 3 home game against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to see himself do more in practice and on the field  
before the game,'' coach Chan Gailey said. ``When he goes in, he 
wants to play at 100 percent, not 60 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's status is still being resolved. Recovering from a disc  
injury without surgery is tricky.

<HEADLINE> Injury Ends Big Unit's Record Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A sore shoulder, combined with Arizona's  
comfortable lead in the NL West, has spoiled Randy Johnson's 
longshot chance to break Nolan Ryan's record for most strikeouts in 
a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who has pitched more innings than any other hurler in  
baseball this year, sat out his scheduled start Wednesday night and 
won't pitch again until Saturday against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	That means he will have only three more starts this season. He  
needs 49 strikeouts to break Ryan's 26-year-old record of 383. 
That's just over 16 strikeouts a game, a rate that seems beyond 
even the considerable reach of the 6-foot-10 left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	The soreness isn't serious, and Johnson said trainers and  
doctors told him he could have pitched without a significant risk. 
But manager Buck Showalter decided he'd rather be cautious because 
Johnson probably will be counted on for two starts in the first 
round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Buck that I felt I was capable of going out and  
throwing a quality game, but a few more extra days won't hurt 
either,'' Johnson said. ``I'm probably doing myself a favor and the 
team a favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has insisted all along that the strikeout record is not  
a big deal to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I struck out a dozen more people this year but I won the  
last four starts of the year, that's going to make me happy,'' he 
said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Probably no statistic in baseball this season is more misleading  
than Johnson's 15-9 record. In seven of those losses, his teammates 
failed to provide him with more than two runs, including an 
incredible stretch when the Diamondbacks were shut out in four of 
his starts in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	In those four shutouts, Johnson had an earned-run average of  
1.41. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's numbers you don't see,'' Johnson said, ``like a  
stretch where I had 14 consecutive starts where I gave up two or 
less runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing close to that had happened to Johnson before.  
</P>
<P>
	``In 35 starts, I may have pitched 14 quality starts like that,  
but not consecutive starts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is the runaway leader in the majors with 335 strikeouts,  
surpassing his career high of 329 set last year with Seattle and 
Houston. He also leads both leagues in innings pitched at 249 2-3, 
and complete games with 11. He leads the National League with a 
2.52 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows that victories are what's important, which is why  
he must have been so frustrated during the stretch when his team 
wasn't scoring runs for him. But he never criticized his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is based on winning, not strikeouts, not ERA, because  
ERAs are so inflated now they aren't even really talked about 
anymore,'' Johnson said. ``But wins are, and wins are how I'm 
evaluated at the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson signed a four-year, $52.4 million contract with  
Arizona in the offseason, there were raised eyebrows around the 
league. He was 35 at the time. He's since turned 36, and many felt 
he was past his prime. 
</P>
<P>
	But his slider has been as wicked as ever this year, his  
fastball still tops 100 mph in the ninth inning, and he is just 5 
2-3 innings short of his career high of 255 1-3 innings pitched. 
His control has never been better. In 32 starts, he is averaging 
just over 11 strikeouts a game. He has walked just 66, or just over 
two per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have more control of my pitches now,'' Johnson said. ``I  
know how to set up hitters now. That comes from maturity, watching 
the game, studying the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter has found Johnson to be even more impressive than  
advertised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his command is the thing that continues to impress me,  
and his stamina,'' Showalter said. ``Sometimes we don't realize how 
tough it is to do the things that he's doing. You try not to take 
things for granted or assume anything, but he just continues to do 
it outing after outing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And every fifth day, Arizona's players have known the intensity  
level would be raised a notch as Johnson sits in his locker, facing 
the wall, before taking the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going over the hitters. I'm visualizing. I almost put  
myself in a trance,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The day the Big Unit pitches is unlike any other.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain what it is,'' said Damian Miller, who has  
caught all but four of Johnson's starts, ``but every fifth day it 
seems like the world stops.''

<HEADLINE> Floyd Spurs Tax Deadline Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxpayers affected by Hurricane Floyd who had  
estimated tax payments due Wednesday have gotten a 15-day extension 
from the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS said affected taxpayers with corporate, partnership or  
fiduciary returns that were due Wednesday also can file by Sept. 30 
without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS cannot extend deadlines for employment or excise tax  
deposits, but will cancel penalties on deposits required from 
Tuesday to Sept. 22 if those deposits are made by Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS said it also would suspend some enforcement activities,  
such as audits, levies and seizures, until Oct. 15 for taxpayers in 
federal disaster areas designated by President Clinton. Taxpayers 
in such areas -- Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South 
Carolina, as of Wednesday -- may claim uninsured casualty losses on 
either amended 1998 tax returns on their 1999 forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers seeking such relief should put ``Hurricane Floyd'' at  
the top of their returns.

<HEADLINE> Computers Used To Forecast Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- All indications from the high-tech ocean buoys, the  
satellite images and the $45 million storm plane were that 
Hurricane Floyd would just brush the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's pretty much what happened.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the computer models were so consistent about the turn  
to the north that forecasters at the National Hurricane Center came 
close to declaring that Floyd would miss Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they played it safe. While maintaining the storm would  
head north before rolling ashore, the forecasters warned residents 
all along Florida's east coast to gather supplies, protect their 
homes and head to higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it turns out, the hurricane moved pretty much as expected  
along the forecasted track,'' hurricane specialist Ed Rappaport 
said Wednesday. ``But if we had been off by 50 miles or so, if it 
had been 50 miles farther to the west, there would've been a direct 
impact on Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Improvements in technology, combined with a wealth of past  
experience, have helped forecasters predict storm tracks with 
greater accuracy over the past few decades. 
</P>
<P>
	A generation ago, the three-day forecast was off by somewhere  
between 400 and 450 miles. That's now down to 200 to 250 miles, 
Rappaport said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the forecasters are slow to congratulate themselves.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're almost afraid of people thinking we're better than we  
are because then they don't allow for error,'' said Jerry Jarrell, 
director of the National Hurricane Center. ``And forecasts are just 
forecasts. They're not the gospel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not yet.  
</P>
<P>
	Computers that line two rooms inside the hurricane center in  
Miami are used by forecasters who must decide the most likely route 
a storm will take. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of readings of wind, air pressure, humidity, light,  
cloud cover and other variable are collected from around the world 
and put into computer models, based in Princeton, N.J., Washington 
and Britain. Forecasters then study those models to plot a 
hurricane's path. 
</P>
<P>
	A critical ingredient is past experience. Computer models that  
are found to be accurate are used again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The premise that we use is that the future is going to behave  
like the past,'' said hurricane center meteorologist Todd 
Kimberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	A big reason for increased accuracy in the past three years is  
the information gathered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's high-altitude jet, dubbed ``Gonzo'' after the 
Muppet character. Gonzo flies miles above the storm and drops 
hundreds of small, information-gathering capsules into the storm, 
then relays the data back to forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that information that really helped forecasters predict  
with confidence Floyd would turn to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the data went into the models and they kept telling us,  
`Floyd is going to turn and soon,''' Kimberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft makes more frequent flights, which means more  
accurate forecasts and better ways of predicting whether residents 
should pack up and head out. 
</P>
<P>
	But forecasters say there's no time in sight when humans won't  
be needed to make the call. 
</P>
<P>
	``Computer models and simulations have improved, but for the  
last four or five years the average error of the hurricane center 
forecast has been smaller than error for any of the computer 
models,'' Rappaport said. ``Which indicates that the experience and 
talent of the hurricane forecasters is critical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency officials rely on forecasters in deciding when to  
order evacuations and when to say it is safe to return home. 
Forecasters must keep in mind that about $1 million a day in 
revenue is lost for every mile of coastline that is forced to 
evacuate. They also have to keep in mind the risks of deciding 
against an evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a really awful position to be in,'' Kimberlain said.  
``You don't want to come back after the fact of people dying and 
say, `I wish we had done that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of Floyd, the storm's tremendous size and strength  
posed a forecasting challenge. Small storms often are steered by 
the winds in their area, but storms as big as Floyd can actually 
change their environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell said forecasters are slow to congratulate themselves on  
an accurate forecast because some storms are just easier than 
others. Dennis, for example, made a bizarre loop off the coast of 
North Carolina last month that forecasters had a bit of trouble 
predicting. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd and the upcoming Gert, however, both appear to be pretty  
straight-forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we're getting good because the storms have been easier  
and the seasons have been easier than the skill increasing,'' 
Jarrell said.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Skirts Fla., Targets Carolinas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COCOA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Monstrous Hurricane Floyd moved closer  
toward the Southeast today, sending wind-whipped rain through 
Florida's deserted streets and leaving coastal residents from 
Georgia to Virginia bracing for a more severe thrashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's eye was expected to continue to swirl over the Atlantic  
before making landfall Thursday near Wilmington, N.C. In a weakened 
form, it could then make life miserable for residents all the way 
up to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm packed 135 mph wind this morning, making in a weak  
Category 4 storm. It stayed far enough off the coast to spare 
Florida from the worst. But tropical storm-force wind up to 73 mph 
raked the state's eastern coast. Rain fell along the coast from 
Florida to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've been spared in Florida may just be transplanted to  
the Carolina coast,'' said Jeremy Pennington, a National Hurricane 
Center forecaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we are breathing a bit of a sigh of relief, although  
it's still a major storm,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said this morning on 
NBC's ``Today.'' ``We're encouraging people to watch carefully 
before they go back home. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT, the storm's center was about 190 miles  
east-southeast of Jacksonville. Floyd was moving north-northwest 
near 14 mph, and a turn to the north and increase in speed was 
expected later today. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning remained in effect from Florida's Sebastian  
Inlet, near the midpoint of Florida's eastern coast, to the North 
Carolina-Virginia line. A hurricane watch continued from there to 
Chincoteague, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches in areas  
along Floyd's path. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of that is falling over water, but there is some  
rainfall over north Florida and the Carolinas,'' forecaster Jack 
Beven said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before daybreak, the streets of Daytona Beach were an  
abandoned, rain-washed grid. In Bunnell, 25 miles north, Flager 
County officials reported tides at 3 to 4 feet above normal, and up 
to 1,400 customers were without power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of squall lines coming through the last  
several hours,'' said Jon Fillinger, a county emergency management 
chief. ``We've got gusts, the kind you'd see in a strong 
thunderstorm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With its hurricane force wind extending 125 miles from the  
center and tropical storm force wind up to 290 miles outward, Floyd 
looked to spare few North Carolina cities from its fury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope and pray for the best,'' North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt  
said. ``But this looks real mean.'' Just last week, parts of North 
Carolina's coast were swamped by Hurricane Dennis, and today, parts 
of the state's Outer Banks got their second evacuation order in as 
many weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was expected to move inland near the North Carolina-South  
Carolina line, not far from Wilmington, N.C., ``and then run inland 
along the coastline right on up through Maine,'' hurricane center 
forecaster Trisha Wallace said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The track would take Floyd over the parts of Virginia, the  
District of Columbia, the northern Chesapeake Bay, near 
Philadelphia, west of New York City, northwestern Connecticut, 
western Massachusetts, central New Hampshire, Maine and into 
Newfoundland, Canada, by Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd will still have 52 mph wind when it hits the Bangor,  
Maine, area, forecasters predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, nearly 2 million people were told to evacuate the  
Southeast seaboard as Floyd's path remained uncertain. Florida 
undertook what officials called its largest-ever peacetime 
evacuation, with tens of thousands of motorists making an epic, 
halting journey north and west. Georgia and South Carolina 
residents also streamed inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Mills, a 34-year-old Kennedy Space Center worker, became  
stuck in traffic, managing only 15 miles in 2 1/2 hours. He became so 
frustrated he simply turned around and returned to the Cape, where 
102 other workers had volunteered to stay behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``You made a mile every five to 10 minutes,'' he said. ``There  
were people going on the sides of the road. People were getting 
angry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney World closed early for the first time in its 28-year  
history, and other resorts also shut down. The Navy sent ships to 
ride out the storm at sea rather than risk damage in port, and 
military aircraft were flown inland to bases from Maine to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton cut short his trip to New Zealand and issued  
pre-emptive disaster declarations for Florida and Georgia to enable 
recovery efforts to begin as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Emergency Management Agency set up a staging area in  
Atlanta, stockpiling food, ice, water, cots, sleeping bags, 
blankets, generators, portable toilets, flashlights and plastic 
sheeting so that they could be delivered to hard-hit areas in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, hundreds of airline flights in and out of Florida and  
Georgia were canceled, and Amtrak suspended train service into and 
out of Miami, scrambling the plans of vacationers and business 
travelers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Garden City, west of Savannah, Ga., Michael Tarvin and his  
girlfriend, Robin Hill, took a break at a shopping center after 
sitting in bumper-to-bumper, three-lanes-wide traffic.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Hospital Prices by Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAK BLUFFS, Mass. (AP) -- Martha's Vineyard Hospital has  
increased its prices for emergency care to capitalize on the 
tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
	The price change, which was decided in late July, is raising  
eyebrows in the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine charging more if you break your leg on the  
golf course in July than if you're skiing in February,'' said 
Leslie Hawkins, president of Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar 
Harbor, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the American Hospital Association said they have  
never heard of seasonal pricing by a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul DellaRocco, interim administrator for Martha's Vineyard  
Hospital, said prices for emergency care and certain other services 
will be 10 percent higher than normal until Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is designed to improve the finances of the hospital,  
which emerged from bankruptcy protection last fall. Its resources 
are strained by an island population of 14,000 that swells to 
100,000 in the summer.

<HEADLINE> Colleagues Laud Recused Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- Friends and colleagues of Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Bill Johnston rushed to his defense following the 
prosecutor's removal from the Waco case. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a nice guy who never curses or engages in what I would  
call a vice. Because of that, it is easy to consider him naive or 
underestimate him,'' author Gary Lavergne said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is that he is as tough as anybody I have ever known,  
and he will only take so much -- from anybody,'' said Lavergne, who 
worked with Johnston while writing a book about executed killer 
Kenneth McDuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 40, appointed an assistant U.S. Attorney in 1987, is  
at the center of a controversy over how the federal government 
handled the 1993 siege and fire at the Branch Davidian compound at 
Waco and the ensuing investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days after he wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno  
raising questions about a possible Justice Department cover-up in 
the Waco standoff, he and his boss, U.S. Attorney James W. Blagg, 
were abruptly removed from the case, according to a court filing 
made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials said the federal prosecutors could be  
potential witnesses in the independent inquiry into the government 
siege and were removed to avoid the appearance of a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in his Waco office, Johnston told The Associated  
Press he isn't sure what to make of the move. ``I don't know how to 
characterize it. Nothing in this case surprises me,'' he said. 
``I'm trying not to be paranoid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston helped draft the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms search warrant that became the basis of the Feb. 28, 1993, 
raid and ensuing 51-day siege. He later helped convict nine 
Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	He made headlines after sending the Aug. 30 letter to Reno in  
which he warned that he had seen documents indicating that other 
Justice lawyers had known for years about pyrotechnic grenades 
being used during the standoff. The FBI has now admitted after six 
years of denials that incendiary devices were used, but continues 
to deny they started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston said he doesn't regret his stand against the Justice  
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did what I did based on the facts presented to me and what I  
thought I had to do,'' he said. ``In August, the department 
continued to deny there were any issues. ... I just had to do 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston is the son of career Dallas County prosecutor Wilson  
Johnston, who helped try Jack Ruby for shooting John F. Kennedy 
assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a McLennan County prosecutor in Waco and later worked  
as police adviser and in private practice. After police in Waco 
became frustrated by the slow pace of prosecutions, city officials 
pressured U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm for a local branch of the U.S. 
Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was tapped for the job. Locals say he was willing to  
take on crimes some federal prosecutors might have passed on. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he got in, he filed all these cases that had been thrown  
out of the DA's office and sent a bunch of people to the pen. His 
conviction ratio was something like 99.99 percent,'' said David 
Smith, a retired Waco city manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a fine man who has always stood for the right thing. It  
didn't matter who was doing the screaming. If he thinks he is 
right, he is going to stand up for it,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Greene Wins 100-Meter Race in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Maurice Greene, a triple-gold winner in the World  
Championships last month, won the men's 100 meters today at the 
12th annual Super Track and Field Meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The world-record holder finished in 10.35 seconds, edging fellow  
American Curtis Johnson, who was second in 10.40 seconds with 
China's Yin Hanzhao third in 10.56. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the only event Greene took part in the one-day meet at  
the end of the track season, geared more toward fun than 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough because of the wind,'' Greene said of the race held  
as a typhoon was approaching Tokyo and elsewhere in central Japan. 
``Without the wind, I believe I could have run a lot faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 track season was just great, he said. ``I am happy I  
had a very good year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his next goal, Greene said: ``My main focus is to win the  
Olympic gold. That comes first, not a record. Right now, I have a 
goal of 9.76 and the coach said I am capable of running faster but 
I take small steps at a time. The most important is to win the 
Olympic gold. That's something I haven't done and I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He holds the world record with a time of 9.79 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dream come true,'' he said on his status as the  
world's fastest runner. ``Now I can say I was a No. 1 once. Records 
are made to be broken and anything can happen in a 100-meter. I am 
thankful and try to be the best. I believe I am the best and as 
long as I keep believing in myself, I can improve myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said he's going home from Tokyo to rest, looking back on  
the good season, and visiting his grandmother in Kansas, who turns 
97 on Sept. 27th. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 100-meter hurdles, American Larry Wade edged world-record  
holder Colin Jackson with a time of 13.50 seconds. Jackson placed 
second in 13.55 seconds with Japan's Satoru Mizuno third in 13.95. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' Wade said. ``This is my first time in Japan.  
For me, to beat him makes me really feel good. I raced against him 
seven times and beat him four times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kazuhiko Yamazaki of Japan won the 400-meter hurdles in 48.98  
seconds, followed by Joey Woody who finished second in 49.16. His 
American compatriot Torrence Zellener was third in 49.21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was running against a headwind in the first half. It was a  
bad condition,'' Yamazaki said. ``I want to win in Sydney next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Kelly Suttle jumped 4.20 meters to win the women's pole  
vault. Japan's Masumi Ono was second with 4.00 meters and her 
fellow citizen Takayo Kondo placed third also with 4.00 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulgarian Petya Pendareva swept the 100- and 200-meter races.  
Pendareva took the 200 meters in 23.27, before winning the 100 
meters in 11.36 seconds.

<HEADLINE> Bill Adds Fetus Assault Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A violent attack that results in the injury or  
the death of a pregnant woman's fetus could mean an additional 
conviction and sentence for the attacker under legislation awaiting 
a vote in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee outvoted Democrats  
14-11 to approve the bill despite warnings from Democrats that it 
eventually could weaken Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court 
decision legalizing abortion. Eleven states already have similar 
laws, and this would be the first such law at the federal level. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law should recognize ``that an unborn child is not a  
nothing,'' committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said during 
committee debate. He called the fetus a ``tiny, living member of 
the human family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., author of the bill, said: ``Most  
Americans will support this because it puts people in jail who 
attack pregnant women and destroy or harm their child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats accused Republicans of being less concerned about  
violence against women than with sneaking into law a provision that 
would give more legal recognition to fetuses, and thus erode the 
right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very clever proposal on the part of the gentleman  
from South Carolina,'' said Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the 
committee's highest ranking Democrat. ``This bill is another 
transparent attempt to score points in the perennial abortion 
debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said the bill had nothing to do with abortion. The bill's  
language specifically prohibits its application to abortions, he 
said, and it would not permit a woman to be prosecuted for taking 
any action -- legal or illegal -- related to the unborn child, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would not apply in cases where a fetus is harmed in the  
course of medical treatment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about holding criminals accountable for their  
actions,'' Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tuesday's committee meeting, Graham said he hoped  
committee members would be moved by an attack on a pregnant woman 
in Arkansas. Under a new state law, an Arkansas man was charged 
with capital murder after he hired three men to beat his pregnant 
girlfriend to kill his unborn daughter. The woman survived the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Republicans voted down three amendments by Democrats  
who wanted to drop the words ``unborn child'' from the bill or 
alter the measure's language to avoid giving a fetus legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill before us -- let's be clear -- is another attempt to  
cut away at the rights of women to determine their own reproductive 
choices,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who authored one of the 
defeated amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion-rights groups agreed. ``This bill is a wolf in sheep's  
clothing,'' said Kathryn Engustian, legislative counsel for the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``If protecting a woman's right to continue her pregnancy were  
truly all that the bill sponsors hoped to achieve, we would be 
working side by side to ensure its passage,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department came out against the bill last week,  
saying it may be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials also said that if a police officer, not  
knowing that a female suspect was pregnant, used force against her 
and she later miscarried, ``the officer could be subject to 
mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole, even 
though the maximum sentence for such use of force on a non-pregnant 
woman would be 10 years.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Rise 0.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in August as  
gasoline and other energy products shot up for a second straight 
month. But elsewhere inflation remained a no-show with clothing 
prices down for a fourth straight month and airline fares 
retreating after a big jump in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today the August increase in its  
Consumer Price Index -- the most closely watched inflation gauge -- 
matched the 0.3 percent July advance. 
</P>
<P>
	In both months, energy was the big force pushing prices upward.  
For August, two-thirds of the total price increase was attributed 
to a 2.7 percent surge in energy costs. Food costs rose a much more 
modest 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of the volatile energy and food categories, prices were  
up just 0.1 percent in August. 
</P>
<P>
	This performance of the ``core'' rate of inflation was even  
better than economists' expectations and will provide ammunition 
for those arguing there is no need for the Federal Reserve to boost 
interest rates for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets rallied on the price figures with rising  
demand in inflation-sensitive bond market sending yields on 30-year 
Treasury bonds down to 6.08 percent this morning from 6.12 percent 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that  
inventories held by businesses on shelves and backlots rose by 0.3 
percent in July while business sales rose at an even faster 0.4 
percent clip. 
</P>
<P>
	That left the ratio of inventories to sales at a record low of  
1.34 months, meaning it would take that length of time to exhaust 
supplies at the current sales pace. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual  
rate of 2.6 percent, compared to a gain of just 1.6 percent for all 
of 1998. However, all of the increase reflects higher energy costs, 
which have rebounded this year after a steep plunge in 1998 that 
reflected slumping global demand in the wake of steep recessions in 
many nations hit by a global currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy costs have risen at a 15.4 percent annual rate through  
August this year after having fallen 8.8 percent for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve boosted short-term interest rates by  
one-half percentage point over the summer. Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan and other Fed officials expressed concerns about the need 
to slow the U.S. economy to a more sustainable pace so that the 
lowest unemployment rates in three decades don't trigger 
inflationary wage demands. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Fed critics have said the central bank is fighting a  
phantom foe with no signs that inflation is getting out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2.7 percent jump in energy costs was even bigger than July's  
2.1 percent increase. Gasoline prices advanced 5.6 percent last 
month and are up 25.1 percent at an annual rate so far this year. 
But even with the surge, pump prices remain 9.8 percent below their 
peak reached in November 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.2 percent rise in food prices in August matched the modest  
July increase. In August, prices fell for beef, pork and fresh 
fruits. Vegetable prices were up 2.2 percent even though tomato 
prices fell by 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing prices fell by 0.3 percent, the fourth consecutive  
drop, as discounts for clothing for men and boys offset increases 
for women and girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline fares fell by 2.7 percent in August after having posted  
a sharp 6.5 percent increase in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical care costs were up 0.4 percent in August and now stand  
3.4 percent higher than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Recreation costs, however, were unchanged for a third  
consecutive month as increases for cable television, athletic 
lessons and club memberships were offset by declines for toys, pet 
services and tickets for movies, theater and sporting events.

	N.C. Islands Evacuated for Floyd  
</P>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Thousands of people evacuated North  
Carolina's barrier islands today for the second time in two weeks 
as powerful Hurricane Floyd churned toward the state's coast, where 
it was expected to come ashore tomorrow. Wilmington, in the 
bullseye of the storm, was lashed with up to 8 inches of rain this 
morning from Floyd's outer rain bands. The heavy rainfall flooded 
streets, complicating efforts to get people off the area's barrier 
islands. This morning the hurricane's center was about 350 miles 
south of Wilmington. Florida was spared the worst of the Category 4 
hurricane, but near hurricane force winds arrived at Cape Canaveral 
early today.

	Hurricane Floyd Lashes Bahamas  
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Bahamians began to survey damage from  
Hurricane Floyd today after the powerful storm smashed cottages, 
pushed boats and barges ashore and flung trees onto highways 
yesterday. The Category 4 hurricane toppled power lines, ripped 
roofs off homes and flooded streets yesterday before heading toward 
the southeastern United States. Trees blocked the main highway 
linking the island's east and center. Several people were being 
treated for minor injuries. It was difficult to estimate the extent 
of the damage elsewhere because the hurricane knocked out phone 
lines to most of the populated islands.

the East Timorese hills waited today for planes to drop the first 
food since militiamen and Indonesian troops forced them from their 
homes. People scavenged for food wherever they could find it, and 
thousands of refugees who have fled the provincial capital, Dili, 
to escape rampaging militias were without adequate food and water. 
Some people reportedly were subsisting on roots and leaves. 
Although houses burned today and sporadic gunfire was heard this 
morning, Dili was relatively calm, with phone lines and electricity 
restored to much of the city.

deal that would create the nation's second biggest food company, 
The Wall Street Journal reported today. The proposed transaction, 
which may be a merger rather than an acquisition, would form a 
company with annual sales of nearly $15 billion. The merger would 
create the third largest food company in the world behind Europe's 
Nestle SA, with $52 billion in sales, and U.S.-based Kraft Foods,

uncertain whether he will be able to play Sunday against the Kansas 
City Chiefs because of an injured right wrist. Davis' wrist was 
bandaged when he arrived at Mile High Stadium yesterday. ``It was a

<HEADLINE> 3 Hospital Workers Die in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A hospital handyman who held a set of  
doors closed against a gunman was hailed by those he saved as a 
fallen hero, one of three killed in a shooting spree at West 
Anaheim Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting rampage began Tuesday morning when, police say,  
42-year-old Dung Trinh walked into the hospital and started firing. 
Authorities said Trinh was apparently angry at the hospital over 
the death of his mother at another hospital earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Ronald Robertson, 51, tried to close the doors on  
the gunman, who had already shot two other employees and was 
heading toward the hospital's lobby where dozens of people were 
milling about. 
</P>
<P>
	While shutting the doors, Robertson was shot in the chest. Then,  
according to witnesses, a wounded Robertson jumped on the gunman, 
trying to hold him back, and was shot twice more. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman was finally disarmed by employees.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to say God bless the man that did save our lives for  
trying to shut the doors so it wouldn't come out to the lobby,'' 
said Debbie Cooper, who was in the lobby with her children when the 
shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinh's 72-year-old mother, Mot Trinh, had been treated at West  
Anaheim Medical Center in June for an undisclosed illness. She was 
taken to Anaheim Memorial West Hospital early Tuesday and died 
about five hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	After her death, police Lt. Steven Walker said Trinh drove a few  
blocks to West Anaheim Medical Center, opened fire and killed the 
three people. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither police nor hospital officials would speculate why Trinh  
was angry at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the other victims as Marlene Mustaffa, 60, of  
Buena Park, a nurse's assistant, and Vincent Rosetti, 51, of Seal 
Beach, who ran the pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, who was director of environmental services and  
responsible for the hospital's housekeeping duties, had been with 
the hospital 10 years. He was married and had three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokeswoman Debra Culver said crisis intervention  
counseling was being offered to both patients and hospital 
staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all wonderful individuals,'' she said of those who  
died. ``I knew them and I, too, am feeling the loss.''

<HEADLINE> Detective Makes Ramsey Assault Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey appeared to have been repeatedly  
sexually assaulted prior to the night she was killed, the first 
detective on the scene said in an interview broadcast Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Boulder police detective Linda Arndt also said there were  
serious problems with the police investigation, including a failure 
to question the parents of the 6-year-old girl immediately after 
her body was found. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why a lot of things weren't done in this case,''  
she said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Arndt said the girl appeared to have been repeatedly  
sexually assaulted prior to the night of her death. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was seen was not a first-time injury,'' she said. ``Not  
all of her injuries appeared to be recent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder County Coroner John Meyer has said evidence of a sexual  
assault was inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Arndt, who resigned in March, has been criticized for her  
handling of the case, especially for sending the girl's father, 
John Ramsey, to look for evidence in the home. 
</P>
<P>
	She is suing former Boulder Police Chief Tom Koby and the city,  
claiming her free-speech rights were violated when police were 
ordered not to discuss the case. Police officials declined comment, 
citing Ms. Arndt's pending lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Arndt's interview aired on the first anniversary of a grand  
jury's work on the slaying. The 12 jurors, who last met May 25, 
have heard testimony from police officers, Ramsey friends and 
relatives, and technicians who examined thousands of pieces of 
forensic evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury's term expires Oct. 20, and prosecutors say a new grand  
jury probably will not be asked to continue the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Arndt arrived at the Ramsey home after JonBenet's mother,  
Patsy Ramsey, called police on Dec. 26, 1996, and reported 
discovering a ransom note for her missing daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	John Ramsey searched the house at Ms. Arndt's request and found  
his daughter's body in the basement. She had been beaten and 
strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said the Ramseys are under suspicion. The couple  
have repeatedly said they are innocent.

<HEADLINE> London Theater: Veteran Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Veteran stars, new plays and the British premiere  
of the Disney smash musical ``The Lion King'' are among the theater 
offerings on tap for London this fall, an attempt to reverse what 
many have seen as a sluggish year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a less-than-colorful summer,'' conceded Bill  
Kenwright, the West End producer of ``Blood Brothers'' and many 
other shows. ``I think the autumn's going to be fascinating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly will be busy.  
</P>
<P>
	Between now and Christmas, as many as 40 major openings will be  
competing for audiences. They range from highbrow, limited-run 
revivals (Tara Fitzgerald in Sophocles' ``Antigone,'' opening Oct. 
11 at the Old Vic) to the European debut of the Tony-winning ``Lion 
King,'' a $10 million behemoth that bows Oct. 19 at the Lyceum. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does feel like an incredible occasion,'' said Josette  
Bushell-Mingo, the Londoner who stars as the shaman Rafiki in the 
musical. Director Julie Taymor's 46-strong cast is entirely 
separate from the ensemble that opened to ecstatic reviews on 
Broadway nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	This version, Bushell-Mingo said, is for people who cannot go to  
New York or Tokyo, where the show also can be seen. ``Everyone is 
open to the fact that this is a new English ensemble,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many major London musicals -- the Broadway transfer of ``Fosse,''  
for example -- are waiting until 2000 to escape the shadow of ``The 
Lion King,'' which sold out long ago. But an array of other new 
plays and revivals are available. 
</P>
<P>
	The musicals that are braving concurrent debuts tend to be as  
modest as ``The Lion King'' is huge (``Spend, Spend, Spend,'' with 
one-time ``Blood Brothers'' star Barbara Dickson, opening Oct. 12 
at the Piccadilly) or retreads of time-tested warhorses (``The 
Pajama Game,'' with sets by American artist Frank Stella, opening 
Oct. 4 at the Victoria Palace). 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Ayckbourn, the prolific English playwright who turned 60  
this year, opens play No. 53 at the Lyric Theater on Oct. 13. Its 
name, like most Ayckbourn material, is ``Comic Potential.'' It 
pairs English actress Janie Dee with David Soul, who starred on TV 
in ``Starsky and Hutch'' and now lives in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about the nature of being human -- the nature of love, the  
nature of laughter,'' writer-director Ayckbourn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other veteran dramatists joining Ayckbourn on the West End this  
fall include Ronald Harwood, with ``Quartet,'' and Alan Bennett, 
with ``The Lady in the Van.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think one has to be avant-garde all the time or  
revolutionary,'' said Harwood, the 65-year-old author of the play 
and subsequent film ``The Dresser.'' ``One simply wants to write 
plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newly opened at the Albery, ``Quartet'' takes a comic yet rueful  
look at four retired opera singers living in an English old age 
home. Donald Sinden stands out as an indomitably randy baritone 
determined to bluff and bluster his way to the grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's play opens Dec. 7 at the Queen's. Its star is Maggie  
Smith, heading a cast of 12 in the role of the real-life woman who 
parked her van in Bennett's north London garden and lived in it for 
years until she died. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Mirren opens in late November at a theater to be  
confirmed, inheriting Uta Hagen's off-Broadway role as a legendary 
writer in American dramatist Donald Margulies' ``Collected 
Stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anne-Marie Duff completes the cast of two under the direction of  
Howard Davies, who had a Broadway smash this past season staging 
Kevin Spacey in ``The Iceman Cometh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zoe Wanamaker, a Broadway sensation in ``Electra,'' stars in a  
historical drama, ``Battle Royal,'' from English writer Nick 
Stafford. Opening Dec. 8 at the Royal National Theater's Lyttelton, 
the play also features Brendan Coyle, the tenderly observant 
bartender in the acclaimed Irish play ``The Weir'' by Conor 
McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson opens his next play in December at the Royal Court  
Theater in Sloane Square, which has been rebuilt at a cost of about 
$40 million. Entitled ``Dublin Carol,'' the play stars Brian Cox, 
an alumnus of McPherson's solo show, ``St. Nicholas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining ``Antigone'' as an eagerly awaited revival is a new  
staging of Sean O'Casey's Irish classic ``Juno and the Paycock,'' 
with film and TV actor Colm Meaney (``The Commitments,'' ``Star 
Trek: Deep Space Nine'') marking a rare return to the British 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The play doesn't need rewriting,'' said Meaney, the  
46-year-old Irishman whose home is Los Angeles, explaining his 
attraction to the project. Director John Crowley's revival opens a 
six-week run Sept. 20 at the studio-sized Donmar Warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't need fixing. It's sort of there,'' Meaney said,  
``so I thought, `Why not?'''

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Stewart Writes Own Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- They've changed just about everything in the  
Pittsburgh Steelers' offense -- the formations and the pass routes, 
the blocking assignments and the blitz protection, even the 
philosophy of the play calling. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest change of all might be in the quarterback, and not  
just because Kordell Stewart is no longer chained to the pocket, 
discouraged from taking off running or creating on the fly. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since Stewart became the Steelers' starter in  
1997, he can check off plays at the line of scrimmage. After being 
forced for two years to run only the plays called by offensive 
coordinators Chan Gailey and Ray Sherman, he is free to adjust the 
play to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if he does so to extreme.  
</P>
<P>
	Steelers coach Bill Cowher was encouraged by every aspect of  
Stewart's play in Sunday's 43-0 rout of Cleveland -- his running and 
throwing, his recognition of the defense and on-the-fly adjustments 
-- except for his frequent use of timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart used up all three of the Steelers' first half timeouts  
by the end of the first quarter as he attempted to alter plays at 
the line of scrimmage, only to run out of time on the play clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart says it won't happen again. Cowher jokes that it had  
better not, if only because the lack of timeouts left the Steelers 
unable to challenge any disputed calls. Under the NFL's new instant 
replay system, a team loses a timeout if a replayed call is upheld, 
so it must have a timeout left in order to challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news was that I could get rid of that thing you use  
to challenge plays. I didn't have to worry about it,'' Cowher said. 
``But you don't want to burn those timeouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer? Cowher and new offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride  
emphasized to Stewart that it is usually better to run the play 
that was called than to call a timeout that might be needed later 
in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the first time we've given Kordell a lot of  
leeway in trying to get in and out of calls,'' Cowher said. ``I 
liked what I saw. We just have to get out of the huddle faster, so 
he will have more time to get in and out of the play. We want to 
make sure we don't start utilizing those timeouts, particularly in 
the second half when they become very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That Stewart finally has the latitude that many NFL quarterbacks  
already possess underscores how committed the Steelers are to 
getting him back on his game. 
</P>
<P>
	The catalyst of an offense that was unpredictable and big  
play-driven in 1997, largely because of Stewart's ability to cross 
up defenses with his running, Stewart felt severely restricted in 
Sherman's offense a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, he ran for only two touchdowns, or nine fewer than  
in 1997. His passing yardage dropped from 3,020 yards to 2,560; his 
TD passes declined from 21 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Without any provocation from their opponents, the Steelers last  
year effectively eliminated the man known as Slash from their 
playbook. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was totally different last year,'' wide receiver Hines Ward  
said. ``If we had a play called, there was no way to adjust. If we 
had a play called and the defense wasn't right to run it, we still 
ran it.''

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh Zoo Has Hope for Elephant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Keepers at the Pittsburgh Zoo hope a 200-pound  
bundle of pachyderm joy beats the odds that run against African 
elephants born in zoos. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoo officials have announced that after 22 months of gestation  
and an hour and 15 minutes of labor, a 17-year-old captive-born 
elephant had given birth to a spry female calf late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	None of four African elephants born in captivity in North  
America since 1987 -- including a male calf stillborn to another 
mother at the Pittsburgh Zoo in 1998 -- lived more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	This time the calf and mother appear to be fine, but officials  
are keeping their fingers crossed, said Pittsburgh Zoo Director 
Barbara Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a girl, so she is important to the breeding  
population,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials will keep the cow and calf out of public view for a  
few days to give them time to bond, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will get her out on public display as soon as we have a  
comfort level with the mom and the baby doing well,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Dollar Hits 3-Year Low Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar plumbed a 3 1/2-year low against the  
Japanese yen for the second day in a row Wednesday as traders sold 
dollars in a continued reaction to strong U.S. trade deficit 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which dropped for the fourth straight day against  
the yen, was mixed against other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 104.23 yen in New York late Wednesday,  
down from 105.79 yen late Tuesday and its lowest closing level 
since Feb. 27, 1996. The dollar fell as low as 103.20 yen in Europe 
earlier in the day. Japanese markets were closed for a national 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the dollar bounced a little Wednesday after the  
Labor Department reported that the nation's consumer price index 
rose a moderate 0.3 percent in August. That was in line with Wall 
Street expectations and suggested that the Federal Reserve may not 
have to raise interest rates for a third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said  
the outlook for the U.S. economy remains promising, even though the 
dollar has continued to weaken in foreign-exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Holders of U.S. dollars got ``no encouragement from Larry  
Summers,'' said Ricardo Gomes, head of foreign exchange at Republic 
National Bank in New York. Many traders read Summers to mean that 
the United States was unlikely to intervene in the markets to prop 
up the dollar but rather will rely on the strong U.S. economy to 
keep its currency aloft, Gomes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had fallen Tuesday after the U.S. government posted a  
record current-account trade deficit of $80.7 billion in the second 
quarter of this year, including a $6.3 billion deficit with Japan 
for the month of June alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted late Wednesday at $1.0396, up from $1.0354  
Tuesday. The British pound was quoted at $1.6147, up from $1.6072. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,  
included 1.5434 Swiss francs, down from 1.5486; 1.4757 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4754. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth 1.8811 German marks, down from 1.8890; 
6.3091 French francs, down from 6.3182; 1.862.34 Italian lire, down 
from 1,865.03.

<HEADLINE> Housing Bill Gets Negative Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan bill designed to increase  
homeownership earned a negative appraisal Wednesday from the 
assistant housing secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	William Apgar, assistant secretary at the Department of Housing  
and Urban Development, said the bill's harmful provisions ``far 
outweigh the positive -- and for that reason, the administration 
cannot endorse this legislation at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apgar told the House Banking Committee's housing and community  
opportunity panel that the administration supports the measure's 
attempt to make home-buying easier by untangling the web of federal 
regulations that can drive up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	And he applauded a proposal for the sale of government-owned  
properties to teachers for half of the market price. HUD Secretary 
Andrew Cuomo recently announced such a program, and sales are to 
begin within weeks, Apgar said. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``possibly the worst'' aspect of the bill, he said, is a  
proposal that would require HUD to offer its vacant or sub-par 
properties to local governments or community-based development 
corporations at steep discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	That could cost the Federal Housing Administration -- the  
government corporation that insures mortgages -- more than $3 
billion, said Apgar, who is also FHA commissioner. The program is 
also unnecessary, he said, because HUD already sells the properties 
at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
	Apgar called for inclusion of a provision that would let local  
officials use certain housing grants to help uniformed city workers 
buy homes where they are employed, ensuring that scarce funds reach 
those who need them most. 
</P>
<P>
	The national homeownership rate reached a high of 66 percent  
last year, but Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., the bill's sponsor and 
housing subcommittee chairman, said the American dream of owning a 
home was still just a dream for too many. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bill provisions would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Let residents and public housing authorities use rental  
vouchers -- used to pay rents -- for a down payment on a house or for 
mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
	--Create uniform standards and construction codes to improve the  
quality, safety and affordability of manufactured homes, which are 
built in factories and shipped to retail locations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require a congressional study of the inspection process for FHA  
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1776.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Ethnic Diversity Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Every day, Honduran native Oneyda Rugg  
welcomes about a dozen newcomers, pointing them to jobs, schools, 
doctors, homes and social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past seven years at the Northwest Arkansas Multicultural  
Center in Springdale, she has been devoted to making immigrants -- 
particularly fellow Hispanics -- feel at home in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, it's working.  
</P>
<P>
	During this past decade, the Hispanic population has grown at a  
faster rate in Arkansas than any other state, according to U.S. 
Census Bureau figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Hispanics who come to Arkansas have stayed, despite the  
general dearth of other Spanish-speaking residents or of ethnic 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could consider that this is one of the very rare places  
where your children feel safe,'' Ms. Rugg said. ``It's healthy, 
it's green, it's beautiful, there are plenty of jobs. The cost of 
living is not as high as other parts of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, the Hispanic and Asian populations of the United  
States have surged during the 1990s, with the number of Hispanics 
growing by more than 35 percent and Asians more than 40 percent, 
the Census Bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Arkansas, the Hispanic population rose from 19,988 in the  
1990 census to 49,473 last year -- a 148 percent increase -- 
according to Census Bureau estimates released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arkansas is really at the forefront. However, we're not  
talking about a lot of people,'' said Sabine Henning, a demographer 
at the Institute for Economic Advancement at the University of 
Arkansas at Little Rock. ``The numbers are still relatively small, 
and I think we always have to keep that in mind, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the influx, Hispanics still comprise a little less than  
2 percent of the state's 2.5 million people -- up from just less 
than 1 percent in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, Hispanics comprise 40 percent of New Mexico's  
population. And the Hispanic population in California increased by 
2.4 million to 10.1 million people. California's total population 
is 32.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the Hispanic population alone in California was  
almost as large as Arkansas' current population, and the total 
population of Hispanics in California is more than four times 
Arkansas' entire population. 
</P>
<P>
	The national Hispanic population is expected to overtake the  
non-Hispanic black population to become the largest minority group 
by the end of 2004, said statistician Larry Sink. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hispanic growth in Arkansas has attracted plenty of  
attention from local residents. Not all of it has been encouraging 
-- particularly from those who resent employers hiring Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an absolute atrocity what the cheap labor  
advocates are doing to these people, they're just using them,'' 
said Scott Leachman, a general contractor and vice president of 
Americans for an Immigration Moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is based in northwestern Arkansas' Benton County,  
which has the state's fastest-growing Hispanic population -- up 221 
percent from 1990 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Sevier County in southwestern Arkansas, where nearly 10  
percent of the population is Hispanic -- the largest percentage in 
the state -- local officials say Hispanic immigrants have helped 
spur the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Them being here has boosted the economy. They shop here, they  
spend their dollars in the city, so the county gets tax money, the 
city gets tax money,'' said Fonda Hawthorne, director of the De 
Queen-Sevier County Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Population estimates show more males than females among  
Hispanics in Arkansas, the opposite of the rest of the population 
and an indication that male Hispanics are coming first to find work 
and then bringing their families, Ms. Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sevier County, for example, the Hispanic population is nearly  
68 percent male, while the rest of the population is 49 percent 
male, Ms. Henning said. The county's largest employer is a poultry 
plant, and many Hispanics work in the poultry business, Ms. 
Hawthorne said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Springdale-based Tyson Foods, the nation's largest poultry  
producer, about 20 percent of its 66,000 employees around the 
country are Hispanic, said spokesman Ed Nicholson. He said roughly 
the same percentage applies to Tyson's 24,000 employees in 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has not specifically recruited Hispanics, Nicholson said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once the word got out that there were these jobs available,  
word of mouth pretty much brought the newcomers in,'' Nicholson 
said. ``We're grateful that those jobs have been filled.''

<HEADLINE> Patagonia Founder Steps Down As CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- The founder of the company that makes  
Patagonia outdoor clothing, famed alpinist Yvon Chouinard, is 
stepping down as chief executive officer to spend more time 
pursuing his two passions: surfing and mountain climbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Chouinard is stepping aside ``to do more of the things he likes  
to do outdoors,'' company spokeswoman Lu Setnicka said Wednesday. 
Chouinard, 60, will still own Patagonia's parent company, the Lost 
Arrow Corp. based in Ventura, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always managed this company as if it's going to be here  
for the next 100 years. It's time for me to step away from 
day-to-day operations and put people in place to ensure the 
company's continued success,'' Chouinard said in a statement to 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Crooke, most recently CEO at Pearl Izumi, a cycling and  
sports apparel company in Colorado, was named chief executive 
officer. He will move to Ventura in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Patagonia's mail order, retail, wholesale and  
international divisions sold $180 million worth of products. Lost 
Arrow also has subsidiaries Lotus Designs, manufacturer of paddling 
products, and Water Girl, a women's surf-oriented sportswear firm.

<HEADLINE> Frito-Lay Exec Leading Tropicana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- PepsiCo Inc. has named Brock Leach as the  
new president and chief executive officer of Tropicana Products 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach, 40, has spent the last 17 years at Frito-Lay -- another  
division of No. 2 soft-drink maker PepsiCo. He replaces Gary 
Rodkin, who was picked last week to head Pepsi-Cola North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach said his greatest challenge at Tropicana will be  
continuing the innovations begun by Rodkin and his team of 
managers. Tropicana is developing new products and versions of 
existing products through a $17 million technology and research 
center at the juice company's Bradenton headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, Leach was president of Frito-Lay Development Co.  
He helped Frito-Lay revamp Doritos Tortilla Chips, launch Baked 
Lay's and Baked Tostitos, and introduce the WOW! snack line made 
with the fat substitute Olean, and sold under the Lay's, Ruffles 
and Doritos names.

<HEADLINE> Web Panel Eyes Sales Tax Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Before a federal panel can decide whether  
Congress should permit state sales taxes on Internet commerce, it 
must determine whether there's any practical way to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to figure out if there is a workable solution,''  
said Gov. Mike Leavitt, R-Utah. ``We're not presupposing what 
should be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, while sharply  
divided on the cyberspace tax question, voted unanimously Wednesday 
to invite submission of detailed proposals on whether the multiple 
state systems can be modified to collect sales taxes from 
out-of-state Internet, catalog or telephone sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-member panel of congressionally appointed business and  
government representatives is to consider those plans at its 
December meeting in San Francisco. Its final recommendation on tax 
policy for the Internet is due to Congress by April. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt's proposal requires that the tax plans focus on  
simplifying the current system, imposing no new taxes, protecting 
taxpayer privacy and acknowledging states' rights, among other 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to figure out if we can make sales taxes work for the  
21st century,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	State and local officials told the commission Wednesday that  
without sales tax collections on Internet transactions, services 
ranging from schools to fire protection will eventually suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Local government and state government cannot operate on an  
empty tank,'' said Randy Johnson, Republican chairman of the 
Hennepin County, Minn., Board. 
</P>
<P>
	If Internet sales reach $100 billion by 2003, an estimated $4  
billion in sales tax would go uncollected because no system exists 
to do so, said Harley Duncan, director of the Federation of Tax 
Administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents, however, say a new tax would slow Internet commerce.  
They say the economic boom has left the 50 states with a combined 
$36 billion surplus in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a problem now and I don't believe it's going to be a  
problem in the future,'' said Dean Andal, a commission member and 
Republican chairman of the California Board of Equalization. ``If 
you look at state tax revenues now, it's boom time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales taxes are the single largest source of revenue for most  
states and local governments, amounting to $147 billion in 1997. 
But under a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision known as Quill, a 
state cannot collect taxes from companies operating outside its 
boundaries unless the company has some physical presence in that 
state, such as a store or warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that case involved mail-order sales, it has been  
interpreted to apply also to Internet transactions. Whether that 
decision should stand is perhaps the question facing the commission 
and ultimately Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Abolishing the Quill standards, say supporters, would protect  
state revenues and ensure that traditional ``brick and mortar'' 
merchants and Internet companies face the same tax-compliance 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would force creation of a simpler collection system --  
perhaps even a single national tax rate, or at least one per state. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress, however, has defeated multiple attempts to override  
the Quill ruling. Apart from worries about the cost of taxing 
Internet sales, some say it would invade privacy as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is simply too complex,'' said Jim Eads, a partner at the  
Ernst &AMP; Young accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also voted Wednesday to support the Clinton  
administration's position that international trade tariffs should 
not be permitted on electronic transactions.

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Evacuees Jam Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- More coastal residents fled inland  
today in the nation's biggest evacuation ever as Hurricane Floyd 
thrashed along the southern Atlantic coast, pounding beaches with 
heavy surf and ripping down tree limbs and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Myrtle Beach and Jacksonville, Fla., were virtual ghost towns  
today as people fled or stayed indoors. Traffic jams clogged 
highways around Wilmington, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2.6 million people had been urged to evacuate, said  
officials in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, and more people 
joined the exodus today in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the biggest evacuation in U.S. history, federal emergency  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A shelter in a Wilmington school took in about 110 evacuees in  
less than an hour after opening today. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk like this one is going to be pretty mean. It's got  
everybody shook up,'' said Terry Hurley, who went to the shelter 
with his wife and two young children. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Florida residents were without power, but that  
state escaped the worst as Floyd swung northward. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm weakened slightly today to a Category 3 hurricane,  
with sustained wind blowing at 125 mph instead of the peak of 
nearly 155 mph when it battered the Bahamas. The enormous storm 
spread rain along the coast from Florida to Connecticut, and heavy 
surf advisories were posted as far north as Massachusetts' Cape 
Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd is expected to make landfall about 5 to 6 a.m. Thursday  
between Myrtle Beach and Wilmington, S.C., said meteorologist Todd 
Kimberlain at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The storm was 
gaining energy from the warm water of the Gulf Stream but its wind 
was not likely to reach Category 4's 131 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	After making landfall, the storm's wind and pouring rain were  
expected to weaken but make life miserable all the way up the coast 
toward Canada's New Brunswick. 
</P>
<P>
	A citywide curfew was set for 3 p.m. today in Myrtle Beach.  
Violators would get a warning, then a ticket, and would be arrested 
if they still disobeyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need to be worrying about them and we don't need them  
out in the weather,'' spokesman Mark Kruea said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beaufort County, at South Carolina's southern tip, about 90  
percent of the nearly 120,000 residents had cleared out. ``It's 
like a tomb out here now,'' said Bud Boyne, the county's emergency 
operations center spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville, Fla., a city of 1 million, also looked deserted  
today with funnel clouds visible and dark clouds circling overhead. 
Surf crashed onto city streets in Jacksonville Beach and nearby 
Flagler County closed a seaside highway because of waves. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in North Carolina ordered evacuations for the barrier  
islands outside Wilmington and up the coast for the Outer Banks, 
the fragile islands that were battered by Hurricane Dennis last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic ground to a halt in massive jams on Interstate 40 and  
other highways leading inland from Wilmington, where heavy rain 
flooded streets. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado touched down in a rural area north of Wilmington today  
without causing damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Hurricane Fran caused about $6 billion in  
damage when it blew ashore at Wilmington and raced along Interstate 
40 into Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Floyd stayed off Florida's Atlantic coast during the  
night, parts of the state were raked by gusts to 76 mph at Cape 
Canaveral and 69 mph in Daytona Beach. Snapped tree limbs and power 
lines left more than 100,000 people without electricity today. A 
weather buoy more than 20 miles off Cape Canaveral measured a 
54-foot wave as Floyd's eye passed over during the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 350 miles northeast of Jacksonville, eight people abandoned  
a sinking tugboat today, but it was not clear if the weather was 
directly responsible for the ship taking on water. ``Floyd did not 
help the situation,'' said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer John 
Ware in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	No significant damage was reported at the Kennedy Space Center.  
The complex was deserted except for 102 volunteers who stayed to 
ride out Floyd, which NASA feared could destroy launch pads and the 
hangars where the space shuttles are kept. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, the storm's center was about 215 miles south of  
Myrtle Beach, S.C. Floyd was moving north-northwest near 14 mph, 
and a turn to the north and increase in forward speed was expected 
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning remained in effect from Titusville, Fla.,  
near Cape Canaveral at the midpoint of Florida's eastern coast, to 
the North Carolina-Virginia line. A hurricane watch continued from 
there to Chincoteague, Va., and a tropical storm watch was extended 
to the eastern tip of New York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's expected track would take its wind and rain across  
Virginia, the District of Columbia, Maryland and Delaware, eastern 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, the New York City area, and into 
Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and 
Canada's Maritime Provinces by Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd could still have 52 mph wind when it hits the Bangor,  
Maine, area, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the south side of New York's Long Island, authorities asked  
people to get off Fire Island by Thursday morning because high wind 
might halt ferry service. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights in and out of Florida and Georgia  
had been canceled, and all Amtrak service had been suspended south 
of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney World remained closed today after shutting down  
Tuesday for the first time in its 28-year history. But SeaWorld was 
reopening today and planned an evening ``Farewell to Floyd'' 
fireworks show.

<HEADLINE> Fans Fill Stadium for Drew Carey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A line snakes around Cleveland Browns Stadium  
as helicopters buzz overhead. Bored fans, dressed in their favorite 
orange-and-brown apparel, toss footballs and read the newspaper as 
they wait to get inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly there is a break in the monotony.  
</P>
<P>
	``There he is!'' screams an excited fan. People dart out of line  
for a glimpse of their hometown hero. The crowd starts chanting his 
name: ``Drew, Drew, Drew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who has the crowds cheering?  
</P>
<P>
	It isn't a sports superstar.  
</P>
<P>
	The fans have turned out for Drew Carey, star of ABC's top-rated  
``The Drew Carey Show.'' Carey is a Cleveland native and a big 
sports fan. 
</P>
<P>
	On the last weekend in August, a crowd estimated at 10,000  
showed up at the stadium to be unpaid extras for the show. Scenes 
were shot for a Sept. 29 episode that focuses on the return of 
Carey's beloved Cleveland Browns to the National Football League 
after a three-season absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a humble experience,'' Carey said. ``Every time I  
come here, all this response, it totally overwhelms me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local businesses donated truckloads of water and thousands of  
sandwiches, doughnuts and oranges to feed the extras, who played 
Browns fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in L.A. love the show, but they don't show up with  
trucks of stuff,'' said Kim Thorpe, who was in charge of food and 
drink for the show. When she arrived at 5:45 a.m., she was amazed 
to find 200 people waiting to get into the stadium. The doors 
wouldn't be opened for another two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unusual to have so many people show up to do a TV show,''  
said Tina Kerry, who was in charge of casting the extras. She 
received more than 10,000 photos of Cleveland residents who hoped 
for a bit part. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Parker, 46, of suburban Maple Heights, got a plum  
assignment. He was Carey's stand-in. ``It's been interesting 
meeting everybody and seeing how the show is made,'' said Parker, 
whose friends now call him ``Drew Bob.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Drew is just like he is on TV,'' Parker said. ``He's sort of  
like an ordinary guy.''

<HEADLINE>  Florida State QB Ready To Atone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A year ago after facing North Carolina  
State, Chris Weinke wondered if he had the right stuff to be a 
major college quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke, despite throwing a 74-yard touchdown pass on the first  
play of the game, was intercepted six times in Florida State's 24-7 
upset loss to the Wolfpack. 
</P>
<P>
	``After something like that, there is a tendency to lose your  
confidence,'' Weinke said this week as the top-ranked Seminoles 
prepared for No. 20 North Carolina State in a matchup of unbeaten 
Atlantic Coast Conference teams. ``In the back of my mind, I may 
have lost it (confidence) but I wasn't going to let anybody know 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke rebounded strongly, going the rest of his season without  
another interception. 
</P>
<P>
	He completed nearly 53 percent of his passes for 1,894 yards and  
16 touchdowns in the next six games -- all victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's one of the great lessons of competitive sports,''  
Bowden said. ``You're not down and out unless you just give up. It 
showed Chris' determination and intelligence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his own doubts, Weinke was hearing it from some  
of the school's more fanatical followers -- receiving 160 e-mails, 
mostly unfriendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden had been through similar tough  
times before with inexperienced quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the game, you wonder if he is going to be the answer or  
not,'' Bowden said about Weinke, who was making just his second 
start. ``But that really didn't last long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except for 1990 when he replaced Brad Johnson with Casey Weldon,  
Bowden has stuck with his season starter during the school's 
12-year string of 10-win seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches decided to stay with the 26-year-old Weinke, who  
postponed his football career for a half dozen years bouncing 
around minor league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's played pro baseball, he'd struck out a few times,''  
Bowden said. ``You're not down and out unless you give up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Weinke remembered more than just a few strikeouts during  
his six-year minor league career in the Toronto Blue Jays system. 
</P>
<P>
	``After failing so many times in baseball you learn how to deal  
with it,'' Weinke said. ``It wasn't the first time I had failed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden's options were inexperienced sophomore Marcus Outzen and  
freshman Jared Jones, who the coaches had hoped to redshirt at that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden also shouldered some of the blame for Florida State's  
self-destruction in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a tendency to panic,'' he said. ``We should have run  
the ball more at N.C. State last year, but it was me insisting we 
get down the field quickly and score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the worst was yet to come for the 6-5, 240-pound  
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Virginia on Nov. 7, Weinke suffered a herniated disc  
when he was tackled on the penultimate play of the first half in a 
45-14 Florida State victory. A four-hour surgery the next week kept 
him away from contact for the next nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	Outzen, meanwhile, stepped in and led the Seminoles to victories  
over Wake Forest and Florida and played in the national title game 
against Tennessee at the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he did not experience any contact until Florida State's  
opening game against Louisiana Tech, Weinke has started the season 
successfully. He's completed 59 percent of his passes for 504 yards 
and five touchdowns in two games.

<HEADLINE> 3 Hospital Workers Die in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- To those who know him, Dung Trinh was the  
picture of a doting son, a man who quit his job and moved in with 
his mother when she fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
	But when she died suddenly on Tuesday, police say Trinh's  
overwhelming grief turned to rage, propelling a shooting rampage at 
West Anaheim Medical Center that morning that left three hospital 
workers dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinh, 43, is being held for investigation of three counts of  
homicide in the deaths of Marlene Mustaffa, a 60-year-old nurse's 
assistant; 51-year-old Ronald Robertson, a maintenance worker; and 
Dr. Vincent Rosetti, a 51-year-old pharmacist.

	His 72-year-old mother, Mot Trinh, had been treated at the  
center in June for a broken hip and diabetes, neighbors said. She 
was taken to nearby Anaheim Memorial West Hospital early Tuesday, 
and died a short time later from diabetes complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after her death, police say Trinh drove a few blocks to  
the medical center. His target: staff on its second floor, which 
houses a critical care unit where his mother was treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do know that he believed that something they had done  
caused his mother's death,'' said Anaheim Police Sgt. Joe Vargas. 
He said it was unclear whether any of the victims had contact with 
Trinh's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Trinh also brandished the gun at patients and other  
hospital staff during the 10-minute ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas said investigators found at least 50 rounds of ammunition  
and a .38-caliber handgun -- in addition to the gun he was holding -- 
in a backpack Trinh was carrying through the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinh has no criminal record and the guns did not appear to be  
stolen, but police could not yet say if they were registered. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors and friends painted a portrait of Trinh as a son who  
would have done anything for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't want to get married because he wanted to take care  
of his mother,'' said Quang Dao, a neighbor. ``He did everything 
for her. When she died, he lost the person of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police and hospital officials declined to speculate why Trinh  
allegedly targeted the hospital or say whether he had made threats 
there. But neighbors said Mrs. Trinh's health failed in the months 
following her release from West Anaheim Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Marie Olvera said she often heard Mrs. Trinh crying out  
in pain at night. 
</P>
<P>
	```Please don't leave me,''' she recalled hearing Mrs. Trinh say  
in Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinh and his mother fled to the United States from Vietnam  
after the fall of Saigon in 1975, settling in California. They 
moved several times before arriving last year at a low-income 
apartment row house a few miles from Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say Trinh worked various jobs as a chef and a laborer,  
but seemed to put most of his effort into caring for his mother and 
cleaning the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Most thought it natural -- adult children often care for their  
elderly parents in the Vietnamese culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Dao and Ms. Olvera said Trinh was so persistent about the care  
his mother received that he screamed at the social workers and 
health care providers who often visited their home to either care 
for his mother or take her to a doctor's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	If the health care workers didn't arrive on time, he took her to  
the hospital himself.

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Evacuees Jam Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- More coastal residents fled inland  
today in the nation's biggest evacuation ever as Hurricane Floyd 
thrashed along the southern Atlantic coast, pounding beaches with 
heavy surf and ripping down tree limbs and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Myrtle Beach and Jacksonville, Fla., were virtual ghost towns  
today as people fled or stayed indoors. Traffic jams clogged 
highways around Wilmington, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2.6 million people had been urged to evacuate, said  
officials in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, and more people 
joined the exodus today in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the biggest evacuation in U.S. history, federal emergency  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A shelter in a Wilmington school took in about 110 evacuees in  
less than an hour after opening today. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk like this one is going to be pretty mean. It's got  
everybody shook up,'' said Terry Hurley, who went to the shelter 
with his wife and two young children. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Florida residents were without power, but that  
state escaped the worst as Floyd swung northward. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm weakened slightly today to a Category 3 hurricane,  
with sustained wind blowing at 125 mph instead of the peak of 
nearly 155 mph when it battered the Bahamas. The enormous storm 
spread rain along the coast from Florida to Connecticut, and heavy 
surf advisories were posted as far north as Massachusetts' Cape 
Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd is expected to make landfall about 5 to 6 a.m. Thursday  
between Myrtle Beach and Wilmington, S.C., said meteorologist Todd 
Kimberlain at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The storm was 
gaining energy from the warm water of the Gulf Stream but its wind 
was not likely to reach Category 4's 131 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	After making landfall, the storm's wind and pouring rain were  
expected to weaken but make life miserable all the way up the coast 
toward Canada's New Brunswick. 
</P>
<P>
	A citywide curfew was set for 3 p.m. today in Myrtle Beach.  
Violators would get a warning, then a ticket, and would be arrested 
if they still disobeyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need to be worrying about them and we don't need them  
out in the weather,'' spokesman Mark Kruea said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beaufort County, at South Carolina's southern tip, about 90  
percent of the nearly 120,000 residents had cleared out. ``It's 
like a tomb out here now,'' said Bud Boyne, the county's emergency 
operations center spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville, Fla., a city of 1 million, also looked deserted  
today with funnel clouds visible and dark clouds circling overhead. 
Surf crashed onto city streets in Jacksonville Beach and nearby 
Flagler County closed a seaside highway because of waves. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in North Carolina ordered evacuations for the barrier  
islands outside Wilmington and up the coast for the Outer Banks, 
the fragile islands that were battered by Hurricane Dennis last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic ground to a halt in massive jams on Interstate 40 and  
other highways leading inland from Wilmington, where heavy rain 
flooded streets. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado touched down in a rural area north of Wilmington today  
without causing damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Hurricane Fran caused about $6 billion in  
damage when it blew ashore at Wilmington and raced along Interstate 
40 into Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Floyd stayed off Florida's Atlantic coast during the  
night, parts of the state were raked by gusts to 76 mph at Cape 
Canaveral and 69 mph in Daytona Beach. Snapped tree limbs and power 
lines left more than 100,000 people without electricity today. A 
weather buoy more than 20 miles off Cape Canaveral measured a 
54-foot wave as Floyd's eye passed over during the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 350 miles northeast of Jacksonville, eight people abandoned  
a sinking tugboat today, but it was not clear if the weather was 
directly responsible for the ship taking on water. ``Floyd did not 
help the situation,'' said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer John 
Ware in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	No significant damage was reported at the Kennedy Space Center.  
The complex was deserted except for 102 volunteers who stayed to 
ride out Floyd, which NASA feared could destroy launch pads and the 
hangars where the space shuttles are kept. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, the storm's center was about 215 miles south of  
Myrtle Beach, S.C. Floyd was moving north-northwest near 14 mph, 
and a turn to the north and increase in forward speed was expected 
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning remained in effect from Titusville, Fla.,  
near Cape Canaveral at the midpoint of Florida's eastern coast, to 
the North Carolina-Virginia line. A hurricane watch continued from 
there to Chincoteague, Va., and a tropical storm watch was extended 
to the eastern tip of New York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's expected track would take its wind and rain across  
Virginia, the District of Columbia, Maryland and Delaware, eastern 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, the New York City area, and into 
Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and 
Canada's Maritime Provinces by Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd could still have 52 mph wind when it hits the Bangor,  
Maine, area, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the south side of New York's Long Island, authorities asked  
people to get off Fire Island by Thursday morning because high wind 
might halt ferry service. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of airline flights in and out of Florida and Georgia  
had been canceled, and all Amtrak service had been suspended south 
of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney World remained closed today after shutting down  
Tuesday for the first time in its 28-year history. But SeaWorld was 
reopening today and planned an evening ``Farewell to Floyd'' 
fireworks show.

<HEADLINE> Motorola To Buy General Instrument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Motorola Inc. is buying General Instrument Corp.  
for $10.66 billion in stock, uniting two technologies that may 
speed sweeping changes in home entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola, best known for making cellular phones and pagers, is  
making a bold push into the future of cable television, which will 
include a variety of ``broadband'' applications, including Internet 
access, high-definition television and telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
	General Instrument dominates the market for cable TV set-top  
boxes -- one of the key ingredients for delivering broadband 
services to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most significant moves our company has ever  
made,'' said Edward D. Breen, chairman and chief executive officer 
of General Instrument, who will head Motorola's new broadband 
division under the deal announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	General Instrument controls 72 percent of the North American  
market for set-top boxes, according to Allied Business Intelligence 
Inc., a technology research company. Allied estimates the number of 
set-top boxes in North American homes is expected to skyrocket from 
about 20 million today to 113 million over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strongest demand is expected to come from overseas  
markets and ``will be the key to our growth and our business,'' 
Breen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's deal will likely be the first of many in the  
communication equipment industry. Companies like Scientific-Atlanta 
Inc., Lucent Technologies Inc., and Nortel Networks Corp. may be 
looking for partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend reflects the merger frenzy among the cable and  
television operators. Companies like AT&AMP;T Corp., which is now the 
largest cable as well as the biggest long-distance telephone 
company, can put pressure on equipment suppliers to cut prices or 
offer more products. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Hindery, head of AT&AMP;T's Broadband and Internet Services,  
even had a hand in bringing about Motorola's acquisition of General 
Instrument. AT&AMP;T owns 20 percent of General Instrument. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave some input how the combined company might be more  
powerful together than standing apart,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the deal holds promise for consumers, some investors  
and analysts had concerns about the terms of the deal. General 
Instrument shareholders will get about $49.81 in Motorola stock, 
that is 0.575 of a share, for each share of General Instrument they 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had the capability to hold out for a better price,'' said  
Anton Wahlman, an analyst for Warburg Dillon Read. ``I thought the 
price would have been somewhere in the low $60s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Instrument's Breen defended the price, saying it still  
offered investors a premium to the stock price just a few weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, General Instrument's shares fell 6.4 percent, or by $3.22  
21/32 to $47.27 11/32 on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
Motorola ended off 7 percent, or by $6.56 1/4 at $86.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will have more products to sell at cheaper  
prices with a wider marketing reach. And using the Motorola brand 
name, the new technology could quickly earn consumers' trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadband programs and services will not only be available for  
televisions, but also for wireless phones, hand-held computers, 
video games and other devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key thing is this is going to be an appliance that  
provides an ability to access broadband information from any 
place,'' said Ragu Gurumurthy, a principal with the consulting firm 
Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton. ``Motorola can create different types of 
devices people can carry with them to access broadband services 
from the train, beach or hotel. You don't have to ever be tethered 
to anything.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Owners: No Vote on Expos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Baseball owners will not vote this week  
on the proposed sale of the Montreal Expos, team president Claude 
Brochu said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposed deals for the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals and  
Oakland Athletics remain on the agenda, with the Reds' sale likely 
to pass, according to a senior baseball official speaking on the 
condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether transactions involving the Royals and  
Athletics would be approved or put off, the official said before 
the start of today's ownership committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal's situation is tied to a new ballpark. While New York  
art dealer Jeffrey Loria heads a group that wants to buy the team 
from Brochu's group, baseball will not bring the deal to a vote 
until stadium financing is in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything has to be signed, sealed and delivered,'' Brochu  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While a group in northern Virginia has been interested in buying  
the Expos, baseball commissioner Bud Selig has said his first 
choice is to keep the team in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The current plan is for the government to help finance a  
ballpark by using about $5.3 million a year in tourism funds for 
20-30 years to back a $67 million bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
	While owners originally intended to meet for two days, there was  
a chance they would end tonight, because of concerns about getting 
home with Hurricane Floyd heading north. 
</P>
<P>
	The $67 million sale of a controlling interest in the Reds from  
Marge Schott to three of the team's limited partners headed the 
list of deals for owners to consider. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindner, who owns the Great American Insurance Co., will  
take over as the controlling owner from Schott, who repeatedly has 
infuriated baseball with inflammatory statements about minorities 
and women. The deal, in which 36.7 percent of the Reds' shares 
would be sold, values the franchise at $181.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	George Strike and William Reik, two of the Reds' current limited  
partners, are helping fund Lindner's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Save Mart Foods chairman Bob Piccinini is the lead investor in a  
group reached a $122.4 million agreement in May to purchase the 
Athletics from Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann for $122.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Piccinini's group, put together by former A's executive Andy  
Dolich, includes Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, must close on the 
deal by the end of the season or it expires. Oakland Mayor Jerry 
Brown has lobbied Selig and even considered coming to Cooperstown 
but decided against it, Brown spokeswoman Stacey Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his meeting with the ownership committee, Piccinini  
emphasized his group's attributes, not the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball, I don't think, reacts very positively to threats,''  
Piccinini said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York investor Miles Prentice agreed Nov. 13 to buy the  
Royals for $75 million from a trust that acquired the franchise 
following the death of founder Ewing Kauffman in 1993. But some 
baseball officials are concerned Prentice's group doesn't have 
enough money to operate the team successfully and some are worried 
his group, which has more 40 investors, is too large. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners are expected to vote on a restructuring plan that would  
reduce the American and National league presidents to figureheads 
by shifting control of umpires, player discipline and scheduling to 
the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman, angry with the change, intends to  
resign after the World Series, several high-ranking baseball 
officials said last week and an announcement could be made at the 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The intentions of AL president Gene Budig, who has been a less  
forceful presence than Coleman, are not known. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, baseball officials told the players' association  
they will examine the idea of a World Cup more closely in the next 
two months before deciding whether to go ahead with a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know more in about six weeks,'' union head Donald Fehr  
said after the annual meeting of the international committee 
established by players and owners in their 1996 labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials have talked for a decade about a World Cup, a  
tournament with major leaguers who would play for national teams 
from the United States, Japan and other countries. Fehr said 
discussions had not yet progressed to the point where the sides had 
even begun to think about when to start the event or even a format. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball plans to increase its international presence by  
starting the 2000 season in Tokyo with two games between the 
Chicago Cubs and New York Mets on March 29-30. They would be the 
first regular season games played outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
	After having the Baltimore Orioles play an exhibition game in  
Cuba in March, the first by a major league team in 40 years, 
baseball opened outside the United States and Canada for the first 
time when San Diego played Colorado in April at Monterrey, Mexico. 
The Padres and Mets played a three-game series in Monterrey in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials are discussing a more widespread program of  
exhibition games in the Caribbean next spring, but it's too early 
to determine if there will be a return trip to Cuba, according to 
one official familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition 
he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners' meeting, the first since January, are dominated by  
franchise sales and a restructuring plan.

<HEADLINE> GOP Considers Delaying Tax Credits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House Republican proposal to slow the  
payment of tax credits to millions of low-income Americans to help 
finance big spending bills seems unlikely to survive in Congress, 
and is certain to be opposed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the plan illustrates the lengths to which congressional  
Republicans are going to find savings so they can say they are not 
using Social Security surpluses for spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are going to be any number of proposals'' to finance the  
bills, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Tuesday, 
adding, ``We've sort of bumped into a wall'' by pledging not to 
spend Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the House GOP idea, rather than getting their  
earned-income tax benefits in a lump sum after they file -- as most 
of the 20 million recipients currently do -- people receiving the 
payments would get them in quarterly or monthly installments. 
Republicans said the plan would merely spread out payments, not 
reduce them. 
</P>
<P>
	But many Republicans from both chambers -- particularly moderates  
-- objected to the idea, making it unlikely that GOP's thin 
majorities in the House and Senate would hold if the plan came to a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my perspective, I don't think you ought to play around  
with people's lives like that,'' said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,  
said he considered the idea ``dead on arrival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should ration things like'' the earned income  
credit, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials and congressional Democrats  
said the plan would unfairly take money from low-income American 
families to finance federal agencies' budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the poor would be hurt because many of them rely on  
the lump-sum payments to buy big-ticket items like used cars. The 
proposal would force many of them to rely instead on costly loans, 
Democrats said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is ``tantamount to a tax increase on working  
families,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the president will not let the Republicans dramatically  
cut taxes on the rich, they have decided to get back at Democrats 
in Washington by raising taxes on the hard-pressed working 
families,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., referring to 
Clinton's promised veto of the GOP's 10-year, $792 billion tax cut 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Congress has sent Clinton just two of the 13 annual  
spending bills for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. Their overall 
price tag is more than $500 billion, or nearly one-third of the 
overall federal budget, and Republicans need to find tens of 
billions in savings for bills that can pass Congress and get 
Clinton's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the measures, GOP leaders have already said they  
would use all $14 billion of the projected budget surplus excluding 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	An idea popular with Senate Republicans for coping with the  
spending problem is so-called forward funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Under this perennially used practice, money is approved that is  
mostly not available until the following fiscal year. That has the 
effect of pushing spending pressures from one year into the next. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's 2000 budget proposed $19 billion of such expenditures,  
and Republicans said there was $11.6 billion of such money in this 
year's budget. Stevens said Republicans would slightly exceed that 
amount for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders have also been hoping to reap savings by  
getting unspent money back from the states for welfare, Medicaid 
and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Governors have been reluctant to return the money, but might do  
so if Congress increases states' flexibility to use federal funds, 
said Clinton Keyes, executive director of the Republican Governors' 
Association. Keyes said some GOP governors planned to discuss the 
situation Thursday with congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Enacted in 1975 under President Ford, the earned income credit  
is designed to discourage low-income families from falling back 
onto welfare. Its benefits have been improved several times, and 
the program has been a frequent battleground between liberals 
trying to expand it and conservatives hoping to curtail it. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit averages $1,890 annually for families with children,  
and is expected to cost nearly $32 billion next year, according to 
Treasury Department figures. 
</P>
<P>
	John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., said the GOP proposal would save up to $8.7 billion in 
fiscal 2000.

<HEADLINE> Penn State Changing Offense Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Penn State needed long-ball passing to  
fool Arizona, whack Akron and sneak by Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Much as coach Joe Paterno would love to return to consistent,  
Big Ten-style, smashmouth football, the Nittany Lions again may end 
up using every last reverse, streak and screen in their arsenal on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	While this is a team that usually starts with the tailback, No.  
3 Penn State's rushing attack so far has been inconsistent, at 
best. 
</P>
<P>
	And next up is No. 8 Miami (2-0). The Hurricanes held Ohio State  
to 116 yards and have three linebackers certain to crowd the line 
of scrimmage. Their defensive backs, on the other hand, are largely 
untested, either by Ohio State's new quarterbacks or Division I-AA 
Florida A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have to throw the ball, we don't know,'' quarterback  
Kevin Thompson said. ``It's just a matter of how Miami plays us. If 
they put eight guys in the box, who knows? Maybe we can break one 
loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (3-0) has done that so far, but Paterno isn't one to  
rely on the big play. He was especially concerned after the Lions 
scraped together just 65 yards in a 20-17 victory over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we'll have to run the ball better than that at  
times during the year,'' Paterno said. ``I said prior to the Pitt 
game that was one of my concerns, that we had really fooled people 
with big plays and that one of these days we weren't going to be 
able to fool people. We were going to have to go in there and earn 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State has been known to throw from time to time -- despite  
its reputation as strictly a running team. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, the Lions became the first team to win a national title  
by piling up more passing yards than rushing yards. In 1994, Kerry 
Collins led Penn State to a 12-0 season by throwing for a 
school-record 2,679 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But both teams had great backs, too: In 1982, Curt Warner rushed  
for 5.3 yards every time he carried. Ki-Jana Carter ran for 1,539 
yards in 1994 at 7.8 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, sophomore Eric McCoo has been Paterno's go-to  
tailback more often than not, but he has only 103 yards on 28 
carries. Aaron Harris, Paterno's most experienced back, has 91 
yards on 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno does not blame his experienced offensive line, only his  
new offensive schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a lot of different sets, we're playing a lot of  
different people, we've tried to establish a little better passing 
game, a little bit more wide-open football game,'' Paterno said. 
``We have not played with two tight ends. We haven't done things 
we've done in other years to make sure we can run the football. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never get anything for nothing,'' he added. ``If you want  
to spread out a little bit, then you don't run the ball quite as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's especially true when teams crowd eight or nine players in  
the box for much of the game, as Pittsburgh did. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to have a successful running day when they do  
that,'' Mike Cerimele said. ``But we're going to have to work to 
get better because that's what we're going to see the rest of the 
year.''

	Heavy rain and thunderstorms from Hurricane Floyd pounded the  
East Coast Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind gusts to 40 mph and heavy rain hit parts of North Carolina,  
South Carolina, southeastern Georgia and northeastern Florida. The 
heaviest rainfall was in the Carolinas, where it fell at the rate 
of 1 to 2 inches per hour, making flooding a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere across the East, tropical moisture from Floyd  
interacted with a stationary front extending from Maine to Florida, 
causing a steady line of rain showers and thunderstorms from New 
England into the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain across the mid-Atlantic states and the northeastern United  
States was much lighter than the storms associated with Floyd in 
the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	To the west, a second stationary front produced rain showers and  
thunderstorms over parts of the central and southern Plains, from 
southern Kansas and Colorado southward into eastern New Mexico, 
western Texas and Oklahoma, and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	All other parts of the country had quiet weather due to a large  
area of high pressure from the Midwest to the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Clear to partly cloudy skies and dry weather were the rule  
across the Ohio, Tennessee, and Mississippi valleys. Clouds were 
thicker across parts of the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	To the west, areas in the northern Rockies had either clear or  
partly cloudy skies and dry conditions, while low clouds persisted 
along the immediate West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures around the nation ranged from 27 in West  
Yellowstone, Mont., to a midday high of 90 in Marathon, Fla. The 
highest heat index was 103 in Marathon, Fla., and the lowest wind 
chill was 19 in Laramie, Wyo.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Opposes Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It takes a village to raise a child, but it  
takes a Republican tax cut to unite New York Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The top four potential Democratic mayoral contenders -- including  
one of the city's top Puerto Rican officials, Bronx Borough 
President Fernando Ferrer -- appeared Wednesday with Hillary Rodham 
Clinton to denounce a proposed Republican tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the proposal would devastate federal funding for New  
York schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, eyeing a race for the Democratic Senate nomination  
from New York, and Ferrer stood shoulder to shoulder during the 
news conference, an apparent symbol of her desire to mend fences 
with the Puerto Rican community. Mrs. Clinton angered many Puerto 
Ricans by opposing the clemency granted by President Clinton to a 
group of FALN activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Also present were Public Advocate Mark Green, City Comptroller  
Alan Hevesi and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone -- all likely 
rivals in the next mayoral election in 2001. The news conference 
was held at United Federation of Teachers headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of unity you see before you -- among all of us -- is  
because we know what's at stake, and the federal budget has a 
direct impact on what happens here in the city and the state,'' 
said Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is exploring a run for  
the Republican Senate nomination, supports using the federal budget 
surplus for targeted tax cuts and targeted spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans think the $800 billion federal budget surplus should  
go back to the taxpayers. President Clinton has said he will veto 
the proposal altogether.

<HEADLINE> Texas Baseball Coach Lauds Costner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas baseball coach Augie Garrido says the  
painful winces on Kevin Costner's face in the baseball movie ``For 
Love of the Game'' are real. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's one scene where you'll see about two or three pitches.  
There must be 140 more that he threw that day on the cutting room 
floor,'' said Garrido, who was technical adviser for the film. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin threw every strike, threw every curve ball. He does love  
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garrido and Costner have been friends since 1992, when Garrido  
was the coach at Cal-State Fullerton and the movie star was invited 
to help dedicate the school's new baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Garrido said the two rarely talk about Costner's  
professional life in Hollywood, he knew the star of ``Bull Durham'' 
and ``Field of Dreams'' was thinking about making another baseball 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Love of the Game'' opened Wednesday in Los Angeles and  
will have its Texas premiere here Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I was going to be part of it until I got a call  
from the executive producer,'' Garrido said. ``It was like 
fulfilling a friend's request to help him. It wouldn't be any 
different than your neighbor coming over and asking for help 
painting his fence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only it's not every day your neighbor asks for help on a  
big-budget motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Augie was the first person I thought of to help on this  
film,'' Costner said. ``I trust him implicitly on all fronts. 
Inside and outside the lines of baseball, Augie is a true friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garrido helped set up the movie's baseball scenes, finding  
former major leaguers and current minor leaguers to put in uniform. 
The crew also hired the real ball boys for the New York Yankees, 
Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed to make this as authentic as we could,'' Garrido  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner, who plays aging pitcher Billy Chapel near the end of  
his career, comes off like the real thing, Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrido said he didn't have to teach Costner how to act and  
throw like a big-league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the character by the time the film ended,'' Garrido  
said. ``Including having a very sore arm.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Gives Gators More Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Classes were canceled at Florida due to  
Hurricane Floyd on Wednesday, although the teaching effort was 
intensified in the football complex. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules say that on days when classes aren't in session,  
coaches don't have to adhere to the four-hour time limit with 
players. So, for one very important day, the No. 4 Gators got extra 
preparation time for Saturday's game against No. 2 Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The team met twice, once more than usual. Later, the practice  
that had been scheduled for indoors was moved back outside because 
severe weather never materialized in Gainesville, which sits about 
75 miles inland from the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of meeting time in,'' coach Steve Spurrier said.  
``I don't know if it paid off any. We practiced just so-so today, 
at least from the offense's side. Maybe the defense had a better 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Jon Hoke said every minute counts for a  
young defense that has endured its share of trouble this season. 
Florida has allowed 784 yards passing in its first two games and 
ranks last in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``You find out every day how little they really know and what  
they do know,'' Hoke said. ``From an experience standpoint, they 
all don't have a lot of it. Every minute you spend with them extra, 
they learn more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was hardly any rain on campus and all thoughts of the game  
being postponed were forgotten. Saturday's forecast calls for sunny 
skies and temperatures in the mid-80s. At game time, it should be 
clear and in the mid-70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the bad weather became a factor and the extra  
practice time was added, Florida players were hinting that the 
football game would get most of their emphasis this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teachers know this is a different week,'' safety Marquand  
Manuel said. ``We all know that. We all know what job has got to 
get accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators will return to a normal schedule Thursday. Spurrier  
says they need every minute they can get. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we play Saturday night like we know what we're doing, then  
the extra meeting time was certainly helpful,'' he said. ``Coach 
Hoke felt it was beneficial to the defense. I thought it was 
beneficial to our guys. We know what to do. Whether we can do it, 
that remains to be seen.''

<HEADLINE> Eight Abandon Ship as Tug Sinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Eight people abandoned ship today as a  
tugboat began sinking about 350 miles northeast of Jacksonville in 
tropical storm force winds whipped up by Hurricane Floyd, Coast 
Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Kennedy, an aircraft carrier based in Jacksonville,  
launched helicopters to attempt to locate the crew members who took 
to a lifeboat. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether winds and rough seas from the hurricane  
were directly responsible for the tugboat taking on water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Floyd did not help the situation,'' Coast Guard Chief Petty  
Officer John Ware said in Miami. The tugboat crew contacted its 
office, and office staffers then called the Coast Guard.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Rise 0.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Motorists got another shock at the gasoline  
pumps last month but elsewhere consumer prices remained subdued. 
Falling costs for clothing, computers, airline tickets and new cars 
pushed the core inflation rate to the lowest level in 33 years, the 
government reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said Wednesday that its Consumer Price  
Index was up 0.3 percent overall in August, but outside of the 
volatile food and energy areas, prices rose just 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, this so-called core rate of inflation has  
risen just 1.9 percent, the smallest increase since a 1.8 percent 
rise in core prices in the 12 months ending in April 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the good news in the underlying rate of inflation,  
many economists said they still expected the Federal Reserve will 
raise interest rates for a third time this year at its meeting Oct. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation remains very mild, but the Fed is looking at  
indicators showing that the economy is growing about twice as fast 
in the current quarter as it did in the spring,'' said Paul Taylor, 
chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said reports showing unemployment returned to a 29-year  
low of 4.2 percent in August while retail sales shot up at their 
fastest clip in six months will keep Fed officials worried about 
inflation threats down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Core inflation remains totally absent, but the unrelenting  
strength of the economy will probably lead the Fed to tighten,'' 
said Gerald Cohen, economist at Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed already has nudged short-term rates up by one-half  
percentage point in two moves this summer trying to slow the 
economy enough to keep inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets initially rallied on the benign inflation  
report, cheering because the core increase of 0.1 percent was just 
half of what had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	But stocks, which had been up by more than 100 points, turned  
lower later Wednesday, reflecting in part renewed fears about 
declines in the value of the dollar in the face of record trade 
deficits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 108.91 points, or 1 
percent, to close at 10,801.42. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge trade imbalance, however, is one of the reasons  
analysts cited for the good performance on inflation. Automakers 
and other U.S. manufacturers have been unable to raise prices, even 
with strong demand, because of stiff competition from 
cheaper-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, inflation at the consumer level is rising at  
an annual rate of 2.6 percent. While this is up from the 1.6 
percent rise in prices for all of 1998, the best showing in 12 
years, all of the gain has come from a rebound in energy prices, 
which fell last year because of global oversupply. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said that two-thirds of the 0.3 percent CPI  
increase last month came from the 2.7 percent monthly jump in 
energy prices which came on the heels of a 2.1 percent July spurt 
in energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices surged by 5.6 percent, continuing a trend that  
has pushed pump prices up by 25.1 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs last month edged up a slight 0.2 percent, a modest  
advance given that drought conditions are cutting into production 
in many parts of the country. Fruit prices fell in August even 
though citrus prices continued an upward climb that has pushed 
their cost up by 60.8 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of food and energy, the price moderation reflected big  
declines in airline ticket fares, which fell 2.7 percent after 
having jumped 6.5 percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	New car prices edged down 0.1 percent and stand 1 percent below  
sticker prices of a year ago even as Detroit enjoys record sales. 
Analysts said that American manufacturers have held the line on 
prices to keep from losing market share to cheaper-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing costs fell for a fourth straight month, which analysts  
also attributed to the positive benefits to American consumers from 
the Asian currency crisis, which has increased imports of low-cost 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco prices fell 1.3 percent last month, but this was viewed  
as only a temporary respite from price increases tobacco companies 
are pushing through to pay for huge lawsuit settlements. Over the 
past 12 months, tobacco prices have risen 27.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer prices, another area where American manufacturers face  
heavy competition from imports, fell by 3.8 percent in August and 
are down 28.4 percent over the past 12 months.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Needs Trinidad for Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- If Oscar De La Hoya is destined for greatness,  
Felix Trinidad might be the fighter who helps get him there. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions that linger about De La Hoya in the ring figure to  
be settled one way or another Saturday night when he and Trinidad 
meet in what should be the most lucrative non-heavyweight fight in 
boxing history. 
</P>
<P>
	When it's over, De La Hoya will either be proclaimed as one of  
the greatest welterweights of recent times or exposed as a very 
good fighter who was the beneficiary of some very careful 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every champion has their moment,'' De La Hoya said. ``This  
fight will have a huge impact in my boxing career. It will put me 
right up there with the greats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Trinidad, De La Hoya has finally found a ring equal to test  
his skills in a fight that features a rare matchup of 26-year-old 
undefeated welterweight champions who are both at their peak. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also found an opponent who may for once be just as  
confident entering the ring that he is going to win as De La Hoya 
has been in his 31 previous fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a more complete boxer than De La Hoya,'' Trinidad said.  
``I feel Oscar is overrated. I'm going to put him on the level he 
really is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, who will earn $15 million to $10 million for  
Trinidad, is a 6-5 favorite in this city's sports books, evidence 
that oddsmakers are having just as tough a time figuring out a 
winner as is the boxing public. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters are big punchers with suspect chins, and it's very  
possible the winner will have to pick himself off the canvas before 
the fight is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to prove something new and show people something  
they haven't seen from me before,'' De La Hoya said. ``It's time to 
prove to myself what talent I have and what boxing ability I 
possess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight has generated such interest that all 12,000 tickets  
were scooped up by casinos before the public ever got a chance to 
go to the box office window. Another 30,000 people will watch on 
closed circuit at various hotels, while promoters say at least 1 
million homes will spend $49.95 to buy the fight on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of the heavyweight ranks, it's the biggest fight since  
Sugar Ray Leonard was fighting the likes of Thomas Hearns and 
Marvelous Marvin Hagler in the 1980s. It's also the most 
anticipated 147-pound fight since Leonard stopped Hearns in the 
14th round Sept. 16, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Oscar wins this fight, he's the biggest thing in boxing in  
decades,'' HBO boxing executive Lou DiBella said. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, of course, is the driving force behind the  
promotion. The 1992 Olympic gold medalist also holds the record for 
most buys of a non-heavyweight fight (800,000) when he fought 
Pernell Whitaker on April 12, 1997, in a fight that grossed $34 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	In seven previous pay-per-view fights, De La Hoya has earned  
promoters some $150 million in television revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, the IBF champion since 1993, doesn't have the same  
recognition among casual fans despite the fact he has won all 35 of 
his fights, 30 by knockout, and has a reputation for a fearsome 
right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad spent 3 1/2 months, most of it in his native Puerto Rico,  
training under his father, Felix Trinidad Sr. He sparred 219 
rounds, some of them against cruiserweights to get used to De La 
Hoya's punching power. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has weaknesses and I am going to take full advantage of  
those weaknesses,'' Trinidad said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters seemed confident Wednesday before and after a  
marathon press conference that was the last public appearance for 
each before Friday evening's weigh-in. 
</P>
<P>
	The press conference not only featured a full card of fighters  
and obligatory fight officials, but also two promoters in Bob Arum 
and Don King. Arum is the main promoter for the fight, while King 
has a smaller role as Trinidad's promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop King from spending an hour or so when he got  
his chance at the podium to introduce his fighter. King challenged 
Arum to a $1 million bet, one that Arum rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting Felix into the ring with Oscar De La Hoya means you're  
risking a lot more than $1 million,'' Arum told King. 
</P>
<P>
	Because both fighters are champions, the two camps had to  
negotiate with Nevada boxing officials on such things as what type 
of gloves would be worn and who would enter the ring first. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's camp wanted Reyes gloves and will have them, while De  
La Hoya will get into the ring last and be introduced last.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Removed From Waco Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- The federal prosecutor who first raised  
concerns about a cover-up at Waco says he's perplexed by the 
Justice Department's decision to remove him from the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not for sure what to make of it,'' said Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Bill Johnston, who was removed along with his boss, U.S. 
Attorney James W. Blagg, and the rest of the federal prosecutor's 
office for western Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying not to be paranoid,'' Johnston said Tuesday. ``I  
don't know how to characterize it. Nothing in this case surprises 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials said the change, made on Friday,  
heeded a request made by Blagg to avoid the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said Johnston, who helped handle the criminal  
prosecution of survivors of the Branch Davidian tragedy, and his 
colleagues are potential witnesses in the independent inquiry into 
the government siege. Attorney General Janet Reno has recused 
herself from the case, and the officials said additional government 
lawyers may also be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The special counsel for Waco, John Danforth, the former  
Republican senator from Missouri, is beginning his investigation 
into whether the government acted inappropriately during the fiery 
end of the 1993 siege and then tried to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Branch Davidian cult leader David Koresh and an estimated 80 of  
his followers were killed on April 19, 1993 when a fatal fire 
engulfed their compound outside of Waco. Government officials 
maintain that Branch Davidians, and not federal agents, set the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston's removal from the Waco case came to light Tuesday,  
less than 24 hours after the public release of a letter he had sent 
to Reno Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have formed the belief that facts may have been kept from  
you -- and quite possibly are being kept from you even now -- by 
components of the department,'' Johnston wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston had been at odds with Blagg and other Justice officials  
over the investigation of the government's actions. He had pressed 
for independent filmmakers to be allowed to review evidence sifted 
from the charred Waco ruins -- evidence that led to the FBI's recent 
admission that potentially incendiary tear gas canisters were fired 
on the day of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	That disclosure sparked congressional inquiries and Reno's  
appointment of Danforth. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Johnston said Tuesday  
he had done what he thought was right. ``In August, the department 
continued to deny there were any issues,'' he said. ``I just had to 
do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin, asked whether  
removing Johnston was a reprisal for his outspoken criticism in the 
Waco case, said: ``Absolutely not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a frequent critic of Justice's conduct, Rep. Bob Barr, a  
member of the House Judiciary Committee, charged that the 
department acted to hush Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
	``The department has swiftly and quietly silenced the one  
internal voice of opposition to the party line, publicly 
embarrassed him and damaged his career,'' Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of lawyers in the civil division of the U.S. Attorney's  
office has been defending the government in a wrongful death suit 
that was scheduled to go to trial Oct. 18 in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder has appointed Michael  
Bradford, the U.S. attorney in a neighboring Texas district to take 
over for Johnston and his colleagues in any further Waco matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a fresh look at this matter with a group that's not  
had any involvement or any potential conflict in the matter, and 
that's why we were asked to come in,'' Bradford said in an 
interview with The Associated Press after meeting with Blagg's 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that renewed  
congressional inquiries into Waco should expand to other instances 
in which Justice officials may have withheld information about 
government conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to have to be broader than just Waco  
itself,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters Tuesday. ``There are a 
number of investigations that they are basically either not doing 
or they have stiffed us on. So we need to find out what's going 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for an initial flurry of hearings by various committees  
have narrowed to two: in the House by Government Reform Committee 
Chairman Dan Burton and in the Senate by the Judiciary Committee.

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Museum Construction Starts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Construction began Wednesday on the $10  
million Jack Nicklaus Museum, being built in the heart of the 
athletic complex at Nicklaus' alma mater, Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility is to be finished in 11 months and inaugurated next  
year. It's opening will coincide with Nicklaus' final competitive 
appearance in The Masters, the U.S. and British Opens and the PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum is being built between the Schottenstein Center, home  
of Ohio State's men's and women's basketball and hockey teams, and 
the Woody Hayes Athletic Center, the football team's practice 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within a few minutes in any direction of the museum are many  
touchstones of my life,'' Nicklaus said in a statement. ``It's the 
area where I grew up, the golf course where I learned the game, my 
high school, the course where I played college golf, the place 
where I met my wife, Barbara, and our home in Dublin's Muirfield 
Village.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Land for the privately funded museum was donated by Ohio State.

<HEADLINE> D'Antoni Tells of Sinking Feeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- When Mike D'Antoni walked into Dan Issel's office,  
he immediately got a sinking feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's sitting there and the lawyer is sitting right beside  
him,'' D'Antoni said Tuesday after being fired as the Denver 
Nuggets' head coach. ``I don't think I've got any violations around 
the city, so I'm thinking, `I could be in a little trouble here.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel, Denver's vice president and general manager, elevated  
himself to head coach in a move that D'Antoni said left him feeling 
blindsided and ``ticked off.'' However, he also said he was 
probably naive. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn a lot, that's for sure,'' said D'Antoni, who went  
14-36 in his only season with the Nuggets. ``About people and 
loyalty and different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though highly successful as a coach in the Italian League,  
D'Antoni seemed to have trouble winning the respect of his players. 
Issel said D'Antoni's overseas experience didn't carry much weight 
with players in the image-conscious NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the coach today in the NBA does not have the respect of the  
players, you've got no shot,'' Issel said. ``This isn't that Mike 
did a bad job. Mike didn't have a chance to do a bad job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel said Nuggets owner Donald Sturm gave him a three-year  
contract with an option for a fourth year if the team is 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Antoni had two years left on a three-year contract and will  
not remain with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mainly worried about what the heck I'm going to do with  
all the free time,'' D'Antoni said. ``I went straight home after 
Dan fired me and turned on the TV. I've already seen three 
`Matlock' reruns, and that's too many for anybody. I'm bored to 
tears. I've got to find another coaching job somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel seems to have the same itch. He coached the Nuggets for 2 1/2  
seasons before retiring in January 1995. At the time, he vowed 
never to coach again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The environment is much different now than it was then,''  
Issel said. ``To be real honest with you, the media criticism 
really affected me the first time around. I think I understand that 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets have had only minimal success since Issel led them  
to the Western Conference semifinals in 1994. They threatened to 
set an NBA futility mark before finishing 11-71 in 1997-98 and 
improved only slightly during last year's lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his first coaching retirement in 1995, Issel has worked in  
radio and television as a basketball analyst, and he returned the 
team as vice president and general manager in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	His major moves in the past year have included signing  
free-agent forward Antonio McDyess and making trades for All-Star 
point guard Nick Van Exel and Denver native Chauncey Billups. He 
also orchestrated a multiplayer trade with Boston this summer that 
brought talented swingman Ron Mercer to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good situation,'' Mercer said. ``I really  
didn't know the former coach too well. I think Dan hit a key point. 
The players have to respect the coach. That's one thing that stands 
out the most. I respect Dan. He's a straightforward guy. I respect 
that a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all his front office maneuvering, Issel still inherits a  
young team with several unproven players, but said he has learned 
from his earlier coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's more mature, and I don't mean in age,'' Issel's wife,  
Cheri, said. ``I think if he's ever going to be prepared, he is now 
prepared to coach this team in the right way and enjoy it. The last 
time, he did not enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel was one of Denver's most popular players in his 11 seasons  
with the Nuggets from 1975-85. He was inducted into the Basketball 
Hall of Fame in 1993 and is still Denver's career rebounding 
leader.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Could Siphon Bush Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Pat Buchanan on the brink of bolting,  
Republicans fear that a strong third-party presidential campaign by 
the conservative contender would siphon support from the GOP 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	A new poll fuels their fears.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he wins the Reform Party nomination, he has $12 million and  
a spot in the presidential debates -- and he can cause real problems 
for Republicans,'' said GOP strategist Scott Reed, who ran Bob 
Dole's failed 1996 presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan will announce his plans in October, though advisers are  
making preparations for him to abandon the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press, which polled  
1,205 adults from Sept. 1 -12, found Buchanan could hurt 
Republicans if the matchup tightens between Democratic front-runner 
Al Gore and GOP favorite George W. Bush of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a head-to-head comparison, Bush leads Gore 54 percent to 39  
percent. In a three-way matchup, 9 percent supported Buchanan while 
the Bush-Gore margin changed little -- 50 percent for Bush, 35 
percent for Gore. But underlying numbers suggest that Buchanan 
would eat away at Bush's base. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the registered voters who chose Buchanan in the three-way  
heat, 60 percent had selected the Texas governor in the two-way 
matchup and just 29 percent had selected the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``More Bush supporters than Gore voters migrate to Buchanan,''  
says the Pew analysis of the poll, which has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. In a close Gore-Bush race ``a 
Reform Party bid by the conservative commentator might mean trouble 
for Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strategists in both parties expect the 2000 presidential  
campaign to be a close race. Republicans are pointing fingers over 
the prospect of Buchanan complicating the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question now is: Who lost Buchanan?'' Reed said.  
</P>
<P>
	Party chairman Jim Nicholson plans to meet with Buchanan this  
month, though he doesn't expect to dissuade him. Party leaders are 
pinning their hopes on GOP conservatives recruited to warn Buchanan 
that his candidacy could help elect Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson spokesman Cliff May said Buchanan needs to realize  
that bolting will ``harm the most important conservative causes he 
has worked for all these years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has asked Buchanan to remain in the party. His supporters  
are urging contacts in Buchanan's circle to do their best to 
convince him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan has argued in a blitz of interviews that the GOP  
nomination is rigged in favor of Bush and his more moderate views. 
If he bolts, Buchanan told CNN, ``I will believe that I have a 
chance to win it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sister and top adviser, Bay Buchanan, met with federal  
elections officials this week to determine whether he could earn 
matching money as a Reform Party candidate. The tentative answer 
was yes, she said, which suits her plans: Raise enough in private 
donations to qualify for federal matching funds and use a $6 
milllion budget to try to qualify for the ballot in the 29 states 
and the District of Columbia where the Reform Party doesn't already 
have access. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic officials say they realize that Buchanan could hurt  
their nominee, especially if a dip in the economy gives his 
populist protectionism views resonance. Buchanan is courting 
Teamsters and a number of small industrial unions -- and his 
advisers have discussed putting a labor-orientated Democrat on the 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a disproportionate number of Buchanan voters would  
come from Bush, although Buchanan's protectionism views will allow 
him to pick up some votes from old-labor Democrats,'' said Roger 
Stone, a GOP consultant who closely monitors the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many Democrats insist they would welcome a Buchanan bid.  
</P>
<P>
	``It gives the Hezbollah wing of the Republican Party a place to  
go,'' Democratic consultant Dane Strother said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's strong anti-abortion views would make him an  
unwelcome intruder to some Reform Party activists, particularly 
supporters of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. The nation's top 
elected Reform Party official, Ventura is trying to recruit an 
alternative to Buchanan who could do well enough in 2000 to 
maintain the party's eligibility for federal matching money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party nominee will get $12.6 million in federal money  
for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Buchanan bolts, the person he hurts the most is himself. If  
he leaves the party, they won't have anything to do with him again. 
Second, he will lose the election because the American people are 
not in sync with his ultraconservative agenda. And, third, there is 
no way he will take over the Reform Party,'' warned Phil Madsen, a 
Ventura adviser and foe of Reform Party founder Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Perot backers are urging Buchanan to run, setting the stage  
for an internal third-party fight. ``The worst he does is come in 
No. 2 in the general election,'' said the party's 1996 vice 
presidential candidate Pat Choate. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that Bush loses the most votes to Buchanan unless  
the commentator's support exceeds 10 percentage points -- when Gore 
would begin to suffer just as much.

<HEADLINE> Canseco To Stay With Devil Rays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Jose Canseco will remain with the  
Tampa Bay Devil Rays next year, and resume his chase for 500 home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays on Wednesday picked up a $3 million option on his  
contract for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm in the lineup I think the numbers speak for  
themselves,'' the 35-year-old slugger said before facing the 
Seattle Mariners at Tropicana Field. ``Hopefully I can stay 
healthy, hit 50 or 60 home runs and help the team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco was having one of his better seasons before he was  
sidelined for six weeks after back surgery to repair a herniated 
disc. 
</P>
<P>
	He was leading the AL with 31 homers and had been selected as  
the league's starting designated hitter for the All-Star game when 
the injury knocked him out of the lineup from July 10 to Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors originally projected Canseco would not return before  
Sept. 1, but his rehabilitation went better than expected. Devil 
Rays general manager Chuck LaMar cited the speedy recovery as one 
of the factors in the decision to bring him back for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jose has been everything we thought he would be and more.  
Before the back surgery, he was headed for one of his best 
offensive seasons ever,'' LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked extremely hard to come back from the injury as  
quickly as he did, and in the process was a very positive influence 
on all of our players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month Canseco said his motivation to return before  
September was to try to catch Ken Griffey Jr. and win the AL home 
run title. He also acknowledged how much it would mean to hit 500 
homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I die, I want to hit 500 home runs. These injuries will  
not keep me from it. I don't care if I have to have back surgery 
every year. It will not keep me from doing it,'' he said two weeks 
before his return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll play until I'm 45. ... I don't care what's in my future --  
a broken leg, a broken ankle, a broken wrist, three or four more 
back surgeries. I guarantee you I'll get 500 home runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was only half joking about sticking around for another  
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important,'' he said Wednesday, reiterating his  
commitment to reaching the milestone that separates great power 
hitters from good ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that has been a battle for me. But eventually,  
injuries or not, I will hit 500 home runs. I'm only 35 years old. I 
probably can easily play until I'm 40.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through Tuesday night's 2-for-4 performance against the  
Mariners, Canseco was hitting .300 since coming off the disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 15 RBIs in 17 games, but all but one of his 18 hits had  
been singles. His only homer, giving him 429 in 14 seasons, was a 
game-winner last week against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	He attributed the lack of power since returning to timing. He's  
happy the decision to pick up his option has been made, but 
stressed it hadn't been a concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wasn't concentrating on that. I'm just trying to get  
healthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, batting .280 with 83 RBIs in 99 games, signed with the  
Devil Rays as a free agent after hitting a career-high 46 homers 
for the Toronto Blue Jays in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned a base salary of $2 million this year. And at $3  
million, he would still be a bargain next season if he continues to 
provide the right-handed power Tampa Bay lacked before his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco hit his 400th homer on April 14 and broke the Devil  
Rays' season home run mark of 19 in the team's 53rd game. A month 
later, he became the first player in major league history to hit 
30-plus homers in a season for four teams.

<HEADLINE> Bill Curbing Campaign Finance Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House took a step toward curbing  
politicians' insatiable appetite for campaign contributions, but it 
was far from clear whether the Senate would go along. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive year, Republican rank-and-file  
members defied their House leadership and joined Democrats in a 
252-177 vote to ban ``soft money,'' the unlimited and largely 
unregulated contributions that corporations, unions and wealthy 
donors make to the political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 197 Democrats, 54 Republicans and one independent voted  
for the bill, while 164 Republicans and 13 Democrats were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone from a government by the people, for the people, to  
a government of lobbyists and special interests,'' said House 
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, rejecting claims by 
opponents that the bill would violate First Amendment rights to 
free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other supporters, Gephardt argued that passing the bill was  
essential to regaining the trust of an electorate turned off by 
big-money politics. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting the Senate to agree is likely to be difficult. Last  
year, after the House bill passed 252-179, Senate backers garnered 
a majority but fell well short of the 60 votes needed to break a 
filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who authored the House bill  
with Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said the situation has changed, 
with more lawmakers shocked by the way the parties and candidates 
are awash in money. But he also acknowledged that ``we're still 
going up the hill and we could fall right back down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As in the House, the Senate bill has a Republican, Sen. John  
McCain of Arizona, bucking the opposition of his leadership and 
joining a Democrat, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, to sponsor the 
bill. ``I'm very pleased that a significant majority of the House 
is on record in support of meaningful campaign finance reform,'' 
McCain said. ``I sincerely hope the Senate will do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling quite good about the way this is shaping up,''  
said Feingold, who said he had talked individually with Senate 
Republicans and found ``quite a number who don't want to be 
associated with the current campaign finance system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who opposes the  
McCain-Feingold bill, has promised a vote on the legislation next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The similar House and Senate bills, the first major changes in  
campaign financing laws in a quarter-century, would ban soft money 
and place curbs on certain political advertising. Broadcast 
commercials within 60 days of an election that made use of the name 
or likeness of a candidate would have to be paid for with regulated 
``hard money'' contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The same rule would apply to issue ads which ostensibly are  
meant to educate voters but actually are thinly veiled attacks on a 
candidate's positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard money refers to direct contributions to candidates, while  
soft money goes to the parties -- supposedly for ``party-building'' 
purposes but, in reality, often for individual campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had enough talk about reform,'' President Clinton, a  
strong backer of the legislation, wrote in a letter to lawmakers. 
``The American people know the system needs to be fixed, buy many 
have come to doubt Congress' will to fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents contended that Shays-Meehan would violate their  
free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the mother of all government regulations,'' said Rep.  
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the third-ranking Republican in the House. ``It 
attempts to control the political process and limit freedom just to 
protect incumbents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Freedom of speech is worthless if no one can hear it,'' said  
Rep. Roger Wicker, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	But that notion was challenged by many within the GOP. ``I would  
urge my colleagues to beware of 'sunshine patriots' who come to the 
defense of the First Amendment only when the speech being defended 
comes with a price tag attached,'' said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, 
R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates are that soft money contributions in the next  
presidential election cycle could top $500 million, double the 1996 
amount, with Republicans generally commanding the edge in raising 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Before winning passage, supporters of Shays-Meehan had to  
survive votes on seven amendments and three substitute versions, 
all regarded as ``poison pills'' that would have effectively killed 
their bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the amendments defeated were those that would have raised  
individual contribution limits from $1,000 to $3,000. Others would 
have required candidates to raise 50 percent of their contributions 
in-state and exempt the Internet from regulations in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Two amendments were accepted: one to bar alien residents from  
making campaign contributions; and another, offered by Rep. John 
Sweeney, R-N.Y., to require a candidate who is not a federal office 
holder to reimburse the federal government for the full costs of 
using government transportation for campaign purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney said his only purpose was to make potential candidates  
more accountable to taxpayers, and denied it was a partisan swipe 
at first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has flown on government 
planes and been protected by the Secret Service on trips to New 
York, where she is considering a run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 417.

<HEADLINE> Matt Williams' Mother Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- The mother of Arizona Diamondbacks  
third baseman Matt Williams said a visit by her son boosted her 
spirits as she recovers from a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, leading the NL with 130 RBIs, left the team to be with  
his mother, Sarah, who had the stroke eight days ago 
</P>
<P>
	Williams went to Carson City with his wife, actress Michele  
Johnson, and his three children to see his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank goodness it was very mild, my right side,'' she said.  
``I'm slowly coming back.

<HEADLINE>  U.N. Council Approves Timor Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Moving with uncharacteristic speed to end  
the rampant violence in East Timor, the U.N. Security Council today 
authorized a multinational force to restore peace and ensure that 
the territory moves toward independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In a unanimous vote, the council gave approval to Australia and  
other troop contributors to start mobilizing soldiers. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he hopes some troops can be on 
the ground by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, whose country is  
expected to lead the 7,000-strong force, told the council it was 
``vitally important'' that troops be deployed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Australia wouldn't move into East Timor alone, and  
would need soldiers from other countries to join the first 
deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are under no illusions -- this is a dangerous mission,'' he  
said. ``There are risks involved for the multinational force, but I 
think the international community sees these risks as worth taking 
to bring peace to East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution authorizes a multinational force to move into  
East Timor and ``take all necessary measures'' to restore peace and 
security and allow for humanitarian aid to reach its people. It was 
enacted under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which authorizes the 
use of force. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has refused to withdraw its troops from East Timor  
despite allegations that they participated in the bloody rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters the U.N.-authorized  
multinational force will be in command on the ground, with 
Indonesian troops probably playing an advisory and liaison role. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the Security Council, Alatas said it was  
``imperative that the multinational force conduct itself in an 
impartial and neutral manner so that its presence in East Timor 
will be credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations were continuing today on the command and  
composition of the force, its rules of engagement, and the duties 
of the Indonesian and multinational soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Alatas said Indonesia was not placing any conditions  
on the multinational force, he emphasized that Jakarta preferred 
troops from countries that belong to the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations because of their understanding of regional 
``sensitivities'' -- and opposed Australian participation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Foreign Minister Jaime Gama of Portugal, East Timor's former  
colonial ruler, said the sole precondition for the force must be 
that it is strong and effective enough to deal with the crisis and 
immediately restore peace and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-Indonesian militiamen, backed by Indonesian soldiers,  
rampaged in East Timor after results of a U.N.-supervised ballot 
were announced Sept. 4, showing an overwhelming vote for 
independence from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan was scheduled to meet today with Alatas and Gama. A key  
topic was expected to be the creation of a U.N. peacekeeping force 
that would take over from the multinational force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council decided to give its blessing to a  
multinational force first because its troops are paid for by their 
own governments, and it can deploy rapidly. A U.N. peacekeeping 
force usually takes months to put together and send into the field.

<HEADLINE> No Charges To Be Filed vs. Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Former NBA star Dennis Rodman,  
arrested last month following a disturbance at a waterfront 
restaurant and bar, won't face misdemeanor drunkenness charges in 
connection with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tori Richards, a spokesperson for the Orange County district  
attorney's office, said Wednesday the decision was made because 
evidence did not show Rodman was so drunk that he would not be able 
to care for his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the standard we must prove in court before a jury,''  
Richards said. ``We reached this conclusion after talking with 
police and reviewing statements from five witnesses who were at the 
bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport Beach police originally recommended Rodman be charged  
because he was offered a chance to leave the restaurant and didn't, 
according to Sgt. Mike McDermott. 
</P>
<P>
	Waived by the Los Angeles Lakers last April after a stormy seven  
weeks with the team, the 38-year-old Rodman was released on his own 
recognizance after spending several hours in jail following his 
arrest outside the restaurant Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they made the right call,'' Rodman's attorney, Paul S.  
Meyer, said from his office in Costa Mesa. ``The potential criminal 
charges evaporated in the light of all the facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate the willingness of the office of the district  
attorney to engage in an independent and thorough review. This 
matter has now been put to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested at the time of the disturbance was Donn Emerson,  
36, who was charged Wednesday with obstructing a police officer and 
possession of marijuana, both misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marijuana was discovered when he was booked, there were  
11.5 grams in his pocket,'' Richards said. ``Apparently, Mr. 
Emerson was not letting police officers conduct their interviews, 
and he was getting in the way. Police repeatedly asked him to step 
back, and he refused to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Emerson faces a maximum of one year in jail and a  
$100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Restaurant owner Ralph Furra, whose wife, Julie, was managing  
the bar at the time, said a woman apparently was taunting Rodman. 
He responded, and then the woman's boyfriend grabbed Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called and asked Rodman to take a taxi home, but he  
refused.

<HEADLINE> Brooks &AMP; Dunn Up for Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- It's as close as country music gets to a  
sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, presenter Tanya Tucker announced Kix Brooks and Ronnie  
Dunn as the best vocal duo without bothering to look at the 
winner's card. 
</P>
<P>
	She was right.  
</P>
<P>
	For seven consecutive years, the duo of Brooks &AMP; Dunn has won  
the award. And they're up for No. 8 when the 33rd annual Country 
Music Assocation Awards are broadcast live Sept. 22 on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``There've been times when we've won duo of the year when we've  
sincerely been embarrassed,'' said Dunn, grinning at the peculiar 
problem of having so much success it seems unseemly sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be perceived as being a little one-sided.''  
</P>
<P>
	Since teaming up in 1991 at the urging of Arista Records head  
Tim DuBois, the two former solo aspirants have fashioned themselves 
into an efficient hit machine and sold more than 16 million albums. 
In 1996, they became the only duo in CMA history to win the top 
award of best entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn, 46, from Coleman, Texas, has one of the most powerful  
voices in Nashville, and is the lead singer on the bulk of the 
Brooks &AMP; Dunn hits. Brooks, 44, from Shreveport, La., is the more 
dynamic live performer. 
</P>
<P>
	For their new album ``Tight Rope,'' longtime Brooks &AMP; Dunn  
collaborator Don Cook worked on the songs featuring Brooks, while 
Dunn brought in Byron Gallimore (Tim McGraw, Jo Dee Messina) for 
his numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	That would seem to indicate a team drifting apart. Just the  
opposite, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``That freedom, as much as people are ready to latch on to any  
hint of a rift with us, actually is the dynamic that keeps us 
together,'' Dunn said. ``Because you can express your individuality 
and still come together and make it a Brooks &AMP; Dunn record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another success strategy: Songwriters who want to work with the  
duo are invited to join them on tour, instead of working in 
Nashville, which is the common practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You spend all day sitting there in those buses a lot of times,  
waiting for the show,'' Dunn said. ``So why not utilize that time? 
And if you have a co-writer out there as motivation, a lot of times 
that'll help you get to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks added: ``Kids and wives and all that stuff you need to  
pay attention to when you're home, and it's hard to pay attention 
to it when you've got somebody over there trying to write a song 
with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of their first hits was ``Boot Scootin' Boogie,'' which  
benefited from the country music line dancing craze of the early 
1990s. They are adept at ballads (``Neon Moon'') and especially 
good at cranking out aggressive rockers like ``Hard Workin' Man'' 
and ``Rock My World (Little Country Girl).'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1996, the duo pitched a curve ball. They released ``My  
Maria,'' a 1973 pop hit by B.W. Stevenson. Varying the formula with 
a pop remake was seen as a gamble at the time. But it went straight 
to No. 1, launched the ``Borderline'' album, and got people taking 
about them again instead of looking for something new. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo is using a similar strategy for ``Tight Rope.'' The  
leadoff single is ``Missing You,'' a No. 1 pop hit for John Waite 
in 1984. The song is shaping up as another country smash hit for 
Brooks &AMP; Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	The hit comes just in time to give the duo a boost with CMA  
Awards voters. This year's challengers are The Kinleys, The Lynns, 
Montgomery Gentry and The Warren Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kinleys and Montgomery Gentry present the strongest threat  
to Brooks &AMP; Dunn's dominance of the best vocal duo honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always felt like we're vulnerable,'' Dunn said. ``No one  
is more prone and set and prepared to lose any more than we are. 
We've been losing since the first platinum record we had. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Insecurity is probably the greatest motivator in any field.  
It's ours.''

<HEADLINE> Insurance Industry Wary of Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd's anticipated wake of costly  
damages is expected to shine a spotlight on changes to the 
insurance industry in the seven years since Hurricane Andrew tore 
across southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	While companies have taken steps to ensure they can pay claims,  
they've also cut back on coverage, leaving some to fear that 
policyholders could be forced to foot more of the bill if their 
property is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The $15 billion in damages caused by Andrew after it swept  
across the southern tip of Florida in 1992 forced about 10 regional 
insurance companies out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, many insurance companies have taken precautions  
against a similar catastrophe by taking out reinsurance policies, a 
kind of insurance policy for an insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The insurance industry wasn't prepared for Andrew,'' said John  
Oxendine, Georgia's insurance commissioner. ``The insurance 
companies were absorbing a lot of the liability themselves because 
they hadn't taken out reinsurance policies. The industry is much 
more prepared now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies also simply stopped issuing policies that  
included hurricane damage liability along the coastlines of such 
frequently hit states as Florida, South Carolina and North 
Carolina. Those that continued to write hurricane policies 
increased the premiums as well as the deductibles that must be paid 
in the event of hurricane-related damages. In some cases, the 
deductibles were raised from as little as 1 percent of the damage 
costs to as much as 5 percent, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxendine said Georgia required insurers to cover coastline  
regions if they wanted to write policies in the heavily populated 
and extremely lucrative Atlanta area, located inland. ``If they 
said they weren't going to insure on the coast in Savannah, we 
said, 'That's fine, but you're not going to insure in Atlanta 
either,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	States such as North Carolina and South Carolina, which lack a  
major population center similar to Atlanta, were unable to use that 
as leverage against the insurers, Oxendine said. 
</P>
<P>
	In eastern Virginia, where Floyd is expected to pass over the  
heavily populated Chesapeake Bay region, Ken Schrad, a spokesman 
for the state Corporate Commission's Bureau of Insurance said that 
many insurance companies have taken steps to prevent overexposure 
to a catastrophe that could bankrupt them. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, that since Andrew, ``anyone who needed  
insurance was able to get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, state Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson issued a  
warning to insurers, which raised rates sharply after Hurricane 
Andrew seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to put the insurance companies on notice: if you think  
you're going to use Hurricane Floyd as an excuse to jack up rates, 
you have another thing coming,'' Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	His department will run sting operations with investigators  
posing as homeowners to catch any unscrupulous adjusters. He 
cautioned homeowners to be sure they see adjusters' licenses and be 
wary of price gouging. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance experts said the storm would have to hit several  
densely populated, heavily developed areas to drain the $341 
billion in surplus funds currently available to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of the financial resources based on the surplus  
numbers, the industry should be well prepared financially to handle 
the potential avalanche of claims that might arise,'' said Dave 
Dasgupta, a spokesman for the Insurance Services Office, an 
insurance data company. He said the industry can thank the booming 
stock market for the vast sum of money available to pay out claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Others aren't as certain about the industry's ability to cover  
the number of claims that could arise in the wake of Floyd, a 
hurricane that at one point was three times the size of Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have some struggles, despite the strength of the  
insurance industry,'' said John Eager, director of claims services 
for the National Association of Independent Insurers, a trade 
association. ``Depending on the magnitude of the loss, it could 
take us right to the brink.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eager noted that that Andrew's damage occurred primarily in low-  
to middle-income neighborhoods, a factor that kept the property 
damage losses lower than if the storm had struck farther north, 
along the wealthy coastline near Miami.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Seeks Support in Minn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Buoyed by strong showings in recent polls,  
Democrat Bill Bradley sought support and spending money for his 
presidential campaign Wednesday, saying he has a better chance at 
the White House than Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator was pleased by polls in New  
Hampshire and New York showing a tight race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly think things are beginning to move,'' Bradley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley met with 200 people and hoped many would volunteer on  
his behalf. He stressed campaign themes of reducing the number of 
poor children, extending health coverage to more people, reforming 
the campaign finance system and properly managing the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the gathering, he explained to reporters why people  
should vote for him: ``Because they believe my leadership would 
improve the quality of life for millions of Americans and they 
think I have a better chance to win in a general election,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Bradley's schedule was a $250-a-person fund-raiser at the  
Minneapolis Club and a $1,000-a-person dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bradley aide, R.T. Rybak, said the campaign hoped to take in  
$100,000 in the short visit. But Rybak said the trip mainly was an 
organizing stop and a sign that Bradley considered Minnesota an 
important state. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush also came to  
Minnesota for short stops and fund-raisers over the past few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley told supporters he wanted to run a campaign in a  
different kind of way, meeting voters face-to-face. He asked for 
help making personal contacts, not commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those who attended Bradley's event were familiar faces  
from Sen. Paul Wellstone's campaigns. Wellstone, D-Minn., was an 
early Bradley supporter. His wife, Sheila Wellstone, introduced 
Bradley and asked supporters to do for him what they had done for 
Wellstone: work hard to elect him. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Heglund, a Minneapolis activist who attended the event,  
called Bradley ``the only hope that the Democrats have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore is going no place fast,'' he said. Heglund, a retired  
teacher, said he would help Bradley as much as his schedule 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly Goren, the chairwoman of the political science department  
at St. Catherine's College, said she might work for Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he can beat George W. and I'm not sure Al Gore can,''  
she said. Goren said she is worried Gore has been tainted by his 
alliance with President Clinton.

without room service and other amenities on Wednesday as thousands 
of workers went on strike, and Miss America Pageant organizers 
worried the weekend event could be disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 54 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees  
International Union walked off the job after their five-year 
contract expired at midnight Tuesday. Negotiators could not agree 
on provisions addressing the use of subcontractors by casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The city declared a state of emergency Wednesday because of the  
strike and approaching Hurricane Floyd, meaning the Department of 
Public Safety can take whatever measures it deems necessary to 
ensure the public safety, health and welfare, Police Sgt. Michael 
C. Tullio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strike, gamblers could still try their luck. Dealers  
are not unionized and the games of chance remained open. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 54 represents about 14,000 casino hotel cooks, bartenders,  
maids, cocktail servers, bathroom attendants and car parkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three casinos reached agreement with the union and were  
unaffected by the strike. The other nine were forced to close 
restaurants, cut back on services and put managerial and non-union 
employees to work in other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Pane came with his wife for the New Jersey State Funeral  
Directors Association's annual conference. Two days after arriving, 
what was supposed to be a three-day getaway was beginning to feel 
more like work. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no chambermaids, nobody making up the beds, no room  
service. When you're used to the amenities, it's inconvenient,'' 
said Pane, 60, of White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	With umbrellas in one hand and picket signs (``Trump is a Bum,''  
said one) in the other, groups of poncho-clad strikers stood in 
driving rain on the Boardwalk, along Pacific Avenue and at the 
entrances to casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	They chanted, discouraged people from entering the casinos and  
hooted when passing automobiles beeped their horns in assent. No 
new talks were scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the protesters have been orderly, Tullio said. One was  
arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and others have 
blocked traffic on some streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the casinos, it was dry. But service was slower than a  
broken roulette wheel -- if it was available at all. Some public 
restrooms were closed because there was no one to clean them. 
Drinks and food were also hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stood in line for 45 minutes for the buffet,'' said  
Madeline O'Dair, 69, of Baltimore, who drove in for the day to play 
the slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Contestants and visitors in town for the 79th annual Miss  
America Pageant, which is scheduled for Saturday, also were 
suffering minor indignities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make my own bed and I generally get my own food, so it  
didn't really affect me,'' said Miss Connecticut Sylvia Gomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pageant boss Robert L. Beck was worried about whether the strike  
would trigger sympathy walkouts by workers in Convention Hall, the 
home of the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a very serious problem not only for the show but  
for the entire contest,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg Caran, assistant general manager of the hall, said  
walkouts by Convention Hall workers were unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Memorial Breaks Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Holocaust memorial broke ground  
Wednesday on a new Hall of Names, where millions of Holocaust 
victims will be documented in millions of pages of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Baron Benjamin de Rothschild, a French wine maker who chairs the  
fund financing the new building, helped lay the cornerstone with 
Education Minister Yossi Sarid and Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction on addition to Yad Vashem, estimated to cost $3.1  
million dollars, is scheduled to begin in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this will infuse information not only to Jewish people,  
but to people across the world, so this does not happen again,'' 
Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nazis and their allies murdered at least six million Jews in  
German-occupied Europe between 1939 and 1945. Many members of the 
widespread Rothschild banking clan perished in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Hall of Names is part of the ``Yad Vashem 2001'' plan to  
renovate the aging memorial. The plan includes a new gateway and 
visitors' center, an International School for Holocaust Studies and 
a new archives building. 
</P>
<P>
	A model of the new Hall of Names showed a three-circle  
structure. Most of the building will house millions of pages of 
testimony naming victims of the Holocaust. It will also house a 
computerized database. 
</P>
<P>
	Yad Vashem Chairman Avner Shalev said he and his colleagues  
hoped the collection of Holocaust testimony would soon reach five 
million pages.

<HEADLINE> Corrections Dept. Has Bodyguard Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A bodyguard unit has been created to protect  
Arizona's top corrections officials, including the prison chief, 
who officials say barely survived an assassination plot by prison 
gang members last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections Director Terry Stewart created the nine-member  
Protective Services Unit in April with temporary funding. 
</P>
<P>
	To continue the unit, the state asked for $400,000 in a  
supplemental budget request, which The Associated Press obtained 
through state open records laws. If approved, the funding would 
kick in during the fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget request says the unit has responded to 29 threats  
made against Corrections Department employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cases involved attempts to intimidate or threaten  
department employees or their relatives or reports that gang 
members planned to kidnap or attack employees, said Gary Phelps, 
the department's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Stewart's life is in danger because of get-tough  
policies on imprisoned gang members, who have been separated from 
other prisoners or transferred to prisons in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sense they want to strike back,'' Phelps said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget request points to a case in which three gang members  
were accused of plotting to kill Stewart. Officials said the men 
were within moments of gunning down Stewart last summer as he ate 
at a restaurant but were scared off by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were dropped in February after a key prosecution  
witness refused to answer questions about the plot in court.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: AIDS Is Africa's Real Foe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Armed conflict killed 200,000 Africans  
last year, but AIDS killed 2 million Africans in the same period, a 
U.N. official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The statistics came in support of a challenge from the U.N.  
Children's Fund for African governments, which spend more on 
defense than on health, to recognize AIDS as Africa's real 
``killing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By any measure, the HIV-AIDS pandemic is the most terrible  
undeclared war in the world,'' said Carol Bellamy, executive 
director of UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on the third day of Africa's largest AIDS conference,  
Bellamy said decades of gains for child survival and development 
were being wiped out across the continent by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat has been worsened by the lack of commitment from  
political leaders to fight AIDS, resulting in a ``conspiracy of 
silence'' to hide the seriousness of the crisis from ordinary 
people, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a quarter of adolescent women south of the Sahara --  
the group most at risk from infection with the HIV virus that 
causes AIDS -- were unaware of even one effective way of avoiding 
the disease, research has shown. 
</P>
<P>
	In southern Africa, more than 30 percent of young women felt a  
healthy-looking person could not be a carrier, a study showed. Up 
to 90 percent of HIV carriers are unaware they are infected. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellamy said African governments must make community education a  
top priority and recognize ``the capabilities of communities and 
the poor to help themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She challenged policy makers to set goals for the year 2002 that  
would include: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Making adolescent women aware of the risks of AIDS and ways to  
protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Giving up to 70 percent of women at prenatal clinics access to  
voluntary and confidential testing. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Encouraging HIV-positive mothers to seek treatment to arrest  
mother-to-child transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Making sure that local governments can better provide food,  
education and basic health care for the 13 million children 
expected to be orphaned by AIDS in the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can achieve these goals only with the sustained support of  
officials at the highest level,'' Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF, she said, was moving to strengthen its support for  
regional governments and she called for greater help from 
international donors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lusaka on Tuesday, the World Bank announced it had given new  
priority to AIDS programs in its $3 billion annual development 
loans to sub-Saharan Africa, putting AIDS ``center stage'' in 
African lending policies, spokeswoman Debbie Zwedie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States spends $880 million fighting about 40,000 new  
AIDS cases a year. All of Africa spends about $150 million fighting 
4 million new cases a year, and only one-tenth of the expenditure 
came from governments, Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is simply unacceptable,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Africa accounts for two-thirds of the world's 31 million  
HIV-AIDS cases. The pandemic has claimed about 11 million lives.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: False Claims in Farm Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Black farmers seeking part of a $375  
million discrimination settlement with the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture will have to wait because of fraudulent claims, 
according to a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Othello Cross, who has handled about 2,200 claims from black  
farmers in Arkansas, said some people who never farmed are filing 
claims saying they lost thousands of dollars because of 
discrimination by the USDA dating to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has attorneys who expected this and they're on  
the lookout, which takes more time for all of us,'' Cross said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a small group of black farmers sued the USDA, saying  
many county-based organizations that delivered loans, emergency aid 
and other government help had consistently discriminated against 
black farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and the farmers settled in March.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the USDA said fraudulent claims should be taken  
seriously to prevent waste of taxpayer dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just glad someone caught it this early,'' said Andrew  
Kauders, a spokesman from the USDA. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, lawyers representing farmers in more than 25 states  
said they expected fewer than 20,000 people to file a claim. But 
Cross said that number has jumped to more than 30,000 in the last 
few months.

<HEADLINE> Web Sites for Bonds Popping Up / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors seeking information about stocks on  
the Internet easily can gain access to thousands of sites at any 
given moment, including ones that let them trade around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds are a different story.  
</P>
<P>
	Those looking to trade, price or conduct general research online  
may sometimes find more data about the tuxedo-clad, martini-sipping 
secret agent named James or the Missouri senator named Christopher, 
after typing ``bonds'' into a search engine. 
</P>
<P>
	This information gap may be attributed to the fact that the  
stock market has been so hot in recent years and investors are far 
more interested in the double-digit returns of equities. But it 
probably also has to do with volume -- there are far more 
outstanding bond issues than stock and most are in over-the-counter 
markets rather than exchanges, which makes them more difficult to 
sort through and track. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just in the corporate market alone, there are 300,000 to  
400,000 bonds listed,'' said Michael Dorfsman, a spokesman for the 
Bond Market Association, a New York-based trade group, ``and most 
bonds don't trade on any given day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the market's magnitude, however, there is still more  
bond information available online today than a year ago -- or even 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Useful Web sites have been slowly popping up. Some financial  
institutions have been augmenting their sites to include more 
information about investing in the credit markets, and a few major 
online brokerages have been providing individual investors with 
trading areas that contain more timely information. 
</P>
<P>
	While still greatly underused, experts like Thomas O'Connell,  
president of Discover Brokerage Direct in San Francisco, predict 
online fixed-income activity will increase as stocks turn more 
volatile and eventually end their long bull market. 
</P>
<P>
	He told a Bond Market Association (BMA) meeting earlier this  
year that bonds eventually will have a strong online presence 
because investors like the option of all-day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, those wishing to develop a working knowledge about  
bonds can obtain some useful information through a few growing Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	A good place to start may be www.investinginbonds.com, which is  
run by BMA. The site starts off with bond basics: types of debt 
securities traded; their suggested presence in an investment 
portfolio; and up-to-date reports analyzing market trends. There 
are price quotes available on some actively traded municipal and 
investment-grade corporate bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Also covering the basics is www.bondsonline.com, run by  
Twenty-First Century Municipals Inc. an online information services 
company based in Mercer Island, Washington. It includes specialized 
sections on Treasuries, savings bonds, municipals, corporates, 
zero-coupon bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations. Price 
quotes and research reports are available. 
</P>
<P>
	A quick overview of current prices and yields for a variety of  
bond categories can be obtained at www.cnnfn.com. Its ``bond 
center'' also provides current news reports about bonds, interest 
rates and the economy. Another good source: www.cbsmarketwatch.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The official site for Treasury bond information is  
www.publicdebt.treas.gov. It includes all types of government bond 
information, including a calculator to determine exactly what the 
public debt was on any given day for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the more sophisticated investor willing to pay a monthly  
fee, there are www.bradynet.com and www.convertbond.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradynet includes complete information on Eurobonds, global  
issues and emerging markets derivatives as well as bond information 
for specific countries an extensive analytic tools. Among the 
issued tracked: Brady bonds, named for former U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas Brady, which allowed 18 countries over the last 
10 years to repay their debt by repackaging defaulted loans into 
new bonds, partly backed by U.S. Treasury bonds. Service starts at 
$99.95 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Convertbond provides a wide range of information about  
convertible bonds, which are publicly traded income-bearing 
securities that can be converted into common stock of companies 
issuing them. Brokerage accounts can be opened. Membership options 
start at $10 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	A good place to trade bonds online is www.etrade.com, run by the  
online broker ETrade Group Inc. Its relatively new Bond Center 
lists thousands of corporates, munis and Treasuries for sale.

	Floyd Heads Toward Carolinas  
</P>
<P>
	MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd churned its way up the  
Atlantic coast today, heading on a collision course with the 
Carolinas after delivering only a glancing blow to Florida. Floyd, 
packing 115 mph winds, moved north toward the mostly evacuated area 
between Myrtle Beach and Wilmington, N.C., its tremendous size and 
power chasing tens of thousands of coastal residents inland as part 
of the biggest evacuation in U.S. history -- 2.6 million people in 
the Southeast. By late day, Floyd was 215 miles south-southwest of 
Wilmington. The storm is expected to roll ashore around daybreak 
tomorrow. 

</P>
<P>
	Bahamians Assess Floyd Damage  
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Amid reports of widespread destruction on  
distant islands in the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd, Bahamians 
today shoveled sand from homes and removed uprooted trees from 
streets. Floyd ripped roofs off hundreds of wooden homes, beached 
dozens of boats, flooded beachfront condominiums and floated cars 
in 6-foot storm surges. Electricity and telephones remained down 
throughout most of the 600-mile long archipelago today, 
complicating the task of reporting casualties and damage. 

</P>
<P>
	U.N. Council Approves Timor Mission  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Moving to end rampant violence in East  
Timor, the U.N. Security Council today authorized a multinational 
force to restore peace and ensure that the territory moves toward 
independence. The council gave unanimous approval for Australia and 
other troop contributors to start mobilizing soldiers. Australia's 
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, whose country is expected to 
lead the 7,000-member force, said today he hopes peacekeepers will 
be in East Timor ``this weekend.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Technology Aims To Locate 911 Calls  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are taking the next steps  
toward ensuring that cell phone users who dial 911 automatically 
give emergency dispatchers a key piece of information: their 
location. The action today by the Federal Communications Commission 
sets the technology standards for cellular companies to follow as 
they make 911 caller location available in their phones. In 
situations such as auto accidents, knowing the location increases 
chances that emergency personnel will get to the scene on time, the 
FCC said.

	Obese Child Offers Genetic Link  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time, injections of the hormone  
leptin have been shown to curb appetite and induce weight loss in a 
human, a new study says. Scientists caused a stir four years ago 
when they announced that leptin could evoke weight loss in mice, 
but until now, a direct role in human obesity had not been 
confirmed. The findings by doctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital in 
Cambridge, England, provide important clues as researchers try to 
decipher the genetic and environmental factors in obesity. 

</P>
<P>
	Americans Facing New Dangers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are at more risk than they think,  
facing possible terrorist attack and other new dangers that 
superior military power cannot prevent, a Pentagon-appointed panel 
reported today. If the nation is drawn into war, it will bring 
``casualties and carnage, and combat will not be like a video game, 
even for Americans,'' concluded the commission headed by former 
Republican Sen. Warren Rudman and former Democratic Sen. Gary Hart.

	Motorola To Buy General Instrument  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Motorola Inc. is buying General Instrument Corp.  
for $10.66 billion in stock, uniting two technologies that may 
speed changes in home entertainment. Motorola, best known for 
making cellular phones and pagers, is making a push into the future 
of cable television, which will include a variety of ``broadband'' 
applications, including Internet access, high-definition television 
and telephone service. General Instrument dominates the market for 
cable TV set-top boxes -- one of the key ingredients for delivering 
broadband services to consumers.

	Dow Dives 108.91 to 10,801.42  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors brushed off a government report that  
showed little evidence of rising inflation, driving stocks lower 
today. The Dow industrials closed down 108.91 at 10,801.42. 
Declining issues on the NYSE led advancers 1,767 to 1,180. The 
Nasdaq also finished down 54.15 at 2,814.14.

of the Cincinnati Reds by Marge Schott today, ending the 15-year 
reign of one of the sport's most controversial owners. Carl 
Lindner, who owns the Great American Insurance Co., will take over 
as the controlling owner from Schott, who repeatedly has infuriated 
baseball with inflammatory statements about minorities and women. 
The deal, in which 36.7 percent of the Reds' shares would be sold, 
values the franchise at $181.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Technology Aims To Locate 911 Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are taking the next steps  
toward ensuring that cell phone users who dial 911 automatically 
give emergency dispatchers a key piece of information: their 
location. 
</P>
<P>
	The action today by the Federal Communications Commission sets  
the technology standards for cellular companies to follow as they 
make 911 caller location available in their phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators hope that cellular companies will begin providing  
phones with locator technology within two years. The commission 
voted 5-0 to set the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision will save lives without question,'' said FCC  
Chairman Bill Kennard in an interview. In situations such as auto 
accidents, when a few hours can mean the difference between life 
and death, knowing the location increases chances that emergency 
personnel will get to the scene on time, Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, when a person makes a 911 call from a regular  
wireline phone, say from home or work, the location of the caller 
will pop up on a screen read by emergency dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators want to see similar information provided for cellular  
911 calls. In 1996, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless 
carriers to set up systems by Oct. 1, 2001, that could locate a 
cellular caller within 410 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	New innovations have cropped up since then so cellular companies  
now have some choices in reaching this goal, Kennard said. The FCC 
is trying to lay out the rules carriers must follow, but are 
staying neutral on which technology to select, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One option wireless companies have is to modify their network so  
they can track their customers. That way, the system could work 
with the existing 65 million wireless phones nationwide, said Mike 
Amarosa, vice president of public affairs for TruePosition Inc., 
which has opted to develop this kind of technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Other carriers are leaning toward building the technology right  
into the phone handset. The phones then could be pinpointed by the 
Defense Department's Global Positioning System. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies designing the location devices for the handsets say it  
offers even greater accuracy and flexibility for future advances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It lends itself very readily to continual upgrades,'' said  
Ellen Kirk, vice president of marketing and strategic planning for 
the San Jose-based SnapTrack Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But such a plan also would require wireless customers either to  
replace or upgrade the phones they have. For this reason, 
regulators also must consider how such a system would be phased in. 
</P>
<P>
	Some privacy advocates have raised concerns that there exists  
the potential for abuse in a system that has network-wide location 
tracking built in. But industry leaders say companies are only 
going to be using the technology to find people who want to be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	``We operate in a very competitive market. I don't think any  
carrier would be dumb enough to try and do that,'' said Michael 
Altschul, vice president of the Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Public safety officials say their main concern is to see that  
the safety enhancement makes its way to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clear goal is to jump start this process and to see  
location technology arrive on the scene,'' said Joe Hanna, 
president of the Association of Public-Safety Communications 
Officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters, the FCC today:  
</P>
<P>
	--Decided what pieces of their network Bell companies and other  
major local phone providers must make available for rivals to 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
	--Voted to provide U.S. companies with direct access to the  
international satellite consortium Intelsat, allowing it to bypass 
Comsat Corp. for services. The commission also authorized defense 
contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. to purchase up to 49 percent of 
Comsat. 
</P>
<P>
	--Largely kept in place its limits on how much spectrum can be  
licensed by a single wireless carrier within a particular 
geographic area.

<HEADLINE> Developer Barred From Paying Jurors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge ruled that millionaire developer Abraham  
Hirschfeld cannot give jurors money after his murder-for-hire 
trial, a question that came up after he offered $2,500 to each 
member of a jury that deadlocked on an earlier trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirschfeld's attorney said state Supreme Court Justice Carol  
Berkman has no authority to tell the defendant what he may do as a 
private citizen after trial if he is acquitted, and some legal 
authorities said he had a point. 
</P>
<P>
	Her order was issued Monday and reaffirmed Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that Hirschfeld's gifts to jurors might not  
be strictly illegal, Berkman said the actions ``don't pass the 
smell test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said she was just trying to ensure a fair trial. She  
said she did not want potential jurors coming to court and 
wondering, ``Will I get paid for this case, and how much?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the case before Berkman, Hirschfeld is charged with trying to  
hire a hitman to kill former business partner Stanley Stahl. Stahl 
died of natural causes this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the quirky parking lot tycoon -- whose offer  
to give Paula Jones $1 million to settle her lawsuit against 
President Clinton was rebuffed -- gave $2,500 to 10 members of a 
jury that deadlocked over whether he was guilty of tax fraud. Two 
jurors turned down the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirschfeld's lawyer, Arthur Aidala, said nothing gives a judge  
the authority to tell jurors what they may not do after they are 
discharged from service. If they want to accept a gift from 
Hirschfeld, that is their right, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't order people not to do something because it smells  
bad,'' said Professor H. Richard Uviller of Columbia University's 
Law School.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Roddy Doyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Three years have passed since the world  
last heard from Roddy Doyle, who from his coarse-witted debut, 
``The Commitments,'' has always rooted his best-selling books in 
the everyday urban Dublin he knows so well. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle's ear for authentically earthy, screenplay-friendly  
dialogue remains evident in his latest novel. But in many ways, ``A 
Star Called Henry'' takes the schoolteacher-turned-author into 
ambitious new territory certain to win him new fans -- and lose him 
some old ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle is billing the novel as the first in a trilogy to follow  
the larger-than-life travails of Dublin slum kid Henry Smart and, 
through him, to depict the divisive, bloody birth of an independent 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to emulate Charles Dickens, to write about a very old  
man, and go right from the very beginning of his life to the end. 
It became a bigger book than I thought it would be,'' Doyle, 41, 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle has no feel for how compelling his fictional hero will  
prove to others, ``but I've become so engrossed in the character 
that I won't let Henry Smart go until he's finished,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many of his creations, Doyle -- with his close-shaven  
head, round wire-framed specs and single stud earring -- gives 
people the impression of being a fairly dogged, stubborn Dub 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been crafting his new trilogy since 1995, when he  
finished ``The Woman Who Walked Into Doors,'' about a Dublin mother 
trapped in a brutally abusive marriage. He considers that his best 
book, though it fared least well overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	He claims not to care how well ``Henry'' sells internationally  
either, though it has already received immediate critical acclaim 
in his homeland and risen to the top of best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales is no way to measure the success of anything, except  
maybe bread,'' he said dismissively. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle takes lasting comfort from the worldwide triumph of  
``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' his 1993 portrait of a boy coping with 
the collapse of his parents' marriage, which won the Booker, 
Britain's top literary prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never write a more successful book than `Paddy Clarke.' I  
know that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with the enduring popularity of his career-launching  
trilogy of wisecracking tales set in his native north Dublin -- 
``The Commitments,'' ``The Snapper'' and ``The Van'' -- Doyle today 
has the financial freedom to write what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Henry,'' Doyle is at his most grim, brutal and morally  
gray. His portrait of tenement life in early 20th-century Dublin, 
in which the child Henry must survive as a rat-catching, 
cattle-thieving orphan, makes the crushing poverty of Frank 
McCourt's 1950s Limerick in ``Angela's Ashes'' seem downright 
comfy. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry is a survivor, intelligent and strong beyond his years. He  
also has a hint of both Leonard Zelig and Forrest Gump in him: He's 
near the center of threshold events, but never really in the frame. 
</P>
<P>
	A natural born killer, Henry survives the rebel Easter Rising of  
1916 and graduates into the ranks of Irish Republican Army leader 
Michael Collins' hand-picked assassins, executing men in their beds 
or on lonely roadsides as part of the rebels' merciless and 
ultimately successful campaign to wrest most of Ireland from 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, Doyle cuts Ireland's founding fathers down to  
size and skewers several romantic notions held sacred by Irish 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry describes the original leaders of the IRA and its  
affiliated Sinn Fein party as ``a little gang of cranky nuts and 
bad poets'' made attractive only by the British authorities' 
tendency to execute them. 
</P>
<P>
	Eamon de Valera appears briefly alongside Henry who, nonplussed,  
notes simply that the future leader of the Irish Republic was 
wearing red socks and smelled bad. 
</P>
<P>
	By the bitter end of this breakneck-paced novel, Henry has  
discovered that his leaders have no intention of making Ireland a 
more equal or free society. His protege in the IRA, Ivan, has 
graduated from landless country bumpkin into a scheming 
power-broker and racketeer lording it over his home county of 
Tipperary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have cattle, land, a cut of the creameries, pubs. Every  
bloody thing. I'm even on the Sunday collections. ... Nobody works 
without the nod from Ivan,'' he tells Henry, who in the same 
illusion-shattering conversation learns his bosses in Dublin want 
him dead. 
</P>
<P>
	An impressively eclectic bibliography at the end of the book  
testifies to Doyle's efforts to reconstruct a period and place that 
has been largely wiped from the face of modern, economically 
booming Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
	One conclusion Doyle hits hard, in keeping with his  
working-class and socialist sympathies, is that the IRA's fight for 
independence was led by power-hungry opportunists who replaced the 
injustices of British rule with their own corrupt, conservative 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must admit, though, I'm very happy living in the Republic of  
Ireland,'' Doyle said. ``I live with the consequences of all that 
violence, and I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I wanted to face the reality of that violence. I didn't  
want to glamorize it. I wanted to do away with the innocent picture 
that I was given when I was a kid about the battle between the 
goodies and the baddies. In `Henry,' there's good in the bad, and 
bad in the good -- human beings, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle is unconcerned that foreign readers may not know enough  
about his country's past to get it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, people who aren't familiar with Irish history are  
going to come up against the fence in this book and wonder what 
it's all about,'' he said. ``But I tried to keep the history 
lessons to a minimum. And fiction makes bad history anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no real place for footnotes in fiction. I just write  
as clearly as I possibly can do. I tend not to think about 
potential audiences abroad. ... When I read `War and Peace' as a 
kid, I didn't know who all these generals were, but I still had a 
ball reading it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle has just finished a screenplay, a romantic comedy called  
``When Brendan Met Trudy.'' The movie is set in Dublin and filming 
is about to start. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also well into his second volume of the trilogy, in which  
Henry Smart sets sail first for England, then the United States, 
presumably to cast an iconoclastic eye on the immigrant experience 
-- and to stretch his creator's literary skills even farther. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle said he's considering moving his wife and three children  
temporarily to America to do research and to discover, he joked, 
``what it's like to live someplace where summer's not exactly the 
same as winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	An excerpt from Roddy Doyle's historical novel ``A Star Called  
Henry.'' Here, the fictional protagonist describes how his IRA 
boss, the real-life Michael Collins, outwits Dublin's police 
(``rozzers'') by hiding in plain sight: 

</P>
<P>
	``Collins was full of plans and skits that dropped us there with  
admiration, obvious notions that no one ever worded but him. He 
slept in the beds of men who'd just been arrested -- the rozzers 
would never search the same house twice in a night, especially when 
they'd found their man the first time. The safest bed in town, he 
said. He was a plastic man. Everyone knew him but no one could 
describe him. His hair was brown, fair and black. He was broad but 
not particularly tall; he was the tallest man in the room. He grew 
a moustache and the years grew with it; he filled out, became 
middle-aged. He shaved it and became a lad again, much too young to 
be Michael Collins. He smiled at the rozzers when he met them at 
the roadblocks; he helped them in every detail; he joined them. He 
never hid in a coat, behind a collar. 
</P>
<P>
	``---- Michael Collins, he said once in answer to a young, fresh  
rozzer's inquiry. I was with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He laughed. We laughed. They laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	``---- I'm just having you on, he said. In a cap or muffler or  
less impressive in the overcoat, he'd have got a butt of a rifle in 
the chops. Not Mick, though. He was a company director, a man about 
town, a class above them and one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``---- Michael Collins, I said to the same question.  
</P>
<P>
	``They laughed again. They let me get away with it because I was  
with Michael Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``---- Keep it up, lads, said Collins as we passed through the  
block. ---- You'll soon catch the bastard. And you can give him a 
root in the hole for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``---- Good-night, sir.''

<HEADLINE> Luise Rainer: A Legend Looks Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Luise Rainer was in San Francisco with husband  
Clifford Odets in 1938 when she got news of her second consecutive 
Academy Award for best actress. But a night of triumph soon became 
one of tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clifford had just had a great fight with me and told me how no  
good I was and all that,'' Rainer says of her stormy marriage to 
the seminal American playwright of ``Awake and Sing'' and ``Waiting 
for Lefty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By golly,'' she says, her recollection clear, her exuberance  
unbridled, ``I phoned home (in Los Angeles) and was told I must 
come home right away because the papers were asking, `Was I 
shunning or not caring about the Academy?' I hadn't even dreamed of 
getting another Academy Award, and there I was unhappy in my 
private life and miserable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In those days, winners were announced hours before the ceremony  
began at around 11 p.m. So despite her domestic distress, Rainer 
had enough time to drive to Los Angeles and accept her trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember Odets drove me three times around the Biltmore,  
where the Oscars were given out, because I was so full of tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainer sits forward, as if ready for her close-up, in a regally  
appointed apartment that this particular afternoon functions almost 
as a stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Her innate theatricality undimmed by the years, Rainer doesn't  
so much answer as emote when asked about her emotionally charged 
and often enigmatic life. 
</P>
<P>
	Once known as the ``Viennese teardrop,'' Rainer did what might  
seem unimaginable: Having made history as the first performer ever 
to win back-to-back Academy Awards -- for ``The Great Ziegfeld'' 
(1936) and ``The Good Earth'' (1937) -- she simply walked out of 
show biz and superstardom. 
</P>
<P>
	Five decades later, at 89, she's an aging yet animated beauty in  
a profession that prizes youth. ``It's so ridiculous,'' she says. 
``Today, if you are 31, you're told you can't do a 30-year-old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s, she was a European emigre to the West Coast who  
replaced Myrna Loy in a little-known film called ``Escapade'' and 
went on to beat out Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo for the Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are few very beautiful people,'' says Rainer. ``Garbo  
was one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got two Oscars, they thought, `Oh, they can throw me  
into anything,''' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	But the diminutive theater-trained performer from Dusseldorf,  
Germany, fell foul of MGM impresario Louis B. Mayer and found that 
life on the post-Oscar fast track was a labor not necessarily of 
love. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a seven-year contract that I broke and went away,'' says  
Rainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a machine, practically, a tool in a big, big factory,  
and I could not do anything. I wanted to film `Madame Curie,' but 
Mayer forbade me; I wanted to do `For Whom the Bell Tolls,' but 
(producer David O.) Selznick took Ingrid Bergman and brought her to 
Hemingway and I didn't know Hemingway. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so I left,'' she says. ``I just went away. I fled; yes, I  
fled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ernest Hemingway may be one of the few 20th-century greats whom  
Rainer did not know. 
</P>
<P>
	George Gershwin taught her to sing ``Summertime'' during a drive  
up the California coast. Bertolt Brecht wrote a play for her, ``The 
Caucasian Chalk Circle,'' and offered her the part of Grusha, now 
considered a defining theater role. She turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like Brecht. I never did,'' she says. ``I think he  
wrote some beautiful plays. But I didn't like the black and the 
white, that the rich were black and always went down to hell and 
the poor were white and went up to heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She prefers Anton Chekhov. ``He finds many, many colors in his  
human beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her 20s she befriended the great photographer Alfred  
Stieglitz, and married Clifford Odets, only to divorce him after 
four years. ``I think my first husband suffered under my career,'' 
she says. ``He loved me, I think, as much as he could love.'' After 
the divorce, they remained together for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Federico Fellini and Luchino Visconti were among the  
directors who sought her out, even though she had largely left 
acting behind and married Robert Knittel, an English book publisher 
who was her husband for 45 years until his death a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, a career that ended in the 1940s has been resurrected  
in director Karoly Makk's ``The Gambler,'' a minor adaptation of 
the Dostoyevsky story, in which she plays a lively grandmother 
opposite Michael Gambon, Dominic West and Polly Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Supposedly, I stole the film, which is a nice idea,'' she  
says. ``I like stealing a film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is she glad to be back in the movies?  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I missed it,'' she says. ``It's been terrible not to do  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``I was very happy without working,'' she adds. ``I  
painted, then I wrote; my husband and I traveled a lot. I always 
did something, always.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a lemon-colored pantsuit, she springs from a chair in  
her elegant Chelsea apartment to show a visitor her paintings. One 
of them is a 1973 portrait of a granddaughter now in her 20s and 
pregnant. Rainer will become a great-grandmother shortly before she 
turns 90 in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere sits a row of boxes made by Rainer that recall the  
work of the artist Joseph Cornell. ``He was mad about me,'' she 
says. ``He made a teardrop, a beautiful box, and I left them all 
behind. I didn't know who he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she shows off a collection of stones largely found while  
mountain climbing. ``I do everything for a little and then I get 
tired of it, and I don't do it anymore,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscars sit on a top shelf in her sun-drenched study, one  
slightly shorter than the other. (``Buttock fatigue,'' is Rainer's 
droll explanation.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Leave them alone,'' she says, preferring to point out other  
honors -- commendations from the German and Austrian governments, a 
1944 letter from the American Red Cross honoring her. 
</P>
<P>
	She began her career on the European stage under the tutelage of  
the celebrated director Max Reinhardt, then made a few films in 
Germany before being brought to Hollywood in the mid-1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Film is a fantastic medium, but I was unaware of that when I  
walked out after three years,'' she says. ``I was unaware until 
much later how many human beings I was able to reach with the 
little I did and how many humans seemed to be grateful or happy 
that I was permitted to give. All of that only came much, much 
later to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an era in which screen goddesses tended to stick to one  
persona, Rainer reinvented herself with the versatility of a Meryl 
Streep. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Great Ziegfeld,'' she was Anna Held, first wife to the  
impresario Florenz Ziegfeld. More than six decades later, her teary 
telephone call congratulating Ziegfeld on his second marriage is 
considered a classic. It is also considered the scene that won her 
the Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, she donned peasant garb to play O-lan, the  
virtuous spouse in ``The Good Earth,'' adapted from Pearl S. Buck's 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing more wonderful to give out, to give out what  
is in you,'' says Rainer. ``I still get fan mail from 50 years ago 
-- not from now, not from `The Gambler.' I still get two to five 
letters a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many people her age might stay close to home, she is  
always on the move. Last September, she spoke at a retrospective of 
her work at London's National Film Theater. Her beaded brocade cap 
is a frequent sight at major opening nights, unless she's on the 
road visiting friends and relatives in the United States or heading 
to a South African safari. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's full of life. She's full of energy,'' says Nicholas  
Dromgoole, an English dance critic and friend of Rainer. 
</P>
<P>
	On the street, ``She's like a power walker; it's difficult to  
keep up with her,'' says another friend, Michael Tilson Thomas, the 
American conductor. 
</P>
<P>
	Memoirs? ``I can't do it. There's too much; I don't know where  
to start. I've written 125 typewritten pages, and I'm at age 22.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps there are far too many adventures still ahead to let her  
dwell on the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I function like an animal,'' she says. ``I function by  
instinct, by intuition. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Many Sent to Summer School in Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scoring errors on school tests last spring may  
have resulted in as many as 3,000 pupils being sent to summer 
school by mistake, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudy Crew, the city schools chancellor, announced the problem in  
a news release Tuesday, but declined to answer questions. An aide 
estimated that about 10 percent of the 300,000 tests were graded 
erroneously by test publisher CTBMcGraw-Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monterey, Calif.-based company confirmed that similar  
scoring errors had occurred elsewhere in the country, but spokesman 
Steven Weiss refused to say where. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss said the scoring mistake was a mathematical error that  
occurred when individual students' raw scores were compared with a 
national norm. He said students' scores would rise modestly when 
recalibrated. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they were told of the discrepancy this  
week by CTB-McGraw Hill. The board is still trying to determine how 
many children were affected and doesn't plan to notify students 
until a figure is confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew on Tuesday also called for an independent audit of  
CTB-McGraw Hill, which received more than $2 million from the 
school board in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The scoring mistakes add yet another kink in Crew's plan to end  
automatic promotion of failing students. 
</P>
<P>
	Test scores last spring had determined that 35,000 students had  
failed the year and would have to attend summer school. In 
mid-August, Crew said most summer schoolers would pass on to the 
next grade. 
</P>
<P>
	But he had to revise his estimate this month, saying 60 percent  
of summer school students would have to repeat their current grade. 
The change was largely the result of 14,000 students who either 
didn't show up at summer school or who didn't take the tests.

<HEADLINE> Vols: Gators Defense Won't Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin has  
seen the eye-popping stats, and he's certain things will be 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	No way does he expect to see the same Florida defense that ranks  
last in the Southeastern Conference when the No. 2 Vols play the 
No. 4 Gators on Saturday in Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Against us they're always faster, they're always bigger, and  
they always go to the right places,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Theories vary as to how the Gators, with 10 new defensive  
starters, yielded 865 yards to Western Michigan and Central 
Florida. Practically all of it, 784 yards, was in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it was due to the nature of the games we've had (29- and  
31-point victories),'' Florida coach Steve Spurrier said. ``Maybe 
we're just not very good covering passes right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Western Michigan threw for 405 yards, 314 of it in the first  
half of what was at the time a tight game. By the second game, the 
defense tightened even though Central Florida threw for 379 yards, 
almost all of it came after Florida was comfortably ahead and 
playing substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen a team just drive, drive, drive against that  
defense, but they did give up big plays,'' Martin said. ``But you 
can forget about all the games they've played. It's going to be a 
different Florida defense out there Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee also knows Florida didn't go all out against two  
lesser opponents. And even Gators defensive coordinator Jon Hoke 
admits as much. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more things in the game plan'' this weekend, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much is made of all the new Florida starters, but there is still  
a good deal of experience on the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the starters are sophomores. All of them played last  
year as freshmen, which says a lot about their abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	On the defensive line, Derrick Chambers, Buck Gurley, Gerard  
Warren and Alex Brown had eight starts among them going into the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren will play for the first time this year following a  
two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	The new linebackers -- Keith Kelsey, Andra Davis and Eugene  
McCaslin -- replace three players who are all in the NFL now. 
</P>
<P>
	In the defensive backfield, all four starters started at least  
one game before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're awfully good,'' Tennessee offensive coordinator Randy  
Sanders said. ``You hear about them losing 10 starters, but they've 
got 14, 15 or 16 guys who have played against us. It's not like 
they're devoid of talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's 20-17 overtime victory over the Gators, Tennessee  
was conservative on offense. The Vols gained 235 yards on 54 plays, 
the second-lowest number of plays all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, making the second start of his career, was 7-of-20 for  
64 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched that game five or six times this week,'' he said.  
``There was so much of me that was missing. I feel bad about that 
game, but we won, so I feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point in his career Tennessee was not asking Martin to  
do much. He faces a bigger burden Saturday, and his numbers suggest 
he has come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
	He has thrown for at least 200 yards in his last four games.  
Over the last 10 games, he has completed 63 percent of his passes 
with 14 touchdowns and four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into this game last season I had confidence, but only in  
what I was doing at the time,'' Martin said. ``I'm a much smarter 
quarterback with more experience now. The offense is better now 
because of my progress.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Hall of Famer Quackenbush Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Bill Quackenbush, a Hall of Famer and one of  
the least penalized defensemen in NHL history, has died at 77. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Sunday at Chandler Hall Hospice.  
</P>
<P>
	Quackenbush played for Detroit and Boston in a 13-year NHL  
career. He joined the Red Wings in 1942 and retired in 1956 after 
seven seasons with the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	He once went 132 consecutive games without a penalty. In 1949,  
he became the first defenseman to receive the Lady Byng Trophy for 
ability and sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	Quackenbush had 62 goals and 222 assists in 774 games during his  
career. He played in eight All-Star games and was inducted into the 
Hall of Fame in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a hockey and golf coach at Princeton from 1967 to 1985,  
leading the men's golf team to five Ivy League titles and the 
women's hockey team to three. 
</P>
<P>
	Quackenbush was born in Toronto and lived in Lawrenceville, N.J.  
A memorial service will be held on Oct. 3 at the Lawrenceville 
School Chapel.

<HEADLINE> Case May Run Ravens' Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- A month ago, Stoney Case was a  
quarterback looking for a job. Now he's one snap away from running 
the Baltimore Ravens' offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Case had nowhere to turn after the Indianapolis Colts cut him  
after their first exhibition game. He finally found a home in 
Baltimore, where he was promptly assigned the No. 4 spot on the 
depth chart behind Scott Mitchell, Tony Banks and Wally Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just hoping to get picked up by somebody quickly where I  
could go in and compete for a roster spot,'' Case recalled 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after Case signed a one-year, $400,000 contract, the Ravens  
released Richardson. Case displaced Banks as the backup to Scott 
Mitchell on the strength of two straight miracle finishes in 
exhibition games in which he threw the winning touchdown passes in 
the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell struggled mightily in the Ravens' 27-10 season-opening  
loss to the St. Louis Rams, and now many fans are clamoring for 
coach Brian Billick to give the starting job to Case. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick is impressed with how Case has learned the system, and  
has plenty of nice things to say about the talent and poise of the 
fourth-year player. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got all the parts. Size, vision, athleticism,  
intelligence, quick release strong arm,'' Billick said. ``He's done 
some excellent things out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Billick is sticking with Mitchell for Sunday's game against  
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scott Mitchell is the starting quarterback. If Scott gets  
hurt, Stoney Case will go in,'' Billick said. ``But right now, I 
can't imagine why Scott Mitchell would come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Mitchell plays as poorly as last week -- 17-for-40 for 188  
yards and two interceptions -- then he might suffer the same fate as 
last year, when he was benched by Detroit Lions coach Bobby Ross 
after two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, one of the reasons Case decided to sign with Baltimore  
is that Mitchell and Banks have absolutely no history with Billick 
or the Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to Jacksonville, and they definitely had a franchise  
quarterback (Mark Brunell),'' Case said. ``Here, there were a bunch 
of guys with one-year contracts and a new coaching staff and a new 
offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case, 29, has made a career out of being a backup. Since being  
drafted in the third round in 1995 by Arizona, he has played in 
four games, starting one, and hasn't thrown a pass in an NFL game 
since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	After riding the bench as the third-string quarterback in  
Arizona last season, Case signed a two-year, $2 million contract 
with Indianapolis that included a $500,000 signing bonus. But the 
Colts released him after signing Steve Walsh as a backup to Peyton 
Manning. 
</P>
<P>
	Things couldn't have worked out better for Case, who kept the  
half-million bucks the Colts gave him and worked his way up the 
depth chart in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have been going pretty well for me. I've gotten some  
breaks and I've played well when I've had the chance,'' Case said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has no idea when his next opportunity will come up, but he  
plans to be ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always ready to go, doesn't matter if No. 3, or 2 or 1,''  
Case said. ``I'm going to prepare as if I'm the starter. Whether I 
play or not, I can't control anything but myself.''

<HEADLINE> Life Close To Land Is Spiritual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANNING, Mich. (AP) -- A breeze rustles the swamp grass as Mike  
Nowak lifts a trap from the gurgling stream and removes a beaver 
nabbed during the night. With a practiced flick of the wrists, he 
swings the sodden carcass over his shoulder into a woven basket 
strapped to his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Animals are very special to me,'' the burly trapper says.  
``All my meat has come strictly off the land, so I respect the 
animals. They give up their life for you, to feed and clothe you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One might consider Nowak a throwback to the 17th century  
coureurs de bois, those French hunters and trappers among the first 
Europeans to explore the upper Great Lakes region. They got along 
well with native Indians, respecting their customs and 
spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the 52-year-old outdoorsman also represents a very modern  
cultural phenomenon: Americans who turn away from the high-tech, 
urban fast track for the less materialistic ways of the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowak doesn't completely reject modernity or capitalism. He  
drives a battered Jeep and adores tinkering with Harley-Davidsons. 
He's a small-businessman, making and selling products made of 
animal furs and horns. 
</P>
<P>
	He earns a little extra money doing construction work in the  
summer, when hunting is out of season and animal furs aren't prime 
for trapping. ``But when Oct. 1 comes, I kind of roll that clock 
back 100 years and try to live that way,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a cramped trailer with a wood stove on a 40-acre farm in  
northern Dickinson County. It's next to the house where he grew up, 
and where his 88-year-old father still lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowak takes pride in growing, gathering, catching, trapping or  
shooting nearly all of his food. ``My grocery bill seldom goes over 
$15 a week,'' he says. ``All I buy is bread and milk and cooking 
spices. Could make my bread but don't want to take the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan's Upper Peninsula is ideally suited for living off the  
land. Although dotted with towns, most are small; the largest city, 
Marquette, has only about 21,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 85 percent of the peninsula is forested. Wildlife is  
abundant, and there's always a river or lake nearby full of fish. 
Despite a short growing season, farmers raise corn, hay, potatoes 
and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers say the U.P.'s back-to-nature enthusiasts tend to be  
either traditional hunter-trappers such as Nowak or people of a 
more liberal bent who might embrace vegetarianism or environmental 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of motivation, this rural life is not for the  
fainthearted. Winters can be brutal. Self-reliance and ``sisu,'' a 
Finnish expression for gutsy perseverance, are the watchwords for 
yoopers who tough it out. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem for Nowak, who looks the part with his weathered  
visage and deep-set blue eyes. He rises before sunup and walks 
several miles a day, regardless of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	His pantry is stocked with canned vegetables from the garden,  
his freezer packed with meat. His taste for wild game ranges from 
beaver to bobcat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Woodchuck, too,'' he says. ``They say it's a rodent, but I  
tell you it's the best-tasting rodent you'll ever eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today for lunch he pan-fries bluegill, served with home-grown  
potatoes and green beans and homemade applesauce and pickles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked a doctor one time why there's so much cancer, and he  
said the air we breathe and the food we eat,'' he says. ``Can't do 
much about the air, but you sure can control what goes into your 
body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nowak was hunting and fishing with his father before he started  
first grade. But when he graduated from high school in 1964, city 
lights beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent much of the next 15 years as a bricklayer in Reno,  
Nev., before returning to the Upper Peninsula for good. ``Best move 
I ever made,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite by accident, he became an entrepreneur in the mid-1980s  
after making himself mittens from coyote fur and a coat and hat 
from beaver pelts. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends began placing orders, and soon he was turning out hardy  
woodsman's garments with furs from otters, foxes and other 
critters. Demand grew, especially after he was featured in a couple 
of outdoor publications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting so busy I couldn't get out in the woods any  
more, so I hired a woman to do the sewing,'' Nowak says. ``Now it's 
gotten so big that I have to buy fur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also hit on the idea of using thin strips of beaver hair as  
bowstring silencers -- devices that eliminate the twang that can 
startle a deer in the second between when an arrow is shot and when 
it strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another product line: jewelry and knife handles made with deer,  
elk and moose horns, in keeping with Nowak's belief that no part of 
an animal should go to waste. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowak uses a distributor to get his bowstring silencers into  
sporting goods stores across the country. He sells his other 
products via mail-order. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he has no interest in being so successful that he  
loses touch with the simple life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes my income's just $5,000 or $6,000 a year, but it's  
like $50,000 or $60,000 to somebody else because I don't have too 
many expenses. I can live like a king off that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Checking his traps, he pauses to pick wild cranberries and watch  
honking Canada geese soar over a nearby lake. Cedar and birch 
stumps gnawed by beavers litter the boggy landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I haven't had a drink in 24 years,'' he says. ``I  
speak to school classes sometimes, and I tell them nature's the 
best high there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sets another trap in a narrow, two-foot-deep channel flowing  
into the lake, concealing it with swamp grass, hammering stakes on 
both sides to keep swimming beaver from bypassing it. Finishing the 
job, he grins contentedly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great life, buddy. The only bad thing is I'm probably  
halfway through it. Where does the time go?''

<HEADLINE> Longs Buying Calif. Rite Aid Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (AP) -- Longs Drug Stores announced an  
agreement on Wednesday to buy 38 Rite Aid stores in California for 
$186 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which is subject to approval by regulators and the  
boards of both companies, includes five Rite Aid stores in the Los 
Angeles area and 33 in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our expertise is operating smaller traditional drugstores,''  
said Rite Aid President Timothy J. Noonan. ``This transaction will 
allow us to divest some of the larger former Payless stores which 
have not been meeting our financial goals and are not consistent 
with our long-term strategic plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Rite Aid bought Thirfty Payless stores for $2.5  
billion, but sales at the spacious West Coast stores have been 
flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, which has about 3,800 stores in 30 states, has been  
the subject of merger or downsizing rumors after a year of 
disappointing earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Rite Aid reported a 39 percent drop in fourth-quarter  
earnings -- from $119.7 million to $73 million -- attributed to a 
store opening spree. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Camp Hill, Pa.-based Rite Aid restated its earnings  
downward 9 percent for the year that ended Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sale is finalized, Longs will operate approximately 420  
stores in six Western states.

different paths to become the top picks in NFL drafts. Bledsoe 
spent two years in college, while Manning stayed the full four. 
</P>
<P>
	Both decisions appear to be the right ones.  
</P>
<P>
	Bledsoe, in his seventh season, is one of the NFL's best  
quarterbacks. Manning, in his second season, may not need much more 
time to be just as good. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was definitely more successful in his rookie season than I  
was. I think he had maybe the best rookie season of any quarterback 
ever,'' Bledsoe said Wednesday. ``Peyton lookes very good. He 
progressed very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manning's stock could increase even more if he can lead the  
Indianapolis Colts to a win on the road Sunday against Bledsoe and 
the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Manning set NFL rookie records for completions,  
attempts, passing yards, touchdown passes and consecutive games 
with at least one touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
	He started his second season impressively by throwing for 284  
yards and two touchdowns in a 31-14 win over Buffalo last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	This would be Manning's third season if he had decided to leave  
Tennessee for the NFL after his junior year. Bledsoe, who left 
Washington State after his sophomore season, was one of the people 
Manning talked to before making his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in an entirely different situation than I was in where  
he was coming back to a team that had a chance to win a national 
championship,'' Bledsoe said. ``At Washington State, we weren't 
coming back to win a national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Bledsoe entered the 1993 draft and started 12 games for the  
Patriots as a rookie. He was picked for the Pro Bowl in his second 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning played his senior year at Tennessee then was chosen  
first overall in the 1998 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice to talk to Drew'' before deciding to stay in  
school, Manning said. ``The main thing he said is, `just do what 
you want to do. Do it and don't think twice about it. You're going 
to struggle your rookie year, no matter what.' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to talk to Drew, a guy who had been in a similar  
situation,'' Manning added. ``I did what I wanted to do. I wanted 
to be a senior in college ... have another year to get more ready 
for the NFL and I'm glad that I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manning threw more interceptions (28) than touchdowns (26) as  
the Colts went 3-13 last season, but he took all the team's snaps 
and got better as the season went on. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to play a rookie quarteerback, you've got to  
be willing to stick with him through all the mistakes and let him 
play through that stuff,'' Bledsoe said. ``If you put a guy out 
there and, all of a sudden, he's looking over his shoulder like 
maybe he's going to be benched at some point, then you get into 
some real trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis coach Jim Mora stuck with Manning, who learned  
through all his adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You knew that he was going to be special at some point,'' Mora  
said. ``So that allowed you to have the patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts have 10 new starters and appear considerably stronger  
than last season, when they finished last in the AFC East. One of 
them, Edgerrin James, rushed for 112 yards in his NFL debut against 
the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to continue to develop the team around'' Manning,  
Bledsoe said. ``I've been fortunate enough with the Patriots to 
have some very good teams around me and if they can continue to 
develop the players around Peyton, I think he's got all the ability 
to take them to where they want to be.''

<HEADLINE> Huskers' Buckhalter No. 2 Tailback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Correll Buckhalter's timing in ending his  
brief hiatus from Nebraska's football team turned out to be better 
than he or his teammates expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckhalter, back from a one-game suspension for skipping  
practices, is now the No. 2 running back in the Cornhuskers' 
``I-back'' formation after the departure of starter DeAngelo Evans, 
who abruptly quit the team just two games into the season. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not how Buckhalter, who led Nebraska in rushing a year  
ago, pictured moving back up the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel good about DeAngelo leaving the team (and) making  
my role on this team better,'' Buckhalter said. ``I hope DeAngelo 
comes back and doesn't go out like the way it's going right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nebraska coach Frank Solich said it's unlikely Evans will  
return to the team, leaving the No. 4 Cornhuskers with new starter 
Dan Alexander and Buckhalter as the only experienced I-backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that can very easily happen,'' said Solich, who  
had to do the I-back shuffle last year when Evans and Alexander 
went down with injuries. Buckhalter ended up playing 12 games 
despite an injured hamstring, a hip pointer and torn bursa sacs in 
both elbows and finished with 799 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``What always looks like a deep position all of a sudden can  
turn into one that's not too deep,'' Solich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solich suspended Buckhalter from last week's 45-0 shutout of  
California. Buckhalter, who said he was frustrated after getting 
just three carries as the Cornhuskers blew out Iowa 42-7 in the 
season opener, didn't come to practice until the following Thursday 
and Solich said he thought Buckhalter might have quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't thinking about leaving. I was just under a lot of  
frustration. I thought I should have played a lot more in the Iowa 
game than I did,'' Buckhalter said. ``I just took some wrong steps 
by not showing up and not communicating with anybody. Which was bad 
on my part because it caused a lot of confusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solich and Buckhalter sorted out their issues and Buckhalter, a  
junior from Collins, Miss., will be back in the lineup on Saturday 
when Southern Mississippi visits Memorial Stadium. Buckhalter says 
Southern Miss was his second choice as a recruit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The night before we signed the letter of intent I wrote down  
some positive things about Nebraska and some positive things about 
USM -- and some negative things also,'' he said. ``I just prayed, 
whenever I woke up the next morning, the team that I felt I should 
play with and that was the decision that I made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Mississippi is the school where Buckhalter's brother,  
Chris, was a running back earlier this decade. Chris Buckhalter led 
the Golden Eagles in rushing in 1994 and 1995 and finished with 
1,533 career rushing yards. In August he was sentenced to 20 years 
in prison after pleading guilty to a charge of manslaughter in a 
1997 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Correll Buckhalter wants to concentrate on football and not his  
brother's troubles. He says he's looking forward to playing against 
Southern Miss, the Conference USA champions in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a lot of great players down there. I think it's just  
the conference that they're in that doesn't let them get the 
recognition like other schools in the Big 12 or Big 10 or SEC,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckhalter, who grew up about 30 miles northwest of the USM  
campus in Hattiesburg, Miss., is glad it's a home game for the 
Cornhuskers for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the game was played in Hattiesburg I don't think that I'd  
have enough tickets,'' he said. ``I'm kind of happy that we're 
playing here in Lincoln and can show some of those guys the type of 
atmosphere that I play in here in Nebraska.''

<HEADLINE> Odwalla Juices Get New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALF MOON BAY, Calif. (AP) -- Nearly three years ago, Odwalla  
Inc. was on the brink of disaster, known more for a deadly E. coli 
outbreak than for its ``Strawberry C Monster,'' ``Femme Vitale'' 
and ``Rooty Fruity'' juice drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the company that helped establish the premium natural juice  
and fruit smoothie category is trying to set itself apart from 
competitors such as Fresh Samantha and Naked Juice, which grabbed 
market share while Odwalla was mired in lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Odwalla has unveiled a new, slimmer bottle with a screw cap and  
a bolder, more colorful label. The bottles cost twice as much to 
make, but the drinks' prices -- usually between about $1.69 and 
$2.99 -- will remain the same. To compensate, the 16-ounce version 
now holds 15.2 ounces and the old 12-ounce contains 11 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
	Some customers have called to complain about the smaller sizes,  
but others have praised the new caps, which replaced a snap-off 
version that leaked, company spokeswoman Erin Markey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new design also provides for a longer shelf-life. The old  
bottles kept juice fresh for 12-17 days, depending on the flavor. 
These new bottles, which are also recyclable, have a nylon lining 
and keep juice fresh for 22-30 days, Odwalla says. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Hemphill of the New York-based Beverage Marketing Corp.,  
which compiles and analyzes sales data, anticipates Odwalla's sales 
will reach $67 million by year's end. That would represent a 13 
percent increase over 1998 sales of $59.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some companies never recover from something like that and I  
think they have,'' Hemphill said. ``It certainly takes time to win 
back the confidence of consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the company's stock, which closed Wednesday at $7.37 1/2,  
has been stuck at less than half of what it traded for in 1996, 
before a Colorado girl died and 66 others were sickened by bacteria 
in Odwalla's unpasteurized apple juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Odwalla's immediate apology and product recall --  
Chairman and CEO Stephen Williamson says trucks were picking up 
juice from stores a half-hour after the company learned of the E. 
coli link -- sales plunged. 
</P>
<P>
	Odwalla later began flash pasteurizing its apple juices, a  
process it said keeps juices fresher and more nutritious than 
traditional pasteurization. And this week, it expanded the process 
to the citrus line, selling both flash pasteurized and fresh 
versions of orange, grapefruit and tangerine drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Odwalla's sales had been growing at about 40 percent a year  
before the outbreak, which depressed sales to about 10 percent of 
what they had been. It took until this latest fiscal year for sales 
to exceed 1996 levels, Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's product line has expanded to include energy bars  
and dairy-free shakes, a wellness drink loaded with vitamin C and 
echinacea to fight colds, and several fruit and vegetable blends. 
One of the latest, to be introduced to stores on Sept. 30, is 
``Serious Energy,'' combines exotic mushrooms, green tea and 
ginseng. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Odwalla expects to lose money the first half of 1999,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a scar and it's going to be here forever,'' Williamson  
said. ``It's important that we remember that, express our sorrow 
and behave in a responsible way.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Lower; Dow Down 0.31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as a tame report  
on inflation only briefly eased fears that the Federal Reserve will 
raise interest rates. Technology shares led the decline, giving up 
some of Tuesday's sharp gains, and the dollar's continued weakness 
against the Japanese yen also undercut stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 0.31 at 10,910.02. The index had fallen back from 
an early gain of 103 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 4.80 at 1,331.49, while the Nasdaq composite 
index was down 30.13 at 2,838.16, after climbing more than 23 
points on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially rose today after the Labor Department reported  
that the August increase in its Consumer Price Index -- the most 
closely watched inflation gauge -- matched the 0.3 percent July 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the big gains in the gasoline and energy categories,  
prices rose a mere 0.1 percent in August, well below what Wall 
Street economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The news initially calmed worries that the Fed will need to  
boost interest rates for the third time this year as it tries to 
prevent inflation from escalating. Financial stocks, which can 
benefit from stable interest rates, rose. J.P. Morgan gained 1 3/4 to 
123 3/4, and Chase Manhattan rose 1 1/8 to 78 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	But continued weakness in the dollar helped turn stocks lower  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Today in New York, the dollar was trading at 104.29 yen, down  
from 105.79 yen late Tuesday and the lowest level against the 
Japanese currency in more than three years. Although the dollar has 
held up well against European currencies, its slide against the yen 
has added to the pressure on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors fear a weaker dollar because it makes imports more  
expensive, setting the stage for price inflation. It can also make 
foreign investors in U.S. stocks more likely to put their money in 
domestic investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation-sensitive bond market fluctuated wildly, with  
yields on 30-year Treasury bonds dropping to 6.08 percent after the 
release of the consumer price report, then edging back up to 6.11 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle fell 3 9/16 to 41 7/8 after the company's fiscal  
first-quarter earnings, reported after markets closed Tuesday, 
failed to meet the most optimistic predictions of Wall Street 
analysts. Oracle earned 16 cents per share, in line with the 
published earnings estimates, but short of the ``whisper'' number, 
an unofficial forecast circulated among Wall Street traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;  
Co. in Kansas City, said the Nasdaq's decline was to be expected 
after the index bounded to a new closing high of 2,887.06 last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A limited number of technology stocks have led the Nasdaq  
higher,'' he said. Some of the leading technology shares already 
have risen so far that ``they are prone to pullbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were nearly even with decliners on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 377.72 million shares at 
midday, ahead of Tuesday's volume. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 0.37 at  
437.87.

<HEADLINE> Some Wayne State Faculty Walk Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The union representing faculty and staff at Wayne  
State University called for a one-day strike on Thursday as it 
tries to gain a more favorable labor contract with the 
30,000-student school. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Thompson, executive director of Local 6075 of the American  
Association of University Professors-American Federation of 
Teachers, said Wednesday the walkout would ``show our resolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne State will remain open, said Provost Marilyn Williamson.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1,687 faculty and staff members at Wayne State are covered  
by the AARP-AFT contract, but only 463 -- about 27 percent -- are 
union members, Ms. Williamson said. The school thinks it can cover 
their work for one day. 
</P>
<P>
	The faculty and staff have been working without a contract since  
July 31. They continued working on day-to-day contract extensions 
until Tuesday, when they voted for the one-day strike, Ms. Thompson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also voted to go on strike indefinitely if a contract  
was not reached by Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Williamson said she hoped state-mediated bargaining would  
produce a new contract before then. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have yet to reach agreement on salaries, the  
length of the new contract and the union's proposal that all newly 
hired faculty members join the union for at least one year.

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttles Safe After Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's space shuttles and hangars  
were safe today following Hurricane Floyd's march up Florida's east 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage at the Kennedy Space Center was minimal, NASA spokesman  
George Diller said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane stayed 103 miles offshore, bringing sustained wind  
of 63 mph, with gusts of 80 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``When this thing goes onshore, wherever it is, we'll find out  
what we missed,'' said Diller, one of about 100 workers who 
volunteered to stay behind to ride out the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	By midmorning, workers had yet to check the two shuttle launch  
pads. But a preliminary inspection of the buildings housing the 
four shuttles and all the equipment for the international space 
station uncovered no serious problems, Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
	A piece of sheet metal blew off the 525-feet-high Vehicle  
Assembly Building early this morning, and the phone lines were down 
a few hours Tuesday night. Sporadic power outages also occurred. 
But that was about it, Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's minimal, very minimal,'' he said. ``You can get this kind  
of damage in a severe thunderstorm. We're just really pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA planned to reopen the space center Thursday morning. The  
center's approximately 12,500 workers were evacuated Monday.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico To Show De La Hoya Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- You can't afford the pay-per-view  
rate to see this weekend's championship boxing match? It's free in 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Rican government said Wednesday it would foot the  
bill for 8,000 poor residents to watch the match between San Juan 
native Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable TV subscribers would otherwise have to pay $50 to see the  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The public screening of Saturday's fight will cost the  
government $72,000, Senate President Charlie Rodriguez said at a 
news conference. The fight will be beamed by satellite from Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is one of Puerto Rico's most popular athletes, and  
excitement over the match has been building since it was announced 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tito Fever,'' as local radio stations have dubbed it,  
coincides with a recent burst of nationalism fueled by protests 
against the U.S. military and the release of 11 pro-independence 
activists jailed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is an American, while Trinidad is a San Juan native.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said lawmakers would distribute 8,000 free tickets on  
a first-come, first-served basis on the capitol steps Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who is running for San Juan mayor, said the tickets  
were meant for poor families, but said the government would not 
require proof of a low income.

<HEADLINE> AmeriCorps Management Is Faulted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal officials running one of President  
Clinton's favorite programs -- the AmeriCorps national volunteer 
service program -- have promised to fix its problems so many times 
they have begun to ``sound like a broken record,'' the chairman of 
a House subcommittee says. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., said he does not doubt that  
thousands of young Americans have done good work through the 
program, which awards college tuition assistance in exchange for 
volunteer service. But he said administrators have failed to 
deliver what was promised. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many AmeriCorps programs are spending taxpayer dollars  
inappropriately,'' Hoekstra said during a hearing Tuesday before 
his panel, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoekstra cited a report from an Indiana student in the Terre  
Haute Tribune-Star that program organizers told her ``she could 
count baby-sitting, lifeguarding and choir practice as AmeriCorps 
volunteerism. Now her education award is in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the investigator in charge of keeping track of AmeriCorps  
said serious management problems continue to trouble the program, 
which Clinton places among his administration's great achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	Audits of the Corporation for National Service, which runs the  
AmeriCorps program, ``revealed that the corporation's financial 
management is inadequate,'' said Luise S. Jordan, the corporation's 
inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriCorps has been a favorite target of some Republicans in  
Congress who say it's silly to pay students to do volunteer work. 
The House voted to eliminate the $533 million that Clinton 
requested for AmeriCorps in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The 
Senate has not yet acted. 
</P>
<P>
	A former chairman of the Corporation for National Service's  
board, defending the program, said it has been working hard to 
correct problems. Furthermore, the program's decentralized 
structure gives state commissions a major role in management and 
oversight of local programs, said Bob Rogers, a Republican who was 
chairman from 1996 to last June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because there are literally thousands of sites at which  
AmeriCorps members serve, it is not feasible, nor was it ever 
envisioned, that the corporation would directly monitor every local 
site,'' Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In such a decentralized structure there will always be a small  
number of incidents of unscrupulous conduct by program 
administrators. And when those people are caught, they are dealt 
with accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said the Corporation for National Service began an effort  
to straighten out its affairs in December, but ``at this time, I 
have no evidence from which I can provide any assurance that the 
material weaknesses have been corrected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That has resulted numerous problems, she said, including poor  
monitoring of volunteer activities at some sites. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, one volunteer received AmeriCorps stipend checks  
even though he was an inmate of an out-of-state prison, Jordan 
said. The volunteer and his project director stole about $4,600 by 
failing to report the volunteer's incarceration and cashing the 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of another AmeriCorps program falsely  
certified that his son had earned two education grants although the 
young man had never served in AmeriCorps. That director also stole 
cash from volunteers by charging them bogus ``activity fees.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-POWs Seek Slave Labor Redress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Claiming they were forced into slave labor by  
Japanese companies, 500 American ex-prisoners of war are seeking an 
apology and millions of dollars from their captors. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, was filed Monday in  
U.S. District Court in Albuquerque, N.M., against five Japanese 
companies. It was described at a New York news conference Tuesday 
as the first aimed at Japanese industrial firms that used POWs to 
produce war goods between 1942 and 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Such actions are illegal under the Geneva Convention and various  
treaties that Japan's wartime government promised to honor, said 
Eli J. Warach, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit embraces families and estates of POWs who died, asks  
compensation for labor and injuries, and would bar the defendants 
from doing business in the United States, but names no money 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions and millions. You can't put a price tag on this,''  
said Warach. ``This is filed not for revenge -- although there is 
some anger -- but to get justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Japanese embassy spokesman Tsuyochi Yamamoto said  
he could not comment on a U.S. legal matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we are well aware of the fact that during World War II we  
committed serious mistakes in colonizing neighboring countries and 
causing tremendous damage and suffering to many countries, 
including the United States,'' Yamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official, who asked not to be identified,  
said the 1951 peace treaty between Japan and the former Allied 
Powers included settlement provisions for most claims over Japan's 
actions during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, the United States compensated ``victims of  
Japanese aggression'' under a program that began in 1948 and 
expired in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.; Mitusi &AMP; Co.,  
Inc.; Mitsubishi International Corp.; Nippon Steel Corp., and Showa 
Denko, were described as the five largest users of POWs in coal 
mines, factories and shipping docks. The five earned $291 billion 
last year, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday in California, three former POWs filed a similar  
lawsuit under a new state law seeking reparation from Mitsubishi 
Corp., the Japanese company that allegedly held them captive during 
World War II. The three also allege they were enslaved. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. records show more than 50,000 Americans, 36,000 military  
and 14,000 civilians, were prisoners of Japan during World War II. 
Of those, 14,000 military and 1,500 civilians died from disease, 
maltreatment and other causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Warach said his lawsuit comes more than 50 years after the war  
because evidence and information withheld by U.S. agencies during 
the Cold War was only recently declassified. 
</P>
<P>
	Several ex-POWs also said U.S. officials warned them in 1945 not  
to discuss their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Slave labor differs from forced labor in that victims are denied  
payment, adequate food and other necessities, and kept confined 
when not working, Warach said. The POWs said they were supposed to 
earn pay but never saw any. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-POWs at the news conference backed the allegations with  
personal memories. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Reuter, 79, of Oxon Hill, Md., who survived the infamous  
``Bataan Death March'' in the Philippines, nearly wept in recalling 
that he learned only after Japan's surrender that U.S. Marines had 
fought a bloody island-hopping campaign across the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially, it meant they were using me to replace a Japanese  
who was trying to kill my brother,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in New Mexico partly because many of the  
victims had been National Guardsmen there before being sent to the 
Philippines.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nationwide group of religious leaders  
Wednesday urged presidential candidates to adhere to a ``Framework 
of Civility'' during the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interfaith Alliance, an organization of religious leaders  
representing about 100,000 supporters from a wide range of 
religious faiths, announced that it sent a letter to all major 
presidential candidates asking them to endorse a code of ethical 
conduct for their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Framework of Civility'' urges candidates to ``reject  
personal attacks, innuendo or stereotyping'' opponents. It also 
asks them to ``avoid all references ... likely to dehumanize those 
holding opinions different'' from their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are calling on presidential candidates to put their faith  
in action by supporting this `Framework of Civility' which embodies 
the values and principles held by people of faith,'' said Rev. 
Welton Gaddy, Interfaith Alliance's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alliance wants the candidates to apply the same standards to  
their staffs as well. It asks them to not condone staff members' 
``degrading, disparaging or demeaning'' personal attacks on 
opposition candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``These questions will be asked of all the candidates and we  
expect a response,'' said Amber Khan, Alliance spokeswoman. 
``Candidates must take responsibility for the impact and culture 
they create through their campaigning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Alliance asked campaigns that do not endorse the ``Framework  
of Civility'' to write their own codes of conduct.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former American Red Cross president  
Elizabeth Dole, flexing her organizational muscle, said Wednesday 
she's garnered campaign leaders in each of Iowa's 99 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The move demonstrates that her campaign has developed  
organizational strength crucial to success in next winter's 
precinct caucuses, and builds on her third-place showing in last 
month's GOP straw poll, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign eventually will have an organizational presence at  
the precinct level, Dole told The Associated Press in an interview. 
The state has more than 2,000 precincts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take it to the next level,'' said Dole. ``That  
shows a very high level of energy and commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to luring traditional Republicans, Dole said she's  
attracted new people to politics, particularly women and young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're building an invisible army of new supporters,'' Dole  
said. ``I welcome these first-time activists to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next winter's caucuses are neighborhood meetings where activists  
declare their preference, and often become a full evening of 
political arguments. They require far more commitment than voting 
in a primary. 
</P>

	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bob Dole got in hot water earlier this  
year when he questioned whether his wife, GOP presidential hopeful 
Elizabeth Dole, could raise enough money to be viable in the 2000 
race. Now, it seems, he's at it again. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Kansas senator, in Wednesday's Rochester Democrat and  
Chronicle, said the distance between front-runner Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush and his rivals for the GOP nomination might be 
insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one anticipated this much of a spread,'' the 1996 GOP  
presidential nominee told the paper, while saying the situation 
could change quickly: ``One day can be a lifetime in politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole also said his wife was having trouble raising funds and  
that he was not sure how long she would be in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am counting on her to go further,'' he said. ``We'll just  
have to wait to see what develops.''

<HEADLINE> Man, Pizza Hut Settle Over Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A man acquitted of killing his wife and her  
manager at a Pizza Hut restaurant has settled a claim against the 
company for failing to provide adequate security and protection for 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Richard Miller was acquitted of killing Nancy Marie  
Miller, 25, and Steven J. Snow, 35, at the Brandon restaurant in 
May 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He filed a civil lawsuit against the Dallas-based company three  
months later. The case had been scheduled for trial next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut resolved the case without admitting fault, Jay  
Allison, company spokesman, said Wednesday. He said Pizza Hut was 
concerned about Miller's children and pleased it didn't have to 
endure a lengthy public trial. Pizza Hut is owned by Tricon Global 
Restaurants, which also owns KFC and Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Miller killed his wife and Snow in a jealous  
rage and then staged the robbery, taking more than $800 from the 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 33, maintains he drove to the restaurant to check on his  
wife when she didn't come home from her waitressing shift. Inside 
the restaurant, her and Snow dead from gunshot wounds to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	A defense witness testified at Miller's trial she saw two people  
matching the descriptions of Ms. Miller and Snow in the restaurant 
doorway the night they died. They appeared to be arguing with a man 
who was not Miller, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one else has been charged with the killings, and the  
investigation ended after Miller's acquittal, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> NFL Says L.A. Still in Stadium Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The NFL's original six-month deadline for  
receiving an acceptable stadium proposal from Los Angeles passed 
Wednesday, with the league keeping its options open. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the three groups actively seeking an expansion team for  
the LA area has been able to put together a deal suitable to the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means the window of exclusivity for Los Angeles has  
ended,'' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL now will evaluate Houston's proposal and also continue  
talks with the Los Angeles groups, Aiello said from league 
headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those hoping to bring a team to Los Angeles is Hollywood  
dealmaker Michael Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ovitz group has worked very hard and spent a great deal of  
money to bring pro football back to LA. Now it's up to the league 
to decide whether it wants to play professional football in Los 
Angeles,'' Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Ovitz, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aiello repeated the league's stance that it isn't near a  
decision on the expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wide open between the four groups we're dealing with.  
It's just a matter of someone stepping up with a plan that can get 
24 votes from our owners,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31 team owners are scheduled to meet early next month in  
Atlanta. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue recently said a decision 
on the expansion franchise may be made then. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths of the team owners would have to approve the  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (expansion) committee will meet Oct. 5 and make its report  
Oct. 6. Hopefully some decisions will be made beginning that day,'' 
Aiello said. ``The NFL will continue communication with all four 
groups as we move closer to the Oct. 6 meeting.''

<HEADLINE> To Win More, Marino Has To Do Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The television audience for ``Monday Night Football'' kept  
getting bigger and bigger before peaking at halftime, when the 
Denver Broncos retired John Elway's number. 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise there, since the rifle-armed,  
tough-as-a-mule-and-cool-as-dry-ice quarterback was always a top 
NFL draw. 
</P>
<P>
	But one of life's little ironies made it impossible for one of  
No. 7's biggest fans to watch. That's because Dan Marino was stuck 
inside the Dolphins locker room during intermission, trying to 
figure out a way to beat No. 7's former team. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it worked out, anyway. Elway still got his grand  
sendoff and close pal Marino settled for a videotape of the 
ceremony -- and what could prove to be a very important victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big win for us, coming in to beat the two-time  
defending champs,'' he said. ``It's a huge win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is not one to exaggerate, but the only way this season  
opener qualifies as huge is for Miami to go on and beat nearly 
everyone in similar fashion. Though he would never say so, Marino 
probably has just one good run left in him. And like Elway at the 
end of his career, the less he has to do to get to the Super Bowl, 
the more likely he is to wrap his hands around the one trophy that 
has eluded him so far. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 previous seasons with the Dolphins, Marino has been the  
only constant and more times than he probably cares to remember 
now, the only reason they won. Monday night in Denver, he was a 
very efficient 15-of-23, with two touchdowns and no interceptions, 
but Marino's presence (not to mention Elway's absence) was not the 
only reason Miami beat Denver so handily. 
</P>
<P>
	A well-choreographed defense led by linebacker Zach Thomas  
limited Broncos running back Terrell Davis to 61 rushing yards and 
no touchdowns in 19 carries, mostly by stacking eight men close to 
the line of scrimmage and daring Elway's replacement, second-year 
passer Brian Griese, to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more important, though, Miami might have stumbled onto  
something they've been lacking from most of the past two decades 
now -- a running game. The Dolphins totaled 111 yards against 
Denver, hardly a stampede, but enough to keep the Broncos from 
zeroing in on Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA product Karim Abdul-Jabbar got most of the work and  
responded well, considering that coach Jimmy Johnson's guarantees 
regarding employment in the Dolphins' backfield are limited to a 
week at a time. Johnson used three of his first four draft picks 
this year on running backs, and both J.J. Jackson and Rob Konrad 
saw action. But the most talented member of the draft trio, Cecil 
Collins, stayed glued to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one scouting service rated Collins the top prospect in  
the draft, but he's been arrested twice for breaking into a woman's 
apartment, failed three drug tests, been dismissed twice from 
college and spent nearly four weeks in jail. Johnson, though, is 
already one year late on the Super Bowl he promised Miami upon his 
arrival in 1996, and so Collins' appearance in a regular-season 
game can't be far off. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter when that is, if Collins is half as good as  
advertised, that day can't come too soon for Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the last member still holding down a job from what is  
considered the greatest quarterbacking class ever to enter the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, six passers were taken in the first round of the 1983  
draft. Marino got to the Super Bowl his second season, got beat and 
hasn't been back since. Jim Kelly took the Buffalo Bills there four 
times and came away empty-handed. Elway lost the first three times 
he made it, and then, leaving more and more of the heroics to Davis 
and a continually improving defense, won back-to-back Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody took away their own memories from the ceremony marking  
the retirement party the Broncos threw Monday night for No. 7. The 
lesson for Marino and the Dolphins is not to recall Elway at his 
most spectacular, but rather at his most opportunistic, finally 
relying on the talents of others more than his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino spent large chunks of his summer playing golf with Elway,  
Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. Besides being automatic Hall of 
Famers and champions, the other thing the trio had in common was 
retirement. Marino is sure to follow them soon, perhaps at the end 
of this season if rumors of Jimmy Johnson's departure from coaching 
turn out to be fact. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a shame if Marino leaves without a championship,  
especially since this is his best chance to do more by doing less. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Earns $1B in Missile Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea has sold at least 490  
Soviet-style Scud missiles to Pakistan, India and Middle Eastern 
countries since 1991, a South Korean scholar said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales have earned the Asian country $1 billion a year in  
badly needed cash, said Kim Chul-hwan, a professor at the Korean 
National Defense University 
</P>
<P>
	``North Korea builds missiles for exports,'' he said at an  
international seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has identified North Korea as the world's No. 1  
exporter of missile equipment and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the North's communist government pledged to freeze  
testing of its long-range missiles during talks with the United 
States on improving relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said North Korea completed plants in 1991 that enable the  
country to produce up to 150 Scud-B and Scud-C missiles a year. 
</P>
<P>
	So far North Korea has sold 160 Scud-Bs to Iran, 100 to Iraq and  
18 to the United Arab Emirates, Kim said. The Scud-B is believed to 
have been modified from the old Soviet design and to have a range 
of 210 miles, the distance between New York and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria has bought 150 North Korean Scud-Cs, which have a range of  
341 miles. Iran bought 42, and India bought 20, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1996, the United States has held a series of talks with  
North Korea on curbing its development and export of missiles. 
North Korea has rebuffed U.S. demands, saying self-defense is the 
inalienable right of any sovereign nation. 
</P>
<P>
	It reportedly has demanded $1 billion annually for three years  
in return for stopping exports of missiles and missile technology.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Roddy Doyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Three years have passed since the world  
last heard from Roddy Doyle, who from his coarse-witted debut, 
``The Commitments,'' has always rooted his best-selling books in 
the everyday urban Dublin he knows so well. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle's ear for authentically earthy, screenplay-friendly  
dialogue remains evident in his latest novel. But in many ways, ``A 
Star Called Henry'' takes the schoolteacher-turned-author into 
ambitious new territory certain to win him new fans -- and lose him 
some old ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle is billing the novel as the first in a trilogy to follow  
the larger-than-life travails of Dublin slum kid Henry Smart and, 
through him, to depict the divisive, bloody birth of an independent 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to emulate Charles Dickens, to write about a very old  
man, and go right from the very beginning of his life to the end. 
It became a bigger book than I thought it would be,'' Doyle, 41, 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle has no feel for how compelling his fictional hero will  
prove to others, ``but I've become so engrossed in the character 
that I won't let Henry Smart go until he's finished,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many of his creations, Doyle -- with his close-shaven  
head, round wire-framed specs and single stud earring -- gives 
people the impression of being a fairly dogged, stubborn Dub 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been crafting his new trilogy since 1995, when he  
finished ``The Woman Who Walked Into Doors,'' about a Dublin mother 
trapped in a brutally abusive marriage. He considers that his best 
book, though it fared least well overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	He claims not to care how well ``Henry'' sells internationally  
either, though it has already received immediate critical acclaim 
in his homeland and risen to the top of best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales is no way to measure the success of anything, except  
maybe bread,'' he said dismissively. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle takes lasting comfort from the worldwide triumph of  
``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' his 1993 portrait of a boy coping with 
the collapse of his parents' marriage, which won the Booker, 
Britain's top literary prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never write a more successful book than `Paddy Clarke.' I  
know that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with the enduring popularity of his career-launching  
trilogy of wisecracking tales set in his native north Dublin -- 
``The Commitments,'' ``The Snapper'' and ``The Van'' -- Doyle today 
has the financial freedom to write what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Henry,'' Doyle is at his most grim, brutal and morally  
gray. His portrait of tenement life in early 20th-century Dublin, 
in which the child Henry must survive as a rat-catching, 
cattle-thieving orphan, makes the crushing poverty of Frank 
McCourt's 1950s Limerick in ``Angela's Ashes'' seem downright 
comfy. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry is a survivor, intelligent and strong beyond his years. He  
also has a hint of both Leonard Zelig and Forrest Gump in him: He's 
near the center of threshold events, but never really in the frame. 
</P>
<P>
	A natural born killer, Henry survives the rebel Easter Rising of  
1916 and graduates into the ranks of Irish Republican Army leader 
Michael Collins' hand-picked assassins, executing men in their beds 
or on lonely roadsides as part of the rebels' merciless and 
ultimately successful campaign to wrest most of Ireland from 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, Doyle cuts Ireland's founding fathers down to  
size and skewers several romantic notions held sacred by Irish 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry describes the original leaders of the IRA and its  
affiliated Sinn Fein party as ``a little gang of cranky nuts and 
bad poets'' made attractive only by the British authorities' 
tendency to execute them. 
</P>
<P>
	Eamon de Valera appears briefly alongside Henry who, nonplussed,  
notes simply that the future leader of the Irish Republic was 
wearing red socks and smelled bad. 
</P>
<P>
	By the bitter end of this breakneck-paced novel, Henry has  
discovered that his leaders have no intention of making Ireland a 
more equal or free society. His protege in the IRA, Ivan, has 
graduated from landless country bumpkin into a scheming 
power-broker and racketeer lording it over his home county of 
Tipperary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have cattle, land, a cut of the creameries, pubs. Every  
bloody thing. I'm even on the Sunday collections. ... Nobody works 
without the nod from Ivan,'' he tells Henry, who in the same 
illusion-shattering conversation learns his bosses in Dublin want 
him dead. 
</P>
<P>
	An impressively eclectic bibliography at the end of the book  
testifies to Doyle's efforts to reconstruct a period and place that 
has been largely wiped from the face of modern, economically 
booming Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
	One conclusion Doyle hits hard, in keeping with his  
working-class and socialist sympathies, is that the IRA's fight for 
independence was led by power-hungry opportunists who replaced the 
injustices of British rule with their own corrupt, conservative 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must admit, though, I'm very happy living in the Republic of  
Ireland,'' Doyle said. ``I live with the consequences of all that 
violence, and I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I wanted to face the reality of that violence. I didn't  
want to glamorize it. I wanted to do away with the innocent picture 
that I was given when I was a kid about the battle between the 
goodies and the baddies. In `Henry,' there's good in the bad, and 
bad in the good -- human beings, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle is unconcerned that foreign readers may not know enough  
about his country's past to get it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, people who aren't familiar with Irish history are  
going to come up against the fence in this book and wonder what 
it's all about,'' he said. ``But I tried to keep the history 
lessons to a minimum. And fiction makes bad history anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no real place for footnotes in fiction. I just write  
as clearly as I possibly can do. I tend not to think about 
potential audiences abroad. ... When I read `War and Peace' as a 
kid, I didn't know who all these generals were, but I still had a 
ball reading it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle has just finished a screenplay, a romantic comedy called  
``When Brendan Met Trudy.'' The movie is set in Dublin and filming 
is about to start. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also well into his second volume of the trilogy, in which  
Henry Smart sets sail first for England, then the United States, 
presumably to cast an iconoclastic eye on the immigrant experience 
-- and to stretch his creator's literary skills even farther. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle said he's considering moving his wife and three children  
temporarily to America to do research and to discover, he joked, 
``what it's like to live someplace where summer's not exactly the 
same as winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	An excerpt from Roddy Doyle's historical novel ``A Star Called  
Henry.'' Here, the fictional protagonist describes how his IRA 
boss, the real-life Michael Collins, outwits Dublin's police 
(``rozzers'') by hiding in plain sight: 

</P>
<P>
	``Collins was full of plans and skits that dropped us there with  
admiration, obvious notions that no one ever worded but him. He 
slept in the beds of men who'd just been arrested -- the rozzers 
would never search the same house twice in a night, especially when 
they'd found their man the first time. The safest bed in town, he 
said. He was a plastic man. Everyone knew him but no one could 
describe him. His hair was brown, fair and black. He was broad but 
not particularly tall; he was the tallest man in the room. He grew 
a moustache and the years grew with it; he filled out, became 
middle-aged. He shaved it and became a lad again, much too young to 
be Michael Collins. He smiled at the rozzers when he met them at 
the roadblocks; he helped them in every detail; he joined them. He 
never hid in a coat, behind a collar. 
</P>
<P>
	``---- Michael Collins, he said once in answer to a young, fresh  
rozzer's inquiry. I was with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He laughed. We laughed. They laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	``---- I'm just having you on, he said. In a cap or muffler or  
less impressive in the overcoat, he'd have got a butt of a rifle in 
the chops. Not Mick, though. He was a company director, a man about 
town, a class above them and one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``---- Michael Collins, I said to the same question.  
</P>
<P>
	``They laughed again. They let me get away with it because I was  
with Michael Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``---- Keep it up, lads, said Collins as we passed through the  
block. ---- You'll soon catch the bastard. And you can give him a 
root in the hole for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``---- Good-night, sir.''

<HEADLINE> Aguiar Knows Bidwell's Plight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Louie Aguiar keeps getting second  
chances. He hopes Josh Bidwell gets one too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Bay Packers on Monday signed Aguiar, a nine-year  
veteran punter, to replace Bidwell, who is out for the season while 
undergoing treatment for testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a battle Aguiar knows all too well. He beat his own  
testicular cancer last year with surgery and radiation treatments, 
and he returned to play with the Kansas City Chiefs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``With cancer, you don't know how long it will be there,'' he  
said. ``You don't know how far it has spread. You can never rest 
easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar was cut by the Chiefs on Sept. 5 in favor of rookie  
Daniel Pope. In Green Bay, he takes the place of Bidwell, another 
rookie expected to be his team's punter of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar worked out with the Packers for the first time on  
Wednesday. He'll make his debut at Detroit on Sunday, and he'll 
kick at Lambeau Field for the first time in his career next Sunday 
against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the Chiefs released him, the perpetually cheerful  
punter never doubted he would get another opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew there would be a shot because I knew I could still play  
in this league,'' Aguiar said. ``I've been through a lot. I wasn't 
ready to walk away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell never got a chance to kick in a regular season game for  
the Packers. A fourth-round draft pick from Oregon, he discovered 
the cancer shortly before Green Bay's final preseason game against 
Miami and returned to Oregon for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers have said they expect Bidwell to return to the team  
next season, but everything depends on how well he recovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar heard about Bidwell's cancer while in Kansas City and has  
been trying to reach him by phone for about a week. The two haven't 
spoken yet, but Aguiar said he soon hoped to speak to Bidwell, who 
had additional surgery earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just tell him to never give up and never back down from  
it,'' Aguiar said. ``I know how hard this is, and I know how hard 
you have to work to overcome it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers originally signed rookie Chris Hanson to replace  
Bidwell, but coach Ray Rhodes feels more comfortable with a veteran 
at the position. He also said the colorful Aguiar would be a good 
addition to the Packers locker room atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy that I've known a lot about for a lot of years,''  
Rhodes said. ``He's one of those guys that grows on you when you're 
around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many cancer survivors, Aguiar, 33, took great pride in  
cyclist Lance Armstrong's victory at the Tour de France this 
summer. Armstrong was out of action for two years while battling 
his testicular cancer, while Aguiar needed only three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``His was 10 times worse than mine,'' Aguiar said. ``I only had  
very minimal radiation treatments, so I was grateful for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar must undergo CAT scans every six months to determine  
whether the cancer has returned. He also conducts self-examinations 
every three weeks, something he urges more men to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how guys are. Nobody wants to go to the doctor,'' he  
said. ``But the examinations are something you can do to help 
yourself, and they're easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar's quick punting motion -- he had just one kick blocked in  
631 career attempts -- will be beneficial in poor weather conditions 
at Lambeau Field. Aguiar said Eagles punter Sean Landeta, who 
kicked for the Packers last season, recommended Green Bay highly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it was a great team to join and a great city to play  
in,'' Aguiar said.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Wants To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's tricky business, AT&AMP;T has found, to shrink  
and expand at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted with a revenue-draining price war in long distance,  
yet determined to press ahead with its expensive bet on using cable 
TV wires for Internet and telephone service, AT&AMP;T is looking to cut 
more jobs on top of the 20,000 eliminated last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest long-distance telephone and cable company  
said Wednesday it froze hiring about a month ago to help meet those 
challenges, which come on top of a pledge made in April to cut $2 
billion in expenses by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said certain units, especially long-distance  
and administrative, will have to shrink so that rapid-growers such 
as the wireless and Internet divisions can flourish. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T wouldn't rule out layoffs, but officials on Wednesday  
expressed hope that staff reductions can be achieved through 
attrition and redeployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, AT&AMP;T did add 3,000 jobs in the second quarter to its  
Broadband and Internet Services division, which encompasses the new 
consumer offerings in cable TV, local telephone service and 
high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	And this week, AT&AMP;T revealed plans to open 400 to 500 stores for  
wireless products and as many as 26 more of its Internet Data 
Centers. The centers enable businesses to put the computers that 
operate their Web sites in a facility that's directly connected to 
a major ``backbone'' in AT&AMP;T's fiber-optic network. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we must reduce our costs, we are not taking a  
cookie-cutter approach,'' Mirian Graddick, AT&AMP;T executive vice 
president for human resources, wrote in a message to employees to 
ease worries sparked by news reports that there might be widespread 
job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	It's really no mystery why AT&AMP;T finds itself battling on so many  
fronts considering the radical makeover the former telephone 
monopoly has undergone to lessen its overwhelming dependence on a 
long-distance market where profits are getting harder to come by. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the obvious exception of a costly price war in long  
distance, sparked by the nickel-a-minute rates introduced by Sprint 
and MCI WorldCom last month, AT&AMP;T has actually invited most of its 
many perils. 
</P>
<P>
	That's been the feisty management style of Chief Executive C.  
Michael Armstrong, who's already slashed 20,000 jobs and $1.6 
billion in expenses since he came aboard less than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong has also moved to spend more than $100 billion on  
acquisitions in that short span, snaring Tele-Communications Inc. 
and MediaOne Group, two of the nation's four biggest cable TV 
companies, in a bid to create a new-age communications company. 
</P>
<P>
	It will require billions of dollars more to upgrade those cable  
systems to handle the floods of two-way, high-speed communications 
involved with co-mingling voice, video, and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	At last count, the company had about 149,000 workers, up from  
108,000 at the start of the year, although most of the increase 
came from the addition of more than 30,000 TCI employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Slightly more than a third of AT&AMP;T's staff are employed in its  
consumer and business long-distance division, which still accounts 
for 80 percent of the company's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	That business is stagnant thanks to the growth of smaller rivals  
through aggressive price cuts. By contrast, AT&AMP;T's wireless 
telephone unit employs 16,000 people and is expected to post 43 
percent revenue growth this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Another third of the workforce is employed in general  
administrative work and other areas such as research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's attrition rate -- employees who retire or quit --  
averages 8 percent a year, said company spokesman Burke Stinson.

<HEADLINE> Minnelli May Play One-Woman Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Liza Minnelli may play the Palace, the historic  
Broadway vaudeville house where her mother, Judy Garland, staged 
several comebacks in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-woman show would be called ``Minnelli on Minnelli,'' a  
salute to director Vincent Minnelli, Liza's father and Garland's 
second husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will include all the great songs from all his great  
films,'' Gary Labriola, Minnelli's manager, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Details have not been worked out, but tentative plans call for a  
four-week engagement beginning Dec. 1. An official announcement is 
expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans were first reported in the New York Post.  
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Minnelli, an Oscar winner for ``Cabaret,'' has  
been plagued by vocal, drug and weight problems in recent years. In 
1997, she replaced Julie Andrews for a month in the stage version 
of ``Victor/Victoria,'' but had to leave the musical early. 
</P>
<P>
	Garland, who died in 1969, first played the Palace in 1951,  
scoring a huge personal success after her career as a leading lady 
at MGM waned. Garland returned again in 1956 and then in 1967 with 
``Judy Garland: At Home at the Palace.''

<HEADLINE> Denver's Housing Market Spiraling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- When Francis Bodie was transferred to Denver, the  
network engineer figured he'd stay in the basement of a friend's 
suburban home for a couple of weeks while he searched for a house. 
</P>
<P>
	He was there for three months.  
</P>
<P>
	Finding a place to call home has become a  
survival-of-the-quickest competition in metropolitan Denver, where 
a population boom has sent the housing market spiraling. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many other house hunters, Bodie learned to ferret out ``for  
sale'' signs, and to hurry to inspect a house as soon as his real 
estate agent called. 
</P>
<P>
	He also realized early on that he needed a pre-approved mortgage  
to stand out, since sellers often receive offers that top their 
asking price, some coming in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like a traffic jam,'' Bodie said. ``Everyone gets  
backed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House hunters resort to sending out fliers to ``sell''  
themselves to sellers. They build networks of friends and relatives 
who may know of a hot property. And they drop everything once they 
learn of a prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It becomes a foot race, and you ask, 'Am I going to  
collapse?''' said D.L. Buchanan, 45, a children's therapist. 
</P>
<P>
	After a decade of stagnation, Denver's economy has boomed in the  
'90s as companies have been drawn there by affordable housing and 
labor costs. With the boom has come workers -- many of them. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Census Bureau statistics placed Colorado among the five  
fastest growing states, posting a 2 percent increase in population. 
The state is expected to have nearly 4.1 million people by 2000, 
according to estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last year, Denver was second only to San Francisco in  
rising housing costs, with prices climbing 4.5 percent -- about 
twice the national average, according to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	And prices continue to increase. Two months ago, an average  
house in metro Denver cost $211,194 -- a 10 percent hike from July 
1998, according to Perry and Butler Realty, a local firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, low apartment vacancy rates have led to waiting lists  
of people willing to snatch new units as soon as they become 
available. Apartment prices have increased as well, statistics 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The market madness is being driven by newcomers hailing from  
higher-priced regions, who come to Colorado with a lot of money to 
spend, said Richard Wobbekind, University of Colorado's director of 
business research. 
</P>
<P>
	As bigger, more expensive houses are built, many Coloradans go  
after them as well, further increasing competition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a new phenomenon for Colorado,'' Wobbekind said.  
``That's why there is a shock going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe the housing boom will settle by year's end,  
when the construction industry catches up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the hunt remains a frustrating, seemingly  
endless task for many. 
</P>
<P>
	In his search, Jeff Schaich, a Boulder graphic designer, said he  
often found several groups trying to inspect townhouses for sale at 
the same time. Often, a mess of Realtor calling cards littered 
tables in front hallways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk about feeling the pressure,'' said Schaich, 34, who had  
seven bids rejected before he was able to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder Realtor Rich Gribbon said buyers often have just a few  
minutes to decide whether to submit a bid. ``You don't even 
remember the color of the carpet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate agent Susan Joslyn said she has even handed out  
fliers about families who want to buy houses in certain 
neighborhoods. When there are no houses for sale, she said agents 
go door-to-door to see if homeowners have thought about selling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tell buyers you have to be diligent, you can't be casual  
about it,'' she said. ``You have to treat it almost like a job.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson, Jones Benefit From Sked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Michael Johnson and Marion Jones have been given  
the chance to win multiple gold medals at next year's Sydney 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the long-delayed competition schedule approved for track  
and field events in Sydney, Johnson will be able to attempt a 
repeat of his historic Olympic double in the 200 and 400 meters and 
Jones can bid for an unprecedented five golds. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule released today also allows for tries at doubles by  
sprinter Maurice Greene, the world champion in the 100 and 200; 
Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, world and Olympic champion at 10,000 
and world record-holder at 5,000; and Russia's Svetlana Masterkova, 
the 1996 Olympic champion in the 800 and 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation, the sport's  
governing body, arranged the schedule specifically so top stars 
could compete in more than one event. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said particular attention was  
given to accommodating Johnson and Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, Johnson became the first man in history to complete  
a 200-400 Olympic double, setting a world record in the 200 in the 
process. After two relatively modest seasons, Johnson reasserted 
his greatness at last month's World Championships in Seville, 
Spain, breaking the 11-year-old world record in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said his next goal is to defend both titles in Sydney,  
where he could face Greene in a highly anticipated 200-meter 
showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, meanwhile, has said she intends to win a record five gold  
medals: in the 100, 200, long jump and both relays. She won the 100 
in Seville, but her bid for four golds was dashed when she settled 
for bronze in the long jump, her weakest event. Jones' season came 
to an end when she collapsed with back spasms in the 200 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Track and field events in Sydney will be held from Sept. 22 to  
Oct. 1, with a day off on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The timetable allows at least one rest day between semifinals  
and finals of races of 800 meters and more, and the 400 meter 
hurdles. A rest day was also incorporated between the qualification 
rounds and finals of jumping events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This schedule protects the rights of the athletes to compete  
at the highest level without incurring any risks to their health, 
while offering spectators a balanced distribution of finals 
throughout the nine days of competition,'' IAAF president Primo 
Nebiolo said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule was approved Tuesday in Monte Carlo, Monaco, by the  
IAAF's technical delegates and representatives of the Sydney 
organizing committee (SOCOG), ending a protracted dispute between 
the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney officials, accusing the IAAF of dragging its feet on the  
schedule, put tickets on sale earlier this summer based on a 
timetable that had not been authorized by the world body. The IAAF 
criticized SOCOG and said it wanted to make several changes, mainly 
to allow for a rest day between the semifinals and finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the final schedule, 11 finals were moved to different days  
than those on the ticket order form. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sydney won its main battle: the date of the women's 400  
final (Monday, Sept. 25) remains unchanged. The women's 400 is the 
highest demand event in Australia because Cathy Freeman, 
Australia's two-time world champion, is expected to be a favorite 
for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made an exception for the 400 meters out of respect for the  
Australian public,'' Reineri said. ``But the principle of having a 
day of rest was respected in all other events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the negotiations over the schedule had nothing to  
do with the IAAF's long-running demands for free tickets and a 
greater share of Olympic television revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Those matters will be addressed later this month at a meeting  
between Nebiolo and International Olympic Committee president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch.

<HEADLINE> Bill Curbing Campaign Finance Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bipartisan legislation to curb the influence  
of money in political campaigns won House passage late Tuesday 
night despite vociferous complaints from conservative Republicans 
that it violates freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The 252-177 vote sent the bill to an uncertain fate in the  
Senate, where GOP opponents are threatening to renew a filibuster 
that killed similar campaign finance legislation a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reach and influence of special interests have grown out of  
control,'' argued Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, one of dozens 
of Republicans to join with Democrats in support of the measure, 
which also enjoys President Clinton's backing. ``As a consequence, 
people believe their elected officials are bought and paid for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., said the measure, with its  
ban on unregulated ``soft money'' contributions and restrictions on 
certain campaign ads, would ``abridge our precious God-given right 
to speak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Republican leadership backed efforts to derail the  
measure or rework it after concluding it could disadvantage GOP 
candidates and leave them vulnerable to attacks by organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
	But in long day of debate on the House floor, a coalition led by  
Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass., 
easily fended off what were characterized as several ``poison 
pill'' amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were proposals to triple the 25-year-old limits on  
contributions, allowing donors to give up to $3,000 to individual 
candidates and $75,000 overall for any campaign cycle. Both were 
rejected by margins of more than 2-1, indicating that supporters of 
the legislation had the votes to prevail on the final roll call, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	One amendment that cleared would require non-office holders who  
campaign for office to reimburse the government for the costs of 
transportation. Democrats complained the provision was aimed solely 
at First lady Hillary Clinton, who is making the rounds in her 
unannounced New York Senate campaign with a complement of Secret 
Service agents. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 197 Democrats, 54 Republicans and one independent voted  
for the bill's passage, while 164 Republicans and 13 Democrats were 
opposed. The tally was nearly identical to last year's vote of 
252-179. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, as in 1998, GOP opponents in the Senate are ready  
with a filibuster, and prospects for final passage are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	As drafted in the House, the bill would ban the use of soft  
money in federal campaigns. Unlike hard money donations, which are 
restricted in size, soft money donations are unlimited and 
unregulated by the federal government. Increasingly, they are 
prized by political parties and certain politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the bill would impose limits on certain types of  
political advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast commercials within 60 days of an election that made  
use of the name or likeness of a candidate would have to be paid 
for with hard money contributions, which are limited in size. So, 
too, would any print or broadcast commercial that contained an 
``unmistakable or unambiguous'' appeal for the election or defeat 
of a federal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Those provisions are designed to crack down on thinly veiled  
attacks ads that are now paid for with soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation produced a spirited debate on the House floor  
that ranged from bedrock constitutional issues to matters of overt 
partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay argued that the measure  
represented ``the mother of all government regulation'' and would 
erode the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Roger Wicker of Mississippi agreed, and added that for  
``liberal advocates this bill is really about party politics. The 
big labor bosses use the forced dues of their union members to 
further their political goals,'' he added, and the legislation 
would do nothing to change that. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan dismissed the complaints about the First Amendment as  
ungrounded. ``When they say free speech, they mean big money,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays said the measure was designed to enforce a ban on  
corporate campaign donations that has been on the books since 1907, 
and a similar ban on the use of union dues dating to 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., said, ``It should concern every one of  
us that there are corporations, there are labor unions, there are 
organizations out there'' whose members make six-figure 
contributions. ``If anyone thinks they're doing it because they 
believe in good government, then they need to look at the 
underlying legislation they're supporting,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays and Meehan had wanted to have the debate last spring, to  
give their Senate allies more time to battle the threatened 
filibuster there. 
</P>
<P>
	But House GOP leaders successfully delayed the measure, and  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., stared down rebels in his own 
rank-and-file who had pressured him to step up the timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scenes, the GOP hierarchy also emphasized the  
political threat to Republican candidates. The party chairman, Jim 
Nicholson, and Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, who heads the Republican 
campaign committee, met privately with GOP lawmakers last month and 
told them the party enjoyed a $40 million soft money advantage over 
Democrats in the 1997-1998 election cycle.

<HEADLINE> John Lennon Guitar Sold in Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The acoustic guitar John Lennon was playing the  
day he met Paul McCartney has been sold at auction for $224,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair met on July 6, 1957, when Lennon was a member of the  
pre-Beatles group called the Quarrymen. The encounter resulted in 
the 15-year-old McCartney being asked to join the group, which 
eventually evolved into the Fab Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gallotone Champion, which Sotheby's billed as the earliest  
Beatles-related guitar to come on the market, was bought by a 
telephone bidder during an auction held Tuesday at London's Hard 
Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer, a New York investment fund manager who did not want  
to be identified, released a statement through Sotheby's saying he 
considered Lennon ``one of the most important, if not the most 
important, musician of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon bought the black-and-red guitar by mail order before  
playing at a picnic at St. Peter's Church in Woolton near 
Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney approached Lennon later that evening and impressed  
Lennon by teaching him the chords and words to Eddie Cochran's 
``Twenty Flight Rock.''

<HEADLINE> Nikki Sixx Won't Be Prosecuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx won't be  
prosecuted for allegedly making crowd-riling remarks during an 
August concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixx was arrested after the group's Aug. 11 show at Mandalay  
Bay, and charged with provoking a breach of the peace -- a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the show, police had warned band members not to make any  
statements that could provoke crowd violence. Authorities stopped a 
1997 Motley Crue show at the Aladdin Theatre here briefly when a 
short riot broke out, injuring four people. 
</P>
<P>
	A videotape of the recent concert reviewed by prosecutors showed  
Sixx telling the 8,000-member crowd: ``Every time we come to town, 
the (expletive) cops tell us we can't be Motley Crue. If they don't 
like it, we can start flipping over cop cars like we did a couple 
of years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Stewart Bell said Tuesday that while Sixx's  
statement may have been offensive to some, it was protected by the 
First Amendment.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures tumbled Wednesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade as rains improved crop prospects. Soybean and other 
grain futures also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight rains in the southwestern plains combined with weak  
export demand drove wheat prices sharply lower. The rains doused 
fields in Texas and Kansas with farmers are poised to sow winter 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather beneficial to the harvest also led soybean futures  
lower, while corn joined the trend on general market pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 12 1/2 cents to $2.61 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.12 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
2 cents to $1.12 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 12 3/4 cents to 
$4.89 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Treasures Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From Pennsylvania's Amish farmland to an  
Indonesian temple, the world's treasures are under fire from war, 
government policies and the elements, a preservation group said 
Tuesday in announcing its list of the 100 most endangered sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual list from the World Monuments Fund seeks to preserve  
historic and modern treasures, as well as man-made landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based nonprofit group is raising millions of  
dollars a year ``to save these irreplaceable sites that define the 
history and the humanity of the peoples of the world,'' said fund 
president Bonnie Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bosnia, military attacks have ravaged the city of Mostar,  
whose 16th-century urban landscape is now vulnerable to the 
elements, vandalism and collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	In Peru, tourism is threatening the 15th-century Inca City of  
Machu Picchu, where a government-endorsed plan to build a cable car 
could destroy the site's serene, isolated quality, the group said. 
Another ancient treasure -- the Valley of the Kings in Luxor, Egypt 
-- is swamped by tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	The sea is endangering the Tanah Lot Temple on the island of  
Bali. The beauty of the temple, which honors sea gods, has been 
compromised by 100 concrete supports installed along the shoreline 
to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania's Lancaster County, a proposed superhighway  
would cut through the farmland home of the Amish and Mennonite 
communities, altering one of America's most scenic landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The list, begun in 1996, is selected by an expert nine-member  
panel from nominations submitted by governments, U.S. embassies, 
cultural and preservation groups and professionals. There are sites 
in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North and South America, 
and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	A founding sponsor, American Express, has put up $10 million. Up  
to $6 million a year comes from governments, businesses, and 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund was created in 1965 by a retired U.S. Army officer,  
Col. James Gray, who helped stabilize the tower in Pisa. The fund 
now supports 62 conservation projects worldwide.

<HEADLINE> New Raymond Carver Stories Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) -- It took more than a decade after  
writer Raymond Carver's death for his widow, poet Tess Gallagher, 
to sit down and sort through the old papers in his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	But when she finally felt the time was right, Gallagher  
unearthed a treasure -- three unpublished stories Carver revised 
several times but never polished. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the stories have been published in Esquire, and the third  
will appear next year in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``These will be the last writings of Ray's to offer of this  
nature. It's been lovely to have his stories in the house again, of 
course. A great excitement and a pleasure,'' Gallagher said this 
week in an e-mail interview from Italy, where she is attending a 
literary festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Carver's death from lung cancer at age 50, his fans have  
wondered whether more of his work existed. Many literary critics 
say the blue-collar author of such award-winning works as 
``Cathedral,'' ``Where I'm Calling From'' and ``Short Cuts'' died 
at the height of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher suspected Carver's desk might contain something  
special, but she had some misgivings about searching through it. As 
executor of his estate, she feared new unpublished tales would lead 
to a protracted bidding war. An award-winning writer herself, she 
suspected the resulting hubbub would leave her no time to work. 
</P>
<P>
	So she put off the task until she could find an editor she  
trusted. That person was Jay Woodruff, a friend and senior editor 
at Esquire. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Woodruff flew from New York to Gallagher's rustic Port  
Angeles home at the foot of the Olympic Mountains to spend a day 
rummaging through Carver's desk. It wasn't until evening, and the 
last drawer, when Gallagher found the three stories dating back to 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``As someone who has read almost everything that Carver had ever  
published, everything was fascinating to me,'' Woodruff said. ``The 
notes, the scraps, the fragments and pieces of a working writer's 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodruff didn't need to do much editing -- just ``light  
housekeeping,'' as Gallagher put it. 
</P>
<P>
	``These aren't stories he wrote when he was 20 and put aside,''  
Woodruff said. ``These are stories he was writing in the mid-80s 
when he was at the absolute peak of his power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first tale, ``Kindling,'' was published in Esquire's July  
summer fiction issue. In the story, a recovering alcoholic purges 
himself of his past through the metaphor of chopping wood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vandals,'' which appears in Esquire's October issue, examines  
the definition of vandalism as the story twists and turns through a 
love triangle. A third piece, ``Dreams,'' will be published 
sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The three stories and two other unpublished Carver works will be  
published by Knopf in a soon-to-be expanded edition of ``No Heroics 
Please,'' a collection of Carver's stories. 
</P>
<P>
	The two other stories were found this summer in the Charvat  
Fiction Collection at Ohio State University, where Carver used to 
sell some of his papers when he was low on money. William Stull, 
who edited Carver collections and wrote his biography, made the 
discovery along with his wife, Maureen P. Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to say that none of them would rank with his  
greatest stories,'' said Gary Fisketjon, editor at large at Knopf 
publishing, ``but collectively, the five were very strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Port Angeles library, where a meeting room is dedicated  
to Carver, librarians say Gallagher was wise to wait. In light of 
recently published ``lost'' works by Ernest Hemingway and Louisa 
May Alcott, they say a good editor is essential. 
</P>
<P>
	``With some authors, their books became formulaic and maybe they  
shouldn't be published unless it's different from what they 
normally do,'' said Genie Devine, a reference librarian who was 
pleased with the newly discovered Carver works. 
</P>
<P>
	Devine said fans from as far away as Japan and Australia come in  
to ask where Carver is buried. Some borrow first editions and end 
up keeping them as souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Carver's grave, which overlooks the Strait of Juan de Fuca  
from a wind-swept bluff, visitors from around the world leave their 
thoughts in a notebook inside a small metal box. Gallagher, whose 
black granite headstone already rests next to Carver's, writes back 
to them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also promised him on his death bed that I would look after  
things,'' she said. ``I keep that promise every day.''

<HEADLINE> Disney Not Close to Angels Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- While the Walt Disney Co. is open to an  
offer, it doesn't appear close to a deal to sell either the Anaheim 
Angels or the NHL's Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been highly exaggerated,'' Tony Tavares,  
president of Disney subsidiary Anaheim Sports Inc. said Wednesday 
at the baseball owners' meetings. ``It's not actively being 
shopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tavares said Disney was approached by people interested in the  
teams about four months ago and was ``in a listening mode.'' But he 
said talks hadn't even progressed to the point where the team would 
seek permission from the commissioner's office to show its books to 
prospective suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig also said no deal is imminent but made it  
sound as if Disney definitely wants out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they're selling is a matter of concern,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney took control of the Angels from Gene Autry in March 1996  
and bought a 100 percent interest following his death last year. 
Tavares said the Angels' poor performance -- they are 61-85, 26 1/2 
games behind first-place Texas in the AL West -- was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is not whether they're satisfied with how the  
teams have gone,'' Tavares said. ``It would be whether or not this 
is on point for their strategic goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tavares likened people who express interest in becoming sports  
team owners to ``people who come into an auto dealership and kick 
the tires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, columnist Peter Gammons wrote for ESPN.com  
that Disney has ``completed the parameters of a deal'' to sell the 
baseball and hockey clubs to billionaire Henry Nicholas III for 
$650 million. ESPN.com is a Web site for Disney-owned cable 
broadcaster ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	While some analysts valued an Angels-Mighty Ducks package at  
$375 million to $425 million, Nicholas ``stepped up and closed the 
deal,'' the ESPN.com said. Nicholas is president and chief 
executive of Broadcom Corp.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Acquire Visio Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is buying Visio Corp., a leading  
maker of diagramming and technical drawing software, in a $1.3 
billion stock deal that helps Microsoft fill a gap in its line of 
business products. 
</P>
<P>
	Visio software lets professionals such as corporate  
administrators and designers make flow and organizational charts 
and more technical drawings such as engineering schematics. The 
purchase will help Microsoft strengthen its grip on the market for 
business productivity software, already dominated by its Office 
suite of word processing, spreadsheet and presentation products. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very few areas Microsoft is not a player in. This is  
one of them,'' said Frank Catalano, an industry analyst in Renton, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Visio, founded in 1990, says its technical drawing software is  
used by 3 million customers and posted $166 million in sales last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it has no plans to integrate Visio's software  
into its existing business software and would continue to sell it 
as a separate product. Microsoft, which also dominates the market 
for operating programs that control a computer's basic functions, 
is battling an antitrust lawsuit that alleges it unfairly blends in 
new software features to squeeze out other technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft chose to acquire Visio rather than develop similar  
software in-house because Visio has a well-known product with loyal 
customers, said Microsoft senior vice president Bob Muglia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot more attractive for us to use our sales force (to  
distribute Visio's established products) than to use an unknown 
product,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said it was too early to say if any of Visio's 700  
workers would be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Each share of Visio common stock will be exchanged for .45  
shares of Microsoft common stock. The transaction, subject to 
regulatory review and approval by Visio shareholders, is expected 
to close by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Visio's stock price shot up 19 percent, or $6.37 1/2 a share to  
$39.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Microsoft, also traded on 
Nasdaq, was down $2.50 to $92.56 1/4 a share.

<HEADLINE> Sponsor Fires Golfer John Daly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	John Daly, a recovering alcoholic and winner of two major  
championships, was fired by his main sponsor today because Callaway 
Golf said he violated a contract clause to not drink or gamble, 
then refused to get help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We care a great deal about John as a person, a golfer and a  
friend and we're grateful for the period of time he successfully 
supported the company and its products,'' said Ely Callaway, the 
80-year-old chairman who hired Daly two years ago when other 
sponsors dropped him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regrettably, we cannot continue to have John as a company  
representative when he is not prepared to take the future steps 
that we feel are necessary to deal with the alcohol and gambling 
problems facing him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly was returning home to Arkansas from Callaway headquarters  
in Carlsbad, Calif., and could not immediately be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway did not say when or where Daly violated the drinking  
and gambling clauses, only that it was confirmed by one of its 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Daly returned to tournament play three weeks ago  
in the Reno-Tahoe Open, where he missed the cut. He had taken time 
off after the U.S. Open, where he was so frustrated that he hit a 
moving ball with his putter, took an 11 on the hole and later said 
he would never play the U.S. Open again. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly became one of the most exciting and volatile personalities  
in golf since he came out of nowhere to win the 1991 PGA 
Championship, thrilling galleries with his ``Grip It and Rip It'' 
style that made him the game's longest hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was just as wild off the course as he was off the tee.  
</P>
<P>
	He went through alcohol rehab at the end of 1992 and won the  
British Open at St. Andrews in 1995. Two years later, he went on a 
drinking binge during The Players Championship that landed him in 
rehab again. 
</P>
<P>
	That cost him his second wife and his contract with Wilson, the  
Callaway gave him another chance, putting its Big Bertha products 
into the hands of a player who has led the PGA Tour in driving 
distance every season but one since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly has said he has not had a drink since, and the recovery was  
clearly taking a toll. He walked off the course midway through the 
second round of the U.S. Open in 1997, and last year in Vancouver 
got a severe case of the shakes on the 15th green. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway recently described Daly's ongoing battle as the most  
difficult recovery of any alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to recover on the stage of one the more stressful,  
difficult games on earth, and be a champion in front of millions,'' 
Callaway said in late July. ``I don't know of anybody who has ever 
tried to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company begged Daly to seek help and offered to pay for him  
to see a leading expert in alcohol and gambling addictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urged him with all of our abilities,'' Callaway said. ``He  
just doesn't feel that's necessary.''

<HEADLINE> Former Avon Executive Leading Excel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Excel Communications Inc., vying with Frontier  
Corp. to be the nation's No. 5 long distance company, has hired a 
former Avon North America executive as its chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Christina Gold replaces Excel founder Kenny Troutt, who will  
remain chairman of the $1.3 billion direct selling unit of 
Canada-based Teleglobe Inc., Excel announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gold spent 28 years at Avon, rising to become president of  
the North American unit and executive vice president for global 
sales. She left in early 1998 after being passed over for chief 
executive and founded a direct-selling consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment makes Ms. Gold one of a handful of women running  
U.S. companies with annual sales of more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Excel is a direct seller of telecommunications  
products and services. It merged with Teleglobe in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Excel's revenue for the first half of this year was $723  
million, 23 percent below the first half of 1998. Troutt has blamed 
the poor earnings on software that contained programming bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gold said she wants to rebuild the company's independent  
sales force, which is less than half the size it was in 1996, when 
it peaked at about 750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also hopes to expand globally, taking aim at the  
European market.

	Crude oil continued its steady march upward after a one-day  
respite. Crude for delivery in October rose 27 cents to $24.13 on 
the New York Mercantile Exchange after zooming as high as $24.49 -- 
its highest level since Feb. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That's well over twice what crude sold for last December amid a  
world oil glut. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by continued unity among the Organization of Petroleum  
Export Countries on production cuts, as well as declining U.S. 
inventories, oil prices could continue their rise for the 
foreseeable future, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we've got very strong OPEC compliance and  
inventories continue to drop, prices could go even higher,'' said 
Bob Morris, an analyst for Paine Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments out of Venezuela fueled Wednesday's market movement as  
President Hugo Chavez insisted his country will stand by the OPEC 
production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, prices edged downward after he said that if prices  
continue flowing upward, Venezuela will pursue its proposal to 
establish an oil price band system to help stabilize world crude 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``If OPEC wants prices to stabilize, the best thing is for them  
not to say anything,'' said Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether prices push to even higher levels may hinge on next  
week's OPEC meeting in Vienna, Austria. Experts say prices could 
settle if the world's top producers give some indication about 
readjusting quotas or clarify what they think is a good oil price. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil prices, which have mirrored crude's climb, were  
unchanged Wednesday at 61.06 cents per gallon for October delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	October unleaded regular gasoline rose .63 cent to 69.05 cents a  
gallon; October natural gas fell .8 cent to $2.628 per million 
British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude for delivery in October fell 12  
cents to $23.59 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The tension went out of the orange juice futures market after  
Floyd skirted the central Florida coast, pounding the region with 
125 mph winds and heavy rains but apparently leaving groves intact 
in the heart of the nation's top juice-producing region. 
</P>
<P>
	``The orange juice crop is not going to be a problem,'' said  
Elizabeth Steger, president of Citrus Consulting International in 
Orlando. ``I didn't hear anything about damage to the groves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears that the storm could wreck thousands of trees had driven  
prices to nearly the $1-a-pound level this week. But word that the 
key growing areas were relatively unscathed sent the market down 5 
cents on Wednesday to close at 91.55 cents on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures plummeted on the Chicago Board of Trade after  
rains soaked fields in Kansas and Texas overnight, improving crop 
prospects with farmers poised to sow winter wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also was pressured by continued weak export demand.  
Sluggish export demand for U.S. wheat puts more emphasis on the 
winter wheat crop, resulting in exaggerated reactions to weather 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 12 1/2 cents to $2.61 1/2 a bushel.  
Other grains and soybean futures also retreated -- December corn 
fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.12 1/4 a bushel, December oats fell 2 cents to 
$1.12 3/4 a bushel and November soybeans fell 12 3/4 cents to $4.89 a 
bushel.

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: Kevin Costner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's lunchtime in Manhattan and Kevin Costner is  
on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
	Knots of journalists mill about, waiting their turn to take a  
bite out of the star. His boyish charm can no longer satiate this 
post-''Waterworld,'' post-''Postman'' crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner, once a sacred cow, has become steak tartar.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe in yourself, you just have to walk forward.  
You're going to suffer the slings and arrows,'' he says, wearily. 
``I just have to go forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tucking his legs up onto a sofa, Costner exhales deeply. He is  
dressed sportily: white pants, pristine white sneakers and a white 
polo shirt under a sleeveless V-neck sweater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mixed up about some things in my life,'' he continues,  
``but I ain't mixed up about how to approach my work. I'm just not. 
Maybe that rubs people wrong -- the certainty with which I come to 
something -- because they're not certain about anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a recurring theme for Costner, a filmmaker with an  
impossibly taut moral compass and a black-and-white view when it 
comes to the ``art'' of movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin has great integrity as a man,'' says actress Kelly  
Preston. ``He's got strong convictions. He's like a good ol' boy -- 
he's got very American down-home values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those values -- plus, of course, his sun-kissed looks -- helped  
catapult Costner into the oxygen-deprived heights of the Hollywood 
elite during the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	His string of hits -- ``No Way Out,'' ``The Untouchables,''  
``Bull Durham,'' ``Field of Dreams'' -- were so impressive that 
Costner was likened to Gary Cooper, a postmodern throwback to the 
stoic, struggling hero. By 1990, he could do what he wanted. And he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner devoted the next 18 months -- and sank all his cash --  
into his directorial debut: a three-hour Western with subtitles in 
Lakota Sioux. People thought he'd gone nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That movie was really beaten up before it ever came out,'' he  
says. ``Nobody ever wants to write about it in that way, but I 
remember reading just awful things about what I was maybe doing out 
in South Dakota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was quietly brewing up a blockbuster: ``Dances With Wolves''  
earned 12 Academy Award nominations and won seven Oscars, including 
best picture and best direction awards. 
</P>
<P>
	More movies followed with Costner as star, including ``Robin  
Hood: Prince of Thieves,'' ``JFK'' and ``The Bodyguard.'' Costner 
was the third highest-paid entertainer in 1991-92 with a net worth 
of $71 million, according to Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't change me at all,'' Costner says. ``You have to  
pursue what you want because there's a lot of noise out there to 
keep you from doing what it is you want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The noise became overpowering when, in 1995, he rolled out his  
$175 million epic, ``Waterworld,'' amid ballooning budgets, the 
breakup of Costner's marriage and rumors of bitter fights on the 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	And that was even before the critics weighed in.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times decried it as ``the most wasteful feat of  
one-upmanship in Hollywood history.'' The Associated Press called 
it ``uninspired and ordinary.'' The Wall Street Journal dubbed it 
``Fishtar,'' after ``Ishtar,'' another expensive clunker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out of 'Waterworld' and I didn't know if I was going to  
make it emotionally, given everything that was going on. And I 
thought, 'Well, are you going to be a baby, you baby?''' he 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Don't be a baby. You can cry all you want to think  
that people have invaded your privacy, but you've created some 
situations in your life and you need to deal with them. You need to 
go to work.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Armyan Bernstein, a longtime Costner friend and a producer of  
the actor's latest film, ``For Love of the Game,'' considers the 
backlash unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is sort of misunderstood. I think so many events in  
his life have painted him with the wrong color,'' Bernstein says. 
``I think that people assume when you're a movie star and you get 
divorced, then that's your fault. And if you have a run-in with a 
director on a movie you're making, then that's your fault, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After ``Waterworld,'' Costner stroked back with ``Tin Cup'' -- a  
devilishly fun parable about a bullheaded golf pro -- only to 
squander his credibility with the post-apocalyptic ``The Postman,'' 
dubbed by many ``Dances With Postcards.'' USA Today didn't think it 
was worth the price of a first-class stamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, movies have been marked through time as being  
dismissed and then finding their way back into a psyche. Whether 
that movie does or not is not important. I'm comfortable with what 
happened,'' Costner says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have faith in the movies and I have faith in my own choices  
about what I do. The measure of movies is how well they do at the 
box office or how well critics receive a film -- and I think those 
are false gods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the fallout has endured. Costner still gets  
trotted out whenever a late-night talk show host needs a Hollywood 
fall guy. Even more painfully, he is routinely made the butt of 
jokes on ESPN's SportsCenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be made to look like a fool. You can be made to look  
like a megalomaniac. You can be made to look egotistical. We don't 
like people that think they're better than other people'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that! I'm as much a working man as anybody else.  
So when people say I'm egotistical, I think, 'No. I'm formed. I'm 
formed in my ideas about things.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So formed, in fact, that Costner can't stop micromanaging -- even  
in retrospect. He remains deeply bothered that a final line in 
``The Postman'' rang untrue. He still regrets smiling during a 
gunfight in ``Silverado,'' a 14-year-old film. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always willing to try to make it better,'' says Preston,  
who worked long hours with the star on the new baseball movie. ``It 
was never an easy day, it was never 'Just jump in and lets throw it 
around and do it.' We would always be picking it apart for the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costner can't even contain himself from picking apart his new  
film -- even as he publicizes it. He's angered that coarse language 
and a nude scene were excised to get a PG-13 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't live with when you know something is broken and you  
don't try and fix it. I just cannot do that. I'm a worker bee. I 
know I've died bloody, not bowed,'' he says, then laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Listen, I'm not insane. I don't have a death wish. It's not  
like I don't want to make my money back. But I don't need to make 
it back at the cost of the movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For Love of the Game'' features Costner in what he admits is  
his most autobiographical film to date: the tale of an aging 
pitcher forced to face an emotional and physical crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
	When he looks back at his own past -- his breakneck rise,  
precipitous descent and critical whupping -- Costner sounds a lot 
like another of his characters: Tin Cup, the golfer who hits the 
same risky shot over and over simply on principle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people I can look at and I can say, 'Is my aim  
true?' And they'll go, 'Yeah.' Then why is this happening? They go, 
'It's a funny world, Kev. It's like the nail that stands up has to 
get knocked down. You have a bad habit of standing up,''' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are, I think, actors and people who have dealt with fame  
in unusual ways that have changed, that have tried to reinvent 
themselves. I haven't done that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had life-altering experiences -- be it divorce or  
something -- but I haven't changed. I've gotten smarter -- about the 
way I feel about movies. But about what I think is right and wrong? 
No, I haven't changed.''

<HEADLINE> Obese Child Offers Genetic Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A hormone produced in fat cells can be used to help people lose  
weight, according to a study of an obese child with a rare genetic 
defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists caused a stir four years ago when they announced that  
the hormone leptin could evoke weight loss in mice, but until now a 
direct role in human obesity had not been confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings by doctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge,  
England, provide important clues as researchers try to decipher the 
genetic and environmental factors in obesity. The work could lead 
to medical treatments for some forms of the condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The study published in today's edition of The New England  
Journal of Medicine involved a severely overweight 9-year-old girl 
whose body produced virtually no leptin, a hormone that is supposed 
to signal the brain to stop eating. The signal does not get through 
properly in some overweight people. 
</P>
<P>
	At the age of 6, the girl was so overweight that doctors  
performed liposuction on her legs to increase her mobility. She was 
constantly hungry and became disruptive when denied food. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, when the girl was 9 and weighed 208 pounds, doctors  
began administering daily injections of leptin. Within a week of 
treatment, the girl's appetite had diminished significantly. After 
a year of injections, she had lost 36 pounds -- and 95 percent of 
that weight was fat. 
</P>
<P>
	While the girl's condition is uncommon, the researchers, led by  
Dr. I Sadaf Farooqi, believe the findings have implications for the 
general population. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Drs. Michael  
Rosenbaum and Rudolph Leibel of the Columbia University College of 
Physicians and Surgeons wrote that many factors besides leptin 
affect weight, and people should not conclude that leptin 
injections would make losing weight easy. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, leptin might help some people stick to a diet by  
curbing their hunger and aid in keeping the weight off, Rosenbaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that we know is that it decreases appetite in  
this child and in a mouse,'' Rosenbaum said. ``It's not the be-all 
and the end-all to promote effortless weight loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leptin is being tested in ordinary fat people as an appetite  
suppressant. Preliminary findings from one study indicate that it 
isn't a miracle cure, but shows some promise when combined with 
diet and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard Dickey, President of the American Association of  
Clinical Endocrinologists, called the study ``a great start,'' 
adding that although doctors generally believe many factors are 
involved in human obesity, leptin is clearly important. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very possible that this child is a clue to appetite  
control and weight gain across a large portion of the population,'' 
he said. ``I think that everybody's excited about the role of 
leptin.''

<HEADLINE> Heinz Stock Moves on Merger Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of H.J. Heinz Co. and Bestfoods shot  
higher today even as Bestfoods denied a report the companies were 
discussing a merger that would create the nation's second-biggest 
food company. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz is the maker of Heinz Ketchup and has a product lineup  
that includes StarKist tuna and Ore-Ida french fries. Bestfoods is 
the maker of Hellman's mayonnaise, Entenmann's baked goods, Skippy 
peanut butter and Knorr soups and sauces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported today that the companies are  
discussing a merger, citing people familiar with the talks. It said 
that because Heinz and Bestfoods are similar in size, it is not 
clear which would lead the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh-based Heinz has annual sales of $9.3 billion, while  
Bestfoods, of Englewood, N.J., has about $8.4 billion for a 
combined total of $17.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be the third largest food company in the world behind  
Europe's Nestle SA, with $52 billion in sales, and U.S.-based Kraft 
Foods, with $27 billion, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said the deal under discussion would be in the form  
of a merger rather than an acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bestfoods issued a statement today in which it said ``no  
significant acquisition or combination discussions are in 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it was responding to press reports and noted it  
was ``departing on this occasion from its continuing policy of not 
commenting on rumors or market activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials for Heinz declined to comment. ``Our policy is that we  
don't comment on market rumors,'' said Ted Smyth, senior vice 
president of H.J. Heinz. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading this morning on the New York Stock Exchange, Heinz  
was up 3.6 percent, or by $1.56 1/4, at $44.75 a share, while 
Bestfoods jumped 7.3 percent, or by $3.56 1/4, at $52.50.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Batters Boats in Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Captain Emmanuel Forbes tried to stay  
with his 114-foot freighter, the Forget-Me-Not, as Hurricane 
Floyd's waves battered it at its pier along the Nassau shore. 
</P>
<P>
	When police ordered him to abandon ship, Forbes ignored them.  
Then the ropes holding the 210-ton ship to the pier began breaking. 
Forbes' engineer and second mate left him alone on board and he 
bade them farewell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then the weather really came,'' he said Wednesday. For several  
agonizing hours, he struggled to keep his ship afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, he said, ``I could do nothing else, nothing else. When  
she broke the last rope, I got off and she was carried away.'' 
Forbes leapt from the deck to safety on the pier. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Forget-Me-Not listed in shallow water several  
hundred feet from shore. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's got a heavy draft,'' Forbes said, ``but I hope we'll be  
able to get her out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of boats, large and small, were tossed about like bath  
toys, smashed or sunk when Floyd hit the Bahamas Tuesday. On 
Nassau's Long Wharf, a 100-foot freighter was dumped onto the beach 
next to the Cocktails and Dreams nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Littering the beach were a mattress, a satin high-heeled shoe, a  
kid's toy, kitchen dishes, twisted silverware and mounds of ragged 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, Michel Ashnel stared in despair at the ruins of his  
livelihood: a smashed-off bow -- all that Hurricane Floyd left of 
his cargo boat. The rest was lumber strewn along Nassau's Long 
Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to do now. It was all I had,'' Ashnel said  
of the 25-foot vessel he used to ferry supplies among the islands.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Aims to Improve Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In June, the nation's major airlines made a  
12-point pledge to treat their passengers better. Today, they 
started unveiling the details. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, pledged to deploy  
mobile, battery-powered workstations at all its hub airports so 
that when there are flight delays or other problems, agents can 
wheel the ``Mobile Chariots'' wherever needed and help with 
rebooking passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier also said it would field 600 hand-held baggage  
scanners at its busiest airports so passengers with flight 
disruptions can instantly know the status of their luggage. In 
addition, United said it would institute a toll-free line for 
customer complaints, something its most frequent fliers requested 
in a recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Continental Airlines, which already rates high is  
passenger-satisfaction surveys, promised to do better by 
communicating more clearly -- whether it's about ticket prices, 
flight delays or lost bags. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to start with the reservations and go all the  
way through baggage delivery,'' Continental spokesman David Messing 
said Tuesday in a prelude to today's formal unveiling of the 
carrier's ``Customer First'' plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines' action toward soothing passengers followed  
complaints prompted by a New Year's storm in the Midwest that left 
thousands of travelers stranded in airports and on aircraft. 
Congress threatened new legislation against the industry, which was 
removed from federal control in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Air Transport Association and its member airlines  
offered a voluntary plan to improve service. Among the dozen 
promises: ensuring that passengers are told of the lowest available 
ticket price; notifying them of delays and cancellations; providing 
prompt ticket refunds; handling bumped passengers with fairness; 
and meeting customers' essential needs during long on-aircraft 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines also pledged to detail how they would fulfill those  
promises by Sept. 15 and implement their new code of conduct by 
Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Two congressional studies released this week said June's broad  
outline lacked legal backing and guaranteed some things already 
required by law. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office -- the investigative arm of  
Congress -- said the ATA's ``Customer Service Commitment'' was 
largely a rehash of existing law or aviation policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several of these measures,'' including fairly handling bumped  
passengers, ensuring customer service from an airline's code-share 
partners, providing prompt ticket refunds, accommodating special 
needs passengers and providing passengers with information on 
airline policies and aircraft configuration, ``reflect what is in 
the statutes and regulations,'' the agency wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said that other promises are not included in the  
airlines' existing ``contract of carriage,'' the fine print on the 
back of airline tickets or ticket jackets that forms the contract 
between an airline and its passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Congressional Research Service, a  
researching agency available to congressional members, said the 
voluntary standards ``may lack the enforceability that the 
conditions of the `contract of carriage' may possess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who commissioned the studies, called the  
Customer Service Commitment ``nothing but legalistic gobbledygook, 
which (does) nothing to protect passengers.'' He said the reports 
are ``a real wake-up call showing how little protection the 
consumer really has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today he offered two measures on the Senate floor requiring  
airlines to reveal when they overbook a flight and to ensure that 
they offer passengers the lowest available fare. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., argued against the Wyden  
proposals, saying the voluntary plan was achieved after lengthy 
negotiations with the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we ought to give them the chance,'' Rockefeller said.  
The measures, which started as amendments, were watered down to 
``sense of the Senate'' resolutions and then adopted by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	David Fuscus, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, also  
asked for patience. ``Whether it's in the contracts of carriage or 
not, it won't matter to the traveling public, because we're going 
to do these things,'' said Fuscus.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Strands U.S. Air Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Florida was not the best place to be a traveler.  
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd stranded thousands of vacationers and business  
travelers around the country when airline and rail service in and 
out of Florida ground to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines canceled nearly 400 domestic and international  
flights through Miami, one of the carrier's four main hubs. Delta 
Air Lines also canceled some flights stopping in Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	In midafternoon, Continental Airlines canceled all its remaining  
Florida-bound flights from Newark International Airport in New 
Jersey, airline spokeswoman Michelle Tracy said. It flies 60 or 70 
times a day from Newark to Florida cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental also would probably cancel flights to coastal South  
Carolina and Georgia, Tracy said. US Airways shut down operations 
in coastal Florida and South Carolina cities, Savannah, Ga., and in 
the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists at Miami International Airport faced a second night of  
sleeping on the floor as hotels filled to capacity. Some tourists 
were out of money. Long lines formed at Burger King and other 
airport businesses still open for business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was complete chaos,'' said Dolores Person, an Irish tourist  
who missed a connection to London on a four-month trip around the 
world. ``It was a really nice trip -- until we got here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm also thwarted travel plans elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	``My customers are very upset with all these cancellations,''  
said Sid Steersman, owner of Steersman Travel Agency in 
Philadelphia. ``When you wait a couple months to go on vacation, 
you're going to be disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce Stephen's of Jesup, Ga., was stuck in Chicago after three  
weeks traveling in the West and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has any idea how we can get home,'' she said. ``It's  
all according to the weather. They don't have any control over it, 
and neither do we.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several airlines relaxed travel restrictions, allowing  
passengers to make flight changes without the usual penalty or 
higher fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, under the standard ``contract of carriage''  
printed on tickets, airlines are not required to provide lodging, 
meals or other accommodations for weather-related delays or 
cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
	Train service was affected, too. CSX Corp., a rail company that  
also moves freight on its lines, was sharply curtailing its 
operations because of the storm, affecting Amtrak and commuter 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides earlier cancellations into Miami, Amtrak canceled  
service on CSX lines between Washington and Miami, Washington and 
Pittsburgh, and some areas of Michigan. About 30 to 40 Amtrak 
trains run on the tracks each day. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX, which has a central dispatching facility in Jacksonville,  
Fla., allowed its dispatchers to leave work to tend to their own 
homes, said Rob Gould, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the prudent course to cancel the service,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Leaves Bell Equipment Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bell telephone companies won't be forced to  
lease to their rivals equipment used for high-speed Internet 
services but still will have to provide them access to parts of 
their local phone networks under action taken today by federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance companies and other upstart competitors had sought  
access to the local phone companies' equipment that delivers 
advanced telecommunications services. They had argued that such 
equipment is need so they can roll out high-speed Internet and data 
services more quickly to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Federal Communications Commission voted 5-0 today not to  
require major local carriers -- like the regional Bell companies or 
GTE -- to give competitors such access in its latest set of rules 
that attempt to wedge open the local phone market. Two 
commissioners dissented in part. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission rules still will enable competitors to lease  
certain components from major local phone carriers so they can 
provide local service without having to build their own facilities. 
A 1996 telecommunications law envisioned this as one way to spur 
more entrants into the local phone marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are telling companies that the elements you came to rely  
on, you are still going to have those to rely on,'' FCC Chairman 
Bill Kennard said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One piece consists of the wires that run from local phone  
company offices to homes and businesses. These are the most crucial 
network elements because they would be very expensive to duplicate. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an effort to get high-speed Internet services out to  
consumers more quickly, Kennard said the commission doesn't intend 
to force the Bells and others to lease equipment used for such 
advanced services. 
</P>
<P>
	This will give incumbent phone companies an incentive to invest  
in high-speed Internet services in the face of competition from 
others like cable companies who are offering such access over their 
lines, Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Kennard said, new competitors will have to  
invest in their own equipment for providing these Internet 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are creating the conditions for lots of companies to get  
out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC originally developed a list of items -- which did not  
include advanced services -- that local companies had to make 
available in 1996. The Supreme Court eventually sent the rules back 
to the commission, saying the FCC did not adequately consider 
whether competitors could obtain the pieces from another source. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said the commission has gone back to provide  
justification for its rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those rules have worked. They are going to stay in place,''  
Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The major local phone companies also have urged the FCC to  
provide more limited access to some of the network elements -- such 
as the switches that connect calls to their destination -- in areas 
where there is already enough competition.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Aim To Improve Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's major airlines tried to quell a  
storm of congressional and passenger dissatisfaction Wednesday by 
announcing detailed plans aimed at improving customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, the largest U.S. carrier, said its steps will  
include deploying mobile computers that can be wheeled to gates 
that have flight problems, so passengers can get extra help with 
rebooking. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines -- the No. 3 carrier, behind American Airlines --  
said its reservation agents will offer callers money-saving travel 
alternatives if a passenger has flexibility, and it will begin 
calling passengers if there are more than two hours notice that of 
a flight cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways, an East Coast mainstay, said it would create a  
12-member consumer advisory board that will meet regularly with 
senior managers to discuss how the airline's customer-service plan 
is operating and make suggestions for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the Wings Club in New York -- an organization of  
aviation professionals -- Delta Chief Executive Officer Leo Mullin 
said airlines ``must regain public confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His company's plan doesn't create ``new customer service  
concepts for Delta, but what is new is that this is our chance to 
re-establish the covenant of trust that customers believe our 
industry broke,'' Mullin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans will take effect by Dec. 15, but critics said they  
remain vague and riddled with loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Delta pledged to let customers hold a reservation  
until midnight the following day -- which in some cases can be more 
than 24 hours away. However, many reservation agents already let 
travelers do that. Delta also has not changed its policy in which a 
passenger has to pay any fare increase that occurs during that 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Society of Travel Agents complained that airlines  
will continue to outlaw such cost-saving tactics such as 
``hidden-city'' tickets. With hidden cities, a traveler might book 
a flight from Point A to Point C, but get off during a stop at 
Point B because it is less expensive to buy the lengthier ticket 
than one to the interim stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically the airlines have not addressed that consumers  
should have the right to use all, part or none of an airline 
ticket,'' said society spokesman James Ashurst. ``They are going to 
be able to continue to penalize travelers for trying to get the 
lowest fare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline action came after a New Year's storm in the Midwest  
left thousands of travelers stranded. Some passengers got stuck on 
planes for hours and others had trouble learning when they might 
get home. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress drafted legislation to force the industry into treating  
passengers better, but the airlines said in June that they would 
develop plans by Wednesday for improving service. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines said the government also must do its part. The  
Federal Aviation Administration ``must restructure and renew the 
air traffic control system to meet the needs of a growing air 
traffic system,'' Mullin told the Wings Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who had filed mandatory ``passenger  
rights'' legislation before the airlines made their voluntary 
proposals, offered two measures Wednesday on the Senate floor as 
the chamber considered the Transportation Department appropriations 
bill. One would require airlines to reveal when they overbook a 
flight, while the other would ensure that passengers receive the 
lowest fare. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., argued against the Wyden  
proposals, saying the voluntary plans were achieved after lengthy 
negotiations with the airlines and ``I think we ought to give them 
the chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a voice vote, senators agreed to ask the Transportation  
Department to investigate lowest-fare and overbooking practices. 
They also passed a watered-down ``sense of the Senate'' resolution 
saying it should be a deceptive trade practice to place passengers 
on overbooked flights or not give them the cheapest fare.	   American Airlines has not announced its plans.

<HEADLINE> Colts Release Defensive Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts released defensive  
back Monty Montgomery and signed running back Tremayne Stephens to 
take his spot on the active roster Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery was in his third year with the Colts and started  
eight games in 33 games. The 5-foot-11, 197-pounder was used on 
special teams in the Colts' 31-14 over Buffalo last week. A 
fourth-round draft pick out of Houston in 1997, Montgomery had 
played in all 32 games the previous two seasons. He had 76 tackles, 
including 64 solo, and recorded three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens was originally signed as a free agent by San Diego last  
year and was waived Monday. The 5-11, 213-pound Stephens played 13 
games for the Chargers last year with one start. Stephens had 122 
yards rushing last year and averaged nearly 22 yards per kickoff 
return.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Force Pats' Roster Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- With the playing status of two starting  
offensive linemen uncertain, the New England Patriots on Wednesday 
re-signed guard Damon Denson, a fourth-round draft pick in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for him on the roster, the Patriots placed wide  
receiver Sean Morey on the practice squad and released wide 
receiver Eddie Conti from the practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Denson was among the players released last week in the Patriots'  
final cuts to reduce the roster to the NFL maximum of 53. 
</P>
<P>
	The team brought him back after right tackle Zefross Moss  
sprained his left ankle and left guard Heath Irwin strained his 
right knee in last Sunday's 30-28 victory over the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were listed as questionable for Sunday's home opener  
against Indianapolis, which has an attacking defense that sacked 
Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie five times in a 31-14 victory over 
the Bills last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty obvious concern,'' Patriots coach Pete Carroll  
said. ``I don't know who's going to play (at right tackle and left 
guard) right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The backups are Ed Ellis and Derrick Fletcher at tackle and Max  
Lane and Todd Rucci at guard. Lane also can play tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Morey, a seventh-round draft pick this year from Brown, was  
among the inactive players for last Sunday's game. Conti, an 
undrafted free agent from Delaware, was signed by the Patriots on 
Sept. 7 after being cut this summer by the Jets and Tampa Bay.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Mrs. Clinton at Hispanic Gala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham  
Clinton shared top billing at Wednesday's Congressional Hispanic 
Caucus gala -- an occasion crystallizing their shared dilemmas in 
running from the same White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He, in his presidential bid, and she, in her Senate race, have  
both courted the burgeoning Hispanic community. Both also have 
strained to establish political identities separate from President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Both tried Wednesday to put the collision of those twin aims --  
over the president's grant of clemency to imprisoned Puerto Rican 
nationalists -- behind them by emphasizing kinship with Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore saluted the community's voting power: ``If a candidate  
speaks the rhetoric of inclusion but pursues the policies of 
exclusion, that candidate is going to pay at the ballot box. You 
will make sure of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton recounted in her warmly received 16-minute address  
that, as a law student, she traveled to the Rio Grande Valley in 
1972 to register Hispanic voters. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that in her more recent campaign travels, ``I have met  
Hispanic leaders and citizens who have been and now are attaining 
what they have demanded -- a seat at the table and an opportunity to 
chart their own destiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two took turns boosting each other's candidacy (she said she  
hoped for ``a president named Al Gore''; he said, ``Let's make sure 
that she is elected'') and saying that Clinton has done good for 
Latinos, but not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore noted this his shared tenure with Clinton had produced low  
unemployment and poverty rates, and high homeownership among 
Hispanics. But, Gore added, ``That's not to say we don't still have 
a great deal of work to do. We do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady said, ``I am not satisfied because we are still  
leaving too many men, women and children behind. ... I am not proud 
that we leave too many Americans out'' of the nation's world-class 
health care system. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore reveled in his reception from the friendly crowd. He  
bragged that his first grandson was born on the Fourth of July and 
said he hoped his next would claim a Cinco de Mayo birthday, a 
reference to Mexico's May 5 national holiday. After two jokes about 
managed care, Gore licked his finger and made a jaunty check mark 
in the air as if to say, ``Score another one for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Mrs. Clinton staged a news conference, where she stood  
at the side of Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton infuriated other leaders of New York's Puerto Rican  
community, most notably Rep. Jose Serrano, with her surprise 
statement last week opposing clemency for convicts associated with 
the FALN, a militant pro-independence group. Her 
allies-turned-critics complained of not being consulted on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Ferrer dismissed it as a lone disagreement. ``The  
Puerto Rican community is not monolithic and doesn't decide 
questions on one issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone at the news conference burst into laughter when Mrs.  
Clinton deflected another hot Puerto Rican issue -- getting the 
Navy's bombing range off the inhabited island of Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I want to do is consult with a number of people. I  
am heavy into consultations now,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Serrano, who attended the dinner, did not return several calls  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has steered clear of the political tangle, saying only that  
he will not ``stand in judgment'' of the president's clemency 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, Gore aides emphasize that the vice president's  
statement is hardly an endorsement of Clinton's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president hasn't spoken out,'' Rep. Xavier Becerra,  
D-Calif., lamented. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there is an interest in resolving this issue of  
clemency, it doesn't supplant education, health care, crime, all 
the other issues of importance,'' Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly am willing to give (Gore) a bye if he's here to  
talk about other issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, a  
Hispanic advocacy group, appreciated that Gore is in a tricky spot 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no good to be obtained by him coming down on one side  
or another,'' Yzaguirre said. ``It's a lose-lose for him to make a 
comment now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the first lady, who stayed behind to campaign while her  
daughter and mother accompanied the president to New Zealand, 
Yzaguirre said: ``Her challenge is to show both independence and, 
at the same time reap the goodwill that Bill Clinton has enjoyed in 
our community. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dance that she's got to do. It's not easy.''

<HEADLINE> GPU Energy Head Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) -- Dennis P. Baldassari will resign as  
president and chief operating officer of GPU Energy, which operates 
utilities that serve 2 million electricity customers in New Jersey 
and Pennsylvania, the company's parent announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldassari, 50, is leaving the $3.4 billion unit at the end of  
the month ``to pursue other interests,'' said Morristown-based GPU 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not immediately respond to a request for an interview  
that was made through company spokesman Jeff Dennard. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldassari joined GPU in 1968 and has been president of GPU  
Energy, of Reading, Pa., since it was created in 1996 by the 
combination of GPU's three utilities, Jersey Central Power &AMP; Light 
Co., Metropolitan Edison Co. and Pennsylvania Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	GPU said a search for a successor has begun. In the interim, the  
presidency will be assumed by Robert L. Wise, president of GPU's 
generation and independent power subsidiaries, the company said.

<HEADLINE> O'Malley Wins Mayoral Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- City Councilman Martin O'Malley's  
zero-tolerance stand on crime reached across the racial divide to 
help the white Democrat win his party's mayoral primary in this 
predominantly black city. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a victory for diversity,'' O'Malley said after his win  
Tuesday. ``And it is a decisive victory against divisiveness, fear 
and the worn-out politics of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Democrats outnumbering Republicans 9 to 1, O'Malley is  
expected to easily defeat his GOP challenger -- developer David 
Tufaroin -- in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, which has been led for 12 years by Kurt Schmoke, who  
is black, would join other predominantly black cities such as 
Oakland, Calif., and Gary, Ind., that have elected white mayors in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 36, O'Malley, a boyish former city prosecutor and leader  
of an Irish musical group, would also be the youngest mayor in city 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are good, the people are smart, the people are  
fair,'' he said. ``If you're honest and you're true and you stick 
to issues, everyone appreciates it: black, white, Asian, 
Hispanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Race has been a key factor in politics in Baltimore, where 60  
percent of voters are black. But O'Malley still would have won even 
if Former Councilman Carl Stokes and Council President Lawrence 
Bell combined their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley received 61,219 votes, or 53 percent. Stokes had 32,069  
votes, or 28 percent. Early front-runner Bell, who raised the most 
money as of the end of August, more than $1 million, had 19,611 
votes, or 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes said even though he lost, he was happy to see voters put  
the issues above race. Black voters ``have proven time and time, 
over and over again that they will be fair in their vote,'' Stokes 
said. ``They will vote across lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lenneal Henderson, a professor in the School of Public Affairs  
at the University of Baltimore, agreed: ``I think the voters are 
taller than race and taller than parochialism. That's what this 
demonstrates,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Malley argued that making streets safe will stop the exodus  
from Baltimore, which suffered the second-biggest drop nationwide 
in population between 1990 and 1998. Baltimore's population dropped 
12.3 percent to about 645,000. According to new census figures, 
nearly one out of three whites left Baltimore during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, a 12-year city council member, also supported  
zero-tolerance and had the backing of the city police union. But he 
slipped badly in the wake of revelations about personal financial 
troubles and an incident in which his campaign workers disrupted an 
O'Malley event. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of an incumbent and a full schedule of  
community forums and debates, turnout was about 40 percent compared 
with 47 percent four years ago.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Gets Bauer Campaign Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer's  
national chairman bolted today to the campaign of rival 
conservative Steve Forbes, declaring that Bauer ``cannot win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Jarvis' announcement is a blow to Bauer, who is trying  
to build momentum from a solid fourth-place showing last month in 
the non-binding Iowa straw poll. It gives Forbes a major public 
relations victory in the battle to emerge as the leading 
conservative in the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``After much soul searching, I have concluded that Gary Bauer,  
my friend and colleague for 16 years, cannot win,'' Jarvis said in 
a memo circulated by the Forbes campaign. ``We waged a valiant 
effort in Iowa. I am very proud of our work. But we must be honest 
with ourselves. Our efforts, while impressive, were not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's campaign chairman, Frank Cannon, issued a statement  
saying the campaign was sorry to see Jarvis leave. ``The Bauer 
campaign is moving forward with great momentum,'' Cannon said. ``We 
hope that Charlie can convince Steve Forbes to debate us on the 
issues soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since his failed 1996 presidential run, Forbes has re-tailored  
his message to appeal to conservatives who were wary of his views 
on social positions four years ago. He is largely a self-financed 
candidate who lags far behind Bush in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa straw poll left Forbes and Bauer in the best position  
to challenge the establishment wing of the party, which is lined up 
to a large extent behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Forbes finished 
second in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle finished an embarrassing eighth

finished ahead of Quayle, but is a marginal candidate. Pat Buchanan

	Jarvis, like Bauer, served in the Reagan administration and has  
ties to James Dobson's influential conservative organization. In

	``Steve Forbes is the only conservative who can win and it is  
time for all conservatives to rally behind him,'' it reads.

<P>
	The Forbes campaign said Jarvis will be a non-paid adviser on  
political strategy, a key to courting social conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Previews 2000 Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australians enjoyed a preview of things  
to come today, one year before the start of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds at Darling Harbour watched 16 hours of demonstrations of  
volleyball, weightlifting, boxing fencing and judo and met athletes 
from many of the 28 sports to be contested at the games. Darling 
Harbour will be the venue for some of those sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will help make people more aware that this is approaching  
and to get ready,'' Helen Russell, a Sydney resident, said as she 
collected commemorative pins and watched the live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Australians like a party. ``I think Sydney is about the  
greatest place on earth to live and I think the rest of the world 
can come and see what a great place this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizing chief Michael Knight was in Lausanne,  
Switzerland, celebrating the start of the one-year countdown at an 
International Olympic Committee party that featured a fanfare of 
aboriginal music. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight and IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch were among the  
guests at a ceremony which was broadcast live to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympic movement is full of confidence in the capacity of  
the organizing committee to hold a successful games next year,'' 
Samaranch said. ``I am convinced the games of the 27th Olympiad 
will be a great success for the athletes, for Australia and for the 
Olympic Movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Canberra, a meeting of 60 indigenous leaders convened by the  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission decided not to 
jeopardize the success of the Games next year through protest 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, because we're a sport-loving people ourselves, we  
want to be at the Games, we want a successful Games, we want to see 
Cathy Freeman reach her full potential and get gold,'' former ATSIC 
chairwoman Lowitja O'Donoghue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation chairwoman Evelyn Scott  
said the success of Australian athletes was paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not about to jeopardize the livelihood of our Australian  
athletes be they indigenous or non-indigenous,'' she said. 
``They've worked all their lives for this, to win gold in their own 
country.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Floyd Lashes Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Residents and tourists began venturing  
outside after Hurricane Floyd clobbered the Bahamas, washing ashore 
two barges and flinging trees onto a main highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive storm toppled power lines, ripped roofs off homes  
and pushed a roiling sea into streets Tuesday on the vulnerable 
islands east of Florida before heading toward the southeastern 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued pre-emptive disaster declarations for  
Florida and Georgia, enabling state and local governments to begin 
recovery efforts as early as possible. Nearly 2 million people have 
been urged to leave the storm's path. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow, this is amazing,'' Andreas Appleby, 23, of Raleigh, N.C.,  
said while surveying the havoc wreaked by Floyd in Nassau, the 
Bahama's capital. ``I can't believe all of this damage was caused 
by one storm!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trees blocked the main highway linking the island's east and  
center, and two barges were washed ashore near main street. LOVE-FM 
radio reported an unmanned barge in nearby Arawak Cay Harbor came 
loose from its moorings and was floating in the sea. There were 
reports of flooding up to 3 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people were being treated for minor injuries at Princess  
Margaret Public Hospital, ZNF government radio reported. No other 
information on injuries was immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	It was difficult to estimate the extent of the damage elsewhere  
because the hurricane knocked out phone lines to most of the 
populated islands, and they remained down even as Floyd was poised 
to leave the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. EDT, Floyd was 125 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral.  
</P>
<P>
	It was moving northwest at 13 mph with maximum sustained winds  
at 140 mph, the U.S. National Hurricane center said. The hurricane 
was growing even larger, with hurricane-strength winds of at least 
75 mph extending 125 miles from the center and tropical storm-force 
wind of 40 mph extending 290 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamian Defense Force officials met at government headquarters  
to plan cleanup and relief efforts, and all Defense Force personnel 
were ordered to report to duty early today, JAMZ radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities lost telephone links with outlying islands,  
including Eleuthera, San Salvador and Cat islands, where winds 
reached 110 mph and damage was feared to be extensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't get through to San Salvador or Cat Island, but we  
expect it to be bad,'' said Melanie Roach, an official at a 
government command center. 
</P>
<P>
	Ham radio operators cited reports of flooded homes and damaged  
docks and boats in the northern islands and keys, but the reports 
were posted on the Internet and could not be immediately confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing substantial coming out of those islands,''  
Police superintendent Conrad Sweeting said. ``We have no 
information about damages or injuries there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the Bahamas, hotel guests and vacationers sought  
shelter inside secure lobbies and enclosed rooms. As the power 
flicked on and off, they dozed on couches and on floors, sipped 
coffee, played cards and waited for the storm to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Coast Guard withdrew two helicopters from Nassau to  
Miami before the storm hit on Monday but was ready to respond to 
any search and rescue requests, Coast Guard Lt. Ron Labrec said in 
Miami. More aircraft were on standby at Great Inagua Island in the 
southern Bahamas, the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and 
stations in Florida and Puerto Rico, Labrec said. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd disrupted airline service throughout the Caribbean by  
forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights into and out of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, another major storm loomed: Hurricane Gert, whose  
sustained winds reached 115 mph with higher gusts Tuesday. It was 
located 990 miles east of the Leeward Islands, and was moving west 
at 16 mph.

<HEADLINE> To Win More, Marino Has To Do Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The television audience for ``Monday Night Football'' kept  
getting bigger and bigger before peaking at halftime, when the 
Denver Broncos retired John Elway's number. 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise there, since the rifle-armed,  
tough-as-a-mule-and-cool-as-dry-ice quarterback was always a top 
NFL draw. 
</P>
<P>
	But one of life's little ironies made it impossible for one of  
No. 7's biggest fans to watch. That's because Dan Marino was stuck 
inside the Dolphins locker room during intermission, trying to 
figure out a way to beat No. 7's former team. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it worked out, anyway. Elway still got his grand  
sendoff and close pal Marino settled for a videotape of the 
ceremony -- and what could prove to be a very important victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big win for us, coming in to beat the two-time  
defending champs,'' he said. ``It's a huge win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is not one to exaggerate, but the only way this season  
opener qualifies as huge is for Miami to go on and beat nearly 
everyone in similar fashion. Though he would never say so, Marino 
probably has just one good run left in him. And like Elway at the 
end of his career, the less he has to do to get to the Super Bowl, 
the more likely he is to wrap his hands around the one trophy that 
has eluded him so far. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 previous seasons with the Dolphins, Marino has been the  
only constant and more times than he probably cares to remember 
now, the only reason they won. Monday night in Denver, he was a 
very efficient 15-of-23, with two touchdowns and no interceptions, 
but Marino's presence (not to mention Elway's absence) was not the 
only reason Miami beat Denver so handily. 
</P>
<P>
	A well-choreographed defense led by linebacker Zach Thomas  
limited Broncos running back Terrell Davis to 61 rushing yards and 
no touchdowns in 19 carries, mostly by stacking eight men close to 
the line of scrimmage and daring Elway's replacement, second-year 
passer Brian Griese, to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more important, though, Miami might have stumbled onto  
something they've been lacking from most of the past two decades 
now -- a running game. The Dolphins totaled 111 yards against 
Denver, hardly a stampede, but enough to keep the Broncos from 
zeroing in on Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA product Karim Abdul-Jabbar got most of the work and  
responded well, considering that coach Jimmy Johnson's guarantees 
regarding employment in the Dolphins' backfield are limited to a 
week at a time. Johnson used three of his first four draft picks 
this year on running backs, and both J.J. Jackson and Rob Konrad 
saw action. But the most talented member of the draft trio, Cecil 
Collins, stayed glued to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one scouting service rated Collins the top prospect in  
the draft, but he's been arrested twice for breaking into a woman's 
apartment, failed three drug tests, been dismissed twice from 
college and spent nearly four weeks in jail. Johnson, though, is 
already one year late on the Super Bowl he promised Miami upon his 
arrival in 1996, and so Collins' appearance in a regular-season 
game can't be far off. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter when that is, if Collins is half as good as  
advertised, that day can't come too soon for Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the last member still holding down a job from what is  
considered the greatest quarterbacking class ever to enter the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, six passers were taken in the first round of the 1983  
draft. Marino got to the Super Bowl his second season, got beat and 
hasn't been back since. Jim Kelly took the Buffalo Bills there four 
times and came away empty-handed. Elway lost the first three times 
he made it, and then, leaving more and more of the heroics to Davis 
and a continually improving defense, won back-to-back Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody took away their own memories from the ceremony marking  
the retirement party the Broncos threw Monday night for No. 7. The 
lesson for Marino and the Dolphins is not to recall Elway at his 
most spectacular, but rather at his most opportunistic, finally 
relying on the talents of others more than his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino spent large chunks of his summer playing golf with Elway,  
Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. Besides being automatic Hall of 
Famers and champions, the other thing the trio had in common was 
retirement. Marino is sure to follow them soon, perhaps at the end 
of this season if rumors of Jimmy Johnson's departure from coaching 
turn out to be fact. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a shame if Marino leaves without a championship,  
especially since this is his best chance to do more by doing less. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rebels Claim Killings in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAVUNIYA, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A clandestine guerrilla radio  
broadcast said that Sri Lankan air force jets killed 18 civilians 
and injured 30 while bombing Tamil rebel positions Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Voice of Tiger radio said that Sri Lankan Kfir jets bombed the  
Pudikudiruppu area, near the eastern Mullaithivu coast. Mullaithivu 
is 170 miles east of the capital, Colombo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten civilians' houses were damaged, and there were children  
among the dead, the rebel radio broadcast said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Colombo-based army official later confirmed there had been an  
air attack on rebel territory, and said there was no way to 
determine how many people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that  
the air force attacks only when it receives confirmation of rebel 
targets, and bombing does not occur in civilian areas. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no independent confirmation of either the rebels'  
claim or the military's statement, as journalists are discouraged 
from visiting the war zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are fighting for an  
independent homeland for minority Tamils in the north and east of 
the island country, located off India's southern coast. Over 58,000 
people have died since the war began in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an investigation into a soldier's claim that hundreds  
of Tamils were buried in mass graves in northern Sri Lanka has 
turned up just 11 skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
	The excavation began outside northern Jaffna City on Sept. 6 at  
sites identified by Lance Cpl. Somaratne Rajapakse, who told of the 
graves during his murder trial last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had helped prepare graves for some 300 Tamils after  
the army recaptured the Jaffna Peninsula from Tamil Tiger rebels in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But at some of the sites, no human remains were found, sources  
close to the proceedings said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have called for Rajapakse to testify again.

<HEADLINE> Report: Sanders Mulling NFL Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Whether Barry Sanders plans to return to the NFL  
is still anyone's guess. If he does, it won't be with the Detroit 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' agent, David Ware, said Tuesday that the star running  
back hasn't indicated whether he would return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's ready to consider it, in the right situation,''  
Ware told the Detroit Free Press for a report today. ``But the 
right situation is not the Detroit Lions. His career is finished 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means his career is finished -- period, Lions chief  
operating officer Chuck Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't consider this an issue,'' Schmidt told the newspaper.  
``We've said all along that when Barry signed the contract, it was 
understood that he would retire a Detroit Lion, he'd finish his 
career in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``And unfortunately that's what he's decided. If he decides to  
come back, we'll welcome him back. And if he retires again, he will 
retire a Detroit Lion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who announced his retirement in July, has offered to  
repay $5.4 million of his signing bonus if the Lions release or 
trade him this season, Ware said. He said he made the offer to 
Detroit on Monday, but the team rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were little nonplused ... because they know that he won't  
play for them,'' Ware said. ``They've told us that if he plays 
again, he'll play for them or he won't play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Sanders ``definitely would return,'' if the  
Lions would accommodate him, a source close to the running back 
told ESPN for a story appearing Tuesday on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders has not filed official retirement papers with the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
	His father, William Sanders, said his son hasn't indicated  
whether he'll come back to football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping he'd never quit,'' he said. ``I don't know what  
he's going to do. ... I keep my fingers crossed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions would not confirm whether Ware contacted them on this  
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position remains the same -- that we honored his retirement  
wishes and we expected the repayment of the prorated portion,'' 
Lions spokesman Bill Keenist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit filed a grievance last week to recover $5.4 million of  
the $11 million signing bonus Sanders got when he signed a 
six-year, $36 million contract signed in 1997. Sanders, who needs 
only 1,458 yards to break Walter Payton's career rushing record, 
disagrees with Detroit's claim that he is required to repay a 
portion of the bonus if he doesn't play. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders did not collect a $1.7 million deferred payment due this  
fall on the original bonus. He also forfeited his 1999 base salary 
of $3.125 million and a reporting bonus of $250,000 by retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware said the issue could go either way with an arbitrator. He  
said he has spoken to Lions officials frequently since Sanders 
announced his retirement, asking Sanders to be released or traded 
if he repays the portion of the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL rules governing the salary cap make it impossible for the  
Lions to trade Sanders this year. They would take an accelerated 
hit of $7.3 million. If Sanders returns the signing bonus, they can 
trade him next year without a salary-cap penalty, The Detroit News 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said he doesn't blame the Lions for taking the  
stand they have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't release him either if I had a Barry Sanders on a  
contract,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Ethnic Diversity Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Hispanic and Asian populations of the  
United States surged during the 1990s, the number of Hispanics 
growing by more than 35 percent and Asians more than 40 percent, 
the Census Bureau says. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Tuesday furnishes fresh evidence of increasing  
ethnic diversity and its unpredictable impact on the nation's 
political and social landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend is leading to a time when ``everybody's a minority,''  
said Vanderbilt University historian Hugh Davis Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks, whose numbers grew almost 13 percent between 1990 and  
1998, remain the nation's largest minority at 12.7 percent, or 34.4 
million of the nation's population of about 270 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics made up 9 percent of the population in 1990, and that  
grew by 1998 to just over 11 percent of the total, 30.3 million, 
the annual update of the 1990 Census said. 
</P>
<P>
	The high number of Hispanics in large Electoral College states  
such as Texas, California, Florida and New York gives the group 
substantial political clout, but the growth of Hispanics showed up 
in less expected areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four states had their Hispanic populations double -- Arkansas,  
Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina,'' said Census statistician 
Larry Sink. 
</P>
<P>
	--Arkansas' Hispanic population increased by 150 percent to  
49,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Georgia's increased by 102 percent to 220,000.  
</P>
<P>
	--Nevada's increased by 124 percent to 78,000.  
</P>
<P>
	--North Carolina's increased by 110 percent to 161,000.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hispanic population, already one of the nation's largest  
minorities, will overtake the non-Hispanic black population by the 
end of 2004, said statistician Larry Sink. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen race relations as a black-white issue,'' said  
Roderick Harrison of the Joint Center for Political and Economic 
Studies, a Washington think tank. ``Clearly, the size of the 
Hispanic population and the Asian population turns it into a 
multicultural issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian and Pacific Islander population grew in the 1990s from  
3 percent of the overall population to almost 4 percent at 10.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Nevada the Asian-Pacific Islander population increased by  
106 percent to 81,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Georgia, it increased by 95 percent to 150,000.  
</P>
<P>
	--In North Carolina, it increased by 87 percent to 100,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Dinah Choi, project director for the Asian Pacific Policy and  
Planning Council, said the rapid growth in numbers of Asians 
emphasizes a need for an accurate Census count in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's population of American Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts  
grew 14 percent to 2.4 million during the period. 
</P>
<P>
	States that already had significant populations of specific  
minorities showed less dramatic rate increases. For example, 
California increased its Hispanic population by 31 percent and its 
Asian population by 34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion in Hispanic population lets Latinos sense their  
growing political potency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very critical (presidential) race for us, and we  
will be the defining group,'' Aida Alvarez, chief of the Small 
Business Administration, said Tuesday at a rally for Vice President 
Al Gore's presidential campaign. ``The 21st century will be a 
Latino century, no doubt about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Bush, governor of Texas and the front-runner in the  
race for the Republican presidential nomination, also is targeting 
the Hispanic vote. A recent poll said he and Gore are splitting the 
Hispanic vote in Texas, but Bush trails in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican consultant David Hill of Houston warned a decade ago  
that the GOP needed to gain a bigger share of the Hispanic vote or 
lose gains made when they carved away some whites who traditionally 
voted Democratic before the Reagan era. These Democrats came to be 
known as ``Reagan Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to change the equation is for Republicans to get  
a larger share of the Hispanic vote,'' Hill said. Hispanics voted 
for President Clinton in 1996 by more than 3-1, according to exit 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic Party has always believed that one of our  
greatest strengths is the diversity of our party, and Hispanics and 
Asians have felt comfortable with Democrats,'' said Jenny Backus, a 
Democratic spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential candidates from both parties have made clear this  
year that they want the Hispanic vote, said Lisa Navarrete, 
spokeswoman for the Latino advocacy group the National Council of 
La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been experiencing something people have been  
predicting for a long time,'' she said. ``The growth has been 
amazing since the 1970s. What has really made a difference is the 
growth of the Latino communities where they normally have not 
been.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is the competition over between Los Angeles  
and Houston for the NFL's 32nd team? 
</P>
<P>
	Houston is the favorite again for the league's next expansion  
franchise, although the NFL wasn't expected to take any action 
today, when its initial six-month deadline for Los Angeles expired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 15 cutoff date for receiving an acceptable stadium and  
financing plan from Los Angeles turned out to be flexible. The 
league now is expected to entertain offers until the owners' 
meetings in Atlanta the week of Oct. 5 -- and possibly beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose district includes the  
Coliseum, remains optimistic about LA's chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the market where the league really wants to be,'' he  
said Tuesday. ``Cut through all the bull and somewhere in there, 
there's a deal to be made. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do a deal with the league and the league wants to  
do a deal with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the expansion franchise goes to Houston, the NFL still  
hopes to have a team in Los Angeles at some point, perhaps an 
existing team. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that may be in the realm of possibility, but now we're  
intensively focused on the 32nd franchise,'' Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum, which would be completely remodeled, was chosen  
last April as the NFL's preferred site for a team. But negotiations 
stalled in July when the league asked for more public funding for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
	When talks with the Coliseum bogged down, the league opened the  
door for other possible sites in the Los Angeles area. Carson, 
which had been snubbed when the NFL decided to focus on the 
Coliseum, reentered the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Davis, a billionaire oilman, came forward with a proposal  
to build a stadium at Hollywood Park, reviving an old idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Public funds aside, the league might eventually do its first  
billion-dollar deal in LA since three billionaires seem eager to 
bring a team to town. 
</P>
<P>
	Grocery magnate Ron Burkle is a member of the team headed by  
Michael Ovitz, who at one time seemed favored by the league as a 
potential team owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Backing the idea of renovating the Coliseum was Eli Broad, who  
made his money in housing construction. 
</P>
<P>
	After representatives from Los Angeles and Houston met  
separately with NFL officials in New York this week, league 
spokesman Greg Aiello said it was still a ``four-horse race'' for 
the new franchise. He noted that because of the land and parking 
around Hollywood Park, it was the ``most doable'' of the three LA 
sites.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Think Indians Are Cheating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox are convinced the Indians  
are doing much more than videotaping game's for instructional 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston manager Jimy Williams asked that a camera atop the  
center-field wall at Jacobs Field be covered after he became 
suspicious that Cleveland was stealing signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got something,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams approached umpire crew chief Tim Welke before Tuesday  
night's game -- a 12-3 Boston victory -- with some kind of evidence 
that the Indians were up to no good. 
</P>
<P>
	And apparently whatever Williams showed Welke was enough to have  
the Indians cover the camera, which Cleveland says is used to 
evaluate its own players' performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Welke said he has notified the AL of the situation, and that the  
camera would remained covered for Wednesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the hands of the league office and being handled  
internally,'' he told the Associated Press before Wednesday night's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Welke declined to comment on what Williams showed him, saying,  
``That's up to Jimy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams wasn't much more forthcoming, but said he heard  
whispers the Indians were cheating back in 1995 when he was 
Atlanta's third-base coach. The Braves played the Indians in the 
World Series that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (umpires) must have thought enough of what I showed them  
to have it covered up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove has had  
to defend his team against cheating allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the Red Sox' concerns,'' Hargrove said. ``There  
have been other clubs that we've had concerns with over the years. 
I don't know what we can do to alleviate their fears. We've covered 
up the camera. We don't cheat. We don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish out players did, but we don't. I'm not talking about  
scuffing baseballs or corking bats. I'm not talking about cheating 
in that regard. But I wished we relayed signs and things like that, 
but our players don't want to. ... I understand their concerns on 
the other side. We'll do what we can to allay their fears but I 
don't know what I can do other than to say we're not doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And anyway, Hargrove said, if the Indians are cheating at home,  
how is it that they've won 44 games outside of Jacobs Field? 
</P>
<P>
	``Our record on the road is pretty good too,'' he said. ``I'm  
telling you that we don't do that (cheat). 
</P>
<P>
	Indians catcher Sandy Alomar said he was unaware of Boston's  
charges, and denied the Indians ever do anything underhanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't steal signs,'' he said. ``We don't have players who  
cheat.''

<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- President Clinton today declared federal  
disaster areas in South Carolina and North Carolina as Hurricane 
Floyd continued to pound the southeastern seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in remarks during a brief refueling stop at Hickam Air  
Force Base, said he told the governors of both states that he and 
other federal officials ``would do everything we can'' to help 
residents deal with the storm and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that every citizen will heed the warnings of the

<HEADLINE> Gore Embraces Hispanic Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore will be able to walk  
into tonight's Congressional Hispanic Caucus gala dinner with the 
endorsements of 521 Latino activists in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	But by sharing the stage with Hillary Rodham Clinton, Gore risks  
seeing his limelight stolen by the first lady's unresolved campaign 
contretemps with Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore himself has not said much about whether President Clinton  
was right to free 14 Puerto Rican nationalists imprisoned on 
sedition and weapons convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye on his own growing Hispanic support, Gore has said  
only that he is ``not going to stand in judgment'' of the 
president's clemency decision. Gore aides privately emphasize that 
the vice president's statement is hardly an endorsement of 
clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's surprise announcement of opposition to her  
husband's move infuriated several Puerto Rican political leaders, 
among them Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., who said he no longer could 
support her campaign for a Senate seat from New York, a state with 
a large Puerto Rican population. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president hasn't spoken out,'' Rep. Xavier Becerra,  
D-Calif., lamented after a pep rally Tuesday launching Gore's 
effort to amass support in the Hispanic community. 
</P>
<P>
	In that appearance, where Gore pumped hands in an adoring crowd  
to the hot-salsa sounds of Ricky Martin, the clemency issue did not 
come up. Instead, Puerto Rico's pro-statehood governor, Pedro 
Rossello, saluted Gore's ``sensitivity'' to Hispanic concerns, and 
his campaign released the 15-page list of endorsements for Gore's 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there is an interest in resolving this issue of  
clemency, it doesn't supplant education, health care, crime, all 
the other issues of importance,'' Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly am willing to give (Gore) a bye if he's here to  
talk about other issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady was not escaping so easily.  
</P>
<P>
	Becerra told reporters that some attending the Congressional  
Hispanic Caucus Institute's annual convention, in the same hotel 
where Gore staged his rally, were abuzz with ``real 
disappointment'' in Mrs. Clinton for her failure to consult them on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it shows that the first lady probably has to continue  
her -- what is it? -- her listening campaign,'' Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore aides said they paid no attention to Gore's double billing  
with the first lady and were unconcerned by it. 
</P>
<P>
	For her part, Mrs. Clinton tried over the weekend to put the  
matter to rest. She acknowledged that she could have done more to 
consult with Hispanic leaders and said that mistake ``will never 
happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The year 2000 crop of political candidates, including Republican  
presidential hopeful George W. Bush, is fiercely courting Latino 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	New census data released Tuesday showed the U.S. Hispanic  
population grew by more than 35 percent to about 30.3 million 
between 1990 and 1998, increasing their share of the total 
population from 9 percent to 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With a riff on pop star Martin's hit single, Gore supporters on  
Tuesday ridiculed any inroads Bush, the Texas governor, has made 
with the Hispanic community. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's all this talk about George W. Bush and the Latino  
community? I mean they talk about this guy like he's Ricky Martin 
or something,'' said California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody thinks that George W. Bush is good for Latinos,  
they ARE living 'La Vida Loca.' (The Crazy Life.)'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Bustamante's endorsement of Gore sounded a bit  
backhanded: ``Many months ago I decided -- maybe it wasn't the smart 
political thing to do, but I think it was the right thing to do -- 
to support Al Gore for president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his ``Ganamos con Gore'' (We win with Gore) theme  
week, Gore joined former ``NYPD Blue'' actor Jimmy Smits and the 
National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts on Monday night to 
deplore the lack of diversity in mainstream movie and TV roles. On 
Thursday, he speaks to the Latino Chamber of Commerce in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's lone rival for the  
Democratic presidential nomination, is also competing for minority 
voters in next year's primaries. And on Monday, the Bradley camp 
announced endorsements from a host of Brooklyn political leaders, 
including several influential members of the New York City 
borough's black community.

<HEADLINE> UAW Extends Automakers' Deadlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Talks between the United Auto Workers  
and DaimlerChrysler AG stretched into the wee hours today as the 
union granted an open-ended extension to automakers' contracts that 
cover 407,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no word on progress from the union or  
DaimlerChrysler, the continuing talks were a sign that a deal could 
be imminent. Talks between the union and General Motors Corp. ended 
late Tuesday evening, while negotiations at Ford Motor Co. were 
much less intense. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokesman David Barnas said early today that the  
union had granted the company an indefinite extension of its 
three-year contract, and talks for a contract covering 75,000 
workers would continue into the morning. Similar extensions were 
given to GM and Ford on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still hopeful we will be able to get a contract without  
significant work stoppage,'' DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Bob Eaton 
said at a news conference Wednesday at the Frankfurt International 
Motor Show. 
</P>
<P>
	While marathon talks are a traditional sign of progress, there  
also were signs of strain between the union and DaimlerChrysler. 
National negotiators, including UAW President Stephen P. Yokich, 
were meeting at DaimlerChrysler headquarters when workers at five 
plants in Missouri and Indiana staged a brief walkout Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at two DaimlerChrysler plants in Fenton, Mo., outside of  
St. Louis, walked off the job at 9:45 p.m. EDT and started 
picketing. The plants, which make the highly profitable Dodge Ram 
trucks and DaimlerChrysler's minivans, employ about 7,100. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 minutes later, workers at two transmission plants and a  
casting plant in Kokomo, Ind., walked off the job, DaimlerChrysler 
officials said. Those plants employ a total of 8,400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The picket signs in Fenton went down about an hour after they  
went up. One local in Kokomo said members should report to work as 
scheduled today; a telephone message at a Fenton local told workers 
to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnas said the union has not told DaimlerChrysler the reason  
for the walkouts. Officials at locals in Missouri and Indiana could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages, job security, health care costs, overtime demands and the  
assignment of work to outside suppliers were expected to be among 
the top issues in this year's talks, as they were during the last 
round in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of  
record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more 
than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few indications of what proposals the UAW and  
DaimlerChrysler might be negotiating. The union has discussed 
efforts to organize DaimlerChrysler's nonunion plants in the United 
States: a Mercedes-Benz sport utility factory in Alabama with 1,600 
workers and Freightliner commercial truck plants in the Carolinas.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Party Threatens Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- An ethnic-based party in Pakistan  
warned Wednesday that its activists could use violence to protest 
police attacks on its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muttahida Qami Movement, which represents the Indian  
immigrant population, accused Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of 
ordering the police to arrest, torture and kill its workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this situation the government is pushing us toward  
violence,'' said Farooq Sattar, a spokesman for the MQM. ``We have 
tried the peaceful approach, but the government has responded with 
brute force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sattar did not explain what form the violence could take.  
</P>
<P>
	Since November 1998 when Sharif dismissed the Sindh provincial  
government and imposed federal rule, 28 MQM workers have died while 
in police custody, Sattar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sattar said police explain that MQM workers die of heart attack  
or while trying to escape. Pakistan's independent human rights 
groups also have complained of unexplained deaths in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The MQM, along with 18 other opposition parties, including  
former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's party, the Pakistan People's 
Party, have been waging almost daily protests against Sharif's 
government in southern Sindh province, of which Karachi is the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the government has imposed a two-month ban on  
demonstrations in the province, saying the daily strikes and 
protests is crippling businesses in Karachi, the country's 
commercial and financial center. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition has responded with promises of further  
demonstrations and strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The MQM is the second largest political party in southern Sindh  
province. Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party is the largest.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Extend Lindy Ruff's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres signed coach Lindy Ruff  
to a three-year contract extension on Wednesday, reportedly worth 
more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, 39, who has one season remaining on a three-year deal, is  
entering his third season with the Sabres after guiding the team to 
its first Stanley Cup final in 24 years. The new salary puts him on 
par with the NHL average for coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've put together something very special here,'' Ruff said.  
``We've got some great challenges ahead of us, from the 
expectations this year to looking past this year and I thought a 
commitment for the next three years would be something I would 
welcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff's 24 playoff wins in two seasons with the Sabres make him  
the franchise leader in postseason victories. His 24-12 playoff 
record gives him the best winning percentage of any current coach, 
67 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres did not disclose terms of the new contract, however  
print and broadcast reports put the number at more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres start the regular season in Detroit Oct. 2.

<HEADLINE> Denver's Housing Market Spiraling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- When Francis Bodie was transferred to Denver, the  
network engineer figured he'd stay in the basement of a friend's 
suburban home for a couple of weeks while he searched for a house. 
</P>
<P>
	He was there for three months.  
</P>
<P>
	Finding a place to call home has become a  
survival-of-the-quickest competition in metropolitan Denver, where 
a population boom has sent the housing market spiraling. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many other house hunters, Bodie learned to ferret out ``for  
sale'' signs, and to hurry to inspect a house as soon as his real 
estate agent called. 
</P>
<P>
	He also realized early on that he needed a pre-approved mortgage  
to stand out, since sellers often receive offers that top their 
asking price, some coming in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like a traffic jam,'' Bodie said. ``Everyone gets  
backed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House hunters resort to sending out fliers to ``sell''  
themselves to sellers. They build networks of friends and relatives 
who may know of a hot property. And they drop everything once they 
learn of a prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It becomes a foot race, and you ask, 'Am I going to  
collapse?''' said D.L. Buchanan, 45, a children's therapist. 
</P>
<P>
	After a decade of stagnation, Denver's economy has boomed in the  
'90s as companies have been drawn there by affordable housing and 
labor costs. With the boom has come workers -- many of them. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Census Bureau statistics placed Colorado among the five  
fastest growing states, posting a 2 percent increase in population. 
The state is expected to have nearly 4.1 million people by 2000, 
according to estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last year, Denver was second only to San Francisco in  
rising housing costs, with prices climbing 4.5 percent -- about 
twice the national average, according to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	And prices continue to increase. Two months ago, an average  
house in metro Denver cost $211,194 -- a 10 percent hike from July 
1998, according to Perry and Butler Realty, a local firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, low apartment vacancy rates have led to waiting lists  
of people willing to snatch new units as soon as they become 
available. Apartment prices have increased as well, statistics 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The market madness is being driven by newcomers hailing from  
higher-priced regions, who come to Colorado with a lot of money to 
spend, said Richard Wobbekind, University of Colorado's director of 
business research. 
</P>
<P>
	As bigger, more expensive houses are built, many Coloradans go  
after them as well, further increasing competition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a new phenomenon for Colorado,'' Wobbekind said.  
``That's why there is a shock going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe the housing boom will settle by year's end,  
when the construction industry catches up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the hunt remains a frustrating, seemingly  
endless task for many. 
</P>
<P>
	In his search, Jeff Schaich, a Boulder graphic designer, said he  
often found several groups trying to inspect townhouses for sale at 
the same time. Often, a mess of Realtor calling cards littered 
tables in front hallways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk about feeling the pressure,'' said Schaich, 34, who had  
seven bids rejected before he was able to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder Realtor Rich Gribbon said buyers often have just a few  
minutes to decide whether to submit a bid. ``You don't even 
remember the color of the carpet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate agent Susan Joslyn said she has even handed out  
fliers about families who want to buy houses in certain 
neighborhoods. When there are no houses for sale, she said agents 
go door-to-door to see if homeowners have thought about selling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tell buyers you have to be diligent, you can't be casual  
about it,'' she said. ``You have to treat it almost like a job.''

<HEADLINE> Branch Davidians' Lawsuit Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- Lawyers for survivors of the Branch Davidian  
tragedy applauded a judge's decision to delay a wrongful death 
trial against the federal government, saying the move will give 
them more time to look at evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Walter Smith on Wednesday delayed the trial  
set for Oct. 18 so federal officials can produce evidence he has 
demanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good news,'' said plaintiffs' attorney Mike Caddell of  
Houston. ``I always thought Judge Smith would give us a reasonable 
amount of time to conduct discovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new court date was not set. But Smith said the government's  
request for a fall 2000 date was ``unrealistic'' and he will not 
postpone the trial for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	One plaintiffs attorney wants the case put off until the  
resolution of congressional and independent inquiries under way in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing to do is let all of this clear and then proceed  
with the civil trial,'' said Russell Solomon of New Orleans. 
``These people are all dead, so what does time matter now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 28, 1993, U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
agents raided the rural home of Branch Davidian leader David Koresh 
and his followers. Four agents and six cult members died in a gun 
battle after the Davidians were tipped to the impending raid. 
Following a 51-day siege, Koresh and nearly 80 others died after a 
fire consumed the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Surviving Davidians and the relatives of the dead later sued,  
challenging the government's conclusion that the cult members 
themselves started the fire and that they shot first during the 
initial raid. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri was recently appointed by  
Attorney General Janet Reno as the special counsel to investigate 
the FBI's conduct during the siege. The agency admitted last month 
after years of denials that it fired potentially flammable tear-gas 
canisters at the Davidian compound the day of the fire. However, 
the government still insists the Davidians started the fatal blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin praised the judge's  
decision to delay the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the judge appropriately recognized that gathering  
all these materials would take longer than Oct. 1,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had ordered the government to surrender all evidence by  
Oct. 1 or face a contempt of court citation.

<HEADLINE> Former All-American Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) -- Terry Miller, a two-time All-American  
running back at Oklahoma State, was sentenced to two years in 
prison on Tuesday for defrauding a McAlester bank out of $179,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to apologize to those I hurt in this matter,'' Miller  
said. ``I want to leave the impression I will do anything I can to 
make it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's lawyer, Steve Stidham, said he had hoped Miller, 43,  
could avoid a jail term. His client has been a longtime community 
volunteer who has paid back most of his $1 million debt to The 
Bank, N.A. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who is out on bond, will report to prison in November.  
</P>
<P>
	``He will pay The Bank back every penny,'' Stidham said.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors alleged in March that Miller submitted false  
invoices to The Bank beginning around March 1995. Under a business 
manager agreement negotiated with The Bank that same month, he 
would then receive advance funds based on the invoices. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller and his sports-apparel company, Sports Nut Inc., received  
about $1 million in advances, $179,000 of which was gained through 
the false invoices, according to records. The former football star 
has paid back more than $800,000 of the money, Stidham said. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Frank H. Seay said Miller's situation didn't meet  
the requirements needed for a lighter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller also faces three years of probation upon his release from  
prison and must pay the $179,000 in restitution to The Bank, Seay 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. attorney Jeff Gallant noted during Tuesday's  
sentencing hearing that Miller had four previous convictions on his 
record. Two of those convictions were for writing bad checks, which 
indicated fraudulent behavior, Gallant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller testified that his business situation suffered after  
$900,000 worth of sports jackets were recalled from his company. 
The jackets had been made by a Eufaula sewing company with which 
Miller also was involved, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was one of the most decorated running backs in Oklahoma  
State history. He ran for 1,680 yards in 1977, his senior year, and 
finished second to Earl Campbell of Texas in the Heisman Trophy 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an NFL first-round draft pick by the Buffalo Bills.  
Replacing O.J. Simpson in the Bills backfield, Miller gained more 
than 1,000 yards in his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries ended Miller's pro career. He started Sports Nut Inc.  
in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Suit Vs. Hewlett-Packard Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A federal court has dismissed a lawsuit  
Xerox Corp. filed last year against Hewlett-Packard Co., 
effectively ending one of five technology-related lawsuits between 
the two office equipment companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox had filed the lawsuit in May last year in federal court  
seeking to block H-P from selling inkjet supplies and printers, 
including some DeskJet models, using the disputed technology. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Michael Telesca ruled Tuesday that H-P did  
not infringe on Xerox's patent and dismissed in its entirety 
Xerox's action against H-P. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox officials said the company would appeal the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	The companies remain locked in a series of other legal  
squabbles, spawned largely by Xerox's introduction in 1997 of H-P 
compatible laser-printer cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition fostered a series of lawsuits over patents and  
trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies settled one lawsuit in January, with Xerox  
agreeing to redesign lettering on packages for H-P-compatible 
printer cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
	In another lawsuit, a federal court in Wichita, Kan., handed  
down a mixed ruling in August forcing H-P to complete shipments to 
Xerox of 4,000 computer chips based on H-P's TrueRes technology, 
which Xerox uses to sharpen images produced by its DocuPrint NC60 
color laser printer. 
</P>
<P>
	But that court ruled Xerox would have to fight for any further  
shipments, forcing the company to look elsewhere for equivalent 
technology.

<HEADLINE>  Emmitt Speaks Up, Cowboys Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Emmitt Smith was tired of seeing the Dallas  
Cowboys throw incompletion after incompletion, so he took his 
complaint to the boss, coach Chan Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking with more passion and volume than usual, Smith reminded  
Gailey how well they had been running the ball against Washington. 
The passing game, he noted, wasn't working and the Redskins were 
building a big lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey sensed Smith's determination and gave in. He called runs  
on the next eight plays and ended up triggering one of the best 
comebacks in franchise history as Dallas turned a 35-14 deficit 
into a 41-35 overtime victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the glow of that game is wearing off as the Cowboys  
prepare to play Atlanta on Monday night, there's still talk about 
Smith's emotional outburst -- and Smith doesn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing the same steely glare, Smith on Wednesday shot down the  
notion that he challenged his coach and demanded the ball, and he 
insisted there are no problems between them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're humans and humans have emotions,'' Smith said. ``It's  
nice to let your emotions show sometimes. I felt like it was an 
appropriate time for everyone to let them go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to create some kind of controversy between me  
and my head coach because I have a great deal of respect for my 
head coach. I believe in what we're doing, in our offensive system 
and in our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he puts so much time and energy into preparing for  
the season that there would've been something wrong if he hadn't 
spoken up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go through training camp, two-a-days in the heat, people  
hollering at you and then when you get in the middle of a very 
heated game and you're behind by 21, you've got to have some kind 
of emotions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emotions drive you to come back and push it into overtime.  
The emotions also help you go into overtime and pull it out. That's 
what the game is all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take out the emotional part of the game, you've just  
got a doggone chess match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys led 14-13 at halftime and ran on their first two  
plays of the third quarter. They then passed on nine of the next 
10, resulting in an interception and two punts -- and three straight 
Redskins touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey admitted he goofed on his play calling.  
</P>
<P>
	``After going back and watching the film, I'd probably change  
that and run the ball a little more in the third quarter,'' he 
said. ``At the time, I thought we were doing the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Dallas returned to the ground game, Smith and backup Chris  
Warren moved the chains and kept the Washington defense from laying 
back waiting for Troy Aikman to throw. Once the Redskins began 
thinking run, the Cowboys hit them with passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey's theory of keeping the defense off balance ultimately  
led to the game-winning play. 
</P>
<P>
	With Dallas facing third-and-2 from its 24, the Redskins  
expected a handoff to Smith. Instead, Aikman faked the exchange and 
threw deep to Raghib Ismail, whose nearest defender was sucked in 
on the play action. Ismail cruised to a 76-yard touchdown, capping 
a 21-point comeback that matched the biggest in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chan is the head coach and he got it under control,'' Smith  
said. ``We got the running game going and things went back to 
clicking like they were in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it all worked out.''

<HEADLINE> Prayers Turn To Screams in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Kim Herron was tending to a flock of  
young children when she heard gunfire erupt at Wedgwood Baptist 
Church. Her first thoughts were of her 17-year-old daughter, who 
was in another part of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	But she waited with the children, leading the group of 100 in  
singing, ``Jesus Loves Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You know our God's in control, but at the same time, you're a  
mom and it's so, so scary,'' Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter had been attending a worship service at the church  
complex when a gunman sprayed the pews with bullets from a 
high-caliber semiautomatic pistol. Seven people were fatally 
wounded; the gunman killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Herron wasn't sure if her daughter was still alive until she saw  
her outside the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Satan just doesn't want God to be glorified, I think  
Satan is at work in the world. That was Satan incarnate,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's regular worship service was packed with teen-agers  
who earlier had taken part in an annual prayer ceremony at their 
schools. A band was playing music when gunshots rang out in the 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	Adults in the assembly hall thought the noise was hammering in  
the hallway, but a bloody teen then wrenched open the door and 
collapsed inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street, off-duty police Officer Chip Gillette looked  
out a window to see why his dog was barking. Children, screaming in 
panic, were streaming from the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots were still being fired as Gillette entered the church and  
the first police car arrived on the scene, acting Chief Ralph 
Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very quick response,'' Mendoza said.  
</P>
<P>
	Afraid of an ambush, Gillette cautiously eased into the building  
but found the gunman dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of police and paramedics converged on the building,  
where a triage area was set up outside. Frantic parents raced to 
the church.

<HEADLINE> Greene Wins 100-Meter Race in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Maurice Greene, a triple-gold winner in the World  
Championships last month, won the men's 100 meters today at the 
12th annual Super Track and Field Meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The world-record holder finished in 10.35 seconds, edging fellow  
American Curtis Johnson, who was second in 10.40 seconds with 
China's Yin Hanzhao third in 10.56. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the only event Greene took part in the one-day meet at  
the end of the track season, geared more toward fun than 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough because of the wind,'' Greene said of the race held  
as a typhoon was approaching Tokyo and elsewhere in central Japan. 
``Without the wind, I believe I could have run a lot faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 track season was just great, he said. ``I am happy I  
had a very good year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his next goal, Greene said: ``My main focus is to win the  
Olympic gold. That comes first, not a record. Right now, I have a 
goal of 9.76 and the coach said I am capable of running faster but 
I take small steps at a time. The most important is to win the 
Olympic gold. That's something I haven't done and I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He holds the world record with a time of 9.79 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dream come true,'' he said on his status as the  
world's fastest runner. ``Now I can say I was a No. 1 once. Records 
are made to be broken and anything can happen in a 100-meter. I am 
thankful and try to be the best. I believe I am the best and as 
long as I keep believing in myself, I can improve myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said he's going home from Tokyo to rest, looking back on  
the good season, and visiting his grandmother in Kansas, who turns 
97 on Sept. 27th. 
</P>

	In the 100-meter hurdles, American Larry Wade edged world-record  
holder Colin Jackson with a time of 13.50 seconds. Jackson placed 
second in 13.55 seconds with Japan's Satoru Mizuno third in 13.95. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' Wade said. ``This is my first time in Japan.  
For me, to beat him makes me really feel good. I raced against him 
seven times and beat him four times.''

American compatriot Torrence Zellener was third in 49.21.

<HEADLINE> Violence Site at U. of Tex. Reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- From the observation deck of the University  
of Texas Tower, school president Larry Faulkner could see students 
milling about on the mall below -- the same place where gunman 
Charles Whitman found many of his victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The deck was reopened Wednesday, 25 years after officials closed  
it because of the 1966 sniper attack that killed 16 people and a 
series of suicide jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't wipe out the past but you don't stop with the  
past,'' Faulkner said as he surveyed the panoramic view from the 
clock tower's 27th floor. ``I believe it is important that we move 
beyond these painful chapters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tower was forever linked with Whitman on Aug. 1, 1966, when  
he lugged a rifle and a footlocker full of ammunition to the 
observation deck and started shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The bloody rampage lasted for 92 minutes, until he was shot to  
death by police officers Ramiro Martinez and Houston McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like Whitman was holding the tower hostage,'' said  
Martinez, who favored reopening the observation deck. ``It's time 
we took the tower back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine other deaths are associated with the tower, including two  
accidental falls and seven suicides, five from the observation 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
	The university closed the deck in 1974 but agreed last year to  
reopen it using a plan generated by students. 
</P>
<P>
	The deck is now covered with a stainless steel lattice to thwart  
jumpers. Visitors must go through a metal detector and cannot bring 
packages onto the observation deck. Security guards will be posted 
at the check-in point and on the deck, Faulkner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulkner said most people have favored reopening the observation  
deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad they're doing it,'' said Robert Heard, a former  
Associated Press reporter who was shot by Whitman while covering 
the story. ``It's a magnificent view from up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month the university dedicated a memorial garden on the  
north side of the tower to honor Whitman's victims.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Push Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures surged Wednesday, resuming a year-long rally  
and reaching a 2 1/2-year high after Venezuela pledged to follow 
through on production cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, orange juice futures plunged after Hurricane  
Floyd missed groves along the Florida coast, and wheat futures fell 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil continued its steady march upward after a one-day  
respite. Crude for delivery in December rose 27 cents to $24.13 on 
the New York Mercantile Exchange after zooming as high as $24.49 -- 
its highest level since Feb. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That's well over twice what crude sold for last December amid a  
world oil glut. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by continued unity among the Organization of Petroleum  
Export Countries on production cuts, as well as declining U.S. 
inventories, oil prices could continue their rise for the 
foreseeable future, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we've got very strong OPEC compliance and  
inventories continue to drop, prices could go even higher,'' said 
Bob Morris, an analyst for Paine Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments out of Venezuela fueled Wednesday's market movement as  
President Hugo Chavez insisted his country will stand by the OPEC 
production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, prices edged downward after he said that if prices  
continue flowing upward, Venezuela will pursue its proposal to 
establish an oil price band system to help stabilize world crude 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``If OPEC wants prices to stabilize, the best thing is for them  
not to say anything,'' said Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether prices push to even higher levels may hinge on next  
week's OPEC meeting in Vienna, Austria. Experts say prices could 
settle if the world's top producers give some indication about 
readjusting quotas or clarify what they think is a good oil price. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil prices, which have mirrored crude's climb, were  
unchanged Wednesday at 61.06 cents per gallon for October delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	October unleaded regular gasoline rose .63 cent to 69.05 cents a  
gallon; October natural gas fell .8 cent to $2.628 per million 
British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude for delivery in October fell 12  
cents to $23.59 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The tension went out of the orange juice futures market after  
Floyd skirted the central Florida coast, pounding the region with 
125 mph winds and heavy rains but apparently leaving groves intact 
in the heart of the nation's top juice-producing region. 
</P>
<P>
	``The orange juice crop is not going to be a problem,'' said  
Elizabeth Steger, president of Citrus Consulting International in 
Orlando. ``I didn't hear anything about damage to the groves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears that the storm could wreck thousands of trees had driven  
prices to nearly the $1-a-pound level this week. But word that the 
key growing areas were relatively unscathed sent the market down 5 
cents on Wednesday to close at 91.55 cents on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures plummeted on the Chicago Board of Trade after  
rains soaked fields in Kansas and Texas overnight, improving crop 
prospects with farmers poised to sow winter wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also was pressured by continued weak export demand.  
Sluggish export demand for U.S. wheat puts more emphasis on the 
winter wheat crop, resulting in exaggerated reactions to weather 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 12 1/2 cents to $2.61 1/2 a bushel.  
Other grains and soybean futures also retreated -- December corn 
fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.12 1/4 a bushel, December oats fell 2 cents to 
$1.12 3/4 a bushel and November soybeans fell 12 3/4 cents to $4.89 a 
bushel.

<HEADLINE> Hair Braiders Fight for Their Craft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Gently pulling aside a tiny clump of hair from  
the woman sitting in front of her, JoAnne Cornwell deftly maneuvers 
the tresses into a tightly coiled lock. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a time when such a simple action could have resulted  
in a hefty fine because Cornwell, like thousands of other braiders 
of African-styled hair designs, doesn't hold a state cosmetology 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	So before the state could come knocking on her door, she took  
them to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: Cornwell is celebrating a federal court victory that  
she and her fellow hair braiders nationwide hope will pave the way 
for them to keep practicing their craft without a license they feel 
is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't shampoo. We don't use chemicals. And we don't cut  
hair,'' said Cornwell, a university professor who developed her own 
trademarked styling technique called Sisterlocks. ``Yet they want 
us to take 1,600 hours of cosmetology training that never addresses 
what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Rudi Brewster agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The court concludes that requiring a would-be African hair  
braider to attend a school of cosmetology is irrational and 
certainly unreasonable,'' the judge said in a 26-page ruling issued 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But he declined to issue a summary judgment extending that kind  
of blanket protection to the American Hairbraiders and Natural Hair 
Care Association in general, partly because their stylists' 
practices vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
	While the association argues its case, the Department of  
Consumer Affairs, which oversees the state's Barbering and 
Cosmetology Program, is waiting for a final ruling before deciding 
whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	State and cosmetology officials have argued that hair braiders  
need to be licensed to ensure consumers are protected. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're working in an environment where diseases and where  
head lice can be transmitted from person to person,'' said Gordon 
Miller, executive director of the 30,000-member National 
Cosmetology Association. ``Sanitary procedures are things that need 
to be learned and understood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are believed to be thousands of people operating small,  
home-based businesses around the country offering such 
African-styled braiding as corn rows and dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But many have been pushed underground by state cosmetology  
boards that want them to undergo training, said attorney Clint 
Bolick of the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Justice, which 
filed the lawsuit on behalf of Cornwell and the hairbraiders 
assocation. 
</P>
<P>
	A few states have addressed the issue either by creating a  
separate license for braiders or exempting them from the 
cosmetology requirements. Two bills that would do the same in 
California are pending in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Bolick said he hopes to use the Sisterlock  
ruling to induce nationwide deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout this litigation, the state was unable to identify  
virtually any unlicensed hairstylists who had harmed consumers,'' 
he said. ``They know they can snuff out competition if they force 
African hairstylists to submit to massive irrelevant training in 
cosmetology schools that derive an enormous profit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornwell, a San Diego State University professor, developed the  
Sisterlock, which is like a tiny dreadlock about the width of a 
pipe cleaner, while experimenting with new hairstyles for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Tuesday she received so many compliments from other  
black women that she decided to turn the style into a business in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Sisterlocks now has some 200 stylists working in several states.  
Each receives 16 hours of training and is kept up on procedures 
through newsletters, manuals and videos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issues that we're presenting are issues that everyone can  
relate to,'' she said. ``They have to do with the right to earn an 
honest living, individuals and self-empowerment, 
community-building, with all kinds of things that have to do with 
the American way.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Upholds Racketeering Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A judge today refused to throw out a racketeering  
indictment against a reputed mobster-turned-informant, saying the 
deal he had with the FBI did not grant him immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf said the case of Stephen ``The  
Rifleman'' Flemmi, which led the FBI to admit it mishandled 
informants and threatened to undo earlier mob prosecutions, had 
merit but did not deserve to be dismissed entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flemmi did not understand that the government, or any of its  
agents, had agreed that he would not be investigated, by the FBI or 
any other law enforcement agency, or prosecutor,'' the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather, he expected that the FBI would overlook some of his  
criminal activity, provide him information concerning any 
investigations that were conducted, and warn him of any imminent 
charges against him of which it learned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf acknowledged the case could be thrown out later.  
</P>
<P>
	Testimony during months of hearings revealed that Flemmi and  
James ``Whitey'' Bulger were longtime informants who dined with FBI 
agents, swapped gifts, and gave money and loans to the agents. 
Flemmi said he and Bulger, now a fugitive, were even tipped off to 
the pending indictments so they could flee. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers sought to dismiss the 1995 racketeering  
indictments based on a relationship that was so cozy that Bulger 
and Flemmi were free to commit crimes -- short of murder -- as long 
as they kept informing on their associates. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how Wolf's decision would affect  
other co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bulger and Flemmi, the ruling is largely irrelevant because  
they now face more serious racketeering allegations that include 
gangland murders. 
</P>
<P>
	The intensified prosecution was at least partially related to  
the disclosures about their past as informants. John Martorano, an 
admitted killer and racketeering co-defendant, became angry about 
Bulger's and Flemmi's cooperation with authorities and agreed to 
testify against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosures about the Bulger-Flemmi relationship with the FBI  
led agency Director Louis Freeh to concede it made significant 
mistakes handling informants and had changed its policies.

<HEADLINE> Judge Upholds Racketeering Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Wednesday refused to throw out  
a racketeering indictment against a mobster-turned-informant, but 
said the case can only go forward if the government can prove it 
was as faithful to their deal as he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi's agreement with the FBI did not  
grant him all-encompassing immunity, U.S. District Judge Mark L. 
Wolf ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	But he ordered hearings to determine whether the indictments  
against Flemmi resulted from the very wiretaps that he helped the 
government obtain by providing information about the room where a 
1989 mob induction ceremony was held. If that's the case, the 
charges against him could be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said Flemmi relied on FBI assurances that any evidence  
intercepted through wiretaps would not be used against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flemmi performed his part of the bargain,'' Wolf wrote. ``The  
government claims that it should not be required to provide Flemmi 
the benefit of that bargain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends that any agreement that Flemmi had with  
the FBI was invalid because he committed many serious crimes -- 
including murder -- but did not tell the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys had filed a motion to dismiss the racketeering  
indictments based on the cozy relationship between Flemmi, 
defendant James ``Whitey'' Bulger, also an informant, and FBI 
officials who turned a blind eye to criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Flemmi's 30-year relationship with the FBI was tight enough that  
they exchanged holiday gifts and the feds looked the other way when 
crimes were committed -- as long as Flemmi kept informing on his 
pals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Wolf's decision could be irrelevant for Bulger and  
Flemmi because they now face more serious racketeering allegations 
that include gangland murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Flemmi's lawyer, Kenneth Fishman, called Wolf's decision a  
``stunning victory. ... The court has clearly rejected the notion 
that the government can walk away from deals made with top echelon 
informants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern said he was pleased the judge did  
not dismiss the indictment but disappointed further hearings were 
deemed necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Mawn, the FBI's special agent in charge, said the judge's  
ruling will be reviewed to identify and correct ``potential problem 
areas.''

<HEADLINE> Future Safety Systems See Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Right now, a car's safety systems,  
such as air bags and seat belts, don't do anything until the 
vehicle slams into another object. 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, cars will do a bit more thinking ahead -- using  
radar sensors and cameras to predict a crash and help lessen the 
impact and injury, or possibly even avoid an accident altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can predict a crash, you can do a better job of  
managing that energy,'' said Ralph Hoar, an auto safety consultant 
based in Arlington, Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea has been in the works for years, and several automakers  
are working on the concept, including Mercedes-Benz, which used the 
Frankfurt International Motor Show to show off a system that could 
be in production in as little as two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is the next great step in passive safety,'' said  
Rainer Justen, an engineer at Mercedes, a division of the merged 
DaimlerChrysler. He said 59 percent of accidents are caused in such 
a way that predictive sensors could help. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Mercedes system, radar sensors are located in the front  
bumper and a camera is mounted on the back of the rear-view mirror, 
facing through the front windshield. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices help determine the speed and size of the object that  
the car is about to hit. The car automatically tightens seat belts 
and inflates air bags ahead of the actual collision -- as much as 
16.5 to 33 feet before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The pre-crash system could be especially beneficial for  
passengers, Justen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the driver usually sees the accident coming and slams on  
the brake, they maintain a position that allows for the maximum 
benefit from air bags and seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	A passenger, however, usually doesn't see the accident coming  
and is jerked forward when the brakes are applied. That means the 
seat belt has too much slack and the air bag is too close. 
</P>
<P>
	More advanced systems also could eventually adjust the stiffness  
of the bumper -- making it softer when a pedestrian is in the way of 
the car or harder when the car is about to collide with a solid 
object, for example a wall or another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Other innovations could include a hood that rises to cushion the  
impact of a pedestrian who is thrown onto the front of a car after 
being struck. 
</P>
<P>
	If the car can predict the accident, then why not just prevent  
it altogether? Future innovations will also help apply the brakes 
to reduce stopping distance, or even bring the car to an emergency 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoar cautioned that such systems would not eliminate human error  
-- or the necessity to develop safety features. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither manufacturers nor the public should think this will  
mean there will be no more crashes, or that less thought has to be 
given to protecting people when crashes occur.''

<HEADLINE> Bruce Lee Gallery Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- In an attempt to boost tourism, Hong Kong plans  
to build a memorial gallery for the late Kung Fu star Bruce Lee and 
a Hollywood-style ``Walk of Fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City councilors have approved plans to set up a Bruce Lee  
Memorial Gallery as part of the Hong Kong Film Archive, a publicly 
funded library and museum for the city's world-renowned film 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-born Lee helped popularize Chinese martial  
arts in the West through a series of Kung Fu films before his 
sudden death in 1973 at the age of 33. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Hong Kong Tourist Association announced it would  
build a Walk of Fame to honor its stars, many of whom have gained 
international recognition in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, director John Woo, and Hollywood stars Jackie Chan, Chow  
Yun-fat and Sammo Hung are expected to be among those honored.

<HEADLINE> US West Plans Cheaper Web Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to capture a wider audience, U S West  
Corp. is offering more for less with a new dial-up version of a 
digital subscriber line, or DSL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baby Bell phone company which serves 14 Western states,  
announced Wednesday that its MegaBit Select is being introduced 
throughout its service area after a trial run in four cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The service costs $19.95 a month, $10 less than what U S West  
charges for a continuous Internet connection via DSL. 
</P>
<P>
	DSL allows people to access the Internet at speeds five times  
faster than the fastest dial-up modem installed on most desktop and 
laptop computers. Continuous DSL service typically costs $50 or 
more per month. 
</P>
<P>
	The dial-up service is targeted at residential customers who  
typically spend a few hours online at a time, although there is no 
limit on access time, said spokesman Garth Neuffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the economy of scale. We'd rather have everyone sign up  
for a low price than just a few sign up at a higher price,'' 
Neuffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	DSL users still need to pay a separate monthly fee, generally  
ranging from $10 to $22, to an Internet service provider such as 
America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	``MegaBit Select will dramatically accelerate the use of  
high-speed Internet services by mass market consumers,'' said Joe 
Zell, president of U S West's !nterprise Networking unit. 
``Recreational and weekend Internet surfers will enjoy dedicated, 
high-speed Internet access at a price that makes sense for their 
lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service is available immediately in more than 40 Western  
cities, including Denver, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Salt Lake City. 
It will be available in other parts of U S West's 14-state 
territory next month, the company said.

<HEADLINE> UAW Extends Automakers' Deadlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers and  
DaimlerChrysler AG kept talking today after an all-night session as 
the union granted an open-ended extension to automakers' contracts 
that cover 407,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no word on progress from the union or  
DaimlerChrysler, the continuing talks were a sign that a deal could 
be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between the union and General Motors Corp. recessed late  
Tuesday evening and were expected to resume this morning, GM 
spokesman Edd Snyder said today. Negotiations at Ford Motor Co. 
were much less intense. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokesman David Barnas said early today that the  
union had granted the company an indefinite extension of its 
three-year contract, and talks for a contract covering 75,000 
workers would continue. Similar extensions were given to GM and 
Ford on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While marathon talks are a traditional sign of progress, there  
also were signs of strain between the union and DaimlerChrysler. 
National negotiators, including UAW President Stephen P. Yokich, 
were meeting at DaimlerChrysler headquarters when workers at five 
plants in Missouri and Indiana staged a brief walkout Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at two DaimlerChrysler plants in Fenton, Mo., outside of  
St. Louis, walked off the job at 9:45 p.m. EDT and started 
picketing. The plants, which make the highly profitable Dodge Ram 
trucks and DaimlerChrysler's minivans, employ about 7,100. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 minutes later, workers at two transmission plants and a  
casting plant in Kokomo, Ind., walked off the job, DaimlerChrysler 
officials said. Production there resumed with the midnight shift 
and was normal today. Those plants employ a total of 8,400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The picket signs in Fenton went down about an hour after they  
went up and the third shift began reporting on time, said Jason 
Archer, financial secretary for UAW Local 110. Archer said all 
union workers should follow their normal routines today. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Bob Eaton said he expected workers  
at those plants would remain on the job as negotiations continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still hopeful we will be able to get a contract without  
significant work stoppage,'' Eaton said today at the Frankfurt 
International Motor Show in Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnas said the union has not told DaimlerChrysler the reason  
for the walkouts. Officials at locals in Missouri and Indiana could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages, job security, health care costs, overtime demands and the  
assignment of work to outside suppliers were expected to be among 
the top issues in this year's talks, as they were during the last 
round in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of  
record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more 
than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few indications of what proposals the UAW and  
DaimlerChrysler might be negotiating. The union has discussed 
efforts to organize DaimlerChrysler's nonunion plants in the United 
States: a Mercedes-Benz sport utility factory in Alabama with 1,600 
workers and Freightliner commercial truck plants in the Carolinas.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Charges Frankel with Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Rogue financier Martin Frankel and  
unidentified associates have been charged with stealing more than 
$18 million from a Tennessee insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Connecticut money manager already faces federal charges of  
embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars from insurance companies 
in six states and a Catholic charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel fled the United States in May. He was caught this month  
in Germany and is fighting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	A complaint was filed Friday in Williamson County General  
Sessions Court by James Prange, an investigator for Tennessee 
Attorney General Paul Summers. It claims Frankel and unidentified 
accomplices ``devised and executed a scheme to acquire and control 
over $18,160,000 from the Franklin American Life Insurance Co.,'' 
The Review Appeal of Franklin reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prange said Frankel and the others claimed they invested the  
money but ``diverted the monies into various accounts under his 
control and for his own use, and the use of others ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Court Judicial Commissioner Jeri Brady charged Frankel with  
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	No date was set for Frankel's preliminary hearing and District  
Attorney General Ronald L. Davis said today ``it's anybody's guess 
at this point'' as to whether he will actually be tried in 
Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just trying to get our dibs on him,'' Davis said.  
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed against the others mentioned in the  
complaint and Davis declined to say who they might be. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel's unlicensed brokerage siphoned at least  
$218 million from insurers in Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, 
Oklahoma and Missouri. A lawsuit filed by some of the companies 
puts the loss at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Franklin American executives in Tennessee have been sued by  
the state of Arkansas, which says they transferred $5.28 million of 
an Arkansas insurance company's assets to an account accessible by 
Frankel.

<HEADLINE> Greek Officials Assess Quake Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- With the search for survivors all but  
abandoned, Greek government officials met Wednesday with 
businessmen to assess earthquake damage to the capital's industrial 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	With the death toll at 137, rescue crews said they still  
believed six people were trapped in the rubble of a kitchen 
products factory. But government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said 
crews would soon stop the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Six others remained hospitalized in serious condition after the  
Sept. 7 magnitude 5.9 quake, which flattened parts of working class 
and immigrant districts north of central Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos announced he was canceling  
Greece's largest annual military exercise, to be held in October 
and involving nearly 50,000 troops, in order to channel the funds 
towards earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsochadzopoulos already announced he was scaling back a number  
of exercises so the money can be used to buy some of the 5,000 
prefabricated homes the military plans to erect within the next two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	His decisions point to warmer relations between Greece and  
traditional rival Turkey, which was rocked by a 7.3 magnitude quake 
on Aug. 17. The two countries have been engaged in a 
multibillion-dollar arms buildup. 
</P>
<P>
	After each country suffered quakes, though, they rushed to help  
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 6,500 damaged homes slated for demolition in the  
Athens area, as many as 100,000 people could need shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors began onsite examinations as part of a criminal  
investigation to determine if contractors bypassed strict 
anti-quake regulations to build some of the demolished buildings. 
The focus of their preliminary investigation was the five-story 
kitchen products factory where more than 20 died. 
</P>
<P>
	National Economy Minister Yannos Papantoniou met with the Greek  
Industrialists Union and other trade groups to reassure business 
leaders the economy will not be derailed by the quake. Greece aims 
to adopt the euro by the start of 2001, joining the 11 other 
countries that use the single European currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Papantoniou has estimated damage could surpass the equivalent of  
$650 million. He also warned the government would crack down on any 
attempts to profit from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third successive day, the Athens Stock Exchange extended  
its record-setting streak, rising 2.1 percent, or 127.36 points, to 
a record 6181.05. The construction industry once again led the 
market, buoyed by expectations of post-quake rebuilding.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Keeping Lower Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez on Wednesday  
ruled out increasing Venezuela's oil output to capitalize on higher 
prices, saying an earlier decision to cut production would be 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela, the world's third largest oil exporter and founding  
member of OPEC, had long been among the biggest quota busters. But 
since taking office in February, Chavez has reversed that policy 
and reduced output in order to help raise flagging prices. 
</P>
<P>
	That policy has been largely successful, with oil prices  
rebounding from a 12-year low last year. The price of a barrel of 
Venezuelan oil went from $7 last year to more than $20 now. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez said in a speech Wednesday that a March OPEC agreement to  
cut production by two million barrels a day would be respected at 
least until next March. Some have urged a production increase as a 
response to the higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks in oil production have contributed to an acute  
economic recession in Venezuela. The economy contracted by an 
astounding 10 percent in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not interested in increasing our production. We have  
said that we are going to maintain the cutback agreement that we 
now have with Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the OPEC countries,'' Chavez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil accounts for about three quarters of Venezuela's export  
earnings. So far, the rebound in oil prices has not translated into 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Hector Ciavaldini, the newly appointed president of the state  
oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela, said last week that the 
company would begin spending more money to stimulate the depressed 
oil sector.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Outlook / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Forecasts for dry weather and favorable crop  
conditions sent grain and soybean futures lower in early trading 
today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficial harvest weather was forecast through the week in the  
eastern Midwest -- the heart of the soybean belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans had already closed Tuesday at their lowest level in  
nearly two weeks, pressured by talk of better-than-expected yields 
along with slowing U.S. export demand because of increasing prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures followed the trend in soybeans, with investors  
also wary because of a report of improved planting prospects for 
hard red winter wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn slipped further amid continued good prospects for the fall  
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 4 1/2 cents to $2.83 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.13 1/2 cents a bushel; December oats 
fell 1 cent to $1.13 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 5 3/4 cents to 
$4.96 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell .25 cent to 67.62 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .35 cent to 80.02 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose .25 cent to 43.35 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies rose .18 cent to 54.25 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq, Amex Web Sites Vandalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hackers vandalized the Internet sites  
Wednesday for Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange, but there was 
no evidence they manipulated financial data during the electronic 
affront to the world's markets. 
</P>
<P>
	A group calling itself ``United Loan Gunmen'' infiltrated the  
computer running the Web sites for Nasdaq and Amex just after 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The hackers left a taunting message -- the high-tech equivalent  
of spray-painting graffiti -- and also claimed to have briefly 
created for itself an e-mail account on Nasdaq's computer system, 
suggesting a broader breach in security. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty serious allegation,'' said Christopher  
Rouland, director of a team of computer security engineers, called 
X-force, for Atlanta-based Internet Security Systems Inc. ``It's 
difficult to say if it's accurate, but once you breach the 
perimeter, it certainly is easier to get into the infrastructure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq Spokesman Scott Peterson said later Wednesday it was the  
exchange's policy not to discuss security issues but added, ``the 
Nasdaq Web site is operational and secure. We will continue to 
monitor our sites to maintain their integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've been talking about concerns our Internet sites and  
has nothing to do with our trading network,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq recently acquired the American Stock Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
	The hacker group left a message saying it intended to ``make  
stocks rise drastically, thus making all investors happy, hopefully 
ending with the investors putting bumper stickers on their 
Mercedez' that say 'Thanks ULG!''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Meanwhile, ULG members go back to flipping burgers at  
McDonalds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, which oversees the nation's stock exchanges, declined 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rouland said the attacks on Nasdaq and Amex were likely to cause  
anxiety among computer professionals on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly will in the financial communities,'' he said.  
``People will notice, and it will cause a buzz. This is going to 
cause more people to pay attention to security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq's Web site runs software from Microsoft Corp., called  
Internet Information Server, that has suffered several serious 
security problems during the past year. Microsoft has distributed 
patches in each case but relies on local computer administrators to 
install them correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	``System administrators can forget to install patches,'' Rouland  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another expert, Russ Cooper, said it's a mistake to assume that  
the Internet's most popular sites are secure from hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice if we could assume that a high-profile site  
would have better security people on staff,'' said Cooper, who runs 
the NTBugtraq discussion group on the Internet for security flaws. 
``Unfortunately, my experience is that's a hope, not a reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hacker group also had claimed responsibility earlier this  
week for the defacement of the Internet site for Matt Drudge, the 
Internet gossip columnist, and electronic attacks against C-Span 
last week and against ABC just weeks ago. All those organizations 
also used Microsoft's Internet Information Server to run their Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq trading volume averages about 800 million shares a day.  
</P>
<P>
	As global financial markets have expanded at a dizzying pace,  
Nasdaq has adopted an aggressive international strategy. Earlier 
this year, Nasdaq took over the Amex and announced plans to 
establish an electronic trading exchange in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq also has set up a joint Web site with Hong Kong's stock  
exchange that will allow U.S. investors to trade in Hong Kong 
securities, has signed a similar deal with the Australian Stock 
Exchange, and is looking into new alliances in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The global expansion by the world's second-largest stock market  
has sharpened its competition with the largest, the New York Stock 
Exchange, which uses a traditional trading floor.

<HEADLINE> Sorenstam To Defend Safeco Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENT, Wash. (AP) -- Annika Sorenstam is back to defend her Safeco  
Classic title this week on the 6,241-yard Meridian Valley Country 
Club course. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's LPGA rookie of the year, Se Ri Pak, will join her at  
the $650,000 event, as will Lorie Kane, No. 4 on this year's money 
list. Pak is No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other top players are skipping the event, which begins  
Thursday, so the big three might turn it into their own private 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam, the 1998 Player of the Year, is fifth on this year's  
money list and will be looking for her second victory of the year. 
She won the Michelob Light Classic in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time Safeco winners Karrie Webb and Juli Inkster, also the  
top two money winners this year, chose to skip Safeco, as did other 
notables: Rosie Jones, Laura Davies, Kelli Kuehne, Sherri 
Steinhauer and Liselotte Neumann. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading rookie on the tour, Mi Hyun Kim, pulled out Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Hall-of-Famer Patty Sheehan, a three-time winner and crowd  
favorite, is also skipping the event as she is taking time off 
following the death of her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, Inkster and Sheehan have seven wins in the 17 years of  
Safeco. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeco has traditionally followed the Safeway Golf Championship  
in Portland, Ore., and often causes scheduling problems for the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the LPGA schedule makers have the tournament  
following the Samsung World Championship of Women's Golf in 
Minnesota. Many players who took part in that tournament, which 
featured the world's top 20 female golfers, pulled out of this 
year's Safeco event. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Samsung event really hurt us,'' Safeco tournament director  
Rosanna Bellotti said. ``A lot of players play hard before a 
championship, peak, then need a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two local golfers joined this year's field with sponsor  
exemptions. Jimin Kang, who played golf with Pak as a youngster in 
South Korea, is a senior at Seattle's King's High School. Kang 
finished second at the recent U.S. Women's Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Kang is Oregon's Paula Patterson, who grew up in  
Washington. Patterson won the USGA's U.S. Open Sectional Qualifier 
this year.

<HEADLINE> Stanford President Stepping Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- The president of Stanford University has  
announced he will step down next year as head of the prestigious 
university, but he said he won't go too far. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerhard Casper, a 61-year-old constitutional law scholar, said  
Tuesday that he will resign next summer, take a sabbatical and then 
return to teach at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always carry the Constitution with me, as is well known. And  
the 22nd Amendment says eight years is the maximum for the 
president of the United States. If eight years is good enough for 
the president of the United States, it's good enough for me,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casper has recently faced criticism over the financially  
troubled merger of Stanford's teaching hospital with the University 
of California at San Francisco's hospitals. Together, they lost $60 
million in the second year after the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	While president of Stanford, a job that paid him $375,622 last  
year, Casper has focused on improving undergraduate curriculum, 
launching a new program for freshmen and sophomores that encourage 
mentoring relationships between students and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
	Provost John Hennessy said Casper has shown that a university  
president can provide dedicated leadership while maintaining 
intellectual vitality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I particularly admire his active engagement with the academic  
programs of the university as well as his significant interaction 
with individual faculty and students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casper said he had no regrets for his time at the top.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let me invoke my favorite adjective in student's use these  
days for anything they like: awesome. This is an awesome university 
and I have had no disappointment.''

<HEADLINE> New Conference Has Two Top 25 Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- Mountain West commissioner Craig Thompson is  
ecstatic, and with a pair of nationally ranked teams from his new 
conference playing, who could blame him. 
</P>
<P>
	The new league, formed when eight Western Athletic Conference  
members bolted to renew old rivalries, opens Thursday night as No. 
23 Colorado State (2-0) visits No. 25 Brigham Young (1-0). 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had opportunities to set the stage over the last nine  
months, but until teams win some games and make it significant ... 
things don't fall into place,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's doubly thrilling to have a game of this magnitude  
in what is only our third week of existence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Brigham Young coach LaVell Edwards, who hasn't held back  
on pregame hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players the other day there's no question this will  
be one of biggest games of the year for us,'' Edwards said. ``We 
will have no problem with our players understanding Colorado State 
is a very good football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eight Mountain West schools -- Air Force, BYU, Colorado  
State, New Mexico, UNLV, San Diego State, Utah and Wyoming -- 
announced plans to leave the WAC in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The move stemmed from convoluted scheduling when the WAC grew to  
16 teams, diminishing traditional rivalries. Many MWC schools were 
charter members of the WAC and its predecessor, the Skyline 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first event, the Mountain West is restoring the old order  
with a meeting of league heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled, but we didn't plan it that way,'' Thompson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	BYU and Colorado State haven't played since 1995 because of the  
divisional system in the 16-member WAC. But before that, the winner 
of the last three games in the BYU-CSU series won the league title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a heck of a ballgame,'' Edwards said. ``I  
love to see Colorado State coming to town, playing well and playing 
hard like they always do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rams coach Sonny Lubick expressed concern about traveling for a  
Thursday game. Colorado State had a short week to prepare after 
Saturday's 38-33 victory over Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's running back Kevin McDougal, who had 190 yards and  
two touchdowns in Colorado State's 41-14 win over Colorado. After 
gaining 147 yards against Nevada, he strained a leg muscle in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a tough decision on his part and the doctor's  
part,'' Lubick said. ``We've got to make sure he's healthy so we 
don't lose him for a longer time. We're not going to know until 
game time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could leave the rushing to freshman Rahsaan Sanders. On  
defense, linebacker Ula Tuitele is out with torn knee cartilage. In 
his place the Rams will shuttle freshmen David Vickers and Josh 
Steward. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll face BYU senior quarterback Kevin Feterik and a passing  
attack that racked up 501 yards in the Cougars' 35-28 
come-from-behind victory over Washington last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Feterik threw for three touchdowns, including the game-winner on  
a 38-yard pass to freshman Chris Hale with 1:16 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticized earlier in his career for making poor decisions,  
Feterik directed a seven-play, 89-yard drive to atone for an 
interception that had led to Washington's go-ahead TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks like he has really matured,'' Lubick said. ``I always  
thought he was a really good quarterback, but he looks like he's a 
real special quarterback right now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ralph Lauren wore his patriotism on his sleeve  
as he unfurled his new collection cast in red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Looks culled from Americana have splashed color on the spring  
2000 runways throughout the first half of the New York Fashion Week 
designer previews. The vivid colors of Old Glory blanketed Tommy 
Hilfiger's rock 'n roll-inspired collection, and Michael Kors 
dedicated his line to all-American preppy chic. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren's show Wednesday saluted ``true American sportswear,'' he  
said, with enough red, white and blue gingham tablecloth patterns 
to supply the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren also gave a nod to the emerging trends of the season,  
including midriff-baring tops, pants cropped above the ankle, 
perforated leather and skirts that drop just below the knee with a 
double-ruffled hem. 
</P>
<P>
	Kors on Wednesday revised ``The Official Preppy Handbook'' with  
a sexy spin on shrunken tennis sweaters and golf pro-shop colors. 
He updated the Ivy League rugby shirt into a body-skimming 
minidress, paired tongue-in-cheek with stiletto sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sexy nouvelle prep -- the woman of the country club who  
all the other women hate and all the men love,'' said Kors, who 
parodied the poolside set with floral caftans and turban towels. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilfiger went for flash-and-dazzle showmanship Tuesday night  
with a fashion extravaganza at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection ``combines a rock 'n roll edge with an American  
sensibility,'' said Hilfiger, whose show included a live 
performance by the rock group Bush and giant video monitors 
capturing the outlandish outfits, including crystal-fringed 
bellbottoms, snakeskin biker vests and cowboy boots emblazoned with 
``Tommy Rocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With equal parts Hollywood and Nashville, the collection  
featured over-the-top leathers appliqued with a flame print, 
microminis with crystal shimmy fringe, and leather jeans 
embroidered with star pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Rowley fit her show into an oldtime, mirrored ballroom  
and breathed new life into vintage handkerchiefs found at an 
upstate New York thrift shop. They showed up Tuesday evening in the 
guise of halter tops held together with delicate string, as well as 
patchwork dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowley, known for her whimsical designs, also lighted up the  
night with lacy, metallic dresses with tiny lights twinkling in the 
dark, the season's best case for battery-operated fashions.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Schools Unify Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The two public university systems in  
the nation's most populous state have agreed to require the same 
high school course work for admission. 
</P>
<P>
	The two systems have different mandates. The more prestigious  
University of California schools consider only the top one-eighth 
of the state's high school seniors, while California State 
University, dubbed the ``people's university,'' takes the top 
one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	The systems also have had slightly different class requirements  
for admission. That often has forced students to choose which 
standards to satisfy or has made them take extra courses to meet 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new requirements, incoming CSU freshmen will be  
required to have an extra year of high school laboratory science 
and another of social science; UC will require a year of art, dance 
or music classes. 
</P>
<P>
	CSU's governing board unanimously approved the new plan on  
Wednesday. The University of California regents approved the 
guidelines in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The new requirements will begin with this year's crop of high  
school freshmen. The standards apply to all students who apply, 
whether they are from California or outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The requirements include four years of English; three years of  
math; two years of social science; two years of lab science, two 
years of foreign language; one year of visual or performing arts 
and one year of electives.

<HEADLINE> Canucks Re-Sign Scatchard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks  
re-signed free-agent center Dave Scatchard on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Scatchard's contract weren't disclosed, but the signing  
comes five days after the Canucks issued the two-year veteran a 
take-it-or-leave-it final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Scatchard, 23, was primarily a third- and fourth-line center  
last season, finishing with 13 goals and a career-high 26 points, 
along with 140 penalty minutes in 82 games. 
</P>
<P>
	With Scatchard under contract, the Canucks have yet to sign  
blue-liners Ed Jovanovski and Adrian Aucoin, whose 23 goals were a 
club record for a defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant general manager Dave Nonis said he hasn't had any  
progress with the players this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll be able to close the gaps and get some deals  
done, but right now I can't tell you that we're close,'' said 
Nonis, adding that the sides are particularly far apart in 
negotiations with Aucoin.

<HEADLINE> New Flying Machine Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- It almost sounds too futuristic to be  
true, but NASA and a Silicon Valley engineer are developing a 
one-person air scooter that can buzz far over gridlocked streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exciting time for all of us involved in this  
monumental project,'' said Michael Moshier, an aerospace engineer 
and former Navy combat pilot who founded Millennium Jet Inc. ``We 
have all been dreaming of such a vehicle for many years, and now 
the dream is becoming a reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moshier has spent more than three years and close to $1 million  
on his personal flying machine, which can be seen on the company's 
Web site at www.solotrek.com. For now, it looks like something out 
of a ``Jetsons'' cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View,  
Calif., said there's nothing funny about the SoloTrek Exo-Skeletor 
Flying Vehicle. Plans call for it to go up to 80 mph, climb as high 
as 10,000 feet and get about 20 miles per gallon of regular 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are genuinely interested in the long-term possibilities for  
enabling personal vertical flight,'' said NASA's Aeromechanics 
branch chief Bill Warmbrodt. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an agreement that was to be formally announced  
Thursday, NASA will provide engineering, technology and testing, 
while Millennium Jet will build and eventually market the craft. 
</P>
<P>
	During initial tests, scheduled for later this year, the  
SoloTrek will only hover a few feet off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	To fly a SoloTrek, the pilot stands on two footrests, leans on a  
sliding backrest and grips handles that control the tilt and speed 
of Hula Hoop-sized air ducts blowing air at about 45 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8-foot-tall aircraft will transport an individual for up to  
90 minutes before needing to be refueled. 
</P>
<P>
	In another high-tech twist, a built-in retinal scanner in the  
pilot's helmet prevents the SoloTrek from turning on unless the 
pilot is identified as having been through a rigorous training 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials said they rarely sign up to work with outside  
inventors, despite hundreds of pitches. But they said they were 
impressed with Moshier's technology and its potential. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest commercial flying contraption to the SoloTrek is a  
rocket belt, which first showed up in the 1965 James Bond movie 
``Thunderball.'' The American Rocket Belt Corp. later developed one 
for sale, but that hydrogen peroxide-powered rocket belt could only 
propel its wearer aloft for about 30 seconds.

<HEADLINE> John Lennon Guitar Sold in Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The acoustic guitar John Lennon was playing the  
day he met Paul McCartney has been sold at auction for $224,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair met on July 6, 1957, when Lennon was a member of the  
pre-Beatles group called the Quarrymen. The encounter resulted in 
the 15-year-old McCartney being asked to join the group, which 
eventually evolved into the Fab Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gallotone Champion, which Sotheby's billed as the earliest  
Beatles-related guitar to come on the market, was bought by a 
telephone bidder during an auction held Tuesday at London's Hard 
Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer, a New York investment fund manager who did not want  
to be identified, released a statement through Sotheby's saying he 
considered Lennon ``one of the most important, if not the most 
important, musician of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lennon bought the black-and-red guitar by mail order before  
playing at a picnic at St. Peter's Church in Woolton near 
Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney approached Lennon later that evening and impressed  
Lennon by teaching him the chords and words to Eddie Cochran's 
``Twenty Flight Rock.''

<HEADLINE> Floyd Prompts Huge Exodus From Ga. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- Most here who could escape Hurricane Floyd  
on their own didn't dawdle. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there were the other, poorer residents of Chatham County on  
the mostly black east side of town. Many had either nowhere to go, 
or little money to get there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid, too, but I think the reason a lot of people leave  
is they got the money to leave,'' Lillie Mobley said Tuesday 
evening as she sat on her porch, mending a frayed skirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said about 60 percent of county residents cleared out  
on Tuesday as Floyd trolled slowly toward land. But officials were 
overwhelmed by the larger-than-expected crowd that needed help. 
</P>
<P>
	A wait ensued while officials gathered 30 orange school buses  
for the neighborhood exodus. Women lounged in bathrobes and house 
dresses while children played in the streets long since deserted by 
those who found other ways out of town. Others who were disabled 
waited in wheelchairs for as much as eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we would have stayed in the trailer,'' said Tammy  
Hensley on Tuesday evening as she waited with her husband and four 
sons. She'd been there since 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been training for this for years, and they do not know  
what they're doing down here,'' she said. ``I mean, this is just 
bad evacuation plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the neighborhood didn't try to leave. Donald Culver, 33,  
said his family never considered fleeing Floyd, evacuation order or 
no, because of the expense and hassle. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's time for me to go, it's time,'' Culver said. ``It's  
all just prediction, anyway. If it happens, it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of blocks away, Sheila Anderson said she lived through  
Hurricane Andrew seven years ago in Florida. She said she'd rather 
deal with Floyd from her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm going to die, I'm going to die at home,'' she said,  
``not scattered out in the street somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Johnson, who was staying with Ms. Anderson to ride out  
the storm, said she couldn't leave due to her job as a Wal-Mart 
clerk. She expects the store to be reopened by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	When Floyd arrives, ``I'll just stay in my house and kneel down  
and pray,'' Ms. Mobley said. ``Fall on your knees and talk to God, 
that's all you can do.''

<HEADLINE> Don King's $1M Challenge KO'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Don King hurled a $1 million challenge to rival  
promoter Bob Arum on Wednesday and got a scolding in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Bob Arum will accept, I will bet $1 million that Tito will  
win this fight,'' bellowed King, the promoter of IBF welterweight 
champion Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad, who on Saturday night will fight 
WBC champion Oscar De La Hoya, promoted by Arum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don King has challenged me, and I have to say something from  
the bottom of my heart,'' Arum retorted. ``It's totally 
inappropriate for promoters or managers to bet on a boxing match. 
In 35 years in boxing, I've never bet on a fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Arum taunted, ``Don, don't you understand that putting  
Felix Trinidad in the ring with Oscar De La Hoya is risking more 
than $1 million?'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those who do bet on fights, De La Hoya was a 6-5 favorite to  
win the most anticipated welterweight championship match since WBC 
champion Sugar Ray Leonard stopped WBA champion Thomas Hearns in 
the 14th round Sept. 16, 1981, at Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know like all my fights it will be a very tough one, but I  
fight to the end,'' said the 26-year-old De La Hoya (31-0, 25 
knockouts). ``May the best man win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, however, made it clear that he doesn't think  
Trinidad is the better man. He doesn't even think the 26-year-old 
Puerto Rican (35-0, 30 knockouts) is as good as Ike Quartey, who De 
La Hoya beat on a split decision Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad predicts he will win by a knockout, but won't predict a  
round. His father-trainer, Felix Sr., says it will be the sixth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters have exchanged barbs, but De La Hoya said there is  
no animosity on my part. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking it's just another fight,'' he said. ``That's how  
focused I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, who doesn't speak English, admits to being angered  
when De Hoya said some time ago that, ``I'm not worth $10 million. 
That's an insult. How can he say I'm not worth $10 million? I'm 
worth that and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of De La Hoya, a Mexican-American who grew up in  
East Los Angeles, is the reason Trinidad is getting $10 million, by 
far his biggest purse. De La Hoya, who has had $9 million paydays, 
is guaranteed $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Taffet of TVKO said the match, priced at $49.95 on  
pay-per-view, ``will be the greatest grossing non-heavyweight fight 
of all time and one of the top five pay-per-view events of all 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current record for a non-heavyweight fight was De La Hoya's  
decision victory over Pernell Whitaker on April 12, 1997, which had 
800,000 buys and grossed $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be De La Hoya's eighth pay-per-view. The seven previous  
totaled 3.6 million boys and $150 million, according to Taffet. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecast will begin at 9 p.m. EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	The 12,000-seat arena is sold out. All tickets were bought by  
casinos and there was no public sale.

<HEADLINE> Alaskan Dividend Survives Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Balancing the state budget is less  
attractive to Alaskans than keeping the annual dividend each man, 
woman and child receives from the state's oil-royalty savings 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters on Tuesday rejected a plan to divide the earnings of the  
$26 billion Alaska Permanent Fund between state spending and the 
fund's wildly popular annual dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	With all precincts reporting, 83 percent of voters rejected the  
plan, confirming a long-held belief in Alaska politics: Politicians 
who try to touch the dividend are courting disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Alaska Legislature got a clear message to go back to the  
drawing board,'' said Eddie Burke, chairman of Save Your 
Dividend-Vote No. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote means Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles and the  
Republican-controlled Legislature -- who put the plan on the ballot 
-- must try again to find a new way to fill the gap between state 
spending and normal revenue. The state gets most of its operating 
money from taxes and royalties on oil production, while Alaskans 
pay no state income tax and no state sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	A decline in oil revenues has forced sharp cuts in the state  
budget, but the fund -- and the dividend -- have grown in the booming 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan before voters would cut the dividend to about $1,340 in  
2001. Last year's payout was $1,540 and this year's is expected to 
exceed $1,700. About $800 million a year would be dedicated to 
bridging the gap between the state's spending and its revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the plan contended it was necessary to avoid  
drastic budget cuts or the loss of Alaska's status as the only 
state without an income tax or a sales tax. The supporters drew 
more than $500,000 in donations from businesses, particularly in 
oil and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people need to understand that in some way they're going  
to have to pay for state government in the future,'' said 
Republican state Rep. Eldon Mulder, one of the plan's architects.

	Opponents, including a loose coalition of conservatives and  
liberal environmentalists, said cutting the dividend would amount 
to a regressive tax that hits the poor while largely exempting rich 
people and corporations, including Alaska's powerful oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Some opponents want deep budget cuts, others want an income tax,  
and still others want to increase taxes on the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``This vote is telling the leaders in the Legislature, the  
Republican leaders especially, to look for other sources of 
revenue,'' said Paula Phillips, a spokeswoman for Alaska 
Conservation Voters. ``The business sector, including oil and big 
tourism, are just going to have to contribute to the solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move to put the plan on the ballot began last winter, when  
oil prices dropped below $9 a barrel and the projected budget gap 
for the current fiscal year grew to more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, oil has climbed to more than $23 a barrel, shrinking  
the budget gap to a projected $632 million.

<HEADLINE> Senate Denounces Clemency Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York's Democratic senators joined nearly  
all their colleagues in the U.S. Senate in condemning President 
Clinton's offer of clemency to Puerto Rican militants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 95-2 Tuesday to denounce the deal, which  
allowed 11 Puerto Rican prisoners to leave federal prisons last 
week after nearly two decades. The House of Representatives 
approved a similar nonbinding resolution last week 311-41. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer, both  
Democrats, voted for the Senate resolution opposing the clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have to disappoint friends it's a tough vote,'' said  
Schumer, who said he discussed his vote with the state's Latino 
leaders in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said the burden of proof is on the administration to  
prove why clemency should be granted,'' Schumer said. ``I have 
repeatedly requested information on these cases. I have been given 
no such information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan declined to discuss his vote.  
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., accused the  
administration of stonewalling his hearing on the clemency grant by 
yanking scheduled FBI testimony at the last minute and failing to 
provide requested documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell said an FBI agent was scheduled to testify at the  
Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism hearing he scheduled 
for Tuesday, but the FBI backed out Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's pretty clear that the White House is behind  
this,'' Coverdell said. ``I think their silence is almost as 
damaging as the decision itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said agent Neal Gallagher had  
submitted his prepared testimony to the Justice Department for 
approval, as is common practice. The Justice Department then pulled 
the plug, Bresson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Chris Watney responded by  
pointing to a letter to Coverdell, which explained that because the 
power to grant clemency is the president's exclusively, there are 
constitutional questions about whether it would be appropriate for 
FBI officials to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House counsel's office,  
denied the White House had ordered the FBI not to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell and others in Congress are requesting records the  
White House used in making the decision to grant clemency, 
including documents that allegedly show the Justice Department and 
other law enforcement agencies opposed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those offered clemency were members of the FALN -- the  
Spanish initials for Armed Forces of National Liberation -- 
responsible for some 130 bombings in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
that left six dead and scores wounded. None of the 16 offered 
clemency was convicted of killing or wounding anyone, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen Puerto Rican prisoners accepted President Clinton's  
clemency offer, which required them to renounce violence and meet 
other parole conditions. Eleven were freed from federal prison 
Friday. One prisoner must serve five more years before he is 
released and two others, who were already out of prison, had their 
remaining fines eliminated. Two rejected the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and police officers have accused Clinton of  
extending the offer last month to boost his wife's 
all-but-announced Senate candidacy from New York, home to some 1.3 
million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton first came out against the clemency offer, angering  
many of New York's Puerto Rican leaders. Then last week she 
explained that she should have consulted further with Latino 
leaders before reaching a decision.

<HEADLINE> Retired News Agency Head Dies at 82 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Elvezio Bianchi, who reported on postwar Italy for  
United Press for two decades and later headed Agenzia Italia, one 
of the country's leading news agencies, died Tuesday night. He was 
82. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by his family did not give the cause of death.  
</P>
<P>
	Bianchi joined United Press before World War II as a copy boy.  
After the war, he became news editor. In 1966, he was appointed 
director of AGI, originally founded by Italy's state-owned oil 
company ENI. 
</P>
<P>
	AGI expanded into business and financial news and distributed  
major international news agencies, including The Associated Press 
and AP-DowJones, to the country's media. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1981. He is survived by his widow, Luciana, a  
daughter, Nicoletta and a son, Massimo. Funeral arrangements were 
scheduled in Rome at San Lorenzo Outside the Walls on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Arista's Clive Davis Still Has Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Clive Davis has a knack.  
</P>
<P>
	He can smell talent a mile away and when he does, watch out  
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the 65-year-old president and founder of Arista Records,  
has helped launch the careers of Whitney Houston, Sarah McLachlan, 
Bruce Springsteen and scores of others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I signed Patti Smith, the great Renaissance woman ... I signed  
Lou Reed ... I signed the Grateful Dead,'' says Davis, casually 
recalling some of his major coups while sitting at his desk in his 
midtown Manhattan office. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that he's trying to brag. It's simply his  
matter-of-fact way of explaining his ability to seize onto what he 
calls the ``all-timers'' -- artists like Billy Joel and Janis 
Joplin, who he also signed, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wait to be turned on,'' Davis says. ``If I'm not turned on  
in seven months, I'll sign nobody. I mean, I don't have a quota of 
who I sign. I've got to feel it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has been feeling it for more than three decades -- first,  
as a top executive and president at CBS Records, and then as the 
head of Arista Records, which he started after leaving CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The label celebrates its 25th anniversary later this year, and  
during fiscal year 1998-99, it had $425 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's their best year, and it's fairly unusual for a label that  
has such a small roster of artists ... to sell so many albums,'' 
said Adam Sandler, music editor for Variety magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The label's current top acts -- Houston, McLachlan, Monica --  
along with new stars like soul singer Deborah Cox and rhythm and 
blues quartet Next -- are largely responsible for those numbers. 
And, of course, Davis, who is involved in every aspect of a 
record's production, from studio to release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most label presidents are involved in their studio releases,  
but not to the extensive level that Clive is,'' Sandler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis remains not only a major player, but a trendsetter who  
signed trailblazers like Sean ``Puffy'' Combs and producers L.A. 
Reid and Babyface before they became superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also helped revitalize lagging careers. Aretha Franklin  
lately has flourished at Arista after a few years on a downward 
spiral, and Santana's latest release, ``Supernatural,'' has hit 
Billboard's top 10 and produced a hit with ``Smooth.'' The Artist 
Formerly Known as Prince may be looking for Davis to help tweak his 
sagging commercial appeal -- he just signed to Arista in August, his 
first deal with a record label since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the thing that makes Clive stand out is his love of  
talent and his love of music,'' says Reid, who together with 
Babyface signed a deal with Arista to develop LaFace Records 10 
years ago. The label is now home to such multiplatinum acts as TLC, 
Toni Braxton and Usher. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably the most thorough executive that we've ever met.  
He's involved in the process from beginning to end and I think 
that's what makes him special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has been a co-producer of many albums, including Houston's  
latest platinum effort, ``Your Love Is My Love.'' Davis, who signed 
the 36-year-old singer to Arista when she was just 19, helped 
arrange collaborations between Houston and Fugees' sensations 
Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill. He also worked with Houston to pick 
the songs on the album. The result is perhaps Houston's most 
critically acclaimed album of her career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been her executive producer and creative partner since  
day one. I screen all her material and she and I pick it. We're 
very much a creative partnership, Whitney and I,'' Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see an executive producer credit, on Monica, on Next,  
it's not because I'm the head of the company. I have come up with 
the material, shaped the material -- that's what I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the typical relationship one would expect between the  
head of a label and a budding artist -- at least not for Cox, whose 
torch song, ``Nobody's Supposed to Be Here,'' was one of last 
year's biggest hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he would be this very... (detached) CEO of a record  
company, but he was the complete opposite,'' Cox recalls of her 
first meeting with Davis a few years ago. ``When he comes across a 
hit, he'll call me, I'll listen to it and we'll discuss what we 
like about the song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a New York City native who lost both his parents at an  
early age, put himself through law school and started working at 
CBS Records as a lawyer in 1960. He rose to become president of the 
company in 1967 -- even though he had no musical background. That 
forced him to take a crash course in the record business -- from 
show music to rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first artist I ever signed was Janis Joplin. I felt my  
way,'' he recalls, recounting when he first saw the rock legend at 
the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. He also saw budding 
singer/songwriter Laura Nyro, and snapped her up as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned from that experience, and by coincidence, I came  
home, I went to a small club in the village, and ... I saw a group 
in formation that was quite innovative, brilliant ... that group 
turned out to be Blood, Sweat and Tears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he signed them, too. And then came Santana, Billy Joel,  
Aerosmith, Springsteen. With so much success, Davis was on top of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But he came crashing down in 1973, when the record label accused  
him of mismanagement of funds and he was fired. Although Davis says 
he was later cleared, it wasn't the end of his problems; he later 
was indicted on tax evasion charges, pleaded guilty to one count 
and had to pay a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations at CBS still cause pain for Davis; it is a  
subject he does not gladly talk about. But true to form, Davis 
rebounded from the scandal with a vengeance. A year after his 
departure from CBS, he started the Arista label, with backing from 
Columbia Pictures, and, he says, CBS records. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, it became a wonderful opportunity for me. It was a  
terribly unfair situation for me at the time, but within a year, 
CBS gave me $1 million to start my brand new record company, which 
turned out to be Arista Records, and it was couched in terms of 
mail-order rights,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a combination of getting payment of $1 million from  
them and the ultimate exoneration of any problems that were charged 
never really cure the pain of something that occurred that was 
unjust, but you learn in life to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And move on he did. Over the years, Davis used his eye for  
talent to build the company from a young upstart to one of the 
industry's formidable labels, and did so by staying true to his 
vision -- signing ``all-timers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge is to pick artists that are going to be long  
lasting artists and not just fads of the moment,'' he said, 
rattling off a list of Arista's roster. ``I mean, Alan Jackson is 
an all-timer. Brooks &AMP; Dunn are all-timers. I mean, on the LaFace 
front, with L.A. and Babyface. ... TLC started with Kris Kross. 
Who's around? It's TLC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Arista was also home to one of the most infamous fad  
groups of all-time -- Milli Vanilli. But Davis insists that the 
lip-synching duo is not part of his legacy. He says Milli Vanilli 
was signed by Arista's European division, and he was not involved. 
</P>
<P>
	One deal in which Davis was involved -- and perhaps one of his  
smartest investments -- was signing the 21-year-old Combs, then an 
up-and-coming producer who had made his name by making stars of 
artists like Mary J. Blige and Jodeci. Over several meetings, Combs 
played Davis his latest hits -- and Davis knew he was special. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Combs' Bad Boy label has produced success after success,  
from Combs' own multiplatinum album -- his second disc, ``Forever,'' 
has just been released -- to hot young acts like Faith Evans and 
112. The partnership between Combs and Davis has been sort of a 
mutual education for both, Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Puffy totally, it was the street. I didn't know the  
street until I met Puffy Combs. He didn't know mainstream, 
crossover music to pop,'' Davis said. ``Now, I feel comfortable 
enough, through the last five years, with Mase, with Biggie, with 
Puffy ... now I feel comfortable enough to have our own artists -- 
Brand Nubian, Naughty by Nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis spends much of his day listening to music, looking for new  
songs, new artists, new producers. His desk is littered with tapes 
and compact discs. But music is not the only thing that drives him 
or gives him satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he was honored by the charity AmFar for donating more  
than $300 million to AIDS charities over the past 15 years. But 
what the divorced Davis seems to cherish most is the relationship 
he has with his children -- all of whom went to law school and are 
in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have dinner every Sunday night,'' he says. ``I'm very close  
with my kids. We go away four times a year together. I believe in a 
close family life ... and not just being loving strangers.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers Jersey Gets Boy in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Ohio (AP) -- School officials apologized to a boy who  
was forced to sit in a corner for wearing a Pittsburgh Steelers 
jersey on his school's Cleveland Browns' spirit day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten-year-old Eric Nutter and his mother, Debbie, have long been  
Steelers fans. So when Western Reserve Middle School about 50 miles 
southwest of Cleveland marked the return of the Browns to the NFL 
on Friday, the fifth-grader didn't wear the Ohio team's brown and 
orange. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to the school wearing a Kordell Stewart jersey, honoring  
Pittsburgh's quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	While he expected some flack from his classmates, he was  
surprised when his teacher, Brent Maillard, had him turn his desk 
around in the back of the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to turn around the whole time to see what was going  
on,'' Eric told The (Lorain, Ohio) Morning Journal, in a story 
published Wednesday. ``I didn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After about two hours, Eric changed into a Cleveland Indians  
T-shirt for gym class. He kept the baseball team shirt on for the 
rest of the day, and was allowed to place his desk back in its 
usual position. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric's devotion was rewarded Sunday night, when the Steelers  
beat the Browns 43-0 in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Maillard and Thomas Turner, the school's principal, met with  
Eric's parents Monday and found they were angry after the boy came 
home from school in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until then, we didn't have any idea at all that he had been  
upset. On Friday, he kind of thought that it was funny. His desk 
was only moved back a couple of feet, and he only had to sit 
sideways. But it was all in fun. Apparently at some point his 
feelings were hurt,'' Turner said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric told WKYC-TV in Cleveland that he got a phone call from  
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked me how good I was doing in school and told me that if  
I have any more problems with his jersey that he'll come down and 
help me,'' Eric said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric's stepfather, Robert Counts, has asked Western Reserve  
superintendent Dennis Bahmer to discipline the teacher, who has 
been reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expressed our concerns to the family and apologized, and  
the teacher did the same,'' Bahmer said. ``It's one of those things 
that started out in fun, but for some reason was not taken that 
way.''

<HEADLINE> Mercury Found in Midwest Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Rain contaminated with mercury from coal-fired  
electric plants is fouling Midwest lakes and rivers, according to a 
report released by environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercury is showing up in Chicago rainfall at levels 42 times  
greater than federal standards have considered safe, according to 
Andrew Buchsbaum of the National Wildlife Federation. Mercury 
levels in rain are even higher in Detroit and Duluth, Minn., he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, New York state's attorney general was taking legal  
action today against 17 Midwestern coal-fired electric plants, 
saying their pollution has contaminated air in the Northeast for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The mercury contamination report was released Tuesday by groups  
including the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Sierra 
Club. The data were collected from government and university 
studies with the help of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
Buchsbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the largest contributor to the problem, the  
electric utility industry, continues to get a free ride on its 
mercury pollution,'' Peter Morman said of the Environmental Law and 
Policy Center. ``While other sources are reducing emissions, no 
such requirements exist for coal-fired power plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morman said mercury pollution by Midwestern utilities probably  
will increase because deregulation will prompt them to generate 
higher levels of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchsbaum said the plants should cut their mercury emissions,  
with an eye on eliminating them, by turning to cleaner energy 
sources such as natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Miller, Commonwealth Edison's air quality engineer, said  
Tuesday that the utility's seven coal-fired plants emitted 1,700 
pounds of mercury in 1998 -- an amount that has been steady for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said ComEd is cooperating with the EPA studies on mercury  
emissions. He said the utility has no plans to convert its coal 
plants to gas. 
</P>
<P>
	A naturally occurring metal, mercury accumulates in fish and  
becomes more concentrated as it moves up the food chain. In humans, 
the neurotoxin can slow fetal and child development and cause brain 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchsbaum said data collected by the University of Michigan Air  
Quality Laboratory found that rain falling on Chicago's South Side 
had mercury levels ranging from 5.4 parts per trillion to 74.5 
parts per trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA considers mercury levels in the Great Lakes to be safe  
for wildlife at 1.3 parts per trillion. For humans, it is 1.8 parts 
per trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry in the  
Department of Health and Human Services says that based on the 
latest studies, people can consume as much as 0.3 micrograms of 
mercury per kilogram of their body weight without health risks. Its 
previous standard -- and the standard still used by the EPA -- had 
been 0.1 microgram. 
</P>
<P>
	But the health impact of low levels of mercury contamination has  
been widely disputed. Congress last year barred further regulation 
of mercury until the National Academy of Sciences completes an 
18-month study of the health effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchsbaum said studies show rain scrubs the air of the mercury  
that belches from coal-fired power plants and incinerators and 
carries it into the Great Lakes and other Midwest lakes and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said he planned to  
file notice to sue 17 plants in five Midwestern states, accusing 
them of violating the 1990 federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer said the plants in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and  
West Virginia failed to upgrade equipment that cleans smokestack 
emissions when they made other big investments in the plants, a 
requirement under the act. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary findings of a six-month EPA study suggested a  
pattern of such violations by operators of many of the country's 
biggest and dirtiest coal-burning plants, Clinton administration 
officials said in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased acid rain problems in the Northeast over the last  
20 years have been linked to sulfates and nitrates, which are 
products of coal-fired power plants. Recent studies by the EPA and 
the Department of Energy indicate that 85 to 90 percent of the 
sulfates over the mid-Atlantic and New England states originate in 
Midwestern power plant emissions.

<HEADLINE> FBI, Cos. Strike Software Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI reached a first-of-its-kind agreement  
enabling telecommunications companies to use computer software made 
by Nortel Networks to assist law enforcement agencies in conducting 
lawfully authorized wiretapping. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement calls for Nortel, a major supplier of  
telecommunications equipment, to provide certain software to its 
carrier customers. Nortel will waive the license fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act  
authorized $500 million for the purpose of reimbursing the 
telecommunications industry for its costs in cooperating with law 
enforcement agencies in wiretapping. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carriers can now begin taking steps to correct technological  
impediments within their networks that currently prevent law 
enforcement from being able to carry out court-ordered electronic 
surveillance directed at suspected criminals and terrorists,'' 
Attorney General Janet Reno said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecommunication carrier Ameritech also is a party to the  
agreement. FBI Director Louis Freeh said the bureau is working 
toward finalizing similar reimbursement agreements with other 
carriers and manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Unions Against Pakistan Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The AFL-CIO is joining an international  
campaign to pressure U.S. companies that sell or buy surgical tools 
to make sure the instruments are not made by child laborers in 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of children in Pakistan, some as young as eight  
years old, have never been to school. Instead, these kids are 
making surgical instruments commonly used in hospitals, doctor's 
offices, and medical centers every day, all across America,'' 
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions within the labor federation representing nurses and other  
health care workers have pledged to bring the issue to the 
bargaining table, if necessary, or use their clout as large 
investors of union pension money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pakistani government has estimated that at least 7,000  
children under the age of 14 work in the country's surgical 
manufacturing industry, doing dangerous jobs such as metal cutting, 
grinding and sandblasting. Many of the children labor in small 
workshops that contract with larger Pakistani vendors that export 
the tools. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of Pakistan's $125 million in annual exports of  
surgical instruments -- such as scalpels and scissors -- go to the 
United States, according to Public Services International, a 
France-based alliance of government workers' unions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The eyes of the world really are on the U.S. in this matter,''  
said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, an activist against child labor. 
</P>
<P>
	PSI has written to nine U.S. companies that it believes may buy  
surgical tools from Pakistani vendors, in turn selling to American 
health plans, hospitals and doctors' and dentists' offices. 
</P>
<P>
	In responses received so far, including from Johnson &AMP; Johnson  
and Baxter International Inc., the companies have denied 
connections to vendors using child labor in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Molino, a Johnson &AMP; Johnson vice president, wrote  
Tuesday that the company has strict rules against doing business 
with such vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't accepted those assurances on face value and have  
undertaken additional evaluations of the situation in Pakistan,'' 
wrote Molino, but she added, ``We remain very interested in any 
information you can share with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unions said they will urge U.S. companies to submit to  
independent investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is using child labor, if you believe them,'' said PSI  
General Secretary Hans Engelberts. ``We want a monitoring system so 
that we can check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations' International Labor Organization launched a  
program this week to monitor surgical tool production sites in 
Pakistan and send child laborers there to school. 
</P>
<P>
	The union campaign will also target U.S. health plans and  
hospital companies that buy large quantities of surgical equipment, 
asking them to hold their suppliers accountable.

<HEADLINE> Schools Providing Mental Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Mark Weist only gets to visit Southwestern  
High School in central Baltimore one day a week. But even that one 
day has given the therapist a chance to save lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had young people who are suicidal or seriously depressed  
referred to me in a state of crisis,'' said Weist. ``But I was able 
to make a connection with them, involve the family, provide more 
intensive care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the value of bringing mental health care into the schools  
where children can get it, said Weist, who also directs the Center 
for School Mental Health Assistance at the University of Maryland 
at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The typical school health center deals with scissors accidents,  
routine eye exams and measles shots. But, as recent high-profile 
school shootings highlighted the need to heal children's minds as 
well, many of the nation's 1,200 school health centers are 
including mental health in their mission. Today, school-based 
mental health advocates will begin their fourth annual conference 
in Denver, expecting 500 attendees up from just about 200 at the 
first conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids who are being abused, contending with neglect, dealing  
with violence, depressed or are acting out cannot learn,'' said 
Weist, who expects a cadre of child psychologists, school health 
professionals, teachers, health educators, youth advocates, family 
members and legislators to come up with ways of improving 
school-based mental health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Weist's Baltimore-based center is one of two national training  
facilities and five state pilot projects for mental health in 
schools established in 1995 by the Health and Human Services 
Department. Advocates estimate 10 million children nationwide ages 
10 to 17 lack proper mental health care. 
</P>
<P>
	In an annual policy speech Wednesday, Education Secretary  
Richard Riley called on Congress to increase funding for mental 
health counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we need to have many more counselors and mentors in  
our high schools and not just to help young people get ready for 
college,'' Riley said in the speech that focused on an emerging 
high school population boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Children were in need of help long before April's shooting at a  
Littleton, Colo., high school, said Weist. But the tragedy and 
others like it opened many discussions on the subject of child 
mental health. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had lots of kids not coming to school after that,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy-makers, too, have reacted by providing more funds. This  
spring, the federal government launched a $1.3 million study of the 
link between abuse and neglected children and later criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers are also trained at the Center for Mental Health in  
Schools at the University of California, Los Angeles. Kentucky, 
Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico and South Carolina have statewide 
projects providing school-based mental health. 
</P>
<P>
	But more money is need, particularly for staff, educators argue.  
Nationally, on average, there's one teacher for every 17 students, 
but a single counselor for every 513 students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many students bring problems to school that principals and  
teachers are simply not equipped to handle,'' argues Gerald N. 
Tirozzi, executive director of the National Association of 
Secondary School Principals. ``They need the help of qualified 
professionals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weist says school mental health advocates must also battle  
problems of public perception: ``If these programs are not in 
schools, then reality is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers try to assure parents and children that students are not  
being manipulated or unfairly diagnosed because of language or 
cultural differences. Instead, students who may have had to travel 
across town and wait endlessly for appointments in a crowded 
community clinic, can take time out at school to confidentially 
discuss problems ranging from drug addiction to sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long run, children can focus on their lessons, Weist  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Baltimore school, positive peer pressure has brought many  
more students to Weist's door. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer we're in school; the less stigmatizing the program  
is,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Ankiel Moving to Bullpen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- It's certainly not a demotion, but St. Louis  
Cardinals phenom Rick Ankiel will be moving to the bullpen for the 
rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals simply don't want to overwork Ankiel and strain  
the arm of what could be the team's ace for years to come. So 
manager Tony La Russa said Wednesday that Ankiel's days as a 
starter are over until 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old left-hander allowed one run in five innings, and  
did not get the decision, in the Cardinals' 4-1 loss to Milwaukee 
on Tuesday. That gave him 28 innings in five starts, but 165 2-3 
innings overall during a season-long rise from Double-A. And he's 
thrown a lot of pitches, considering his 224 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we'll do is give him his complete rest so by Sunday,  
which would be his fifth day, we'd have him available in the 
bullpen,'' La Russa said. ``And maybe he'll be in a situation late 
in the game to pitch an inning here or there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ankiel, 0-1 with a 3.86 ERA with the Cardinals, is nearing the  
innings target set for him. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Ankiel was effective with an extra day's rest  
Tuesday. La Russa was cautious with him that game, pulling him from 
a 1-1 game after five innings and 86 pitches. In his previous 
start, Ankiel struggled in the sixth and walked four -- one with the 
bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Ankiel is feeling the strain of the innings, he's not  
letting on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel normal, I guess, for playing a season,'' Ankiel said.  
``I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ankiel, who's far from the most expansive interview subject,  
didn't seem too disappointed that he got his first career hit 
before his first victory. He has four no-decisions, and the 
Cardinals have lost all five of his starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get out there and get a chance to compete at this level  
and kind of see how hitters react,'' he said. ``I think I'm 
learning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, he doesn't seem in awe of his surroundings even  
though he was pitching in high school a little more than two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't think about what it would be like,'' Ankiel  
said. ``I try and focus on throwing to the mitt, and not worrying 
about where I'm at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To some opponents, he looks like a seasoned veteran.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ankiel has a lot of poise and know-how for 20 years old,''  
Brewers pitcher Scott Karl said. ``He's got super stuff, so fluid 
on the mound. He looks so nice and easy and throws it 93 or 94 
mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To others, he's definitely a work in progress.  
</P>
<P>
	``When things go a little awry and he walks a guy or gives up a  
hit, he's not in a comfort zone,'' said Jeff Cirillo, who doubled 
and scored in the fourth. ``That's to be expected from a young guy 
pitching in the big leagues for the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa can't wait to see the finished product.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's real good, already,'' La Russa said. ``Imagine what he's  
going to be. He's a beautiful young man.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Cable News Stresses Content </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new generation of local cable newscasts is  
helping to change the image of local television news as shallow and 
crime-sodden. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the cable news operations that have sprung up quickly in  
the past few years are trying to compete with bigger broadcasters 
by emphasizing substance over sizzle, a study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the best news channels, like Las Vegas One and New York  
One, pack more information into their newscasts than broadcast 
network affiliates, said a report by Rocky Mountain Media Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The media watchdog group has criticized local broadcast  
newscasts throughout the 1990s for heavily emphasizing crime news 
and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sense that a lot of people in the industry feel that the  
traditional local newscast is vulnerable to change,'' Paul Klite, 
the group's executive director, said Tuesday. ``The old format has 
gotten tiresome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klite's group studied the newscasts of 21 cable stations on a  
fairly typical news day -- June 23, 1999. Overall, the programs had 
more news stories and fewer commercials than local newscasts did 
when measured in a separate, similar study. The cable newscasts had 
25 percent less news about violent crime, Klite said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable news operations generally have fewer soft features, less  
banter between anchors, and are also more willing to try different 
approaches, such as doing four short weather forecasts in an hour. 
Many cable newscasts feature one anchor instead of two, possibly 
because it's cheaper, Klite said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited Cable Pulse 24, a Toronto news station, as  
``without a doubt the most information-packed newscast in North 
America.'' Its screen is divided into seven separate information 
windows that deliver stock figures, sports scores, news headlines, 
the time, local weather, local traffic and a traditional newscast. 
</P>
<P>
	The newscast takes up 35 percent of the screen. Many stories ran  
for two minutes, unusually long in local news, and covered the 
environment, financial news, politics and health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sort of grew out of looking at an Internet screen,'' said  
Stephen Hurlbut, the station's vice president and general manager. 
``We seem to be evolving into a culture that can process multiple 
sources of information at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some viewers initially responded negatively when the  
format was introduced a year and a half ago, it is now popular and 
imitated, mostly in Canada, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all cable stations followed the trend, the report said.  
Miami station WAMI's twice-nightly newscast, while trying to 
present an alternative to crime-heavy local broadcasts, 
concentrated on ``fluff'' like celebrity gossip and relationship 
advice, Klite said. 
</P>
<P>
	WAMI news director M.J. Witt said her show is more like a  
newsmagazine than a newscast. It does not cover spot news, but 
frequently does investigative stories. She said it's wrong to 
characterize the show as heavy on ``fluff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're much closer to a newspaper in that we cover stories that  
the local news does not and we do it very well,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Candidate Profile: George W. Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Texas (AP) -- Restless as tumbleweed and rolling toward  
age 30 without a career, George W. Bush headed back to the spunky 
West Texas boomtown of his childhood. Maybe in Midland he could tap 
a gusher and finally sink some roots. 
</P>
<P>
	He brought his father's sterling name, degrees from Yale and  
Harvard, some $13,000 left in his trust fund, and his strongest 
personal asset -- an exuberant charm spiked with wisecracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He walked into the office and he hadn't changed a bit, the  
same impish George,'' recalled Joe O'Neill, a childhood friend. 
``He had a conversation with every secretary on the way back to me. 
He knew everybody in the office by the time he left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush never found much oil in Texas, but he slowly found his way.  
He married and fathered twin girls, quit drinking, began studying 
Scripture, and made his an unsuccessful foray into the family 
business by running for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	He learned to court friends and political supporters of his  
father, the vice president. And he hooked up with the oil investors 
who would eventually help him become managing partner of the Texas 
Rangers baseball team. Bush used the Rangers post to cultivate 
celebrity status and prepare for a gutsy, winning challenge to 
Democratic Gov. Ann Richards in 1994. The Rangers deal also made 
him a multimillionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	He's clearly wised up, settled down. Yet friends say Gov. George  
W. Bush, the runaway front-runner for the Republican presidential 
nomination, isn't that different from ``The Bombastic Bushkin'' who 
stormed the oil fields in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	He's impatient and super-competitive, whether at Scrabble or  
golf or politics. He's physical, quick to drape his arm around a 
stranger or grab a friend in a headlock. And he's blunt -- ``the son 
who pulls no punches and tells it like he thinks it is,'' according 
to Barbara Bush. He's ``sort of gruff,'' his wife concedes, and it 
can be intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also irreverent -- the class clown in his Methodist adult  
Sunday school. Asked what word he most associated with Christmas, 
Bush answered ``Santa Claus.'' When his mother's cocker spaniel 
died, Bush greeted her with, ``I'm so sorry, doggone it.'' He 
showed up at a fancy costume party as Gandhi, wearing orange body 
paint and a droopy white sheet that ``looked like he was walking 
around in a diaper,'' longtime friend Don Jones recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd just pop off without thinking what was going to come out  
of his mouth,'' said another buddy, Charlie Younger. ``He's reined 
it in some now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are still the quips and raised eyebrows and winks,  
often conveying an ironic detachment from whatever carefully 
orchestrated campaign event he's starring in. The message, says 
wife Laura, is ``don't get too serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Walker Bush was born July 6, 1946 in New Haven, Conn.,  
where his father, already a flying hero of World War II, was 
charging through Yale. When ``Georgie'' was 2, his parents moved 
West to chase the oil boom. 
</P>
<P>
	They settled in Midland, where friends recall an idyllic 1950s  
childhood of Little League, BB guns and backyard barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
	But young George also endured great sorrow at age 7, when his  
little sister Robin died of leukemia. In her memoir, his mother 
credits Georgie's endearing musings about his sister -- once 
suggesting she was watching a football game from heaven -- with 
salving his parents' grief. 
</P>
<P>
	``This incredible bond was formed between mother and son that  
exists to this day,'' said Michael Wood, a longtime friend. Bush's 
wit and verve mirror her instead of his more reserved father. 
</P>
<P>
	The next child, now Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was seven years  
younger. Three others followed: Neil, stung by the S&AMP;L scandal of 
the 1980s and now a business consultant; Marvin, a venture 
capitalist; and Doro, wife of a Washington lobbyist and mother of 
four. 
</P>
<P>
	None seems to have felt the weight of their father's successes  
as much as the eldest, often called ``Junior'' although he's one 
name short of George Herbert Walker Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	He followed his father's path to prep school in Andover, Mass.,  
and then Yale, but failed to live up to his legacy in academics or 
sports. Instead, he's remembered at Andover for organizing 
stickball tournaments and lavish pep rallies that brightened an 
otherwise rigid campus. 
</P>
<P>
	At Yale, like his father, he was tapped for the secret Skull and  
Bones society and became president of Delta Kappa Epsilon. 
Fraternity brothers remember him as ``the life of the party'' among 
a group preoccupied by beer, sports, soul music and, of course, 
girls. He surprised friends with a short-lived engagement to a 
young woman from Houston his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends say Bush avoided the nascent Vietnam War protests at  
Yale and didn't brook criticism of his father, then a Texas 
congressman supporting the war. He had a student draft deferment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before graduation in 1968, Bush signed up for pilot  
training in the Texas Air National Guard, where it was unlikely he 
would be sent to Vietnam. Bush says he wanted to learn to fly like 
his father; he denies allegations that family connections helped 
win a coveted slot and avoid the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I met the qualifications,'' Bush has said, and ``I served my  
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus began what Bush calls his ``nomadic period.'' He moved to a  
singles complex in Houston, chased women, drank bourbon, tooled 
around in a sports car and flew F-102 fighters on weekends. He 
bounced through several jobs, helped with his father's 
congressional campaign, and worked for a year at a charity that 
mentored poor black boys. 
</P>
<P>
	He was trying to ``reconcile who I was and who my dad was, to  
establish my own identity in my own way,'' Bush said in a 1989 
interview. Unsure what to do next, he enrolled in Harvard, earning 
a master's of business administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush acknowledges he drank too much but has rebuffed persistent  
questions about illegal drugs. Recently, he denied using drugs 
within the past 25 years, a period that covers his return to 
Midland and ascent to governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The earth in Midland is so dry that the only shade trees are  
planted and pampered, and they end at the edge of town. In the 
surrounding oil fields, pump jacks peck at the dusty ground like 
giant, lazy birds. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 29, Bush returned to the town where he was raised, to  
grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	For him, it was ``entrepreneurial heaven.'' On the heels of the  
Arab oil embargo, prices were skyrocketing and fortunes were 
blossoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``George didn't know anything about the oil business really,''  
said one of his business partners, geologist Paul Rea. ``The 
principal reason was because his dad did it, and he wanted to make 
some money of his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With guidance from his father's local friends, Bush began as a  
``land man,'' putting together deals to buy mineral rights. No one 
would have known from his worn jeans and hand-me-down shirts that 
his father was ambassador to China. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anybody live so cheap,'' muses oil man Buzz  
Mills, who let Bush set up a desk in the cramped kitchen area of 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Once when his car stalled on a deeply flooded road, Bush  
stripped to his skivvies and climbed out a window, carefully 
holding his coat and trousers above the water -- he was headed to a 
meeting and had to protect his only business suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends introduced Bush to Laura Welch, a reserved librarian who  
had attended junior high with him in Midland. They were married 
three months later. She became a stabilizing influence, ``like 
ballast to a rocking ship,'' Younger said. Their twin daughters, 
Barbara and Jenna, are now 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The marriage started on the campaign trail in an unlikely bid  
for an open congressional seat. Bush staged an upset in the '78 GOP 
primary but he lost the general election after Democrat Kent Hance 
successfully branded him a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by investments from family friends back East, his oil  
exploration business performed modestly well until prices plummeted 
in 1981. Two Cincinnati investors gave him a boost by merging their 
larger company, Spectrum 7, with his. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, the same pair would tip him off that the Rangers  
ballclub was coming up for sale. He put them together with other 
big money to buy the club from family friend Eddie Chiles in 1989. 
When the team was sold last year, Bush's original $600,000 
investment plus a hefty bonus paid off $14.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But his last year in Midland was a difficult, introspective  
time. His business, like much of the industry, was reeling from 
falling prices. He focused on his growing faith. ``His conversion 
was like a struggle up a steep hill,'' said Don Jones, a weekly 
Bible study partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush remained an enthusiastic social drinker. His wife, Laura,  
had told him ``it would probably be a good idea to stop,'' as had 
his colleague Rea. After a boisterous, sentimental 40th birthday 
dinner with friends, Bush woke up with a hangover and abruptly 
swore off alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Another weight was lifted when Spectrum 7 was bought out by  
Harken Energy in late 1986, leaving Bush with a handsome chunk of 
stock and $120,000 consulting contract. Rea says their financial 
angel was attracted in part by Bush's name -- his father was now 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	His days as a full-time oil man over, Bush moved to Washington  
as a self-described ``loyalty thermometer'' for his father, 
overseeing the political hired help in the '88 presidential 
campaign. His tough manner offended some, but Bush felt he had 
proven himself to Dad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew there were times -- I could just tell -- when he  
respected my opinion,'' he said in an interview after the election. 
</P>
<P>
	And the experience turned his own ambitions back toward  
politics. ``He got a taste of it again,'' said O'Neill. ``And it 
whetted his appetite.''

<HEADLINE> Heinz, Bestfoods Stocks Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Although H.J. Heinz Co. refused comment and  
Bestfoods denied rumors the two were in merger talks, investors bid 
up their shares Wednesday on the prospect of takeovers boosting the 
value of food companies' lagging stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts in the food industry have long advised that big food  
makers may have to merge to boost lagging earnings, firm up their 
global presence and answer the call for cheaper prices from large 
grocery chains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Food companies have lost 10 percent of their value on average,  
while the market is up 10 percent. So there's a 20 percent spread 
there. You've got a group of shareholders who are getting pretty 
darn frustrated,'' said analyst Terry Bivens of Bear Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of merger talks between Bestfoods and Heinz were first  
reported in Wednesday's edition of The Wall Street Journal. Dow 
Jones News later Wednesday reported that talks had broken off 
Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz, best known for its ketchup, has a product lineup that  
includes StarKist tuna and Ore-Ida french fries. Bestfoods is the 
maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise, Entenmann's baked goods, Skippy 
peanut butter and Knorr soups and sauces. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh-based Heinz refused to confirm or deny that it was  
talking to Bestfoods, while Bestfoods issued a statement saying 
``no significant acquisition or combination discussions are in 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it was responding to press reports and noted it  
was ``departing on this occasion from its continuing policy of not 
commenting on rumors or market activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz's no-comment was typical of companies that are the subject  
of Wall Street rumors. That Bestfoods went a step further intrigued 
Bivens, who said an investor might infer something is going on with 
the Englewood, N.J. company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Heinz would like to do it. I think the real question is  
what's Bestfood's disposition on this,'' said Bivens. ``As I look 
across the food category, this would be the best combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Bestfoods jumped up $4.81 1/4, a 8.5 percent gain, to  
$53.12 1/2. Shares of Heinz were up $1.43 3/4, or 3.3 percent, to close 
at $44.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz and Bestfoods come together, it would be a merger of  
equals -- not an acquisition, The Journal reported. Heinz has annual 
sales of $9.3 billion, while Bestfoods, of Englewood, N.J., has 
about $8.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, their sales would be $17.7 billion annually, making  
the combined company the third-largest food company in the world 
behind Europe's Nestle SA, with $52 billion in sales, and 
U.S.-based Kraft Foods, with $27 billion, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney have issued reports  
suggesting the time is right for food manufacturers to consider 
acquisitions or mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The firms said most big food companies have reached a point  
where they are having trouble generating profits and will have to 
merge to consolidate costs, increase market share or find new 
distribution channels to combat increasing pressure from a 
consolidating grocery industry that is demanding lower prices as 
its buying power grows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all been waiting for this consolidation to start. Maybe  
this will be it,'' said Bill Leach of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real problem in the food industry is there's just not any  
sales growth,'' Leach added. ``Heinz seems like it has a 
restructuring every couple of years. Their factories are pretty 
efficient; there's just not a lot you can do to improve the 
margins.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles County supervisors honored  
Director Rob Reiner for his accomplishments outside the film 
industry.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Hear Insurance Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal bank regulators have signed new  
agreements with seven states to share information about customer 
complaints related to insurance sales by banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The move announced Wednesday brings to 16 the number of states  
that have signed such accords, and more are expected in the near 
future. It comes as Congress gets closer to enacting sweeping 
legislation that would lift Depression-era legal barriers and allow 
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to get into each 
other's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks now sell a small amount of insurance, but sales are  
expected to grow substantially in the near future, regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The new information-sharing agreements were announced by the  
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury Department 
division that oversees nationally chartered banks. They were signed 
by the Comptroller's office and insurance regulators in Alabama, 
Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland and West 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``These agreements enhance consumer protection and assure  
compliance with appropriate insurance sales standards,'' 
Comptroller John D. Hawke said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators couldn't immediately provide examples of consumer  
complaints about insurance sales by banks. But Consumers Union and 
the Independent Insurance Agents of America, whose members compete 
with banks, have maintained that many consumers are confused about 
whether insurance sold by banks is federally guaranteed -- as bank 
deposits are -- and therefore could be misled by bank salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups also say consumers are vulnerable to pressure to buy  
insurance, notably credit life insurance, when they apply for loans 
from banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new agreements, the Comptroller's office will forward  
to the state insurance regulators copies of any complaints it 
receives regarding to sales of insurance in that state by a bank. 
The state regulators will do the same. Confidentiality of all 
shared information will be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar accords previously had been signed with Delaware,  
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, North Dakota, 
Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comptroller's office said Wednesday it had completed  
negotiations with three other states, which it did not name, and 
that it expected to sign agreements with them in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial services legislation cleared the House in July  
with a veto-proof vote, 343-86. House and Senate negotiators have 
been trying to blend the package with a substantially different 
version passed by the Senate in May. The Clinton administration 
supports the legislation in principle.

<HEADLINE> Troubled Maytag Realigns Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Iowa (AP) -- Maytag Corp. is realigning its core  
businesses and trying to give more attention to lower-end appliance 
brands that have been dragging down profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock rose 1.2 percent on the announcement  
Wednesday, but was pummeled last week when Maytag said it would not 
meet Wall Street's earnings expectations because of weak sales of 
its lower-priced goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Maytag said its businesses and brands will be consolidated into  
four groups: Home Appliance Solutions, Commercial Appliance 
Solutions, Worldwide Solutions and Emerging Business Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the reorganization, Maytag will be using the same  
strategies on the lower-end brands, such as Magic Chef and Admiral, 
as it has been using on its top-name Hoover and Maytag products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our continued success requires that we develop more fully our  
ability to bring new waves of innovation across every product lines 
in every business and execute our business model with excellence,'' 
said Maytag's chairman, Lloyd D. Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Maytag stock tumbled 26 percent to $41.75 a share on  
the New York Stock Exchange when the company gave its earnings 
warning. It rose 43 3/4 cents Wednesday to $38.37 1/2. As recently as 
May, Maytag had been flirting with $75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton-based Maytag is the nation's No. 3 appliance maker,  
behind Whirlpool and General Electric Corp. The company employs 
about 23,800 people at 17 manufacturing plants in North America and 
China.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Affects Southern League Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- The Southern League baseball championship  
series will remain in Tennessee for at least one extra game because 
of Hurricane Floyd, league officials announced on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando and West Tennessee were scheduled to play the first two  
games Monday and Tuesday in Jackson, Tenn., and the last three in 
Orlando, Fla., on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Because of the 
hurricane threat in Florida, Game 3 was moved to Wednesday in 
Jackson, although Orlando will play as the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	Games 4 and 5 remain scheduled for Friday and Saturday in  
Orlando, if needed and weather permitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the severity of Hurricane Floyd and its potential impact  
in central Florida, we believed it would be prudent and wise to 
extend the home series in West Tennessee,'' said Arnold D. Fielkow, 
president of the Southern League. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league office will continue to monitor the hurricane  
situation throughout the week, and will be prepared to take 
appropriate action as the situation warrants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd was moving northwest Tuesday towards Cape  
Canaveral, Fla., with winds of 140 mph. Orlando is 49 miles west of 
Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tuesday night's game, Orlando led the best-of-5 series  
1-0.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Military Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved a bill Wednesday that  
boosts spending for the military -- and raises pay -- despite 
reservations from some Democrats about the measure's proposed 
revamping of the nation's nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The $289 billion military spending bill passed 375-45. It  
already had been approved by House-Senate negotiators and is 
expected to get final approval in the Senate, probably next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But the legislation, which increases military spending by $18  
billion over this year, also directs a reorganization of the Energy 
Department, creating a largely independent nuclear weapons agency 
within the department. 
</P>
<P>
	That had some Democrats concerned and has prompted a possible  
veto by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization has wide support in Congress after months of  
controversy over allegations of lax security and Chinese espionage 
involving the nuclear weapons labs and the mishandling of a spy 
investigation at the Los Alamos lab dating back to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in an interview that he  
``most likely'' would recommend a veto of the defense bill because 
it puts too much power into the hands of the new agency. 
</P>
<P>
	While supporting creation of a new agency within the department,  
he said the House-passed provision ``endangers health, safety and 
environmental oversight'' of the nuclear weapons program and would 
jeopardize security and counterespionage improvements he already 
has made. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt to rework the Energy Department portion of the bill  
was rejected by 281-139. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and many Democrats, particularly those from  
districts with defense sites, said too much was at stake for 
America's military in the bill to open it up again for changes 
because of the Energy Department reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would provide $8.3 billion more for the military  
in fiscal 2000 than was sought by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes a widely popular 4.8 percent military pay raise;  
more money for military barracks and family housing, and increased 
spending for readiness, maintenance and military hardware from $176 
million for 17 new Black Hawk helicopters to $3.7 billion for a 
ballistic missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military's readiness is in jeopardy,'' said Rep. Duncan  
Hunter, R-Calif., referring to the dispute over DOE reorganization. 
``It would be a tragedy to defeat this bill for some turf fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said he supported the defense  
provisions, but criticized the creation of a National Nuclear 
Security Administration that would be largely insulated from the 
rest of the Energy Department and even the secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``It returns us to the dark secretive days ... when the Atomic  
Energy Commission lied to everybody,'' declared Dingell. The AEC 
during much of the Cold War years worked largely in secret and in 
producing America's nuclear arsenal also left major environment 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, who was key in crafting the DOE  
reorganization provision, said the new agency will ``establish a 
clear chain of command ... where accountability is no longer a 
question'' when it comes to the nuclear weapons labs and security. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., said the new agency still would be  
subject to environmental and worker safety laws. ``It will not 
result in any reversal of any existing environmental policies,'' 
insisted Spence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers rushed to put the measure into the defense bill amid  
the outcry in recent months over the handing of a three-year 
espionage investigation at the Los Alamos weapons lab in New 
Mexico. A scientist at the lab was fired in March for security 
violations after being under investigation since 1996 in the 
apparent theft of nuclear secrets in the 1980s. He has not been 
charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal Energy Department review was critical of the  
handling of the investigation. Recently three Los Alamos officials, 
including its former director, were given reprimands and other 
disciplinary action involving the spy investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A congressional panel this summer produced a report that alleged  
widespread Chinese theft of America's nuclear secrets dating back 
20 years or more because of inattention at the Energy Department 
and weapons labs to security and counterespionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently a presidential commission on intelligence called for  
creation of a semiautonomous nuclear weapons agency within the DOE 
saying that the department was not capable of reforming itself.

<HEADLINE> Jackson: Network Boycotts Not Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Media ownership is more effective than  
boycotting television networks, a longtime civil rights leader told 
black broadcasters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not enough to talk about the image on TV. We've got to  
get behind the question of ownership and control,'' the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson said as the National Association of Black Owned 
Broadcasters opened their fall conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said minorities need a voice because the media can  
``control character and minds, who is friend and who is enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This month, the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil  
rights organization, asked minorities not to watch the four major 
networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC -- because the group found just one 
leading Hispanic role among the 38 shows premiering this fall. 
Other organizations, including the NAACP, also are pressuring the 
networks to feature more minorities in prominent roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Tristani, a member of the Federal Communications  
Commission, is among the boycotters participating in the 
``brownout'' that is to run from last Sunday through Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television is a powerful force, especially when it comes to  
our children, who are still trying to figure out how they fit into 
the larger society,'' Tristani said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	La Raza spokeswoman Lisa Navarrete agreed with Jackson, saying  
the brownout is part of an overall strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to increase Latino ownership. We want to talk to  
advertisers,'' she said. ``We are not in decision-making roles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said the solution is to increase minority ownership of  
media outlets, roles that he said have historically been held by 
white men. 
</P>
<P>
	``How does Ted Turner get CNN? He bought up the networks that we  
couldn't finance'' because banks would not give blacks loans, 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He sees mega-mergers, such as the CBS-Viacom marriage announced  
Sept. 7, as a threat to minorities and wants the FCC to hold 
hearings.

<HEADLINE>  1 Missing, Much Damage in Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Bahamians shoveled sand from homes and  
removed uprooted trees from streets Wednesday amid reports of 
widespread destruction on distant islands in the aftermath of 
powerful Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was missing on northern Grand Bahama Island after the  
van he was riding in got stuck in a storm surge Tuesday and he 
tried to swim to high ground. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Great Abaco Islands, entire neighborhoods were flooded by  
the storm surge and homes, viewed from an aerial flight, looked as 
though they been randomly pushed together. In the island's Marsh 
Harbour wooden homes were flattened and reduced to debris, or left 
only partially standing or turned on their sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene looked similar in northern Eleuthera, where winds  
reached 110 mph Tuesday. Homes were left without roofs, boats 
tossed like toys onto the shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeport resident Bobby Tinker disappeared just west of town,  
said Inspector Kendall Deveaux. A friend, Nelson Davis, survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to beat the hurricane. They were trying to  
get back to their homes when they got caught,'' Deveaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people, including one who fell off a roof during the  
storm, were treated for minor injuries in Nassau, the Bahamian 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's winds ripped roofs off hundreds of wooden homes, beached  
dozens of boats, flooded beachfront condominiums and floated cars 
in 6-foot storm surges while pummeling the fragile islands east of 
Florida on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity and telephones remained down throughout most of the  
600-mile long archipelago on Wednesday, complicating the task of 
reporting casualties and damage that was certain to soar into the 
millions of dollars. U.S. military and Bahamian aircraft were sent 
to survey the islands and airlift emergency supplies if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nassau's airport reopened Wednesday afternoon, with charter  
flights to ferry tourists out and the first commercial flight to 
Miami scheduled for evening. 
</P>
<P>
	All services were expected to be restored on New Providence  
Island -- home to half the Bahamas' 310,000 people -- by late 
Wednesday, the government Tourism Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, Arthur Schechter,  
accompanied Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham as he flew to Cat, San 
Salvador, Abaco and other islands to inspect storm damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Abaco and the tiny keys on its periphery, including Man-O-War  
Cay, Green Turtle Cay and Elbow Cay, sustained ``extreme'' damage, 
said Chris Lloyd, senior officer with the Bahamas Air Sea Rescue 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	On New Providence Island -- home to half the Bahamas' 310,000  
population -- all services were expected to be restored by late 
Wednesday, the government tourism ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the hard-hit eastern island of San Salvador, Club Med  
officials were trying to charter aircraft to evacuate 380 tourists 
who rode out the storm at the resort, which was running on 
generator power. The sprawling island's Atlantis resort reported 
only minor damage and major hotels in Nassau were also spared 
significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Government radio ZNS said most homes on San Salvador, population  
1,000, were roofless, and reported ``mass structural damage 
throughout the country.'' Docks and citrus orchards were destroyed 
on Ackland Island, and a chicken farm was washed away on New 
Providence Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main road is destroyed. Houses are destroyed. Residents  
say they are in desperate need of essential services,'' ZNS radio 
reported from Abaco Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's winds had reached 110 mph on Abaco, Eleuthera, San  
Salvador and Cat islands, and damage was feared to be extensive. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, mounds of wind-driven sand and dangling power lines  
slowed traffic to a crawl. Under brightly sunny skies, residents 
inspected a half-dozen smashed boats beached along Nassau's West 
Bay Street; another half-dozen were stranded along nearby Arawak 
Cay. 
</P>
<P>
	``They looted my boat. They stole my stove. How can people do  
that when I already have so much trouble?'' shouted Omar Segundo, 
surveying his beached 100-foot freighter in Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattresses, lumber from ravaged docks and other debris littered  
beaches. Uprooted sea grape and almond trees lined a central 
boulevard. Utility workers swarmed the streets, fixing downed power 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to do now. It was all I had,'' said Michel  
Ashnell as he stared at a pile of lumber -- all that was left of the 
25-foot boat he used to ferry supplies among the islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Skeete held her 2-year-old son, Levi, as she watched  
neighbors remove a tree that had smashed her small wooden home in 
half. ``I am just worried about getting the tree out of my living 
room,'' she said numbly. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Ingraham said he expected all schools and  
government offices on New Providence Island to reopen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Grand Bahama Island, police used small boats to rescue air  
traffic controllers, meteorologists and airport workers who had 
been stranded by a 6-foot storm surge at the seaside airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some vicious flooding,'' said constable Chris Barr.  
``We had cars floating around.'' Police patrolled Freeport streets 
to prevent looting. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio stations reminded residents to keep an eye out for  
Hurricane Gert, whose winds reached 150 mph Wednesday and, at 5 
p.m. EDT, was centered 725 miles east of the northern Leeward 
Islands. It was moving westward at 13 mph, and a gradual turn to 
the west-northwest was expected Thursday.

	Freeport resident Bobby Tinker disappeared just west of town,  
said Inspector Kendall Deveaux. A friend, Nelson Davis, survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to beat the hurricane. They were trying to  
get back to their homes when they got caught,'' Deveaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people, including one who fell off a roof during the  
storm, were treated for minor injuries in Nassau, the Bahamian 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's winds ripped roofs off hundreds of wooden homes, beached  
dozens of boats, flooded beachfront condominiums and floated cars 
in 6-foot storm surges while pummeling the fragile islands east of 
Florida on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity and telephones remained down throughout most of the  
600-mile long archipelago on Wednesday, complicating the task of 
reporting casualties and damage that was certain to soar into the 
millions of dollars. U.S. military and Bahamian aircraft were sent 
to survey the islands and airlift emergency supplies if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nassau's airport reopened Wednesday afternoon, with charter  
flights to ferry tourists out and the first commercial flight to 
Miami scheduled for evening. 
</P>
<P>
	All services were expected to be restored on New Providence  
Island -- home to half the Bahamas' 310,000 people -- by late 
Wednesday, the government Tourism Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, Arthur Schechter,  
accompanied Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham as he flew to Cat, San 
Salvador, Abaco and other islands to inspect storm damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Abaco and the tiny keys on its periphery, including Man-O-War  
Cay, Green Turtle Cay and Elbow Cay, sustained ``extreme'' damage, 
said Chris Lloyd, senior officer with the Bahamas Air Sea Rescue 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	On New Providence Island -- home to half the Bahamas' 310,000  
population -- all services were expected to be restored by late 
Wednesday, the government tourism ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the hard-hit eastern island of San Salvador, Club Med  
officials were trying to charter aircraft to evacuate 380 tourists 
who rode out the storm at the resort, which was running on 
generator power. The sprawling island's Atlantis resort reported 
only minor damage and major hotels in Nassau were also spared 
significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Government radio ZNS said most homes on San Salvador, population  
1,000, were roofless, and reported ``mass structural damage 
throughout the country.'' Docks and citrus orchards were destroyed 
on Ackland Island, and a chicken farm was washed away on New 
Providence Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main road is destroyed. Houses are destroyed. Residents  
say they are in desperate need of essential services,'' ZNS radio 
reported from Abaco Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's winds had reached 110 mph on Abaco, Eleuthera, San  
Salvador and Cat islands, and damage was feared to be extensive. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, mounds of wind-driven sand and dangling power lines  
slowed traffic to a crawl. Under brightly sunny skies, residents 
inspected a half-dozen smashed boats beached along Nassau's West 
Bay Street; another half-dozen were stranded along nearby Arawak 
Cay. 
</P>
<P>
	``They looted my boat. They stole my stove. How can people do  
that when I already have so much trouble?'' shouted Omar Segundo, 
surveying his beached 100-foot freighter in Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattresses, lumber from ravaged docks and other debris littered  
beaches. Uprooted sea grape and almond trees lined a central 
boulevard. Utility workers swarmed the streets, fixing downed power 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to do now. It was all I had,'' said Michel  
Ashnell as he stared at a pile of lumber -- all that was left of the 
25-foot boat he used to ferry supplies among the islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Skeete held her 2-year-old son, Levi, as she watched  
neighbors remove a tree that had smashed her small wooden home in 
half. ``I am just worried about getting the tree out of my living 
room,'' she said numbly. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Ingraham said he expected all schools and  
government offices on New Providence Island to reopen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Grand Bahama Island, police used small boats to rescue air  
traffic controllers, meteorologists and airport workers who had 
been stranded by a 6-foot storm surge at the seaside airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some vicious flooding,'' said constable Chris Barr.  
``We had cars floating around.'' Police patrolled Freeport streets 
to prevent looting. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio stations reminded residents to keep an eye out for  
Hurricane Gert, whose winds reached 150 mph Wednesday and, at 5 
p.m. EDT, was centered 725 miles east of the northern Leeward 
Islands. It was moving westward at 13 mph, and a gradual turn to 
the west-northwest was expected Thursday.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 83.90 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose this morning after a tame  
inflation report help calm investors' fears that the Federal 
Reserve would raise interest rates for the third time this year. 
But technology shares lost ground, giving up some of Tuesday's 
sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 83.90 at 10,994.23, erasing much of 
Tuesday's 120-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 8.10 at 1,344.39, while the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 3.02 at 2,865.27, after climbing more than 23 points on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose today after the Labor Department reported that the  
August increase in its Consumer Price Index -- the most closely 
watched inflation gauge -- matched the 0.3 percent July advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the big gains in the gasoline and energy categories,  
prices rose a mere 0.1 percent in August, well below what Wall 
Street economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped temper concerns that the Fed will need to boost  
interest rates for the third time this year as it tries to prevent 
inflation from escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also helped lift prices in the inflation-sensitive  
bond market, which sent yields on 30-year Treasury bonds down to 
6.08 percent this morning from 6.12 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation jitters were heightened Tuesday after the Commerce  
Department reported retail sales surged 1.2 percent in August, the 
biggest increase in six months and nearly twice what economists had 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	That report added to worries the economy is overheating  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 12-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 110.39 million 
shares in the early going today, up from 86.86 million shares on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was up 1.72 at 439.96.  
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading overseas, Germany's DAX index was down 0.9  
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was unchanged, and France's CAC-40 was 
up 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan were closed for a national holiday.

<HEADLINE> Savannah: What, Me Worry? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- As Hurricane Floyd barreled toward him, Dr.  
David Thomas sat on the steps of his 1889 Italianate home on 
Monterey Square, calmly sipping orange juice and staring at the 
moss-draped live oaks and towering magnolias. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before an improved forecast eased the minds of city  
residents today, nailing plywood was the furthest thing from 
Thomas' mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figure if it's been here over 100 years and it's withstood  
it without any problems, it'll probably withstand this one -- 
hopefully,'' Thomas said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His three-story home is across from Mercer House, made famous by  
the book and movie ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' sentiments appeared to be shared by most in historic  
Savannah, where precious few of the graceful antebellum mansions 
were boarded or even had their windows taped. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had reason to worry Tuesday. The Georgia Emergency  
Management Agency had predicted Floyd would rake Savannah and other 
coastal cities with 125 mph wind late today. But as the storm took 
a more eastward track, that estimate was lowered today to 50-60 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatham County, of which Savannah is the seat, ordered all  
250,000 residents to evacuate Tuesday. The director of the county's 
emergency operations center, Phillip Weber, said today the 
evacuation order would stay in effect, even with the improved 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that we have a bluebird day here in Savannah, but we  
can't afford to plan that way. This storm is not a dot on a track. 
... We can't afford to let our guard down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many in the historic district were staying put Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to stay down on the first floor in the hall at the  
peak of the storm and just sit there and play cards and drink 
wine,'' said Barbara Hofer, 67, who lives behind Mercer House. 
``It's four bricks thick all the way around -- brick all the way up, 
three stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others weren't willing to gamble. At Bonaventure Cemetery,  
pictured on the ``Midnight'' cover jacket, a few people removed 
statues from the graves of relatives. Bonaventure, where songwriter 
Johnny Mercer and other leading citizens of Savannah are buried, 
sits on the Savannah River and could flood. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument for Revolutionary War hero Casimir Pulaski, which  
had been on display at the Coastal Heritage Museum, was put in 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Lafayette Square, workers rushed to remove 112 feet of  
scaffolding from the twin spires of St. John the Baptist Cathedral, 
one of Savannah's oldest churches at 200-plus years. The 
scaffolding was erected to repair the church's stucco surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Savannah's historic district sits on a bluff above the Savannah  
River, 20 miles inland and high enough to keep most of downtown 
from flooding, city officials said. Their main worry was that wind 
and debris could breach old homes and buildings, letting water seep 
in from heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Savannah residents worried most about damage to the  
towering oaks that give the city some of its distinctive natural 
beauty. But city officials expect many will survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Savannah wasn't the only place in Georgia worried about  
protecting its historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers on Jekyll Island shuttered the ``millionaire cottages''  
built by the Rockefellers and Pulitzers. At Fort McAllister, where 
Gen. William T. Sherman ended his March to the Sea after burning 
Atlanta, state workers removed military artifacts, including small 
arms and artillery shells. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Savannah, Thomas was more worried about his boat docked  
in the harbor than his home. 
</P>
<P>
	That, he said, will ``be here after I'm gone.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Miss America Chides Change in Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The reigning Miss America has joined  
a chorus of critics denouncing the pageant's decision to open up 
the contest to women with divorces or abortions in their past. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss America Nicole Johnson, asked Wednesday about the changes,  
pulled no punches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see the Miss America Organization as an organization that  
thrives on tradition, principles and standards,'' said Johnson, 25, 
who will crown a successor on Saturday. ``To deviate at all from 
those traditions, standards and principles saddens me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Miss America Organization's board of directors, which voted  
in June to change the eligibility requirements, has agreed to hold 
off on the change pending talks with state pageant directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The directors contend that allowing divorcees or those who've  
had pregnancies to compete would mar the pageant's ideals. Pageant 
officials have said they made the change to comply with 
anti-discrimination law. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Miss Rhode Island won in swimsuit and Miss Louisiana  
in talent Wednesday as preliminary competition continued in the 
79th annual Miss America Pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Lindsay, 24, of Warwick, R.I., won a $500 scholarship in  
the swimsuit competition. Lindsay is a University of Rhode Island 
fashion major. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Lawrence, 22, of Destrehan, La., a University of New  
Orleans graduate who wants to be a pediatrician, won a $2,500 
scholarship in the talent contest. She performed a ballet dance to 
``Man of La Mancha.'

<HEADLINE> Bombing Prosecutor Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The U.S. attorney who helped prosecute  
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols in the Oklahoma City bombing case 
has resigned, saying he planned to return to private practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick M. Ryan said that while he was disappointed that Nichols  
did not receive the death penalty for the explosion that killed 168 
people, he believed justice was done. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, 53, was sworn in as U.S. attorney for the Western District  
of Oklahoma 19 days before the bombing. He devoted the following 
three years to preparing the case for trial in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will never forget the many thousands of victims of the April  
19, 1995, tragedy that I have worked with and met over the past 
several years,'' Ryan wrote in his letter of resignation to 
Attorney General Janet Reno. ``Their stories and faces are forever 
etched in my memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he would keep his  
promise to the victims not to write a book about the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the facts are out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	His resignation is effective Oct. 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pianist Roger Williams plans to be at the  
keyboard the moment he turns 75. 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainer, known for hits like ``Autumn Leaves,'' ``Born  
Free,'' ``Lara's Theme'' and ``The Impossible Dream,'' is planning 
a 12-hour recital to celebrate the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	The marathon will begin Sept. 30 and end Oct. 1 -- his birthday --

<P>
	``Recently, my kids and my friends started asking me what I  
wanted to do for my 75th birthday,'' Williams said Monday. ``Well, 
I love to play and I love to play people's requests. So in 12 
hours, I'm going to get to do a lot of what I love to do.''

<HEADLINE> Quayle Opposes Troops in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- The United States should stop being ``an  
international 911 operator'' and keep American troops out of East 
Timor, former Vice President Dan Quayle said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a superpower, our role is not peacekeeping,'' the  
Republican presidential candidate told Dover Rotary Club members. 
``Our role is peacemaking ... I do not believe that even though we 
are the only superpower, we should be the global policemen of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said Wednesday that sending troops to  
East Timor could help Indonesia's transition to democracy and 
protect U.S. military and economic interests. But Quayle said the 
U.S. military already is stretched too thin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're spread all over the world, and when there is a serious  
crisis in an important region of the world, we may not be able to 
do the job,'' he said. ``Bill Clinton has taken the bar so low in 
foreign policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said Clinton has ``cut at the heart and soul'' of the  
military by letting it dwindle in size. He proposes building it up 
with the money generated by his proposed tax cut, a freeze on 
non-defense discretionary spending and shrinking the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The departments of Education and Labor should be folded into the  
Department of Health and Human Services, he said, to save money and 
provide ``one-stop shopping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle was unfazed by his poor showing in state polls -- 3  
percent of likely New Hampshire primary voters said they'd vote for 
Quayle in a WMUR-CNN poll released this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been behind before,'' he said. ``I just have to take my  
message to the people and let them choose. I think after I do that, 
I'll do exceedingly well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he has enough money to get through the New  
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary and will evaluate his 
support after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotary member Dave Azarian, a Democrat, said he was more  
impressed with Quayle than he anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if he can continues like this, he's going to do a lot  
to restore the impression people have of him,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Disney: No Deal Near on Angels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. isn't close to a  
deal to sell either the Anaheim Angels or the NHL's Mighty Ducks, 
the company's executive in charge of the teams said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been highly exaggerated,'' said Tony Tavares, the  
president of Anaheim Sports Inc., a Disney subsidiary. ``It's not 
actively being shopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, columnist Peter Gammons wrote for ESPN.com  
that Disney has ``completed the parameters of a deal'' to sell the 
baseball and hockey clubs to billionair Henry Nicholas III for $650 
million. ESPN.com, which is a Web site for Disney-owned cable 
broadcaster ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts have valued the Angels-Ducks package at $375  
million to $425 million, but Nicholas ``stepped up and closed the 
deal,'' the columnist wrote. Nicholas is president and chief 
executive of Broadcom Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Tavares said Disney was approached by people interested in the  
teams about four months ago and was ``in a listening mode.'' But he 
said talks hadn't even progressed to where the team would seek 
permission from the commissioner's office to show its books to 
prospective suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney took control of the team from Gene Autry in March 1996  
and bought a 100 percent interest following his death last year. 
Tavares said the Angels' poor performance -- they began the day 
60-85, 26 1/2 games behind first-place Texas in the AL West -- was not 
a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is not whether they're satisfied with how the  
teams have gone,'' Tavares said. ``It would be whether or not this 
is on point for their strategic goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tavares likened people who express interest in become sports  
team owners to ``people who come into an auto dealership and kick 
the tires.''

<HEADLINE> Brain Buildup Causes Addiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cocaine may be one of the toughest addictions to cure because it  
triggers a buildup of a protein that persists in the brain and 
stimulates genes that intensify the craving for the drug, new 
research suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at the Yale School of Medicine were able to isolate  
the long-lived protein, called Delta-FosB, and show that it 
triggered addiction when released to a specific area of the brains 
of genetically engineered mice. 
</P>
<P>
	The protein (pronounced fawz-bee) isn't produced in the brain  
until addicts have used cocaine several times, or even for several 
years. But once the buildup begins, the need for the drug becomes 
overpowering and the user's behavior becomes increasingly 
compulsive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like a molecular switch,'' said Eric Nestler, who  
led the research. ``Once it's flipped on, it stays on, and doesn't 
go away easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, to be published Thursday in the journal Nature,  
were called ``elegant'' and ``brilliant'' by other researchers who 
said it offered the first concrete proof that drug use triggers a 
specific long-term change in brain chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	The study indicates genetics is less a factor in addiction than  
prolonged drug use, said Alan Leshner, director of the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse, which funded part of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your genes don't doom you to be an addict,'' Leshner said.  
``They just make you more, or less, susceptible. We've never found 
one gene that keeps you from being an addict, or one that dictates 
you're going to be an addict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nestler and his colleagues combined genetic and biochemical  
research to isolate the Delta-FosB protein and the area of the 
brain it affected, then did behavioral studies on the mice. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the level of Delta-FosB accumulates, it begins to regulate  
genes that control a region of the brain called the nucleus 
accumbens, an area involved in addictive behavior and pleasure 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
	They speculated that Delta-FosB also activates other genes that  
produce biochemical compounds called glutamates, which carry 
messages in brain cells. Receptors in the brain cells become highly 
sensitive to glutamate, particularly in the nucleus accumbens. 
</P>
<P>
	To test the theory, they inserted a gene associated with  
glutamate into the nucleus accumbens of experimental mice. Those 
mice showed a ``dramatic'' increase in cocaine sensitivity, they 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major advance in our understanding of addiction,''  
said Francis White, chairman of cellular and molecular pharmacology 
at Finch University of Health Sciences in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers were more cautious, noting that addiction is a  
complex process in humans because it is linked to learning and 
multiple chemical pathways in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not clear to me that there's a separate molecular pathway  
that's going to be assignable to drug abuse and not interfere with 
other learning,'' said Gary Aston-Jones of the University of 
Pennsylvania School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The craving for cocaine can be so powerful, a recovered addict  
who has avoided the drug for years may start feeling his or her 
heart race just by seeing something associated with drug use, such 
as a $100 bill or a familiar street corner, Aston-Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to knock out the memory for the drug but you don't  
want to knock out the memory for the way home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Hyman, director of the National Institute of Mental  
Health, said the study also indicated the buildup of the Delta-FosB 
protein might be a factor with other drugs, including amphetamine, 
morphine, heroin and nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important stepping stone but there is a long road  
to travel,'' Hyman said.

<HEADLINE> To Win More, Marino Has To Do Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The television audience for ``Monday Night Football'' kept  
getting bigger and bigger before peaking at halftime, when the 
Denver Broncos retired John Elway's number. 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise there, since the rifle-armed,  
tough-as-a-mule-and-cool-as-dry-ice quarterback was always a top 
NFL draw. 
</P>
<P>
	But one of life's little ironies made it impossible for one of  
No. 7's biggest fans to watch. That's because Dan Marino was stuck 
inside the Dolphins' locker room during intermission, trying to 
figure out a way to beat No. 7's former team. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it worked out, anyway. Elway still got his grand  
sendoff and close pal Marino settled for a videotape of the 
ceremony -- and what could prove to be a very important victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big win for us, coming in to beat the two-time  
defending champs,'' he said. ``It's a huge win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is not one to exaggerate, but the only way this season  
opener qualifies as huge is for Miami to go on and beat nearly 
everyone in similar fashion. Though he would never say so, Marino 
probably has just one good run left in him. And like Elway at the 
end of his career, the less he has to do to get to the Super Bowl, 
the more likely he is to wrap his hands around the one trophy that 
has eluded him so far. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 previous seasons with the Dolphins, Marino has been the  
only constant and more times than he probably cares to remember 
now, the only reason they won. Monday night in Denver, he was a 
very efficient 15-of-23, with two touchdowns and no interceptions, 
but Marino's presence (not to mention Elway's absence) was not the 
only reason Miami beat Denver so handily. 
</P>
<P>
	A well-choreographed defense led by linebacker Zach Thomas  
limited Broncos running back Terrell Davis to 61 rushing yards and 
no touchdowns in 19 carries, mostly by stacking eight men close to 
the line of scrimmage and daring Elway's replacement, second-year 
passer Brian Griese, to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more important, though, Miami might have stumbled onto  
something it has been lacking for most of the past two decades now 
-- a running game. The Dolphins totaled 111 yards against Denver, 
hardly a stampede, but enough to keep the Broncos from zeroing in 
on Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA product Karim Abdul-Jabbar got most of the work and  
responded well, considering that coach Jimmy Johnson's guarantees 
regarding employment in the Dolphins' backfield are limited to a 
week at a time. Johnson used three of his first four draft picks 
this year on running backs, and both J.J. Johnson and Rob Konrad 
saw action. But the most talented member of the draft trio, Cecil 
Collins, was ineligible to play because of a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one scouting service rated Collins the top prospect in  
the draft, but he's been arrested twice for breaking into a woman's 
apartment, failed three drug tests, been dismissed twice from 
college and spent nearly four weeks in jail. Johnson, though, is 
already one year late on the Super Bowl he promised Miami upon his 
arrival in 1996, and so Collins' appearance in a regular-season 
game will come as soon as his ankle heals. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter when that is, if Collins is half as good as  
advertised, that day can't come too soon for Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the last member still holding down a job from what is  
considered the greatest quarterbacking class ever to enter the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, six passers were taken in the first round of the 1983  
draft. Marino got to the Super Bowl his second season, got beat and 
hasn't been back since. Jim Kelly took the Buffalo Bills there four 
times and came away empty-handed. Elway lost the first three times 
he made it, and then, leaving more and more of the heroics to Davis 
and a continually improving defense, won back-to-back Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody took away their own memories from the ceremony marking  
the retirement party the Broncos threw Monday night for No. 7. The 
lesson for Marino and the Dolphins is not to recall Elway at his 
most spectacular, but rather at his most opportunistic, finally 
relying on the talents of others more than his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino spent large chunks of his summer playing golf with Elway,  
Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. Besides being automatic Hall of 
Famers and champions, the other thing the trio had in common was 
retirement. Marino is sure to follow them soon, perhaps at the end 
of this season if rumors of Jimmy Johnson's departure from coaching 
turn out to be fact. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a shame if Marino leaves without a championship,  
especially since this is his best chance to do more by doing less. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Bearing Down on Southeast U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COCOA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Monstrous Hurricane Floyd moved closer  
toward the Southeast, sending wind-whipped rains through Florida's 
deserted streets and leaving coastal residents from Georgia to 
Virginia bracing for a more severe thrashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, near hurricane force winds arrived at Cape  
Canaveral while the rest of Florida's eastern coast was met with 
tropical force winds and gusts up to 73 mph, said Jack Beven, a 
forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain fell from West Palm Beach to Cape Canaveral.  
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's eye was expected to continue to swirl over the Atlantic  
Ocean before making landfall on Thursday at Wilmington, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've been spared in Florida may just be transplanted to  
the Carolina coast,'' said Jeremy Pennington, also a Hurricane 
Center forecaster. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. EDT, the storm's center was located about 110 miles  
east-southeast of Cape Canaveral. Floyd was moving northwest near 
14 mph, and a turn to the north and increase in speed was expected 
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning remained in effect from Fort Pierce, Fla.,  
at the midway point of Florida's eastern coast, to the North 
Carolina-Virginia border. A hurricane watch continued from there to 
Chincoteague, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches in areas  
along Floyd's path. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of that is falling over water, but there is some  
rainfall over north Florida and the Carolinas,'' Beven said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before daybreak, the streets of Daytona Beach were an  
abandoned, rain-washed grid. In Bunnell, 25 miles north, Flager 
County officials reported tides at 3 to 4 feet above normal, and up 
to 1,400 customers were without power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of squall lines coming through the last  
several hours,'' said Jon Fillinger, a county emergency management 
chief. ``We've got gusts, the kind you'd see in a strong 
thunderstorm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After making landfall, forecasters expect Floyd -- a Category 4  
storm with 140-mph winds -- to follow the Interstate 95 corridor 
north to Wilmington throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	With its hurricane force winds extending 125 miles from the  
center and tropical storm force winds up to 290 miles outward, 
Floyd looked to spare few North Carolina cities from its fury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope and pray for the best,'' said North Carolina Gov. Jim  
Hunt. ``But this looks real mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 2 million people were told to evacuate the Southeast  
seaboard as Floyd's path remained uncertain. Florida undertook what 
officials called its largest-ever peacetime evacuation, with tens 
of thousands of motorists making an epic, halting journey north. 
Georgia and South Carolina residents also streamed inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Mills, a 34-year-old Kennedy Space Center worker, became  
stuck in traffic, managing only 15 miles in 2 1/2 hours. He became so 
frustrated he simply turned around and returned to the Cape, where 
102 other workers had volunteered to stay behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``You made a mile every five to 10 minutes,'' he said. ``There  
were people going on the sides of the road. People were getting 
angry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney World closed early for the first time in its 28-year  
history, and other resorts also were shuttered. The Navy sent ships 
to ride out the storm at sea rather than risk damage in port, and 
military aircraft were flown inland to bases from Maine to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued pre-emptive disaster declarations for  
Florida and Georgia to enable recovery efforts to begin as quickly 
as possible. He also planned to cut short his trip to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Emergency Management Agency set up a staging area in  
Atlanta, stockpiling food, ice, water, cots, sleeping bags, 
blankets, generators, portable toilets, flashlights and plastic 
sheeting so that they could be delivered to hard-hit areas in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, hundreds of airline flights in and out of Florida and  
Georgia were canceled, and Amtrak suspended train service into and 
out of Miami, scrambling the plans of vacationers and business 
travelers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Garden City, west of Savannah, Ga., Michael Tarvin and his  
girlfriend, Robin Hill, took a break at a shopping center after 
sitting in bumper-to-bumper, three-lanes-wide traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going west, as far west as I can get,'' said Tarvin.

Falling costs for clothing, computers, airline tickets and new cars 
pushed the core inflation rate to the lowest level in 33 years, the 
government reported. The Labor Department said today that its 
Consumer Price Index was up 0.3 percent overall in August, but 
outside of the volatile food and energy areas, prices rose just 0.1 
percent. But even with the good news in the underlying rate of 
inflation, many economists said they still expected the Federal 
Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this year at its 
meeting Oct. 5.

<P>
	Business Inventories Rise 0.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department said today that  
inventories held by businesses on shelves and backlots rose by 0.3 
percent in July while business sales rose at an even faster 0.4 
percent clip. That left the ratio of inventories to sales at a 
record low of 1.34 months, meaning it would take that length of 
time to exhaust supplies at the current sales pace.

	European Stocks Fall on Fed Concern  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Stocks fell in Europe today as traders worried  
about a possible U.S. interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve 
next month. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies 
fell 1.07 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 311.33. A report 
Tuesday showing strong consumer spending in the United Staets 
helped fan fears that the Fed may raise rates when it meets again 
in October. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 9.33 points to 
3,816.53, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 9.22 points at 
3,700.92. In European markets, Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.3 
percent. The Paris and London bourses were the worst performers, 
with a drop of 0.8 percent in both the CAC-40 and FTSE 100 indexes. 
In London, heavyweight oil stocks came under pressure, with BP 
Amoco and Shell closing down.

	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Bargainers for the major U.S. car  
companies and the United Auto Workers continued intensive 
negotiations today after the union granted an open-ended extension 
to contracts that cover 407,000 workers. The focus of the talks was 
at DaimlerChrysler's U.S. headquarters, where the two sides met 
through the night. They took a short break at midmorning, returning 
to the table this afternoon. Neither side would comment on 
progress, but the marathon session was taken as a sign a deal could 
be imminent.

	Feds To Hear Insurance Complaints  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal bank regulators have signed new  
agreements with seven states to share information about customer 
complaints related to insurance sales by banks. The move announced 
today brings to 16 the number of states that have signed such 
accords. More are expected in the near future. The development 
comes as Congress gets closer to enacting sweeping legislation that 
would lift Depression-era legal barriers and allow banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies to get into each other's 
businesses.

ambitious expectations. For the three months ended Aug. 31, Oracle

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders New Trial in NRA Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A judge has ordered a new trial in a lawsuit  
against the National Rifle Association, saying a $4.45 million 
award to two members over a scuffle at a convention was excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Clarence Newcomer on Tuesday rejected the  
NRA's request to dismiss the case. But he wrote that he had ``no 
doubt that the excessive damages awarded were a result of passion, 
prejudice or bias against the NRA and not because of the 
evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Brodbeck of Des Moines, Iowa, sued the NRA and its  
president, Charlton Heston, for defamation and battery, saying he 
was roughed up by an NRA security guard during the group's national 
convention in Philadelphia last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brodbeck also said Heston accused him of ``very bad acting'' in  
an attempt to disrupt the NRA meeting. Brodbeck's wife, Sally, was 
part of an NRA faction opposed to the current leadership, according 
to the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a trial in which the 75-year-old former actor took the  
witness stand, the jury in May awarded Brodbeck and his wife $4.45 
million in damages. The amount included a $2.7 million punitive 
award for damage to the Brodbecks' reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcomer set a retrial for Dec. 6.

	WEST PATERSON, N.J. (AP) -- Diet guru Richard Simmons has offered  
financial help to an ill 800-pound man recently rescued from his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters on Sunday cut a 54-square-foot hole in an apartment  
house wall so they could free Steven DeProspo and take him to a

	DeProspo, 31, and his mother now face eviction from their  
apartment because of the damage.

	Simmons, in New Jersey for a book signing Tuesday night, heard  
about the duo's plight and offered to lend a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's just a matter of having the place cleaned up, I'd be  
happy to pay to have the place made presentable, as long as the 
landlord agrees to continue to let them live there,'' Simmons said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Pledge Long-Term Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The two Democratic presidential  
candidates, pressured by the state's large and active elderly 
community, signed pledges to find ``a comprehensive solution'' for 
long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley headed to a senior center to  
sign the pledge Wednesday, and added that he would push for 
prescription medication coverage as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore signed the same pledge ``without  
hesitation'' earlier in the week after meeting privately with 
leaders of AARP, the nation's largest lobby group for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	That group has made long-term care a top priority, arguing that  
it isn't covered by Medicare and most insurance policies. It has 
been pressuring presidential candidates to deal with the issue, and 
both Bradley and Gore signed the same pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	That pledge doesn't commit them to specific actions, but they  
agreed to make ``the long-term care crisis one of my 
administration's top priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It calls for a ``comprehensive solution drawing on both private  
and public financing methods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and Gore are competing in the state's leadoff precinct  
caucuses next winter and the elderly are a key group being courted. 
Iowa is the nation's third oldest state, and studies have shown 
that the elderly voter in heavier proportions than other 
demographic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing homes can cost thousands of dollars and month, and more  
for those requiring skilled care. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley held a roundtable with about a dozen seniors, telling  
them he'll offer a detailed health care package within a couple of 
weeks, but said it will have a component dealing with long-term 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are about 25 million adult Americans who are caring for  
their elderly parents,'' said Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley argued for ``some form of Medicare drug benefit'' to  
ease the financial pinch facing the elderly, with the cost to come 
from the projected budged surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first priority in the use of that money should be health  
care and reducing child poverty,'' said Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part Gore said long-term care issues have long been a  
priority, and he noted that the administration is pushing for a 
prescription drug benefit under Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long-term care is a top priority of mine and will continue to  
be if I am elected president,'' Gore said. He signed the pledge 
Sunday night during a private meeting with AARP leaders, and his 
campaign issued a statement Wednesday about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus on health care was shifted briefly during Bradley's  
appearance when he took note of a measure which passed the House 
banning so-called soft money from campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said the administration of which Gore is a part hasn't  
been terribly active on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this administration truly cared about this issue they  
should be up there breaking arms,'' said Bradley. ``This is a real 
test of how serious the administration is toward the elimination of 
soft money.''

<HEADLINE> Washington Braces for Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are fleeing, the president is  
rushing back from overseas and ordinary Washingtonians are 
hunkering down. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Hurricane Floyd is expected to be much weakened by  
the time it reaches Washington on Thursday, the capital's denizens 
aren't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish all my colleagues safe travel home,'' House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Wednesday, as he and the other 
leaders canceled legislative business for the week so 
representatives could catch flights home in case local airports 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	Members hurried past a dozen or so ornate metal outdoor lounge  
chairs that had been brought inside from the Capitol's many 
balconies to protect them against Floyd's winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators, somehow hardier than their House colleagues, remained  
in town to finish their weekly work and ride the storm out. 
</P>
<P>
	And President Clinton nixed plans for a day of golfing in Hawaii  
-- where his plane was stopping to refuel after a five-day official 
trip to New Zealand -- so he could hurry home to face Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	For the people who live in and around Washington, flash flood  
warnings and predictions of winds up to 60 mph prompted a rash of 
school closings and a run on local markets 
</P>
<P>
	``People are shopping as if a blizzard were coming,'' said Mike  
Masoni, manager of the Giant Food Store in Bowie, Md., east of 
Washington. Shoppers stocked up on water, canned goods, ice, 
flashlights and batteries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Floyd comes into range, sometime during the night, 3 to 6  
inches of rain are expected to fall in six hours or less, producing 
flash flooding and heavy winds, forecasters said. District of 
Columbia officials are expected to decide Thursday whether to 
declare a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't like a sightseeing thing,'' said D.C. Mayor Anthony  
Williams. ``When you've got winds of 60 miles per hour, that's 
serious,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some commuter trains heading into Virginia and Maryland were  
canceled, and the Federal Aviation Administration said flights 
would likely be canceled at Ronald Reagan National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandria, a Virginian city just across the Potomac from  
Washington, prepared 2,000 sandbags, prompting its mayor, Kerry 
Donley, to declare, ``We're prepared for anything that Floyd's 
going to give us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The D.C. city government and several other local jurisdictions  
have instituted a ``liberal leave'' policy for nonessential 
employees. District businesses are encouraged to adopt similar 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	But a tape recording at the Office of Personnel Management  
indicated neither hurricane nor floods nor an empty House of 
Representatives would keep government workers from their appointed 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``All federal employees are expected to report for work on  
time,'' it said.

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Bearing Down on Southeast U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COCOA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Monstrous Hurricane Floyd moved closer  
toward the Southeast, sending wind-whipped rains through Florida's 
deserted streets and leaving coastal residents from Georgia to 
Virginia bracing for a more severe thrashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, near hurricane force winds arrived at Cape  
Canaveral while the rest of Florida's eastern coast was met with 
tropical force winds and gusts up to 73 mph, said Jack Beven, a 
forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain fell from West Palm Beach to Cape Canaveral.  
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's eye was expected to continue to swirl over the Atlantic  
Ocean before making landfall on Thursday at Wilmington, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've been spared in Florida may just be transplanted to  
the Carolina coast,'' said Jeremy Pennington, also a Hurricane 
Center forecaster. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. EDT, the storm's center was located about 110 miles  
east-southeast of Cape Canaveral. Floyd was moving northwest near 
14 mph, and a turn to the north and increase in speed was expected 
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning remained in effect from Fort Pierce, Fla.,  
at the midway point of Florida's eastern coast, to the North 
Carolina-Virginia border. A hurricane watch continued from there to 
Chincoteague, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches in areas  
along Floyd's path. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of that is falling over water, but there is some  
rainfall over north Florida and the Carolinas,'' Beven said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before daybreak, the streets of Daytona Beach were an  
abandoned, rain-washed grid. In Bunnell, 25 miles north, Flager 
County officials reported tides at 3 to 4 feet above normal, and up 
to 1,400 customers were without power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of squall lines coming through the last  
several hours,'' said Jon Fillinger, a county emergency management 
chief. ``We've got gusts, the kind you'd see in a strong 
thunderstorm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After making landfall, forecasters expect Floyd -- a Category 4  
storm with 140-mph winds -- to follow the Interstate 95 corridor 
north to Wilmington throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	With its hurricane force winds extending 125 miles from the  
center and tropical storm force winds up to 290 miles outward, 
Floyd looked to spare few North Carolina cities from its fury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope and pray for the best,'' said North Carolina Gov. Jim  
Hunt. ``But this looks real mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 2 million people were told to evacuate the Southeast  
seaboard as Floyd's path remained uncertain. Florida undertook what 
officials called its largest-ever peacetime evacuation, with tens 
of thousands of motorists making an epic, halting journey north. 
Georgia and South Carolina residents also streamed inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Mills, a 34-year-old Kennedy Space Center worker, became  
stuck in traffic, managing only 15 miles in 2 1/2 hours. He became so 
frustrated he simply turned around and returned to the Cape, where 
102 other workers had volunteered to stay behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``You made a mile every five to 10 minutes,'' he said. ``There  
were people going on the sides of the road. People were getting 
angry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney World closed early for the first time in its 28-year  
history, and other resorts also were shuttered. The Navy sent ships 
to ride out the storm at sea rather than risk damage in port, and 
military aircraft were flown inland to bases from Maine to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued pre-emptive disaster declarations for  
Florida and Georgia to enable recovery efforts to begin as quickly 
as possible. He also planned to cut short his trip to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Emergency Management Agency set up a staging area in  
Atlanta, stockpiling food, ice, water, cots, sleeping bags, 
blankets, generators, portable toilets, flashlights and plastic 
sheeting so that they could be delivered to hard-hit areas in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, hundreds of airline flights in and out of Florida and  
Georgia were canceled, and Amtrak suspended train service into and 
out of Miami, scrambling the plans of vacationers and business 
travelers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Garden City, west of Savannah, Ga., Michael Tarvin and his  
girlfriend, Robin Hill, took a break at a shopping center after 
sitting in bumper-to-bumper, three-lanes-wide traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going west, as far west as I can get,'' said Tarvin.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Ethnic Diversity Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Hispanic and Asian populations of the  
United States surged during the 1990s, the number of Hispanics 
growing by more than 35 percent and Asians more than 40 percent, 
the Census Bureau says. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Tuesday furnishes fresh evidence of increasing  
ethnic diversity and its unpredictable impact on the nation's 
political and social landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend is leading to a time when ``everybody's a minority,''  
said Vanderbilt University historian Hugh Davis Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks, whose numbers grew almost 13 percent between 1990 and  
1998, remain the nation's largest minority at 12.7 percent, or 34.4 
million of the nation's population of about 270 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics made up 9 percent of the population in 1990, and that  
grew by 1998 to just over 11 percent of the total, 30.3 million, 
the annual update of the 1990 Census said. 
</P>
<P>
	The high number of Hispanics in large Electoral College states  
such as Texas, California, Florida and New York gives the group 
substantial political clout, but the growth of Hispanics showed up 
in less expected areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four states had their Hispanic populations double -- Arkansas,  
Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina,'' said Census statistician 
Larry Sink. 
</P>
<P>
	--Arkansas' Hispanic population increased by 150 percent to  
49,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Georgia's increased by 102 percent to 220,000.  
</P>
<P>
	--Nevada's increased by 124 percent to 78,000.  
</P>
<P>
	--North Carolina's increased by 110 percent to 161,000.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hispanic population, already one of the nation's largest  
minorities, will overtake the non-Hispanic black population by the 
end of 2004, said statistician Larry Sink. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen race relations as a black-white issue,'' said  
Roderick Harrison of the Joint Center for Political and Economic 
Studies, a Washington think tank. ``Clearly, the size of the 
Hispanic population and the Asian population turns it into a 
multicultural issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian and Pacific Islander population grew in the 1990s from  
3 percent of the overall population to almost 4 percent at 10.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Nevada the Asian-Pacific Islander population increased by  
106 percent to 81,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Georgia, it increased by 95 percent to 150,000.  
</P>
<P>
	--In North Carolina, it increased by 87 percent to 100,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Dinah Choi, project director for the Asian Pacific Policy and  
Planning Council, said the rapid growth in numbers of Asians 
emphasizes a need for an accurate Census count in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's population of American Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts  
grew 14 percent to 2.4 million during the period. 
</P>
<P>
	States that already had significant populations of specific  
minorities showed less dramatic rate increases. For example, 
California increased its Hispanic population by 31 percent and its 
Asian population by 34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion in Hispanic population lets Latinos sense their  
growing political potency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very critical (presidential) race for us, and we  
will be the defining group,'' Aida Alvarez, chief of the Small 
Business Administration, said Tuesday at a rally for Vice President 
Al Gore's presidential campaign. ``The 21st century will be a 
Latino century, no doubt about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Bush, governor of Texas and the front-runner in the  
race for the Republican presidential nomination, also is targeting 
the Hispanic vote. A recent poll said he and Gore are splitting the 
Hispanic vote in Texas, but Bush trails in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican consultant David Hill of Houston warned a decade ago  
that the GOP needed to gain a bigger share of the Hispanic vote or 
lose gains made when they carved away some whites who traditionally 
voted Democratic before the Reagan era. These Democrats came to be 
known as ``Reagan Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to change the equation is for Republicans to get  
a larger share of the Hispanic vote,'' Hill said. Hispanics voted 
for President Clinton in 1996 by more than 3-1, according to exit 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic Party has always believed that one of our  
greatest strengths is the diversity of our party, and Hispanics and 
Asians have felt comfortable with Democrats,'' said Jenny Backus, a 
Democratic spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential candidates from both parties have made clear this  
year that they want the Hispanic vote, said Lisa Navarrete, 
spokeswoman for the Latino advocacy group the National Council of 
La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been experiencing something people have been  
predicting for a long time,'' she said. ``The growth has been 
amazing since the 1970s. What has really made a difference is the 
growth of the Latino communities where they normally have not 
been.''

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttles Safe After Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's space shuttles, hangars and  
launch pads all escaped serious damage Wednesday from Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	The space agency had feared that Floyd would wipe out the  
hangars and other installation if the storm came ashore with its 
140 mph winds. The NASA facilities were built to take wind of no 
more than 125 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hurricane stayed 103 miles offshore, bringing sustained  
wind of only 63 mph, with gusts of 80 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA spokesman George Diller, one of about 100 workers who  
volunteered to stay behind to ride out the storm, said a 
preliminary inspection of the buildings housing the four space 
shuttles and all the equipment for the international space station 
found no major problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's minimal, very minimal,'' he said. ``You can get this kind  
of damage in a severe thunderstorm. We're just really pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some weather-protection material came off one of the two shuttle  
launch pads, and about 30 sheets of metal siding blew off the 
525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, Diller said. Several signs 
and trees were down, and some trailers sustained minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone lines were down a few hours Tuesday night. There were  
also sporadic power outages, and NASA had trouble getting its 
high-voltage systems back on line. 
</P>
<P>
	At the nearby Cape Canaveral Air Station, all four rockets that  
were left on their launch pads during the storm were said to be 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA plans to reopen the space center Thursday morning. The  
center's approximately 12,500 workers were evacuated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The space agency was unable to move the $2 billion-a-piece  
shuttles to a safer location earlier in the week because it does 
not have enough modified jumbo jets to transport all four 
spaceships. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the two 747s are kept out West and it takes a full  
day to prepare a shuttle for the piggyback ride. Also, there cannot 
be any rain or excessive wind during the flight; water would damage 
the fragile shuttle tiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttles are transported across country atop the jets on the  
rare occasion the spaceship lands in California or when it needs to 
go from Cape Canaveral to California for a periodic tune-up.

<HEADLINE> UAW, Auto Makers in Intensive Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Amid signs that a deal could be  
imminent, negotiators for the major car companies and the United 
Auto Workers held intensive talks Wednesday after the union granted 
an open-ended extension to contracts that cover 407,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks at DaimlerChrysler's U.S. headquarters went from Tuesday  
morning into Wednesday night, with breaks at noon and for dinner. 
Neither side would comment, but the marathon session was taken as a 
sign a deal could be close. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has emerged as the lead company for the UAW to  
negotiate a replacement for three-year contracts. Talks between 
subcommittees of the union and General Motors Corp. continued 
Wednesday evening, GM spokesman Edd Snyder said. Negotiations at 
Ford Motor Co. recessed Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The union granted the three companies an indefinite extension of  
its three-year contract, which was to expire at midnight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While marathon talks are a traditional sign of progress, there  
also were signs of strain between the union and DaimlerChrysler. 
National negotiators, including UAW President Stephen P. Yokich, 
were meeting at DaimlerChrysler headquarters when workers at five 
plants in Missouri and Indiana staged a brief walkout Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Eaton, DaimlerChrysler's co-chairman, said he expected  
workers at those plants would remain on the job as negotiations 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokesman David Barnas said the union has not  
told the German-American automaker the reason for the walkouts. 
Union officials did not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the union has extended contracts past the deadline.  
It has not called a national strike during contract negotiations 
since 1976, although it has used plant-level strikes. Experts have 
said a national strike, which would threaten a boom year for the 
auto industry, seems unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW usually chooses one automaker to make a deal with first,  
then uses that deal as a template for other contracts. This year, 
Yokich has kept talks going with both GM and DaimlerChrysler and 
refused to publicly name a target. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages, job security, health care costs, overtime demands and the  
assignment of work to outside suppliers were expected to be among 
the top issues in this year's talks, as they were during the last 
round in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of  
record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more 
than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999.

<HEADLINE> States, Cities Predict Web Tax Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They may be awash in surpluses now, but state  
and local officials say they will eventually need to collect sales 
taxes on billions of dollars in Internet transactions to avoid 
serious erosion in services such as schools and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Local government and state government cannot operate on an  
empty tank,'' Randy Johnson, Republican chairman of the Hennepin, 
Minn., County Board, told the federal Advisory Commission on 
Electronic Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	If Internet sales reach $100 billion by 2003, an estimated $4  
billion in sales tax would go uncollected because no system exists 
to do so, said Harley Duncan, director of the Federation of Tax 
Administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is of profound importance to the states,'' Duncan told  
the 19-member commission, created by Congress to recommend by April 
a national tax policy for the burgeoning electronic marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents, however, say a new tax would slow Internet commerce.  
They say the economic boom has left the 50 states with a combined 
$36 billion surplus in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a problem now and I don't believe it's going to be a  
problem in the future,'' said Dean Andal, a commission member and 
Republican chairman of the California Board of Equalization. ``If 
you look at state tax revenues now, it's boom time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales taxes are the single largest source of revenue for most  
states and local governments, amounting to $147 billion in 1997. 
But under a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision known as Quill, a 
state cannot collect taxes from companies operating outside its 
boundaries unless the company has some physical presence in that 
state, such as a store or warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that case involved mail-order sales, it has been  
interpreted to apply also to Internet transactions. Whether that 
decision should stand is perhaps the question facing the commission 
and ultimately Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Abolishing the Quill standards, say supporters, would protect  
state revenues and ensure that traditional ``brick and mortar'' 
merchants and Internet companies face the same tax-compliance 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also force creation of a simpler collection system --  
perhaps even a single national tax rate, or at least one per state. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress, however, has defeated multiple attempts to override  
the Quill ruling. Apart from worries about the cost of taxing 
Internet sales, some say it would invade privacy as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is simply too complex,'' said Jim Eads, a partner at the  
Ernst &AMP; Young accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is sharply divided on the sales tax question but  
did vote unanimously Wednesday to invite submission of detailed 
proposals on whether the system can be modified to collect taxes 
from out-of-state Internet, catalog or telephone sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Gov. Mike Leavitt, R-Utah, requires that any  
such tax plans focus on simplifying the current system, impose no 
new taxes, protect taxpayer privacy and acknowledge states' rights, 
among other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to figure out if there is a workable solution,''  
Leavitt said. ``We're not presupposing what should be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also voted to support the Clinton administration's  
position that international trade tariffs should not be permitted 
on electronic transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission meets in December in San Francisco to examine any  
sales tax reforms that are submitted and to discuss international 
tax implications of Internet commerce.

<HEADLINE> US West Plans Cheaper Web Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U S West Corp. is targeting a wider audience  
with a cheaper, dial-up version of the high-speed Internet 
connection known as DSL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baby Bell phone company for the Rocky Mountains and Pacific  
Northwest announced today that MegaBit Select is being introduced 
in 14 western states after a trial run in four cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthly charge of $19.95 is $10 less than what U S West  
charges in its territory for a continuously live Web connection via 
DSL, which is an abbreviation for digital subscriber line. In other 
parts of the country, ``always-on'' DSL service typically costs $50 
or more per month. 
</P>
<P>
	DSL users still need to pay a separate monthly fee, generally  
ranging from $10 to $22, to an Internet service provider such as 
America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	``MegaBit Select will dramatically accelerate the use of  
high-speed Internet services by mass market consumers,'' said Joe 
Zell, president of U S West's !nterprise Networking unit. 
</P>
<P>
	DSL allows people to access the Internet at speeds five times  
faster than the fastest dial-up modem installed on most desktop and 
laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the MegaBit Select dial-up version doesn't provide a  
continuous connection to the Internet, there is no limit on access 
time, said U S West spokesman Garth Neuffer. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is available immediately in more than 40 Western  
cities, including Denver, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Salt Lake City. 
It will be available in other parts of U S West's 14-state 
territory next month, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Kimeses Indicted on Murder Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A mother and son held on murder charges in  
New York in the disappearance of a wealthy widow have been formally 
charged in the Los Angeles slaying of one of their business 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
	A felony complaint and arrest warrant filed Aug. 18 in Los  
Angeles Municipal Court and unsealed Wednesday accuses Sante Kimes, 
64, and her son, Kenneth Kimes, 23, with the murder of David 
Kazdin. The pair remained jailed in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge carries a possible death sentence, District Attorney  
spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said Wednesday. Authorities do not expect 
to bring the mother and son to Los Angeles before the New York case 
is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the Kimeses' lawyers said they were unaware of the  
complaint, which alleges that Kenneth Kimes ``personally and 
intentionally'' shot Kazdin to death in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazdin, 63, was found dead March 14, 1998, his body dumped into  
a trash bin. The felony complaint alleges the Kimeses killed Kazdin 
``for financial gain'' but did not give specifics of the motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Jose Muniz said the Los Angeles Police Department  
says it has one witness who says he helped dump the body. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our knowledge, they don't have any forensics tying Kenneth  
to the murder,'' Muniz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kimeses were arrested in New York on July 5, 1998, on a Utah  
warrant alleging that they wrote a bad $14,000 check to buy a 
Lincoln Town Car. In the meantime, police learned that the Kimeses' 
landlady had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother and son became suspects in the disappearance of the  
landlady, wealthy widow Irene Silverman, 82, after police found 
Mrs. Silverman's personal and financial documents in the Kimeses' 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also found a forged deed that purported to transfer Mrs.  
Silverman's Upper East Side mansion to the Kimeses for a fraction 
of its $4 million-plus worth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the car, police found loaded .9-mm and .22-caliber pistols,  
several wigs and masks, plastic handcuffs, $30,000 in cash, an 
empty stun gun box, a pink liquid similar to a known ``date rape'' 
drug, and cassettes of Mrs. Silverman's telephone conversations -- 
apparently taken from wire taps. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair also are suspected in the 1996 disappearance of a  
banker in the Bahamas and the disappearance of a drifter who was 
working with the Kimeses and vanished around the time the Kazdin 
was killed.

<HEADLINE> Favre Said Ready for Lions Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Although a week of rest would probably do  
him good, Brett Favre and his battered throwing hand will be ready 
for Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre said he has ``seen dramatic improvement'' in the condition  
of his hand, which has a sprained thumb and a muscle bruise after 
collisions during the preseason and in the Green Bay Packers' 28-24 
win over the Oakland Raiders last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time most valuable player doesn't plan on throwing a  
football until Friday, but said his streak of 110 consecutive 
starts won't be broken this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing with injuries is part of the game,'' Favre said.  
``More than likely, the remainder of the season it'll bother me one 
way or another. I'm ready for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre hit his hand on Russell Maryland's helmet in the third  
quarter of Green Bay's win over Oakland. He recovered to lead two 
fourth-quarter scoring drives, including an 11-play, 82-yard 
masterpiece in the final 1:51 for the winning points. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered a sprained thumb during the preseason, and that  
injury still lingers. Favre also has a bruise and several scrapes 
on the hand, which was black-and-blue on Monday but now looks 
almost normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre doesn't expect to have the hand drained or to take a  
pain-killing shot, either. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback said that although a week off likely would help  
the hand heal more quickly, he wouldn't miss a game. With seven 
more starts he will pass Ron Jaworski for the longest starting 
streak by a quarterback in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I took a week off, it probably would feel a lot better, but  
as long as I can keep slinging it, and not hurt my team, I feel 
like I can play,'' Favre said. ``They know well enough by now that 
I'm not going to come out unless I absolutely have to.''

<HEADLINE> Atlantic City Casino Workers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Raucous demonstrators from the ranks  
of 14,000 striking hotel workers greeted early morning visitors to 
Atlantic City casinos today. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Local 54 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees  
International walked off the job at nine casino hotels today after 
their five-year contract expired at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members reached agreements at three other casinos before  
the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the targets of the strike is the Trump Taj Mahal. At the  
entrance this morning, about 100 union members jeered people 
attempting to drive into parking areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go to Showboat! Go to Showboat,'' they yelled, because  
representatives for Showboat Hotel Casino representatives had 
agreed on a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the affected casinos vowed to remain open during  
the walkout, though they said they would have to close some of 
their restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartenders, banquet waiters, cocktail servers, maids, maitre  
d's, cooks and other rank-and-file workers began to disappear as 
the deadline passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropicana Casino Resort said today that four of its seven  
restaurants were closed, with management and non-union workers 
running the other three. The hotel said it also reduced some guest 
services, providing room cleaning and linen changes only on 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropicana spokeswoman Maureen Siman said the resort had ``a  
couple of canceled reservations,'' but they were because of bad 
weather, not the strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashiers and dealers are not unionized and are not participating  
in the work stoppage. The casinos employ between 40,000 and 50,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of contract talks Tuesday set the stage for a  
disruptive strike that also could inconvenience contestants and 
fans of the Miss America Pageant, scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials said members are satisfied with the terms of the  
resorts' latest contract offer, but they demand additionally that 
bosses stop hiring subcontractors who do not pay union wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Union president Bob McDevitt said the casinos failed to live up  
to the promises made when casino gambling was pitched to New Jersey 
voters in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcontracting ``will erode the community and it will make it  
difficult in the Atlantic City area for workers to feed their 
families in the way that was promised by the casino industry,'' 
McDevitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers were striking against the Atlantic City Hilton,  
Tropicana Casino Resort, Bally's Park Place, Caesars Atlantic City 
Hotel Casino, the Sands Hotel Casino, Resorts Atlantic City, Trump 
Plaza, Trump Marina and Trump Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying signs, rowdy union members set up picket lines at  
casino entrances and rallied on the Boardwalk shouting ``No 
contract, no peace'' and ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, subcontracting must 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pickets were orderly, and no major incidents had been  
reported as of midmorning, police Sgt. Michael Tullio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union negotiators came to terms with representatives of Harrah's  
Casino Hotel, Showboat Hotel Casino and the Claridge Casino Hotel 
about 90 minutes before the midnight deadline.

<HEADLINE> Owners Balk at Okaying Royals Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- When it came time to vote on Miles  
Prentice's bid to purchase the Kansas City Royals, baseball owners 
balked Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of giving the team a real live owner for the first time  
since 1993, baseball voted 29-1 to table consideration of the $75 
million deal, saying baseball economics were too uncertain for 
small-market teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hopeful we would be approved,'' Prentice said after  
listening to commissioner Bud Selig announce the decision. ``We 
were not rejected. They did not turn us down. That's the important 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, 57, has owned the Midland RockHounds of the Double-A  
Texas League since 1990 and headed a group of more than 40 
investors willing to buy the team and keep it in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the death of founding owner Ewing Kauffman in 1993,  
the team wound up being owned by the Greater Kansas City Community 
Foundation and Affiliated Trusts, which must sell it by June 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past four months, some baseball officials said privately  
they were concerned Prentice's group did not have enough money to 
operate the team. Others said they worried it had too many 
investors, making it unwieldy to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Selig said consideration would be put off until  
after baseball's latest economic study committee makes its report, 
with only the Royals' dissenting. While Selig said he expected the 
report in about three months, baseball often fails to meet its own 
deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardships of baseball economics is making all our  
decisions when it comes to franchises,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one of the 30 controlling owners have entered the game  
since the start of 1992, an unprecedented turnover. Baseball has 
resisted moving franchises since the Washington Senators became the 
Texas Rangers after the 1971 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moving franchises was a solution in the '40s, '50s and '60s,''  
Selig said. ``Today it merely switches problems from one area to 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also are few options for teams wishing to move. Charlotte,  
N.C., hasn't indicated a willingness to fund a stadium, and any 
team wanting to move to northern Virginia would face a court fight 
from Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig shrugged off talk of contraction, an idea discussed by  
Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris, saying it hadn't been given 
serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, wearing a red necktie with images of baseballs on it,  
said he remained optimistic, focusing on Selig's hopeful comments 
and doing his best to overlook the remarks about the viability of 
small-market teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is committed to keeping the Royals in Kansas City,''  
Prentice said.

<HEADLINE> Fatal Shootings in Texas Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A man dressed in black walked into a  
teen-age church service Wednesday night, pulled a gun and began 
shooting people, some of them fatally. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire department spokesman Tony Rodriguez said some people died  
inside the Baptist church, but the number was unknown. Early 
reports from other fire officials said as many as six were dead, 
but that has not been confirmed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight victims were brought to three area hospitals, Rodriguez  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they believed the shooter was dead, and a witness  
said he shot himself in a church pew. 
</P>
<P>
	Five ambulances were sent to Wedgwood Baptist Church after the 7  
p.m. shooting. Medical helicopters also went to the scene in the 
southwest corner of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 young people were inside the sanctuary when the  
shooting began, said Dax Hughes, the church's college minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hits the door real hard to make his presence known and he  
just immediately started firing,'' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very calm and looked normal and was smoking a  
cigarette,'' witness Christy Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 17, told KDFW-TV she thought about 15 people had been  
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	When the gunfire was over, Hughes said, the man ``sat in the  
back pew and put a gun (to his head) and shot himself and fell 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Applegate, a seventh grader, said he was in choir practice  
when the gunman burst into the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were singing a song and then in the middle of the song this  
guy opened the door and fired one shot,'' he said. ``He just kept 
telling us to stay still. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all just jumped under the benches and he fired about 10  
more shots. ... Somebody said, 'Run, run,'' and we all started 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man reloaded several times during the rampage.  
</P>
<P>
	Police herded reporters and bystanders to an elementary school  
across the street because possible explosives had been found by the 
bomb squad.

<HEADLINE> Bahamians Assess Post-Floyd Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Residents and tourists ventured into  
debris-strewn streets today after Hurricane Floyd clobbered the 
Bahamas, washing ashore two barges and flinging trees onto streets 
and highways. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge storm toppled utility poles, ripped roofs off homes and  
pushed a roiling sea into streets Tuesday on the islands east of 
Florida before heading toward the southeastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	No deaths were reported, although officials had yet to contact  
outlying islands because telephone lines were down, police 
Superintendent Conrad Sweeting said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is that there is a lot of coastal damage and  
structural damage to homes in New Providence and Grand Bahama,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At an emergency session of Parliament, Prime Minister Hubert  
Ingraham said he was flying to Cat and San Salvador islands and 
other officials were headed to Eleuthera and Abaco. Floyd's winds 
reached 110 mph on Eleuthera, San Salvador and Cat islands, and 
damage was feared to be extensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Mackie, operations director of JAMZ radio in Freeport, on  
the western end of Grand Bahama Island, said some areas were 
flooded and stranded residents had to be rescued in boats. Cars 
were floating in one neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, on New Providence Island, major hotels were spared  
significant damage. Many tourists, tired of a storm whose winds 
began Monday night and didn't stop until early today, anxiously 
awaited word on when the airport would reopen. Downed utility poles 
and dangling wires slowed traffic to a crawl on many Nassau 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprawling Atlantis resort in Paradise Island reported only  
minor damage and said none of its 2,000 guests or 500 workers were 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow, this is amazing,'' Andreas Appleby, 23, of Raleigh, N.C.,  
said while surveying the havoc wreaked in Nassau. ``I can't believe 
all of this damage was caused by one storm!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trees blocked the main highway linking the eastern and central  
parts of New Providence, and two barges were washed ashore near a 
busy street. There were reports of flooding up to 3 feet high in 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people, including one who fell off a roof, were being  
treated for minor injuries, ZNF government radio reported. Bahamas 
Defense Force personnel reported for duty today to help any relief 
and rescue operations. The U.S. Coast Guard said it was ready to 
respond to search and rescue requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Under brightly sunny skies, Nassau residents inspected smashed  
boats that had been beached. Workers shoveled three feet of sand 
from inside the bar at the Cocktails and Dreams nightclub, where a 
100-foot freighter, the Caribe 1, was beached outside.

<HEADLINE> Senators Rally For Farm Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flanked by dozens of farmers from across the  
country, Democratic senators demanded that Congress pass emergency 
farm relief and overhaul the Freedom to Farm Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Congress cannot leave without acting on agriculture,''  
said Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. ``We cannot 
afford to wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Senate passed $7.4 billion in emergency aid to  
help keep struggling farmers in business. But the legislation still 
has not made it out of a Senate-House conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the senators, Democrat Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, later  
went on the Senate floor and talked about the farm crisis for 
several hours, tying up business to focus attention on the issue. 
Spokesman Jim Farrell said Wellstone would continue to do so in 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said that during a trip back home, a boy had told him he  
wanted to become a farmer but his father would not let him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is more than just about price,'' Daschle said. ``This is  
about a way of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers and children stood behind the senators, some holding  
signs that said, ``Save Our Family Farms.'' Julie Baker, who 
described herself as a Missouri farm wife, said, ``We have totally 
hit rock-bottom in the countryside right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats blame the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, which overhauled  
farm subsidy programs going back to the Great Depression. The 
federal government still subsidizes farmers, but no longer 
guarantees a minimum price for their crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get rid of the most noxious weed populating America  
-- it's called the Freedom to Farm Act,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa. Harkin also called on Congress to pass legislation 
sponsored by Wellstone imposing a moratorium on agribusiness 
mergers and acquisitions.

	Consumer Prices Rise 0.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in August as  
gasoline and other energy products shot up for a second straight 
month. But elsewhere inflation remained a no-show with clothing 
prices down for a fourth straight month and airline fares 
retreating after a big jump in July. The Labor Department said 
today the August increase in its Consumer Price Index -- the most 
closely watched inflation gauge -- matched the 0.3 percent July 
advance. Two-thirds of the August price increase was attributed to 
a 2.7 percent surge in energy costs. Food costs rose a much more 
modest 0.2 percent. 

</P>
<P>
	Business Inventories Rise 0.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department said that inventories  
held by businesses on shelves and backlots rose by 0.3 percent in 
July while business sales rose at an even faster 0.4 percent clip. 
That left the ratio of inventories to sales at a record low of 1.34 
months, meaning it would take that length of time to exhaust 
supplies at the current sales pace. 

</P>

But technology shares lost ground, giving up some of Tuesday's 
sharp gains. Just before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial 
average was up 25.96 at 10,936.29. Broader stock indicators were 
mixed, with the Nasdaq composite index down 22.00 at 2,846.29 after

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Motorola Inc. made a bold bet today on the  
future of cable television, announcing it had agreed to pay about 
$11 billion in stock for General Instrument Corp., the largest 
producer of cable TV set-top boxes. General Instrument's set-top 
box operations dominate one of the key technologies that is 
revolutionizing home entertainment. With the new equipment 
available today, the televisions of tomorrow can offer many more 
``broadband'' cable services, including Internet access, 
interactive video games and telephone services.

	DaimlerChrysler Has Big Tech Plans  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler plans to invest more  
than $49 billion by 2001 to develop new technologies that would set 
it apart in the fiercely competitive auto market, the co-chairmen 
of the company said today. The German-American automaker plans to 
introduce 64 new passenger car and commercial vehicle models 
worldwide before the year 2004, co-chairmen Robert Eaton and 
Juergen Schrempp said at a news conference at the Frankfurt 
International Motor Show. The company revised upwards its full-year 
sales projection to $155 billion from $148 billion on the basis of 
increased sales in the first eight months of the year.

<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers and  
DaimlerChrysler AG kept talking today after an all-night session as 
the union granted an open-ended extension to automakers' contracts 
that cover 407,000 workers. While there was no word on progress 
from the union or DaimlerChrysler, the continuing talks were a sign 
that a deal could be imminent. However, there also were signs of 
strain between the union and DaimlerChrysler. National negotiators, 
including UAW President Stephen P. Yokich, were meeting at 
DaimlerChrysler headquarters when workers at five plants in 
Missouri and Indiana staged a brief walkout last night.

	Heinz, Bestfoods May Merge

	NEW YORK (AP) -- H.J. Heinz Co., the maker of Heinz Ketchup, and  
Bestfoods, the maker of Hellman's mayonnaise, are negotiating a 
deal that would create the nation's second biggest food company, 
The Wall Street Journal reported today. The proposed transaction, 
which may be a merger rather than an acquisition, would combine 
Pittsburgh-based Heinz, which has annual sales of $9.3 billion, 
with Bestfoods, of Englewood, N.J., to form a company with annual 
sales of nearly $15 billion. The merger would create the third 
largest food company in the world behind Europe's Nestle SA, with 
$52 billion in sales, and U.S.-based Kraft Foods, with $27 billion, 
the newspaper reported.

U.S. interest-rate hike. Hong Kong stocks plunged as 
higher-than-expected U.S. retail sales data sparked concerns that 
the U.S. Federal Reserve might increase interest rate to dampen 
inflationary pressure before the end of the year. The Hang Seng 
Index shed 373.43 points, or 2.7 percent, closing at 13,430.60.

<HEADLINE> E. coli Outbreak Sickens 313 in Ill. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The number of people with symptoms  
linked to an Illinois E. coli outbreak has reached 313, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two people have been hospitalized. One remained in  
critical condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those with symptoms, 44 have been tested and confirmed as  
having E. coli, the state Public Health Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the people apparently were exposed to the bacteria at a  
party held Labor Day weekend in a cow pasture near Petersburg, 
about 25 miles northwest of Springfield. About 1,800 people 
attended the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The source of the E. coli contamination is still unknown. The  
health department has conducted more than 600 interviews so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people who contract this strain of E. coli experience  
intense cramps and bloody diarrhea. In severe cases, it can destroy 
red blood cells and interfere with kidney function.

<HEADLINE> At 70, Bo Diddley Still Rockin' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Bo Diddley's greatest claim to fame  
may not be his induction into the Rock and Roll of Fame, nor his 
star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, nor his lifetime achievement 
award from the Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a Nike commercial.  
</P>
<P>
	Already a rock and blues icon, Diddley entered the American  
consciousness after a 1989 ``Bo Knows'' commercial for Nike. 
Commenting on football and baseball star Bo Jackson's guitar 
skills, Bo Diddley turned to the camera and said, ``He don't know 
Diddley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never could figure out what it had to do with shoes, but it  
worked,'' Diddley says. ``I got into a lot of new front rooms on 
the tube. I thank Nike and Bo Jackson for doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this 70-year-old rocker, famous for his innovative use of  
rhythm, his square homemade guitar, dark glasses and black hat, has 
not reaped the financial rewards to go along with his music awards. 
</P>
<P>
	While Diddley appreciates the honors, ``it didn't put no figures  
in my checkbook,'' he says angrily. 
</P>
<P>
	The need for money and not just a love of music keeps him  
constantly on the road, playing county fairs, small casinos, 
private parties and music halls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ain't got no money, ain't nobody calls you honey,'' he  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland  
in 1987, followed by the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1989, and 
received his lifetime achievement award from the Grammys in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just told people they thought enough of Bo Diddley for me  
to be honored by putting my name on something, which as really 
great. But it didn't put no bucks in my kitty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diddley says he only received a small portion of the money he  
should have made during his career. Like other artists of his 
generation, he was paid a flat fee for his recordings and received 
no royalty payments on record sales. He also says he was never paid 
for many of his performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am owed. I've never got paid,'' he says. ``A dude with a  
pencil is worse than a cat with a machine gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, he claimed to be $300,000 in debt and was paying for a  
large home in Hawthorne, about 20 miles outside Gainesville. He 
later divorced and moved to a secluded area outside Bronson, about 
40 miles to the west. ``My kids were deprived of going to 
college,'' he says. ``The money I was making wasn't enough to send 
them somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Touring at his age doesn't trouble him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy ain't nothing but a damn number,'' he says. ``I'm  
writing and creating new stuff and putting together new different 
things. Trying to stay out there and roll with the punches. I ain't 
quit yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Ellas Bates on Dec. 30, 1928, in McComb, Miss., Diddley was  
later adopted by his mother's cousin and took on the name Ellas 
McDaniel, which his new wife, Sylvia, still calls him. 
</P>
<P>
	His family moved to Chicago when he was 5. He took violin  
lessons at the Ebenezer Baptist Church and learned guitar at age 
10, when he began playing on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
	The name Bo Diddley came from other youngsters.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where the kids got it, but the kids in grammar  
school gave me that name,'' he says. He liked it and made it his 
stage name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diddley -- that word has been around for a long, long time.  
When I was a kid, my mother used to say, `You don't know diddley 
squat.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Diddley was playing Chicago's Maxwell Street in his early teens.  
</P>
<P>
	He was signed to the Chess and Checkers record labels in 1955.  
His first single, ``Bo Diddley,'' went to No. 2 on the rhythm and 
blues charts. 
</P>
<P>
	``His Chess recordings stand among the best singular recordings  
of the 20th century,'' said Howard Kramer, assistant curator of the 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Diddley saidhe had no musical influences growing up. ``I don't  
like to copy anybody. Everybody tries to do what I do, update it. I 
don't have any idols I copied after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many artists, including the Rolling Stones, the Who, Bruce  
Springsteen, Buddy Holly, George Michael and Elvis Costello copied 
Diddley's style. 
</P>
<P>
	``They copied everything I did, upgraded it, messed it up. It  
seems to me that nobody can come up with their own thing, they have 
to put a little bit of Bo Diddley there,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Diddley was a pioneer of the electric guitar, adding reverb and  
tremolo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He treats it like it was a drum, very rhythmic,'' said E.  
Michael Harrington, music theory and composition professor at 
Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite his technique and talent, Diddley said disc jockeys  
in the early 1950s called his work ``jungle music.'' It wasn't 
until the pioneering disc jockey Alan Freed came up with the term 
``rock and roll'' that Diddley's music found a home on mainstream 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Diddley said Freed was talking about him, recalling Freed's  
introduction before an Apollo Theater concert: ``Here is a man with 
an original sound, who is going to rock and roll you right out of 
your seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diddley's major hits included, ``Say Man,'' ``You Can't Judge a  
Book By It's Cover,'' ``I'm A Man,'' ``Shave and a Haircut,'' 
``Uncle John'' and ``The Mule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out of school and made something out of myself,'' he  
said. ``I am known all over the globe, all over the world. There 
are guys who have done a lot of things that don't have the same 
impact that I had.''

<HEADLINE> Finders Happy About Keep They Kept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RINGGOLD, Ga. (AP) -- Almost 20 months after Kathy Fulton found  
two plastic bags stuffed with $279,000 in her driveway, a judge has 
ruled she and her husband can keep 40 percent of it. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the Fultons get $111,616.  
</P>
<P>
	No, wait! Their attorneys get a one-third contingency fee, so  
that leaves $74,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Oops! Don't forget Uncle Sam. After federal taxes are taken out,  
the couple will have about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their chiseled share, the Fultons couldn't be happier,  
said their lead attorney, James McKoon. He said they plan to use it 
to help pay off their home mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to say our clients are extremely pleased  
with the settlement and that the case was resolved amicably without 
a trial,'' McKoon said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Harold L. Murphy in Rome, Ga., agreed  
to the settlement on July 16, less than two weeks after dismissing 
a claim by the Fultons' neighbor, who said the money had been 
stolen from his truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, placed in an interest-bearing account that grew to  
$321,000 over nearly two years, was split three ways: 40 percent to 
Catoosa County, 40 percent to the Fultons and 20 percent to the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fulton found the cash in December 1997. She ran over the  
bags on her driveway while taking her children to school and 
thought they contained coffee that fell from her husband's car.

<HEADLINE> Parts of Bell Networks Ordered Open </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Revising part of its market-opening rules,  
federal regulators decided Wednesday that major local telephone 
companies must still make available to rivals certain pieces of 
their networks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Federal Communications Commission also granted the  
carriers -- including the regional Bell companies and GTE -- some 
relief by placing limits on what they are required to share and 
excluding equipment used for high-speed Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 5-0 vote, the FCC said Bell companies must continue to make  
available six items, including the wires that run from local phone 
company offices to homes and businesses. These are the most crucial 
network elements because they would be very expensive to duplicate. 
Bells must also provide a device that connects the lines to wiring 
inside customers homes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission determined that the Bell companies don't need  
to hand over operator and directory assistance services, since 
competitors could get those from other sources, such as third-party 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also declined to force the Bells and GTE to lease  
competitors equipment used for high-speed Internet services, like 
devices in central telephone offices that act as the counterparts 
to home modems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to regulate just for regulation's sake,''  
said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. ``We're taking a lighter touch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major local phone companies gave the plan mixed reviews. While  
pleased they would not have to make available their advanced 
services equipment, some said the FCC didn't go far enough to 
reduce their burdens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FCC has taken only baby steps in the direction of  
deregulation,'' said Alan Ciamporcero, GTE's vice president of 
federal regulatory affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When competitors have already shown they can invest in new  
facilities, federal regulation shouldn't encourage them to 
piggyback on the facilities of others,'' said U S West spokesman 
David Fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance companies and upstarts supported the portions of  
the ruling that would enable them to get into the local phone 
market without having to build their own facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	But MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T said their efforts to roll out data  
services -- particularly to underserved and rural areas -- might be 
hampered because of the FCC's decision not to make available 
advanced equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said he hoped the ruling would do just the opposite, by  
giving both incumbent and new companies an incentive to invest in 
advanced services and get them out more quickly to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see high-speed Internet access in every home ...  
soon,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC originally developed a list of items -- which did not  
include advanced services -- that local companies had to make 
available in 1996. The Supreme Court eventually sent the rules back 
to the commission, saying the FCC did not adequately consider 
whether competitors could obtain the pieces from another source.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Charges Frankel with Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Rogue financier Martin Frankel and  
unidentified associates have been charged with stealing more than 
$18 million from a Tennessee insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Connecticut money manager already faces federal charges of  
embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars from insurance companies 
in five states and a Catholic charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel fled the United States in May. He was caught this month  
in Germany and is fighting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	A complaint was filed Friday in Williamson County General  
Sessions Court by James Prange, an investigator for Tennessee 
Attorney General Paul Summers. It claims Frankel and unidentified 
accomplices ``devised and executed a scheme to acquire and control 
over $18,160,000 from the Franklin American Life Insurance Co.,'' 
The Review Appeal of Franklin reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prange said Frankel and the others claimed they invested the  
money but ``diverted the monies into various accounts under his 
control and for his own use, and the use of others ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Court Judicial Commissioner Jeri Brady charged Frankel with  
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	No date was set for Frankel's preliminary hearing and District  
Attorney General Ronald L. Davis said today ``it's anybody's guess 
at this point'' as to whether he will actually be tried in 
Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just trying to get our dibs on him,'' Davis said.  
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed against the others mentioned in the  
complaint and Davis declined to say who they might be. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel's unlicensed brokerage siphoned at least  
$218 million from insurers in Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, 
Oklahoma and Missouri. A lawsuit filed by some of the companies 
puts the loss at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Franklin American executives in Tennessee have been sued by  
the state of Arkansas, which says they transferred $5.28 million of 
an Arkansas insurance company's assets to an account accessible by 
Frankel.

	``Til The Medicine Takes'' (Capricorn Records) -- Widespread  
Panic 

</P>
<P>
	Coming out of the same college town that produced R.E.M. and the  
B-52s, Widespread Panic has built a devoted following by emulating 
a West Coast band also known for extended jams, both live and in 
the studio, and experimental stylings. 
</P>
<P>
	But on ``Til the Medicine Takes,'' the band once hailed as the  
next Grateful Dead refocuses itself and its songs to make itself 
more appealing to pop audiences already familiar with its Athens, 
Ga. brethren -- with frustratingly mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake, the sound -- a cross between the Southern rock  
of the 1970s and psychedelia of the '60s -- will be familiar to 
longtime ``Spreadheads.'' But while each tune is shortened to 
manageable lengths, the album is certainly no hit-single factory. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not necessarily a bad thing, as shown on ``Climb to  
Safety.'' With its harmony, power-chord hook and ragged electric 
piano, the pulsating tale of a scary train ride is the closest 
Widespread Panic can come to even approaching a Top 40 sound while 
retaining its distinctive style. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an attempt to become more approachable by listeners at  
large, the band brings in some outside help, including veteran 
producer John Keane and The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, and there is 
just a sense of something getting lost in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	At least Widespread Panic can't be faulted for trying something  
new. How many 10-minute jams can you listen to on record, anyway? 
</P>

<P>
	``Rough Harvest'' (Mercury Records) -- John Mellencamp  

</P>
<P>
	Call this John Mellencamp's attempt at an ``Unplugged'' album.  
``Rough Harvest'' appears on the surface to be a throwaway project 
and an attempt to cash in on the craze started by the 
acoustic-style MTV performance show. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead, the record gives new depths to the work of one of  
the most prolific artists of the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Using stripped-down arrangements, Mellencamp revisits some of  
the best songs of the latter stages of his career, with the few 
years he's added also giving needed depth to such socially 
challenging songs as ``Love and Happiness'' and ``Jackie Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the gravel in his voice -- the result of a lot of hard  
touring and even harder living in his early days -- doesn't do any 
harm to ``Minutes to Memories,'' a tale of an old man telling his 
life story on a bus ride through the Midwest, or ``Human Wheels,'' 
which gets a dose of humanity missing in the original studio 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	The liner notes say this is the kind of music Mellencamp and his  
crack band play when they just want to play music. Perhaps they 
should play this way all the time.

<HEADLINE> End of Marge Schott Reign at Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- From her first moments as owner of a major  
league team, Marge Schott made it clear she would do things her 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott made her grand entrance as the new Cincinnati Reds owner  
on Dec. 21, 1984 by letting her St. Bernard lead the way into a 
crowded meeting room at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who else would walk in with a dog?'' she proudly asked  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Who else? That question would be asked again and again during  
Schott's 15-year reign as owner of baseball's first professional 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Who else would chase away the team's scouts, complaining that  
all they do is watch baseball games? 
</P>
<P>
	Who else would refer to her general managers dismissively as  
``whatchamadoodle'' and show little interest in learning the names 
of her players? 
</P>
<P>
	Who else would make her dogs the center of attention, allowing  
them the run of the field and the offices? 
</P>
<P>
	Who else would stubbornly refuse to curb her inflammatory  
comments, even after a suspension? 
</P>
<P>
	Only Marge Schott. And now, with baseball owners approving her  
sale to three limited partners Wednesday, the end of her 
news-making reign is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she understood a lot of things,'' said Bob  
Howsam, who turned the club over to Schott. ``She thought she 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howsam, who built the Big Red Machine of the 1970s, knew Schott  
from social occasions when she made an offer to buy the team from 
William and James Williams in 1984. At the time, she was known as a 
wealthy widow who made campy commercials for her car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
	She calmed fears about her lack of baseball expertise by saying  
she'd leave decisions to those in the know. Howsam took her at her 
word and lobbied baseball to approve the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott got the team. Howsam got a surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out to be the worst thing I think I've ever done in  
baseball,'' Howsam said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans and the local media initially embraced the change from the  
publicity-shy Williams brothers to the front-and-center Schott. But 
right away, she dropped hints that things would work out much 
differently than everyone expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're private because they're smart,'' she said of the  
previous owners. ``I'm public because I'm dumb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howsam retired as planned in 1985 and Schott moved into his  
office, dogs in tow. By that time, Howsam had gotten a glimpse of 
the problems ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	He heard her coarse language. He learned how little she thought  
of the farm system. He got in her doghouse by telling reporters the 
team was making money while she claimed it was losing millions. 
</P>
<P>
	He was taken aback when Schott rejected his offers to help her  
understand her new endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her I would sit down and show her how baseball  
accounting was,'' Howsam said. ``She said she didn't need any help. 
That was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within two years, Schott had taken tight control of the team.  
Any purchase of $50 or more had to be approved by her. She got 
involved in player moves. She fought the team's limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
	She was becoming a different type of owner than anyone  
anticipated, and she made no apologies for her roughshod style. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never had a hands-on management before,'' she said. ``You  
have to have that to keep track of what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her methods alienated employees and resulted in an exodus of  
front-office officials and farm system personnel. The team's 
limited partners challenged Schott, hoping to rein her in and, 
ultimately, get her out. She survived the challenge and became more 
intractable. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, those festering problems remained a secondary  
matter while manager Pete Rose led the team to four consecutive 
second-place finishes. Schott was content letting Rose get most of 
the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he was banned for life for gambling in 1989, Schott assumed  
a higher profile. She made her St. Bernard the focal point in 1990, 
rubbing dog hair on manager Lou Piniella for good luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Her team won the World Series with a homegrown roster that was  
in the pipeline before she began slashing the farm system. It was 
her finest moment as owner and brought her a lot of attention, but 
not enough to satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
	She complained that the other owners didn't dote on her enough  
during their next meeting, giving her roses and congratulations and 
then moving on to other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel hurt but, being a woman, maybe I expected a  
little more attention,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the rest of her reign as owner, she never lacked attention.  
</P>
<P>
	Her treatment of the farm system in the 1980s caught up with the  
team in the '90s. The farm system produced little, forcing the 
small-market team to compete for free agents just as salaries were 
taking off. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1995, the Reds had the second-biggest payroll in the National  
League and one of the least-productive farm systems. The Reds made 
it to the NL championship series only to be swept by Atlanta, then 
began a retrenching that resulted in three years without a winning 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Overshadowing all of it was Schott's public image. The '90 World  
Series championship gave her a forum; she used it to speak her mind 
about Hitler, minorities and a wide range of topics that had 
nothing to do with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Her use of racial and ethnic slurs was at the heart of a lawsuit  
by a fired employee and made baseball's treatment of minorities a 
national focal point in 1992. Baseball's executive council 
suspended her for the 1993 season, hoping it would send a message 
and teach her a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing changed when she returned. She continued to do  
interviews that kept baseball on the defensive. In one, she 
suggested that Hitler was good in the beginning but just went too 
far. In another, she said racism was something created by the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Marge has anything against any one group of  
people or race,'' Rose said. ``I just don't think she likes 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball and the team's limited partners began exploring ways to  
muzzle her and force her out. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with another suspension for inflammatory comments, Schott  
turned day-to-day decision-making over to managing executive John 
Allen in 1996. She was an owner in name only for the last few 
years, allowed input on the annual budget and negotiations for a 
new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen reversed a lot of her decisions, began rebuilding the farm  
system and strengthening the threadbare front office. By 1999, the 
team was competing for the playoffs again. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the limited partners got some leverage. Their  
ownership agreement expired at the end of 2000, when they could 
oust Schott. With baseball hinting she should sell and the limited 
partners ready to get rid of her, Schott relented and made a deal 
with three of the limiteds. 
</P>
<P>
	The stormy Schott years were over.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very sad,'' Howsam said. ``She really had the  
opportunity to do great things for Cincinnati baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Who Will Win Country Music Awards? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ask Martie Seidel of the Dixie Chicks if  
her group will be named the top entertainer in country music this 
year, and she immediately starts talking like Garth. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Garth Brooks. Garth from Wayne and Garth, the goofy duo made  
famous on ``Saturday Night Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not worthy,'' Seidel said. ``I just don't think we're  
worthy of that at this point. I'd be embarrassed if we won that 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She may have to grin and bear it. After two years of domination  
by Brooks, the most prestigious annual award in the country music 
industry is likely to go elsewhere in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The CMA Awards will be handed out Sept. 22 in a ceremony  
broadcast live on CBS. About 6,800 members of the country music 
industry nominate and select the winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a rundown of the nominations and some predictions about  
who will win: 
</P>
<P>
	ENTERTAINER: Garth Brooks, Dixie Chicks, Tim McGraw, George  
Strait, Shania Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks probably won't win three in a row because voters  
generally have given the award in two-year blocks. Vince Gill won 
in 1993-94, Brooks in 1991-92, Strait in 1989-90, and Hank Williams 
Jr. in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Brooks currently is pursuing pop chart success, which will  
turn off some Nashville-centric voters. The veteran Strait is 
always a threat, but voters are more likely to award somebody fresh 
as they look to the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make it a hard-to-call race between the Chicks,  
McGraw and Twain. The odds say McGraw will win because he's been 
the most steady and least controversial of the three. Twain 
probably deserves it the most, for outlasting charges she was a 
flash-in-the-pan and becoming a crossover phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	But the guess here is the Dixie Chicks. The flashy-dressing trio  
were the hit of this year's Lillith Fair, yet have been vocal about 
staying true to the country format. They continue their audacity 
with their new album ``Fly,'' which has a happy song about killing 
an abusive man, and another called ``Sin Wagon'' that talks about 
``mattress dancing.'' Mattress dancing is what you think it is. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FEMALE VOCALIST: Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Jo Dee Messina,  
Shania Twain, Trisha Yearwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Twain, who has never won a CMA Award, should win this one. Only  
Faith Hill has had a big enough year to challenge her. And all 
those gossips who whispered that Twain didn't tour to support her 
``The Woman in Me'' CD because she doesn't sing well have had time 
to digest their crow. 
</P>
<P>
	Twain is a star, and was out on the road proving it for most of  
1999. She's here to stay, and CMA voters will finally acknowledge 
it. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	MALE VOCALIST: Vince Gill, Alan Jackson, Tim McGraw, George  
Strait, Steve Wariner. 
</P>
<P>
	Strait has won this award for the past three years. Gill won it  
from 1991-95. Jackson missed his best time to win it because of the 
domination of the other two. Wariner has had an amazing comeback, 
but a nomination is as far as he'll probably get. Put your money on 
the hardworking, well-respected McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SINGLE: ``Amazed,'' Lonestar; ``Choices,'' George Jones; ``Don't  
Laugh at Me,'' Mark Wills; ``Please Remember Me,'' Tim McGraw; 
``Wide Open Spaces,'' Dixie Chicks. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be too perfect for Jones to cap his comeback from a  
near-fatal car wreck in March by winning this award. No matter, 
``Choices'' is the best song of this bunch, though ``Please 
Remember Me'' is a great Rodney Crowell ballad and the yearning in 
Natalie Maines' voice on ``Wide Open Spaces'' will win over many 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's got to be The Possum for his ode to ``living and  
dying, with the choices I've made.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ALBUM: ``A Place in the Sun,'' Tim McGraw; ``Always Never the  
Same,'' George Strait; ``The Key,'' Vince Gill; ``Two Teardrops,'' 
Steve Wariner; ``Where Your Road Leads,'' Trisha Yearwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Key'' is the best album of Gill's career and should have  
been a much bigger hit. Gill, longtime host of the CMA Awards, is 
beloved in the industry for his charity work and his willingness to 
lend his talent to help other artists. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw and Strait are strong contenders in this category, but  
Gill will win. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	HORIZON AWARD (for career progress): Kenny Chesney, Sara Evans,  
Jo Dee Messina, The Wilkinsons, Chely Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Tough category to call. For sheer success, Chesney should win on  
the strength of his single, ``How Forever Feels,'' which stayed at 
No. 1 for six weeks. Wright and Evans haven't made as much career 
progress, but Messina and The Wilkinsons could make it a close race 
with Chesney, who will probably win by a hair. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	VOCAL GROUP: Alabama, Diamond Rio, Dixie Chicks, Lonestar, The  
Wilkinsons. 
</P>
<P>
	No contest. Dixie Chicks.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	VOCAL DUO: Brooks &AMP; Dunn, The Kinleys, The Lynns, Montgomery  
Gentry, The Warren Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kinleys and Montgomery Gentry have livened up this category  
for the first time in years. But not enough to unseat Brooks &AMP; 
Dunn, who should win for the eighth straight time. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	MUSIC VIDEO: ``Don't Laugh at Me,'' Mark Wills; ``How Forever  
Feels,'' Kenny Chesney; ``I'll Go On Loving You,'' Alan Jackson; 
``Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me,'' Faith Hill with Tim 
McGraw; ``Wide Open Spaces,'' Dixie Chicks. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be a chance to acknowledge Jackson with an award.  
Also, the video was great and the half-spoken/half sung ``I'll Go 
On Loving You'' was an innovative single that deserves recognition. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SONG (for songwriter): ``Don't Laugh at Me,'' Allen Shamblin,  
Steve Seskin; ``Husbands and Wives,'' Roger Miller; ``If You Ever 
Have Forever in Mind,'' Vince Gill, Troy Seals; ``Please Remember 
Me,'' Rodney Crowell, Will Jennings; ``This Kiss,'' Annie Roboff, 
Robin Lerner, Beth Nielsen Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong category. Roger Miller, a legendary performer still  
beloved in Nashville seven years after his death, could be the 
sentimental choice of many voters for his ``Husbands and Wives,'' 
which was revived by Brooks &AMP; Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	VOCAL EVENT: ``Old Dogs,'' Waylon Jennings, Mel Tillis, Bobby  
Bare, Jerry Reed; ``No Place That Far,'' Sara Evans and Vince Gill; 
``My Kind of Woman/My Kind of Man,'' Vince Gill and Patty Loveless; 
``Trio II,'' Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, Dolly Parton; ``Same 
Old Train,'' Clint Black, Joe Diffie, Merle Haggard, Emmylou 
Harris, Alison Krauss, Patty Loveless, Earl Scruggs, Ricky Skaggs, 
Marty Stuart, Pam Tillis, Randy Travis, Travis Tritt, Dwight 
Yoakam. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tough choice, but the pick here is ``Trio II,'' which  
would be a nice touch since Parton is being inducted into the 
Country Music Hall of Fame during the awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	MUSICIAN: Eddie Bayers, Paul Franklin, Dann Huff, Brent Mason,  
Randy Scruggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Scruggs (son of banjo great Earl Scruggs) is the winner because  
he put out ``Crown of Jewels,'' a great overlooked album, and CMA 
voters know him better than the studio musicians who make up the 
rest of the field.

<HEADLINE> 5 Questions With Alessandro Nivola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First, there's the name.  
</P>
<P>
	Alessandro Nivola.  
</P>
<P>
	``My name has been a real source of confusion to just about  
everyone,'' the 27-year-old actor said. ``The first roles I was 
always called in for were bricklayers. And now since I've done so 
much work in England, people are confused about my nationality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, his father is from the Italian island of  
Sardinia, where Alessandro is as common as John in the United 
States. And Nivola is a traditional name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one more thing to make it more difficult for people  
to categorize what kind of person I am,'' the handsome, clean-cut 
actor said. ``It keeps more possibilities open for different types 
of work -- I look so Waspy but I speak Italian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second, how much pressure did he feel when he shared the stage  
this summer with Gwyneth Paltrow? He appeared with Paltrow in 
Shakespeare's ``As You Like It'' at the Williamstown Theater 
Festival in Williamstown, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real scene up there especially because Gwyneth was in  
the show,'' Nivola said. ``We had (Steven) Spielberg showing up. 
One day, I think Kevin Kline, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward and Mia 
Farrow all came to the show. Every day there was such pressure on, 
but I don't think anyone had as much pressure as she did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Nivola was ``discovered'' while doing ``A Month  
in the Country'' with Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham on 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming back to the theater in Williamstown, I suddenly  
realized that I'm not the new guy anymore. There were young interns 
and non-equity actors there who were asking me about my career,'' 
he said. ``I was always `the kid.' People always treated me like 
the young guy who was open, openhearted and open for information 
and wanting to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nivola's upcoming films include ``Best Laid Plans,'' co-starring  
Reese Witherspoon and Josh Brolin; Kenneth Branagh's film version 
of Shakespeare's ``Love's Labours Lost''; and ``Mansfield Park,'' 
an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mansfield Park'' and the Branagh film were shot in England.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd always wanted to travel the world and I've really been  
fortunate that way. I've worked all over Europe, and I never 
expected to do it as much I have,'' he said. ``However, now I feel 
just a little bit tired by it and I would like to work in L.A., or 
New York, or around the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Best Laid Plans,'' Nivola plays a frustrated worker at a  
recycling plant who drags his girlfriend (Witherspoon) and an old 
buddy (Brolin) into a web of crime and deception. 
</P>
<P>
	Nivola doesn't seem a likely candidate for the part of a  
scheming thief. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a certain thrill to be able to convince people that  
I was capable of that kind of bad behavior,'' Nivola said during an 
interview at a Manhattan hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Growing up you lived throughout the Northeast, where is home  
for you now? 
</P>
<P>
	Nivola: `Where is home?' is a very confusing question. I have a  
little place in L.A. that I rented when I went out to do 
`Face/Off.' I got evicted from my place in New York so I got kind 
of stuck out there. Since then I've done three of my last four 
films in England, so I've spent a lot of time in London. I just 
come and go to L.A. I get my mail there. 
</P>
<P>
	2. What do you do when you're not working?  
</P>
<P>
	Nivola: My whole life over the past few years has been consumed  
with being an actor, which is what I always wanted to do so that's 
good. But it hasn't left a lot of time for anything else. I play 
soccer obsessively. There's this group of middle-aged Italian guys 
who play out in L.A. -- they have uniforms and everything. I go out 
and play with them on weekends. I also love to read. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Are you a Shakespeare buff?  
</P>
<P>
	Nivola: The plays are just brilliant -- there is great language  
and great dialogue. And the plays are so modern. The language is 
difficult, but the themes and what people are really saying is 
always just so timely. You wouldn't believe some of the lines -- you 
are just shocked and you think `Is that really an Elizabethan 
line?' You think this is just so understandable. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Were you nervous about returning to the stage this summer?  
</P>
<P>
	Nivola: It had been four years since I'd done a play, and for  
Gwyneth it was five or six. It's completely different doing a play. 
The stage is more demanding, you have to get into shape for it -- 
especially your voice. But it is incredibly rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Do you feel like you are making a name for yourself?  
</P>
<P>
	Nivola: In the first few years I was in New York, I probably  
worked harder at being an actor than I ever have and probably ever 
will again -- hopefully. It was a constant thing of trying to get 
work and then be good at it. Now, luckily, the main part of the 
work is doing the work, not getting it.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Shake Up Offensive Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles made more changes to  
their ineffective offensive line Wednesday, promoting veteran Jeff 
Dellenbach to the starting lineup and moving Jermane Mayberry yet 
again, this time from guard to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	In what seems like a weekly rite of passage since late in  
training camp, there were two new teammates to introduce: guard 
David Diaz-Infante and tight end Justin Swift, both signed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest moves, including the release of lineman John Michels,  
were part of coach Andy Reid's steadfast effort to jumpstart his 
sputtering offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're either going to hop on the bus or you're not going to  
hop on the bus,'' Reid said Wednesday. ``And if you're not, then 
you're not going to hang with this group here. I'm going full-steam 
ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message is clear.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't get the job done, you're gone,'' rookie guard  
Doug Brzezinski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellenbach, a 15-year veteran signed a week ago, will start at  
right guard Sunday against Tampa Bay. Mayberry, who has been moved 
several times since training camp, goes to right tackle to replace 
rookie John Welbourn, who is out for the year following knee 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz-Infante, who won two Super Bowls with Denver before being  
released last week, essentially replaces Michels in the rotation. 
Oliver Ross was promoted from the practice squad to back up 
Mayberry. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade of defensive end Jon Harris to Green Bay for Michels  
looks a little strange now. Reid said Diaz-Infante, who was 
available when the Eagles acquired Michels, is an ``upgrade'' over 
Michels. So why was Michels acquired in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to evaluate John in here as a player after his knee  
surgery,'' Reid said. ``I felt that John could be a starter for me 
if I needed one. I didn't necessarily feel that way after the 
surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, who set the tone for a no-nonsense approach by cutting  
veterans Jerry Crafts and George Hegamin late in camp, stopped 
short of saying the line is set. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is how I'd like it right here, if it works,'' Reid said.  
``Again, I'm going to keep a close eye on that position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been easy to miss. The Eagles (0-1), coming off a  
demoralizing 25-24 loss to Arizona in the season opener, have been 
hampered by an ineffective offense in five games including the 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	They took a 21-0 lead in the first quarter against the  
Cardinals, courtesy of three turnovers that gave them the ball 
inside the 20. They couldn't move the ball the rest of the game and 
lost on Chris Jacke's 31-yard field goal as time expired.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Falls 108.91 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors brushed off a government report that  
showed little evidence of rising inflation and drove stocks lower 
Wednesday. The dollar's weakness against the Japanese yen continued 
to undercut stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 108.91 points, or by 1  
percent, to close at 10,801.42. The index had tumbled from an early 
gain of 103 points, with the selloff gaining momentum in the final 
hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also closed lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 fell 18.32 to 1,317.97. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index fell 54.12 to 2,814.17, more than reversing 
Tuesday's gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the fact that we're still hitting new records with  
some regularity, the broad market is not participating,'' said 
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; 
Co. in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department's report of a modest increase in its  
Consumer Price Index -- the most closely watched inflation gauge -- 
initially pushed stocks higher Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The index rose 0.3 percent in August, matching the July advance.  
Excluding large gains in the gasoline and energy categories, prices 
rose a mere 0.1 percent in August, well below what Wall Street 
economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``With only one sector showing a noticeable shift in price, the  
CPI has to be viewed as a fine report on inflation,'' said Michael 
Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was not enough to convince investors that the Fed will  
hold off on raising interest rates for the third time this year as 
it tries to prevent inflation from escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors believe we've lost the wind at our backs in terms of  
low inflation and low interest rates,'' said Lynn Yturri, who runs 
the One Group Equity Income Fund for Banc One Investment Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's continued weakness in the dollar also drove the  
market lower. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Wednesday afternoon, the dollar bought 104.23 yen,  
down from 105.79 yen late Tuesday. At one point earlier in the day, 
the dollar dropped to 103.20 yen, the lowest level against the 
Japanese currency since early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors fear a weaker dollar because it makes imports more  
expensive, setting the stage for a rise in inflation. It can also 
lead foreign investors to pull out of U.S. stocks to seek more 
attractive returns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation-sensitive bond market swung sharply, with yields  
on 30-year Treasury bonds dropping to 6.08 percent after the 
release of the consumer price report, then shooting as high as 
Tuesday's late rate of 6.12 percent. Yields were 6.10 percent as 
stock markets closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle fell 2 13/16 to 42 5/8 after the company's fiscal  
first-quarter earnings, reported after markets closed Tuesday, 
failed to meet the most optimistic predictions of Wall Street 
analysts. Oracle earned 16 cents per share, in line with published 
estimates, but short of the ``whisper'' number, an unofficial 
forecast circulated among Wall Street traders. 
</P>
<P>
	A $10.66 billion merger inspired little enthusiasm on Wall  
Street. Cell phone maker Motorola fell 6 11/16 to 86 1/2 after saying 
it will acquire General Instrument, the leading maker of cable TV 
set-top boxes. Shares of General Instrument declined 3 29/128 to 47 
35/128. 
</P>
<P>
	Belski said the Nasdaq's decline was to be expected after the  
index bounded to a new closing high of 2,887.06 last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A limited number of technology stocks have led the Nasdaq  
higher,'' he said. Some of the leading technology shares already 
have risen so far that ``they are prone to pullbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft fell 2 1/2 to 92 9/16 and Sun Microsystems dropped 3 to  
82 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts attributed the late slide in stocks to selling in  
advance of Friday's quarterly ``triple witching'' day, when options 
and futures on stocks and stock indexes expire. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 929.15 million 
shares, compared with 881.27 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.91 to 436.33.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Germany's DAX index fell 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE  
100 lost 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 lost 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Japan were closed for a national holiday.

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis C Clears Faster in Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Children with hepatitis C may fight off the infection better  
than adults, researchers reported today in The New England Journal 
of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers examined 458 children who underwent heart surgery in  
Germany long before 1991, when that country began screening its 
blood supply for viruses such as hepatitis C, a leading cause of 
liver disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors found that 67 of the children -- 15 percent -- had  
acquired hepatitis C during their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	But 20 years later, the infection had cleared on its own in  
nearly half of the patients. Among those in whom the infection was 
still present, few had developed liver disease -- even though those 
few patients also had other risk factors for liver disease, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 20 percent of adults who acquire hepatitis C manage to  
fight off the infection without treatment, said the lead 
researcher, Dr. Manfred Vogt of the German Heart Center at the 
Technical University of Munich. And about 30 percent of adults who 
get the virus develop cirrhosis or other serious liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knows why this is,'' Vogt said.  
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Maureen Jonas of the  
Children's Hospital in Boston noted the reasons behind the 
``spontaneous clearance'' of the infection among the children 
remain unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know whether more serious manifestations of liver  
disease will appear 30 or 40 years after infection,'' she wrote. 
``Thus, it is important to screen and follow patients who are at 
risk for hepatitis C and to do more than simply reassure infected 
children and their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2.7 million Americans carry the hepatitis C virus,  
making it the most common blood-borne infection in the United 
States. The standard medicines can make all signs of the virus 
disappear, but it's unclear how long the effect lasts.

<HEADLINE> Corcoran Art School Makes Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the oldest U.S. schools of visual  
design, the Corcoran School of Art, said Tuesday it was changing 
its name and adding new degree programs, equipment and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corcoran College of Art and Design has opened a ``Georgetown  
campus'' in an old elementary school in an upscale neighborhood of 
the nation's capital. The facility was bought from the District of 
Columbia for $1.5 million and is part of a $3.5 million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2004, the college expects to have a new building adjacent to  
its current site near the White House. Frank Gehry, architect of 
the new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, recently won a contest 
to plan the addition. 
</P>
<P>
	In 2001, the college expects to grant its first associate  
degrees in fine arts and photography. In 2003, it will graduate its 
first bachelor's degrees in photojournalism, and in 2004 its first 
in arts education. The school already offers bachelor's degrees in 
fine arts, graphic design and photography. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corcoran School of Design was founded in 1890. That was 20  
years after the Corcoran Gallery of Art was established as the 
capital's first art museum by William Wilson Corcoran, a financier 
and collector.

<HEADLINE> Surgeon General, Fergie Team Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Surgeon General David Satcher teamed up with  
the Duchess of York on Wednesday to get the fat out. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question about the fact that obesity is at an  
all-time high in this country,'' Satcher said at a national 
conference on obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	About 55 percent of American adults -- 97 million people -- are  
considered overweight or obese. Doctors consider people obese if 
they weigh at least 20 percent more than what is recommended for 
their height. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what it's like to be humiliated,'' said the former  
Sarah Ferguson, who once weighed 200 pounds and was dubbed 
``Duchess of Pork'' by the British tabloids. She is now a 
spokeswoman for Weight Watchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The former wife of Britain's Prince Andrew, looking thin in a  
cobalt-blue suit, said she keeps her weight down by sticking to a 
healthy diet and spending 20 minutes on a stationary bicycle every 
morning.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Starts Olympics Countdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- When Sydney was awarded the 2000  
Olympics six years ago, Helen Russell was among the thousands 
celebrating downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, she was back for more -- this time, one year away  
from the Sept. 15, 2000, opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will help make people more aware that this is approaching  
and to get ready,'' the 34-year-old Russell said as she collected 
commemorative pins during celebrations at Darling Harbour. ``It 
seemed such a long way away six years ago when we were standing 
outside the Opera House screaming at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wake-up call to the city.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Australians like a party,'' she said. ``I think Sydney is  
about the greatest place on Earth to live and I think the rest of 
the world can come and see what a great place this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darling Harbour will be the site of Olympic volleyball,  
weightlifting, boxing, wrestling, fencing and judo. For 16 hours, 
crowds watched sports demonstrations and mingled athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators in Sydney roared while watching a live broadcast of a  
ceremony from Lausanne, Switzerland, where -- to a fanfare of 
Aboriginal music -- the International Olympic Committee celebrated 
the one-year countdown by sending out the first invitations to the 
world's athletes. More than 10,000 athletes are expected to take 
part in the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympic Movement is full of confidence in the capacity of  
the organizing committee to hold a successful games next year,'' 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said. ``I am convinced the 
games of the 27th Olympiad will be a great success for the 
athletes, for Australia and for the Olympic Movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, U.S. Olympic hopefuls gathered outside the studios  
of NBC, which will televise the games. Among them were softball 
pitcher Dot Richardson, high jumper Amy Acuff and pole vaulter 
Stacy Dragila. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, meanwhile, the track and field competition schedule  
was announced and Michael Johnson learned he will get a chance to 
replicate his historic sprint double of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation, the sport's  
governing body, arranged the schedule specifically so top stars 
could compete in more than one event. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said particular attention was  
given to accommodating Johnson and Marion Jones, the sport's top 
female star who will have the opportunity to bid for gold in the 
100, 200, long jump and both relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who set a world record of 19.32 seconds in the 200 in  
Atlanta, struggled with injuries and other setbacks for much of the 
next three years. But he reasserted his greatness at last month's 
World Championships in Seville, Spain, breaking the 11-year-old 
world record in the 400 with a clocking of 43.18. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly pleased that the schedule will allow me to do  
the double again,'' Johnson said. ``It's an extremely difficult 
thing to do, but it's not uncharted territory anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm running faster now than I was at the Olympics three years  
ago,'' Johnson said. ``I don't think there's anyone who can beat me 
if I'm on top of my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The timetable also clears the way for doubles by American  
sprinter Maurice Greene, the world champion in the 100 and 200; 
Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, world and Olympic champion at 10,000 
and world record-holder at 5,000; and Russia's Svetlana Masterkova, 
the 1996 Olympic champion in the 800 and 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney schedule includes a rest day between the  
qualification rounds and finals of the triple jump, as well as 
other jumping events. The timetable also allows at least one rest 
day between semifinals and finals of races of 800 meters and more, 
and the 400 meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Australia's capital of Canberra, a meeting of 60 indigenous  
leaders convened by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
Commission decided not to jeopardize the success of the games 
through protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, because we're a sport-loving people ourselves, we  
want to be at the games, we want a successful games, we want to see 
Cathy Freeman reach her full potential and get gold,'' former ATSIC 
chairwoman Lowitja O'Donoghue said, referring to the Aboriginal 
track star. 
</P>
<P>
	Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation chairwoman Evelyn Scott  
said the success of Australian athletes was paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not about to jeopardize the livelihood of our Australian  
athletes be they indigenous or non-indigenous,'' she said. 
``They've worked all their lives for this, to win gold in their own 
country.''

<HEADLINE> Yzerman Gets Three-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman has  
signed a three-year contract extension, the team said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman's contract now runs through the 2002-2003 season.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings didn't make public the terms of the contract and  
Yzerman's agent didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> KC's Tight End Returns to Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Tight end Tony Gonzalez returned to  
practice for the first time in three weeks Wednesday, hopeful he'll 
be ready for Kansas City's home opener against Denver on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, one of the most important elements in the Chiefs'  
offensive plans, had been out since injuring his right knee in an 
exhibition game against Jacksonville on Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out and practiced today and felt pretty good,'' said  
the 6-foot-4, 250-pounder. ``It was a little gimpy on the corner, 
when I was turning. I took myself out toward the end of practice, 
about the last 10 plays. A little sore. I didn't want to push it on 
the first day of practice. I just want to take care of it until 
Sunday and then let it go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez' absence was sorely felt in Sunday's season opener at  
Chicago, where the Chiefs lost 20-17 to a team they were favored to 
beat. The decision not to play him was not made until just before 
game time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just sitting there and watching was the worst,'' he said.  
``The doctor said don't go with it. But it just killed me sitting 
there, just watching, especially when you know you can help your 
team out. It was tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Gonzalez is ready, he'll give quarterback Elvis Grbac another  
option. 
</P>
<P>
	``He makes a tremendous amount of difference,'' Denver safety  
Tyrone Braxton said. ``Elvis looks to him more. He's a good 
blocker, a physical blocker. He helps out their offense 
tremendously. I remember Elvis last year would look to him in 
crucial situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round pick in 1997, Gonzalez caught 33 passes for 368  
yards and two touchdowns as a rookie. Last year, he had 59 catches 
for 621 yards and two scores and the Chiefs are hoping he'll reach 
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony's a playmaker. Each team has a certain amount of  
playmakers and you need them out there all the time,'' center Tim 
Grunhard said. ``We missed him last week. There are big plays he 
could have made. I'm hoping he can be out there this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs are also hoping to get defensive lineman Dan Williams  
back. Williams, who sat out last season in a contract dispute, has 
missed the past five weeks with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm basically just trying to come out here and do more and  
more each day and see how it holds up,'' said Williams, who led the 
Chiefs with 10 sacks in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm basically just trying to get back to a functional point. I  
feel I am back to a functional point. That being said, I've just 
got to come out and do the best I can.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska Looks for Balancing Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Alaska's political leaders on Wednesday  
began the search for a way to balance the budget without reducing 
the the annual dividend people get from the state's permanent fund, 
a proposal voters rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan to fill the gap between state spending and normal revenue  
with earnings from the $26 billion oil-royalty savings account went 
down in defeat Tuesday, with 83 percent voting no in an advisory 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund's treasured dividend would have been cut several  
hundred dollars to about $1,340 in 2001. Alaskans expect to receive 
more than $1,700 when the checks go out next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we got was a 2-by-4 upside the head,'' Republican state  
Sen. Gary Wilken said Wednesday. ``Now we just have to decide what 
it means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the plan devised by the Republican-controlled  
Legislature and endorsed by Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles came from 
a mismatched coalition of hard-line conservatives and liberal 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservatives want deep spending cuts before tapping the  
fund or changing Alaska's status as only one of two states with 
neither an income tax nor a general sales tax. Taxes and royalties 
on oil production cover most of the cost of state government, but 
dwindling oil revenue has prompted budget cuts in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to discuss reprioritizing what we do as a state and  
stop doing some things we can'tafford anymore,'' said Republican 
Rep. Scott Ogan, who opposed the plan in the Legislature and headed 
a group that campaigned for a no vote in the election. 
</P>
<P>
	The liberal end of the coalition argued for more taxes on  
Alaska's profitable industries, including oil and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alaskans have said loud and clear they want this Legislature  
to consider all potential revenue sources, including increased 
industry taxes, when they go to balance the budget next year,'' 
said Paula Phillips, a spokeswoman for Alaska Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with many lawmakers, Knowles interpreted the vote as a  
call for a financial plan that relies less heavily on earnings from 
the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be other more fair and balanced sources of  
revenues,'' Knowles said. ``I don't know whether its going to be an 
income tax, a sales tax or some kind of a broad-based tax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state now balances the budget by tapping a reserve account  
that now contains less than $3 billion. Without some new source of 
money, officials worry that reserve could be empty within a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowles offered no specifics, but said he hoped to have a new  
proposal ready by the time he gives his State of the State speech 
in January. He opened this year's session by proposing an income 
tax that GOP lawmakers summarily dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	An avid booster of the oil industry, Knowles seemed dubious  
about the idea of raising oil taxes. Such a move could make the 
state less attractive to developers, driving away investment and 
jobs, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise on Tame Inflation Report / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Wednesday after a government  
report showed inflation remaining tame. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32  
point, or $2.81 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 6.10 percent from Tuesday's 6.12 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said the consumer price index rose 0.3  
percent in August, in line with economists' expectations and 
matching July's increase. The core reading of consumer prices, 
which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.1 percent, 
lower than forecasts for a 0.2 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The low inflation rate seemingly lessens the chance that the  
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this 
year at its meeting Oct. 5. Bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return 
to investors, are less attractive during periods of rising interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities rose 2/32 point to 3/32  
point, and intermediate maturities rose 7/32 point to 9/32, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.73 percent as the  
discount fell 0.07 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.61 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.07 percent, as the discount fell 0.04 
percentage point from Tuesday to 4.87 percent. One-year yields were 
5.23 percent as the discount fell by 0.03 percentage point from 
late Tuesday to 4.96 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.43 3/4 percent from Tuesday's 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 113 1/8. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged at 5.86 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Tim Couch To Start for Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The Tim Couch Era has arrived in Cleveland  
much sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, the No. 1 pick in the draft, will replace Ty Detmer as  
Cleveland's starting quarterback Sunday when the expansion Browns 
play at Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland was rocked 43-0 in its opener by the Pittsburgh  
Steelers. The Browns gained just 40 total yards and made only two 
first downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer made the switch because he thinks  
Detmer would be better coming off the bench if Couch gets in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed in Ty,'' Palmer said today. ``It wasn't  
all his fault. I'd like to think Ty would be able to a better job 
as a reliever than Tim as a reliever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Couch, who threw an interception on his first  
passing attempt Sunday night, could be the starter for the rest of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch skipped his final season at Kentucky and signed a $48  
million contract with the Browns. He was impressive during 
preseason, completing 10 straight passes and throwing a touchdown 
pass to rally Cleveland past Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	But he looked shaky in his final few performances, and the  
Browns wanted to bring him along slowly this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really looking forward to the opportunity,'' Couch said.  
``Hopefully, I can go out and move the chains and put some points 
on the board.''

<HEADLINE> Niners' Play Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young took his team to task  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco 49ers quarterback challenged teammates to play  
with more feeling. And in a direct jab at non-contributing rookies, 
Young said the club has to start getting more help from its younger 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came off of the preseason and I don't think we played with  
the passion we need to play with,'' Young said Wednesday as the 
team began preparations to play New Orleans on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's got to be a battle, a passion for football,'' said  
Young, who struggled along with the rest of the 49ers in a 
season-opening 41-3 loss at Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure whether it was the lethargic start or the weather  
but the passion to play football week in, week out needs to be with 
us throughout the season, starting Sunday. I look at that as a 
major factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci said he didn't agree with Young at all.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see it that way,'' Mariucci said. ``I thought we were  
ready to play and I thought we were playing hard. We weren't 
necessarily playing well, especially on offense, but we certainly 
were playing hard. So I don't know what he's talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young acknowledged that he played as poorly as anyone in  
Sunday's debacle at Jacksonville, the 49ers' worst regular-season 
loss since 1980, and he vowed to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said the team faces an uphill battle unless it gets  
additional production from newcomers. San Francisco's rookie crop 
has been particularly disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers made defensive tackle Reggie McGrew their first-round  
pick and defensive end Chike Okeafor was their next selection, in 
the third round. General manager Bill Walsh said he expected both 
to contribute this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But McGrew and Okeafor missed virtually all of training camp  
with injuries -- Okeafor hurt his back playing basketball and McGrew 
had a knee condition -- and have done next to nothing on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, San Francisco has hardly gotten any help from the draft  
in the last three years. Quarterback Jim Druckenmiller, a 
first-round pick in 1997, was a bust and shipped off to Miami in a 
preseason trade and the jury is out on cornerback R.W. McQuarters, 
a first-rounder in 1998 who has yet to crack the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we can't have enough young impact players,'' Young  
said. ``We need young players to make an impact. There's not a 
question about that. The rest of us, we've always been able to 
carry the load and we'll continue to just carry it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young said it has been tough dealing with the lopsided loss but  
that the team now had to look forward to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long couple days,'' Young said. ``Right now, it's  
kind of clench your jaw and let's go 15 weeks and make last week 
the reason why we go all the way. It doesn't have to happen 
overnight but you have to start to see that mindset from the top to 
the bottom for our team.''

<HEADLINE> Concern Over Small Firefighter Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When a lightning storm sparked a swarm of  
small fires in northern California's Plumas National Forest last 
month, officials had no choice but to let some of them burn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely didn't have the staffing we needed,'' said Kent  
Swartzlander, who oversees federal fire crews in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to let nine fires go on our district. We knew they were  
there, but we just didn't have the people to fight them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Days later, when enough fire crews had been brought in from  
other state, local and federal departments, two of those nine fires 
had merged to become a major blaze covering thousands of acres, 
Swartzlander said. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke Tuesday at a House hearing on what federal officials  
say is one of the major impediments to fighting Western wildfires: 
a shrinking pool of firefighters and managers to actually battle 
the forest-eating flames. 
</P>
<P>
	This year has been particularly bad for wildfires, with 4.4  
million acres burned through August -- more than twice the total for 
an average year. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agencies that manage most of those burning  
landscapes have fewer people and resources to fight those fires, 
according to a report last month from Congress' General Accounting 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of qualified federal wildland firefighter teams has  
dropped by more than one-third since 1992 as firefighters retire or 
leave for higher-paying jobs with other fire departments, the study 
said. Congress has given federal land-management agencies only 
about 85 percent of the firefighting money they need for the past 
three years, the GAO report said. 
</P>
<P>
	That puts forests, grasslands, homes and other firefighters at  
risk from monster blazes fueled by vegetation that grew during 
decades of fire suppression, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to get on the fires as quickly and contain  
them when they're small,'' said Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	Chenoweth is backing a bill sponsored by Rep. Richard Pombo,  
R-Calif., that would raise wages and other benefits for federal 
firefighters. Swartzlander, president of a federal firefighters' 
group, and others have complained that federal firefighters often 
get paid much less than their local counterparts when fighting the 
same fire.

<HEADLINE> Motorola To Buy General Instrument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Motorola Inc. made a bold bet today on the  
future of cable television, announcing it will pay about $11 
billion in stock to acquire General Instrument Corp., the largest 
producer of cable TV set-top boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	General Instrument's set-top box operations dominate one of the  
key technologies that is revolutionizing home entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new equipment available today, the televisions of  
tomorrow can offer many more ``broadband'' cable services, 
including Internet access, interactive video games and telephone 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola, best known for making cellular phones and pagers, is  
looking for a stronger presence in the fast-growing market for 
broadband services. 
</P>
<P>
	General Instrument is the market leader in set-top boxes,  
controlling 72 percent of the North American market, according to 
Allied Business Intelligence Inc., a technology research company. 
Allied estimates the number of set-top boxes in North American 
homes is expected to skyrocket from about 20 million today to 113 
million over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strongest demand is expected to come from overseas  
markets and ``will be the key to our growth and our business,'' 
said Edward D. Breen, chairman and chief executive officer of 
General Instrument, who will head Motorola's new broadband 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allows us to participate in the fastest-growing segments  
of the telecommunications industry,'' said Christopher B. Galvin, 
the chairman and chief executive of Schaumburg, Ill.-based 
Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
	For General Instrument, a deal with Motorola will mean more  
marketing power, better supply contracts and a broader product 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Galvin said he does not anticipate a large number of job cuts in  
the combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced today, Motorola will offer 0.575 share  
of its stock for each of General Instrument's shares. That would 
represent a value of about $11 billion at Tuesday's closing prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors in both companies seemed to have concerns about  
the terms. Many shareholders in Horsham, Pa.-based General 
Instrument don't think they are getting enough money, while 
Motorola shareholders are worried the dilution to the value of 
their stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Motorola fell  
6 percent or by $5.75, to $87.43 3/4 a share, while General 
Instrument's stock was off about 5 percent, or by $2.68 3/4, at 
$47.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Breen defended the price General Instrument shareholders are  
getting, claiming it represents a premium to where the stock was 
trading just a few weeks ago before speculation of a deal pushed 
shares higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most strategic move our company has ever made,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is  
subject to approval by shareholders and antitrust regulators. It is 
expected to be completed early next year, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement could put pressure on other cable equipment  
companies to find partners. Scientific-Atlanta Inc., the No. 2 
maker of set-top boxes, has seen its stock climb this week as 
investors bet the company will be the next target. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation among these companies reflects the merger  
frenzy among the nation's cable TV operators. AT&AMP;T Corp., Cox 
Communications Inc., and Charter Communications Holdings LLC are 
among the cable firms that have announced major acquisitions in the 
past six months.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Utility Vows Improvements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Commonwealth Edison has promised to spend $1.5  
billion improving its service after summer power outages shut down 
the Chicago Board of Trade and left thousands of people without 
electricity during a heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal review and a separate improvement plan sent to Mayor  
Richard M. Daley and the Illinois Commerce Commission by 
Commonwealth Edison's parent company, Unicom Corp., blamed many of 
the outages on company blunders. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation found an inflexible system that didn't allow  
the company to easily switch power among substations, said David 
Helwig, interim senior vice president of the utility's transmission 
and distribution operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Unicom promised more aggressive inspection and maintenance,  
better monitoring of equipment, additional capacity in key 
locations and improved system flexibility. The plan includes $1.5 
billion in improvements to its distribution system over the next 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The company serves about 3.4 million customers in the Chicago  
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubles started July 30 with a blackout that left about  
100,000 customers without power for up to three days in 
temperatures of more than 100 degrees. Several outages followed, 
including one Aug. 12 when problems at a substation forced a 
shutoff of power to Chicago's busiest business district, and 
mechanical problems Aug. 22 that caused a blackout that threatened 
to spoil frozen plant and animal tissue in the Field Museum of 
Natural History.

automaker's U.S. offices were a sign a deal could be imminent. 
Talks recessed at midmorning and resumed this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between the union and General Motors Corp. recessed late  
Tuesday and resumed this morning, GM spokesman Edd Snyder said. 
Negotiations at Ford Motor Co. were much less intense. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokesman David Barnas said early today that the  
union had granted the company an indefinite extension of its 
three-year contract covering 75,000 workers. Similar extensions 
were given to GM and Ford on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While marathon talks are a traditional sign of progress, there  
also were signs of strain between the union and DaimlerChrysler. 
National negotiators, including UAW President Stephen P. Yokich, 
were meeting at DaimlerChrysler headquarters when workers at five 
plants in Missouri and Indiana staged a brief walkout Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at two DaimlerChrysler plants in Fenton, Mo., outside of  
St. Louis, walked off the job at 9:45 p.m. EDT and started 
picketing. The plants, which make the highly profitable Dodge Ram 
trucks and DaimlerChrysler's minivans, employ about 7,100. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 minutes later, workers at two transmission plants and a  
casting plant in Kokomo, Ind., walked off the job, DaimlerChrysler 
officials said. Production there resumed with the midnight shift 
and was normal today. Those plants employ a total of 8,400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The picket signs in Fenton went down about an hour after they  
went up and the third shift began reporting on time, said Jason 
Archer, financial secretary for UAW Local 110. Archer said all 
union workers should follow their normal routines today. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Bob Eaton said he expected workers  
at those plants would remain on the job as negotiations continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still hopeful we will be able to get a contract without  
significant work stoppage,'' Eaton said today at the Frankfurt 
International Motor Show in Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnas said the union has not told DaimlerChrysler the reason  
for the walkouts. Officials at locals in Missouri and Indiana could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages, job security, health care costs, overtime demands and the  
assignment of work to outside suppliers were expected to be among 
the top issues in this year's talks, as they were during the last 
round in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of  
record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more 
than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few indications of what proposals the UAW and  
DaimlerChrysler might be negotiating. The union has discussed 
efforts to organize DaimlerChrysler's nonunion plants in the United 
States: a Mercedes-Benz sport utility factory in Alabama with 1,600 
workers and Freightliner commercial truck plants in the Carolinas.

<HEADLINE>  Nations Promise East Timor Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Closing ranks against terror, countries  
from France to Thailand promised on Wednesday to send soldiers to 
rescue thousands of starving East Timorese from further slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is offering planes and pilots to get  
peacekeepers into the province, and will also help with logistics, 
communications and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	In just weeks, the obscure conflict became an urgent priority  
for the U.N. Security Council, which early Wednesday approved a 
peacekeeping force authorized to use ``all necessary measures'' 
against violent militias. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor's capital, Dili, was quiet Wednesday, with only a few  
homes burning and sporadic gunfire. Tens of thousands of refugees 
waited in nearby hills for desperately needed food drops from 
low-flying Australian military airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dili is empty now. There are only ghosts of massacres,'' East  
Timorese rebel leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao said from 
Jakarta, where he is staying until it is safe for him to return. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed increasingly likely that Australian-led peacekeepers  
could find Dili free of pro-Indonesian militias when they land and 
secure the city, expected as early as this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The militias, which rampaged across East Timor shooting people  
to death and butchering them with machetes, were slipping out of 
the capital, said Indonesian military officers who spoke to The 
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor plunged into a murderous nightmare after U.N.  
officials announced Sept. 4 that voters had overwhelmingly approved 
independence in a referendum last month. Hundreds and possibly 
thousands of people have been killed in less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had to learn, independence is not cheap. We have had  
to pay,'' said Sebastiao Guterres, a 26-year-old U.N. volunteer who 
was among those airlifted to a refugee camp in Darwin, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	For those left behind, food and shelter were the highest  
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations was readying huge transport planes to drop  
food packets to the impoverished refugees as early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict has raged for nearly 25 years, since Indonesia  
invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1974. An estimated 200,000 
people have died in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	In less than two weeks, an estimated 300,000 or more people have  
been driven from their homes by the militias and their allies in 
the Indonesian military. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign governments, in a show of solidarity, have been rushing  
forward with promises of troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, which will lead the force and send 4,500 troops,  
should be braced for casualties, Prime Minister John Howard warned 
Thursday. Australians are regarded in Indonesia as favoring 
independence for East Timor, and could be targeted by pro-Jakarta 
militias, said President B.J. Habibie's spokeswoman, Dr. Dewi 
Fortuna Anwar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one has to understand that there is now a very strong  
feeling of animosity towards Australia, rightly or wrongly, from 
among the pro-integration forces in East Timor,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The total force will be 7,500-strong. France pledged 500  
soldiers on Wednesday, while Thailand offered 700 troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia, South Korea and other countries also promised to send  
units. A contingent of Gurkhas, elite fighters who come mostly from 
Nepal, also will head to East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States already has said it will provide several  
hundred support personnel, while the Philippines said Wednesday it 
would send 1,200 people, most of them doctors and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our desire of course to see the multinational force in  
East Timor as soon as possible,'' Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were fears, however, that the militias could target  
Australian peacekeepers because of anger at the country's role in 
pushing for the security force. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of refugees in Dili sheltered at military  
headquarters, the governor's office and the seaport. Many waited 
under red, yellow and blue tarpaulins, looking tired and 
frightened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never fled home because I'm old,'' said 67-year-old Filomena  
de Jesus, outside her shack in eastern Dili. ``I'll stay here, 
whether East Timor is part of Indonesia or independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People scavenged for food wherever they could find it. Two  
girls, pushing a cart carrying sacks of rice toward their refugee 
camp, said they found the rice in a church. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard in New York said staff members on  
the ground traveled six miles south of Dili to the town of Dare, 
bringing six tons of rice, which were then tracked up into the 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
	A priest in Dare told the U.N. staff that 50,000 Dili residents  
were hiding in the mountains and lacked food and medical supplies, 
Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rome-based World Food Program said it would drop 70 tons of  
high-energy biscuits in 350,000 packages. 
</P>
<P>
	FIDES, the Vatican's missionary news service, warned on  
Wednesday that the militias plan to use aid drops to find and bomb 
refugees hiding in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is their final act of terrorism before the U.N. forces  
arrive,'' said Sister Maria del Carmen Aparicio, mother superior of 
a convent in Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Australian police said suspected militia members were  
identified among refugees sheltering in Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
	A police spokesman said a family of 10 believed to be militia  
members and two men thought to be members of the Indonesian 
military were being held. Earlier, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst 
said five suspected militia members had been pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees are staying in a small tent city built within the  
fenced-off property of the local East Timorese community. In 
Washington, the Defense Department said it was preparing to ship 
300,000 packaged meals to Darwin for the refugees.

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Benjamin S. Bloom, an education professor whose  
research led to an upsurge in interest in early childhood 
education, including the creation of the Head Start program, died 
at home Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom, the Charles W. Swift Distinguished Service Professor  
Emeritus in Education at the University of Chicago, was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom was known for expanding notions of who was capable of  
learning and performing well in school. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, Bloom demonstrated that 50 percent of the  
variations in intelligence at age 17 can be estimated at age 4. 
That, and research showing that early experiences at home impact 
learning later in life, led in part to the establishment of Head 
Start. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom went on to advance a theory that said all students are  
capable of learning if material is presented in a logical, 
systematic way. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, Bloom wrote 17 books and served as president  
of the American Educational Research Association.

<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Harry Crane, co-creator of Jackie  
Gleason's classic 1950s sitcom ``The Honeymooners'' and comedy 
writer for Red Skelton, the Marx Brothers, Bing Crosby and others, 
died Tuesday of cancer. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Crane died at his Beverly Hills home, according to publicist  
Warren Cowan. 
</P>
<P>
	The writer, who worked on movies as well as TV, had another link  
to Hollywood: He was the grandfather of actresses Melissa Gilbert 
(``Little House on the Prairie'') and Sara Gilbert (``Roseanne''). 
</P>
<P>
	The native of New York City was 19 when he started performing  
stand-up comedy. He was recruited by MGM as a screenwriter, earning 
his first credit on ``Air Raid Wardens'' (1943), starring Stan 
Laurel and Oliver Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Joe Bigelow were staff writers for ``Cavalcade of Stars''  
when Gleason, the variety show's new host, asked for help in 
developing a sketch. 
</P>
<P>
	Gleason told the writers he wanted to play an ``everyday working  
stiff'' who lived with his long-suffering wife in a little Brooklyn 
flat, according to the book ``Classic Sitcoms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two created a scene involving squabbling Ralph and Alice  
Kramden, and the couple became a variety show mainstay for Gleason 
and then in 1955 the basis for the 39-episode sitcom ``The 
Honeymooners.'' 

</P>
<P>
                         *Charles Crichton    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Charles Crichton, a director of comedy films in  
the 1940s and 1950s who made a resurgence with ``A Fish Called 
Wanda,'' died Tuesday at his home in the London neighborhood of 
South Kensington after a short illness, said his son, David 
Crichton. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Crichton directed 1946's ``Hue and Cry,'' the first so-called  
Ealing comedy, named after the west London film studio. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his best-loved Ealing productions was 1951's ``The  
Lavender Hill Mob,'' a classic about a timid bank clerk played by 
Alec Guinness who schemes to get even with his employer by 
masterminding a foolproof robbery. It featured a young Audrey 
Hepburn in one of its opening scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Crichton directed a steady stream of films throughout the '50s,  
but his career hit a setback in 1962 when an argument with 
producer-star Burt Lancaster during the making of ``Birdman of 
Alcatraz'' caused him to quit in mid-production. 
</P>
<P>
	``He Who Rides a Tiger,'' directed in 1965, wound up being his  
last feature film for 23 years, until John Cleese enticed him out 
of television work to direct ``A Fish Called Wanda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, at the age of 78, Crichton was nominated for an Academy  
Award as best director for ``Wanda,'' a comedy starring Cleese, 
Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis that rollicked along in the best 
Ealing tradition.

for the New York-based Journal of Commerce, died Sept. 6 from 
complications of diabetes. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies wrote several unpublished children's books and a  
science-fiction opus. His career as a police and maritime reporter 
included jobs at the (San Pedro) News Pilot and The (Torrance,

Grange Daily News for 34 years, died Monday of leukemia. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over as publisher on Sept. 1, 1961, Long dedicated  
the newspaper to attracting new and diversified jobs. He 
spearheaded a drive to organize a chamber of commerce, twice 
serving as its president. 
</P>
<P>
	Long and his fellow industrial authority members brought more  
than 40 new industries to La Grange, creating nearly 7,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>

editor of the New Statesman magazine, died Saturday at age 93.

	Smith landed a job for the British Broadcasting Corp.'s new  
weekly magazine, The Listener. She rose to assistant editor and was

<HEADLINE> Trashy Lingerie for the Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Where do L.A.'s most public personalities  
shop for their most private garments? 
</P>
<P>
	The Trashy Lingerie store, located on La Cienega Boulevard, is  
the preferred destination for stars seeking push-up bras, naughty 
nighties and scanty panties. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrities and their go-fers have shopped for movie costumes  
for more than 500 films, the owners said. Other stars have relied 
on Trashy's togs for music videos or for roles on television's 
``Melrose Place,'' ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' ``Veronica's Closet'' 
and ``Suddenly Susan.'' Still others come in search of the perfect 
little something for private moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daryl Hannah was here and bought some black lingerie with  
stockings. It was for a special night, though I can't say with 
whom,'' said co-owner Mitchell Shrier. ``Everybody comes in. It's 
Hollywood. That's why it's such a madhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwyneth Paltrow outfitted herself in a camisole with garters,  
G-string and marabou slippers, all in lipstick red. Liv Tyler, 
Winona Ryder and Drew Barrymore are ``very, very good customers,'' 
said Shrier's daughter-in-law Mary Shrier, who works in the store. 
The trio, she said, all swear by '50s-style undies with modest 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolly Parton dropped $8,000 in one spree, snapping up corsets as  
well as dresses, jackets and shoes.

<P>
	With about 8,000 items in stock, customers like Cher, Janet  
Jackson or Fran Drescher are certain to find something to their 
liking. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I decided to sell lingerie, instead of calling it The  
Best Lingerie Store in the World, I decided to go the other way,'' 
said Shrier, a large, white-bearded man who favors Hawaiian shirts. 
``You tell somebody `Trashy Lingerie' and they never forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before his wardrobe turned casual, Shrier wore a tuxedo daily,  
accessorized with black leather waistcoat and watch fob. This 
``ringmaster outfit'' was his sales uniform for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was talking to women, they would know I was actually  
working in the store, not just some guy hitting on them,'' he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrier launched the store in 1974, on the same site where he and  
his wife had been designing and selling sexy shoes that practically 
begged to be worn with stockings and a garter belt. Soon the couple 
was offering those accessories to meet star demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The store's celebrated window displays entice with the exotic  
and erotic. Two examples: a jungle scene of mannequins clad in 
safari bras and panties making soup out of a hunky male in a pot 
and an ``Austin Powers'' window crammed with '60s go-go dresses and 
windows scrawled with ``Shag me, baby'' and ``Shagarific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It won't cost you anything to take a peek at the window, but  
you'll need a $5 membership card to enter the hot-pink building. 
The store's motto is ``Our fantasy is fulfilling yours,'' and 
Trashy's inventory is priced to sell -- from $8 for a G-string to 
$125 for a satin chemise. 
</P>
<P>
	The store, which houses its own factory of designers and  
seamstresses, pulls in about $1.5 million retail annually. The Web 
site features Trashy-clad customers like Madonna, Geena Davis, 
Laura Dern, Juliette Lewis and Heather Locklear. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes lingerie so hot?  
</P>
<P>
	Shrier has this answer: ``You can wear it for more than one  
person. It has no fingerprints.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Greene Wins 100-Meter Race in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Already the world's fastest human, Maurice Greene  
is setting his sights on another title. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world-record holder in the 100 meters and winner of  
three gold medals at the World Championships, won the event 
Wednesday at the Super Track and Field meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main focus is to win the Olympic gold,'' said Greene, who  
edged fellow American Curtis Johnson in 10.35 seconds. Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That comes first, not a record. Right now, I have a goal of  
9.76 and the coach said I am capable of running faster, but I take 
small steps at a time. The most important is to win the Olympic 
gold. That's something I haven't done and I want to do.'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With his season over, Greene plans to return home to rest and  
visit his grandmother in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy I had a very good year,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	To say the least. He kept the world record with a time of 9.79  
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dream come true,'' he said of being the world's  
fastest runner. ``Now I can say I was a No. 1 once. Records are 
made to be broken and anything can happen in a 100-meter. I am 
thankful and try to be the best. I believe I am the best and as 
long as I keep believing in myself, I can improve myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 100-meter hurdles, American Larry Wade edged world-record  
holder Colin Jackson with a time of 13.50 seconds. Jackson placed 
second in 13.55 seconds, with Japan's Satoru Mizuno third in 13.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazuhiko Yamazaki of Japan won the 400-meter hurdles in 48.98  
seconds, followed by Joey Woody, who finished second in 49.16. 
Torrence Zellener of the Unites States was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulgaria's Petya Pendareva swept the 100- and 200-meter races.  
Pendareva took the 200 in 23.27, before winning the 100 in 11.36 
seconds.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq, Amex Web Sites Vandalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer hackers vandalized the Internet sites  
early today for Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange in a bold 
electronic affront to the world's financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	A group calling itself ``United Loan Gunmen,'' infiltrated the  
computer running the Web sites for Nasdaq and Amex just after 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	It was extraordinarily unlikely the hackers would have been able  
to manipulate any financial data within the exchanges. Nasdaq 
recently acquired the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the exchanges was not available immediately for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The hacker group left a taunting message saying it intended to  
``make stocks rise drastically, thus making all investors happy, 
hopefully ending with the investors putting bumper stickers on 
their Mercedez' that say 'Thanks ULG!''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Meanwhile, ULG members go back to flipping burgers at  
McDonalds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also claimed to have briefly created for itself an e-mail  
account on Nasdaq's computer system, suggesting a broad breach in 
the system's security. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty serious allegation,'' said Christopher  
Rouland, director of a team of computer security engineers, called 
X-force, for Atlanta-based Internet Security Systems Inc. ``It's 
difficult to say if it's accurate, but once you breach the 
perimeter, it certainly is easier to get into the infrastructure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq's Web site was run using software from Microsoft Corp.,  
called Internet Information Server, that has suffered several 
serious security problems during the past year. Microsoft has 
distributed patches in each case but relies on local computer 
administrators to install them correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	``System administrators can forget to install patches,'' Rouland  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another expert, Russ Cooper, said it's a mistake to assume that  
the Internet's most popular sites are secure from hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice if we could assume that a high-profile site  
would have better security people on staff,'' said Cooper, who runs 
the NTBugtraq discussion group on the Internet for security flaws. 
``Unfortunately, my experience is that's a hope, not a reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hacker group also had claimed responsibility earlier this  
week for the defacement of the Internet site for Matt Drudge, the 
Internet gossip columnist, and electronic attacks against C-Span 
last week and against ABC just weeks ago. All those organizations 
also used Microsoft's Internet Information Server to run their Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Rouland said the attacks on Nasdaq and Amex were likely to cause  
anxiety among computer professionals on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly will in the financial communities,'' he said.  
``People will notice, and it will cause a buzz. This is going to 
cause more people to pay attention to security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq trading volume averages about 800 million shares a day.  
</P>
<P>
	As global financial markets have expanded at a dizzying pace,  
Nasdaq has adopted an aggressive international strategy. Earlier 
this year, Nasdaq took over the Amex and announced plans to 
establish an electronic trading exchange in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq also has set up a joint Web site with Hong Kong's stock  
exchange that will allow U.S. investors to trade in Hong Kong 
securities, has signed a similar deal with the Australian Stock 
Exchange, and is looking into new alliances in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The global expansion by the world's second-largest stock market  
has sharpened its competition with the largest, the New York Stock 
Exchange, which uses a traditional trading floor.

<HEADLINE> Terrell Davis Injures Right Wrist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terrell Davis is unsure about his status for  
Sunday's game after he injured his right wrist in the Denver 
Broncos' 38-21 loss to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' wrist was bandaged when he arrived at Mile High Stadium  
Tuesday to film a soup commercial. He also was nursing a scrape on 
his back from the Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a physical game, but the game wasn't any more physical  
than games I've played in the past,'' said Davis, who gained 61 
yards on 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	The running back isn't sure when the wrist injury occurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just know that when I left the stadium, (the wrist) was  
stiff then,'' he said. ``When I woke up (Tuesday) morning, it was 
real stiff. I don't think it's broken or anything. But it's stiff, 
and it swelled up a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis will be a spokesman for Campbell's Chunky Soup, and a  
Davis label will adorn cans of the soup.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings' Yzerman Signs Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman has  
signed a three-year contract extension, team officials announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman's contract, which had been in a holding pattern since  
February, now runs through the 2002-2003 season. It will give 
Yzerman 20 seasons with the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years is nice,'' Yzerman told The Detroit News. ``But  
what I'm most pleased about is this team will be very competitive 
over the course of the next four seasons. I'm excited about playing 
for a team that will be a contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with the last year of his current contract, the deal  
will pay Yzerman an average of $7.5 million for the next four 
seasons, the Detroit Free Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman, 34, is entering his 17th season in the NHL, all with  
Detroit. He has been the Red Wings' captain since the 1986-87 
season, making him the longest-serving captain in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NHL record books, Yzerman ranks 11th in goals with 592.  
He is 10th in assists with 891 and ninth in points, 1,483. 
</P>
<P>
	He is eight goals shy of becoming the 11th player in NHL history  
to reach the 600 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's never considered playing for another team.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always envisioned playing my entire career in Detroit,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Will Fight Pale in Comparison? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad  
welterweight showdown will be the biggest grossing non-heavyweight 
fight in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Money talks, of course, but it doesn't always tell the entire  
story. 
</P>
<P>
	As an event, the modestly billed ``Fight of The Millennium,''  
doesn't match some fights involving the Fabulous Four of the 1980's 
-- Leonard, Hearns, Hagler and Duran. At least going in. 
</P>
<P>
	When any combination of the Fab Four got together, the public  
paid attention. De La Hoya-Trinidad has certainly attracted 
attention, but there doesn't seem to be the electricity generated 
by such fights as Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Duran on June 20, 
1980 at Montreal and Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns on Sept. 16, 1981, 
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, if the current pay-per-view situation existed in the  
1980s, at least three fights would have outgrossed Saturday night's 
match at Mandalay Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the Duran-Leonard, Leonard-Hearns fights and the  
Leonard-Marvelous Marvin Hagler match April 6, 1987 at Caesars 
Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other fights that would have been pay-per-view hits would  
have been the Leonard-Duran rematch Nov. 25, 1980, in the Superdome 
at New Orleans and the Hagler-Hearns bout April 15, 1985, at 
Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Pay-per-view has made big fights available to many more people,  
but it also has changed the sport in another way. Fighters, with 
huge purses guaranteed, have become less accessible to the media 
and, through the media, to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's the way of the sports world. Besides, what really  
counts is what happens in the ring, not in a news conference or an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya (WBC champion) and Trinidad (IBF champion), each 26  
and unbeaten, figure to give the paying public its money's worth. 
They've already earned their money -- De La Hoya is guaranteed $15 
million and Trinidad $10 million -- by selling out the 12,000-seat 
arena at Mandalay Bay and by making the fight what Mark Taffet of 
TVKO said will be one of the five top pay-per-view events ever. 
</P>
<P>
	It might not be as great a fight as the 1981 welterweight title  
match between Leonard and Hearns, to which it is being incessantly 
compared -- but it doesn't have to be in order to be a darn good 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard-Hearns I was such an attraction that it was shown on  
closed-circuit television at 298 sites with 1.5 million seats and 
on pay-per-view in 24 cities, with one million available homes. It 
also was telecast to 50 countries and drew a live crowd of about 
24,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard made about $13 million and Hearns a little more than $5  
million. Can you imagine what they could make today with 
pay-per-view blanketing the United States?. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a truly great fight, a fight of ebb and flow. Hearns, the  
WBA champion, stalked Leonard for the first five rounds, then was 
badly hurt by the WBC champion in the sixth and seventh rounds. 
With Leonard looking for a knockout, Hearns outboxed him until 
Leonard knocked him down in the 13th round, then stopped him in the 
14th. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a fight that will always be discussed by boxing buffs.  
Hopefully, Saturday night's will be such a fight.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Honors Go to Robards, Borge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Actors Sean Connery and Jason Robards will be  
saluted for lifetime achievement at this year's Kennedy Center 
Honors, along with singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder, dancer Judith 
Jamison and pianist-comedian Victor Borge. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22nd annual awards, announced Tuesday, will be presented  
Dec. 4 at a dinner at the State Department. The next day President 
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton will throw a White House 
reception for the recipients, followed by a gala performance at the 
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, taped for television 
broadcast later in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Robards, 77, and Connery, 69, are being honored for a wide range  
of acting. Connery, a Scot, first became known for his role during 
three decades as James Bond, Agent 007, in films based on Ian 
Fleming's novels. 
</P>
<P>
	Robards, born in Chicago, has performed in stage dramas from  
Shakespeare to Harold Pinter. He has won two Academy Awards, for 
his portrayals of The Washington Post's Ben Bradlee in 1976's ``All 
the President's Men'' and novelist Dashiell Hammett in ``Julia'' in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Borge, who turned 90 last January, made his debut as Borge  
Rosenbaum, a soloist at 14 with the Philharmonic Orchestra of his 
native Copenhagen. Already celebrated in the Nordic countries for 
his musical humor before he was 30, he fled the Nazi advance with 
his American wife and was soon performing with Ed Sullivan, Rudy 
Vallee and Bing Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
	Wonder, a songwriter and singer, is ``a musical genius who has  
been an integral part of American popular culture for the past four 
decades,'' said James A. Johnson, Kennedy Center chairman. At 49, 
he is the youngest of the five being honored. 
</P>
<P>
	Blind since birth, Wonder signed a contract at 11 in 1963 with  
Motown where as ``Little Stevie Wonder'' he began turning out hit 
records. He was instrumental in the movement to honor the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. with a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison, 56, is a dancer, choreographer and teacher who has led  
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater since its founder died in 
1989. She was his biggest star for 15 years. Ailey was honored by 
the Kennedy Center in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Plays in Pro Golf Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan was the epitome of confidence on  
the basketball court. Not on the links. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm nervous, man,'' Jordan whispered before teeing off on  
Wednesday at the LaSalle Banks Chicago Open -- his first foray into 
professional golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan entered the $150,000 tournament as an amateur, stirring  
speculation that he might be ready to enter another pro sport. 
</P>
<P>
	He was quick to admit he's not ready for big-time golf. And he  
proved it, shooting a first-round 84, 13 strokes over par. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty sure I'm out of my league, but it was fun,'' Jordan  
said. ``What I take away from it is that you have to maintain a 
certain focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Jordan was the biggest star playing in the three-day  
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just exciting to see him,'' said Teri Kozina, whose  
husband Gus was also playing as an amateur. She and the couple's 
6-year-old son, Eric, watched Jordan shoot a practice round on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got so carried away watching him practice, we had to make  
ourselves go back and give (his) dad some support,'' Kozina said.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Evacuees Fight Fear, Boredom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOUGLAS, Ga. (AP) -- Charity Boree didn't get much sleep after  
helping her mother evacuate nursing home residents from St. Simons 
Island to a shelter in Douglas, 90 miles away from the dangers of 
Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year-old helped get the 106 patients settled, then stayed  
up until 4 a.m. Wednesday directing other evacuees to the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hard night,'' she said later Wednesday as she waited  
out the storm with her mother, nurse Virginia Boree, at Douglas' 
First Baptist Church. Still, she was relieved to know that Floyd 
had turned away from Georgia and would likely spare her home in 
Brunswick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really scared,'' she said. ``I thought I'd come back to  
Brunswick and it wouldn't be there, and my house wouldn't be 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was one of about 11,000 evacuees from three states who  
crowded into 50 shelters across Georgia on Wednesday, fighting fear 
and boredom as they waited for the hurricane to pass. The Red Cross 
scrambled to open additional shelters as more evacuees poured into 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of others took refuge at hotels and motels, but by  
Wednesday there were virtually no rooms to be found anywhere in 
Georgia, which has more than 100,000 hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Hurwich of AAA Auto Club South in Atlanta was scrambling to  
find space for clients fleeing from neighboring states. He wasn't 
having much luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen anything like it,'' he said. ``It's worse than  
the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Governor's Office of Consumer Affairs heard complaints about  
gas stations doubling their prices and motels charging $145 for a 
$65 room, said Barry Reid, director of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said his office was investigating and would issue  
cease-and-desist orders to any businesses caught violating the 
state's anti-gouging law, enacted after floods in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time to be profiteering and taking advantage  
of people whose lives have already been upset,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Lattany of Brunswick had planned to find a motel for  
herself and seven relatives, including her four grandchildren, when 
they left home Tuesday. But after six hours of fruitless searching, 
they settled for a Red Cross shelter at a school in Nicholls, 15 
miles east of Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came expecting motels, showers. We found this shelter with  
a girls' locker room, three showers and no shower curtains,'' she 
said Wednesday as she used a crayon and her granddaughter's 
coloring book to pass the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Other people played cards, watched TV or read newspapers in the  
school's gym. 
</P>
<P>
	Lidiya Olsen of Jacksonville Beach, Fla., slept in her car  
outside the Nicholls shelter with her dog, which wasn't welcome 
inside for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Russia, she said leaving her home was hard. ``For  
the first time in my life, I had no house to live in. Life is hard 
in Russia, but I always had a place to stay,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At an Augusta shelter, Quincy Frazier of Early Branch, S.C.,  
played games with his children, prayed and read his Bible. He said 
he was eager to get home to see whether his property had been 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep listening at the weather forecast,'' he said. ``Thank  
the Lord (the storm) is losing a little bit of strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The community center where Frazier and his family were staying  
was at capacity with 217 evacuees, as were at least eight others in 
Augusta. But emergency officials opened the Augusta civic center 
Wednesday afternoon, making room for another 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're soliciting donations of food to feed them,'' said Rob  
Kiser, program manager for the Augusta Parks Department. ``We just 
had pizza delivered for 250 people.''

more we laugh at the absurdity of the body politic, the worse it 
gets. 
</P>
<P>
	From Anywhere, USA, to Washington, D.C., the halls of government  
seem replete with manipulators, liars and thieves running the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Greeks, the bad guys in these power plays aren't the  
ones drinking the poison to illustrate a moral point, though. 
Rather, the condition of American politics is poisoning us all. 
</P>
<P>
	We suffer from growing cynicism and lowest-common-denominator  
expectations for our leaders. We are, in essence, in a general 
state of ennui.

	The Daily Oklahoman, on the Waco investigation:  
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. John C. Danforth of Missouri is a good choice to run  
a new investigation into allegations of governmental misconduct in 
the 1993 Waco standoff that ended with the fiery deaths of 86 
Branch Davidians, including 24 children. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old, three-term Republican left Congress in 1996  
with a reputation fairness and compassion, no doubt because of law 
and divinity degrees he earned three decades ago at Yale. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Although Danforth's charge is to investigate official  
misconduct, his overarching mission is to restore public confidence 
in the Justice Department and the FBI, both badly tarnished by the 
Waco siege and fire. ... 
</P>
<P>
	We hope his investigation will settle, as quickly as possible,  
corrosive questions that should've been answered long ago, which 
instead have bred more cynicism about the government's exercise of 
power and authority.

	The News-Journal of Daytona Beach, Fla., on state drug plan:  
</P>
<P>
	Florida wants to do a lot more than ``just say no'' to drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	The ambitious goal of state drug czar James McDonough -- to cut  
drug use in half within five years -- is pure fantasy. But his plan 
for a balanced attack that emphasizes education and treatment over 
punishment is a long way from the state's earlier chaotic anti-drug 
tactics. ... 
</P>
<P>
	There's a lot to like in this half-billion dollar plan. ...  
</P>
<P>
	The main challenge with this plan may be keeping the emphasis on  
education and treatment. The Legislature has a long-term addiction 
to harsh punishment instead of rehabilitation for everything from 
youthful crimes to sexual offenders. If Gov. Jeb Bush and McDonough 
can keep the Legislature focused on education and treatment, they 
may be able to turn the corner on the state's surging drug problem.

	The Seattle Times, on PTSA for gays:  
</P>
<P>
	Inspiration for the PTA arose from a conference for married  
mothers in 1897. It took only two years for the women to realize 
they should make fathers feel welcome, too. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a century later, one particular group of people still  
feels profoundly unwelcome at school: parents or students who are 
gay or lesbians, or parents whose teenagers are gay or lesbian. The 
state Parent-Teacher Association will put Washington on the map 
when it formally approves what appears to be a first in the nation, 
the Gay Lesbian PTSA of Greater Puget Sound. ... 
</P>
<P>
	If it becomes a politically charged advocacy group, the Gay and  
Lesbian PTSA of Greater Puget Sound could polarize schools more 
than unify them. But if does what it intends -- provide support -- it 
will help children and their families bring strength to their 
schools.

<P>
	The culture of secrecy is alive and well on Capitol Hill. ...  
</P>
<P>
	The agencies that generated mountains of classified documents  
over the last 50 years have been ordered to declassify many of the 
documents for access by citizens. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators are pressing the White House to require that all  
the material declassified so far be re-examined to make sure that 
sensitive details about the U.S. nuclear arsenal don't slip out. 
...
</P>
<P>
	No one is in favor of giving away nuclear weapons files .... But  
the lesson of declassification in the 1990s is that those sensitive 
files aren't being declassified. ... 
</P>
<P>
	We hope that the anti-disclosure provisions are removed from the  
defense bill before it becomes law. It is overkill, and will set 
back ... access to knowledge about government activities.

</P>
<P>
	Although we can give thanks for NATO bombing that stopped Serb  
massacres in Kosovo, one thing seems sadly clear: There won't be 
any quick fix to the blood feud between Serbs and Kosovars. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Not only do many members of these two ethnic groups despise each  
other, Serbs as a group show little remorse over their Nazi-like 
actions upon an entire class of citizens. ... That's the 
pessimistic and, we suspect, accurate portrayal of Serb society 
given by Blaine Harden, a journalist with extensive experience in 
the Balkans, in a recent issue of The New York Times magazine. ... 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few repentant Serbs who talked to Harden explained  
why many of her countrymen still deny Serb atrocities in Kosovo: . 
...
</P>
<P>
	``For them, Albanians are not really human beings. The Serbs  
believe they are the chosen people. It is racism. I hate to say it, 
but it is like what the Germans did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs are not the only culprits. Many Kosovars too, judging from  
recent clashes in Kosovo with Serbs, are showing the same sort of 
blind hatred toward their neighbors. It all means this is one 
trouble spot that will be with us for years to come.

</P>
<P>
	In 1947, when Allen Funt hid his first microphone (then movie  
camera), he found a way to introduce Americans to each other in a 
way we found embarrassing and captivitating. That he also made it 
hilarious accounts for the longevity of ``Candid Camera'' and the 
multiplicity of its seemingly endless knock-offs. 
</P>
<P>
	Funt, who died (Sept. 5) at age 84, understood that a spoonful  
of giggles makes almost anything easier to take. 
</P>
<P>
	Funt's puckish sense of humor and keen eye brought us closer to  
each other. He taught us all to say, ``Smile! You're on Candid 
Camera.'' Best, he helped us all to see that, no matter how serious 
life can seem, it's often best when the joke is on us.

</P>
<P>
	Clinton moved toward his Chinese colleague on the question of  
Taiwan. The United States would not change its position that there 
is only one China. What appears to be only continuity, is a 
disguised signal to the politicians in Taipei, the definition of 
one statehood closely followed by a one-sided declaration of 
independence. That Beijing threatens to use weapons in such a case 
has more or less a ritual character, as does Washington's warnings 
of a Taiwan war. 
</P>
<P>
	With his political dealing Jiang Zemin, so-to-say, was handed  
some hard cash. The conservatives who wanted to use the WTO theme

trust in an inconstant Clinton, are now missing a weapon. Zhu can

<HEADLINE> Emmy Awards Top Nielsen Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The ceremony honoring television's best and  
brightest bombed -- on TV. Fox's telecast of the Emmy Awards drew 
the lowest ratings for television's big night since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Sunday telecast's estimated 17.4 million viewers was  
easily the most-watched program of the week, a lull before the 
upcoming storm of season premieres. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a Fox entertainment program has ranked No.  
1 during the week in all of Nielsen Media Research's measurements. 
But the audience was still 1.9 million people smaller than the one 
watching NBC's Emmy telecast last year. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, led last week by its twin ``60 Minutes'' broadcasts,  
narrowly won the week with a 6.7 rating and 12 share. Fox had a 6.6 
rating and 11 share, and was easily the most popular network among 
the advertiser-prized 18-49 audience. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was third with a 6.3 rating and 11 share, ABC had a 5.7  
rating and 10 share, and the WB and UPN tied with 2.2 ratings and 4 
shares. Pax TV had a 0.9 rating and 2 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox also got a jolt of negative attention from Sen. Joseph  
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, and former U.S. Education 
Secretary William Bennett. The two gave Fox its ``Silver Sewer 
Award'' for its ``tireless, tasteless and ongoing efforts to drag 
down network programming standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two politicians criticized the new Fox series, ``Get Real,''  
for showing a mother finding her teen-aged son in bed with his 
girlfriend. The show premiered last week to lackluster ratings, 
finishing in 50th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox issued a statement saying its programs had been rated  
appropriately under the industry's voluntary standards to warn 
viewers of content. The network said it respected viewers' freedom 
to choose their own entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and the ``NBC Nightly News'' tied  
for first in the evening news ratings race with 7.0 ratings and 16 
shares. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.0 rating and 13 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Sept. 6-12, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``Emmy Awards,'' Fox, 11.7; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 9.1;  
``60 Minutes II,'' CBS, 8.8; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 8.6; ``ER,'' NBC, 
8.5; ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' special, CBS, 8.5; ``Frasier,'' 
NBC, 8.5; ``Friends,'' NBC, 8.3; ``20/20-Friday,'' ABC, 8.0; 
``JAG,'' CBS, 8.0.

<HEADLINE> Outer Banks Faced Dennis, Now Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina's Outer Banks barely had  
time to recover from Hurricane Dennis before Hurricane Floyd forced 
another evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis blew away sand dunes and chewed up a half-mile of road on  
Hatteras Island before coming ashore as a tropical storm two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never really gotten out of the mode from the  
preparations that were in place from Dennis,'' said Dare County 
spokeswoman Dorothy Holt. ``So we're really just sort of moving 
into Floyd from Dennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the thousands of visitors on the Outer Banks -- a long  
whisker of islands just off the coast -- obeyed an evacuation order, 
according to emergency management spokeswoman Martha Wickre. Most 
businesses closed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Hatteras Island, Herb Anderson was keeping his fingers  
crossed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got everything tied up, boarded up and nailed down,''  
Anderson said at the marina where he works. 
</P>
<P>
	On Ocracoke Island, which was evacuated Tuesday, pub owner Buffy  
Warner said he couldn't recall a time when so many locals had left 
in the face of a storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Even by North Carolina standards, Floyd was considered unusually  
menacing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of strength and speed and force of the wind, it looks  
to be a once in a decade storm, or even longer,'' said state Public 
Safety Secretary Richard Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis began menacing North Carolina's coast Aug. 29, when  
upwards of 100,000 residents and visitors streamed off the state's 
middle and northern barrier islands. A slow-mover, Dennis stayed 60 
miles off shore as it drifted up the coast and then headed out to 
sea. Then it stalled and began backtracking. 
</P>
<P>
	It battered the Outer Banks for days with gale-force winds and  
14-foot waves, preventing evacuees from returning. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm came ashore at Cape Lookout on Sept. 3, drenching the  
middle of the state with more than 8 inches of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-two punch of Dennis and Floyd on North Carolina's  
coastline evoked memories of 1996, the year of Hurricanes Bertha 
and Fran. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm smart enough to know when Mother Nature's going to win,''  
said Paul Raspet, a college student stuck in traffic Wednesday 
while trying to leave the mainland coastal city of Wilmington. ``I 
saw what Fran did. I saw pine trees ripped out by the roots and 
thrown like toothpicks. I'm not going to take any chances and go as 
far west as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fran struck Sept. 5-6, 1996, causing 24 weather-related deaths,  
not all in North Carolina, and about $6 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fran followed Bertha, which struck July 12 in the same region.  
It caused $1 billion to $2 billion in damage and killed 10 people, 
two in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in 41 years that two hurricanes struck the  
North Carolina coast during the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	David Loewenthal of the National Weather Service office in  
Raleigh said the region's recent rate of hurricanes is way above 
normal, but he does not blame any global weather trends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a coincidence,'' he said. ``Let's hope the  
coincidence ends soon.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan met his match on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The retired basketball star, who helped the Chicago Bulls win  
six NBA titles with his extraordinary skills, looked decidedly 
ordinary during Wednesday's opening round of the $150,000 Chicago 
Open golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who entered the tournament as an amateur, shot an 84, 13  
strokes over par, and admitted he was overmatched as he seldom was 
on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty sure I'm out of my league, but it was fun,'' Jordan  
said. ``What I take away from it is that you have to maintain a 
certain focus. Not just for five or 10 minutes. It's four hours of 
solid focus, and every little putt means something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery of 100 or so cared nothing about the score, however.  
This was Michael Jordan, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just exciting to see him,'' said Teri Kozina, who had her  
6-year-old son, Eric, in tow as she watched Jordan's round. She and 
her son watched his practice round on Tuesday, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got so carried away watching him practice, we had to make  
ourselves go back and give dad some support,'' Kozina said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Gus, is a Chicago-area amateur who played in the  
tournament Wednesday. He shot 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other Jordan-watchers were former NBA player Quinn Buckner  
and Chicago Cubs Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, who made a special trip to Birmingham, Ala., when Jordan  
tried his hand at minor-league baseball, said he was on the golf 
course Wednesday to give Jordan moral support. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my second go-round,'' Banks said. ``Mike's always been  
so successful, I'm sure he'd do well as a pro if he wanted to. I 
think he has a lot of talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckner was more of a realist, saying he doesn't think Jordan is  
ready for the big time on the links. Golf pro Dewey Lewis agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a long, long way to go,'' said Lewis, who once gave  
Jordan golf lessons. ``Right now, he plays like what he is -- a good 
country club player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second round of the 54-hole event is scheduled Thursday and  
only the top scorers advance to Friday's final round. Jordan knows 
he's through after the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the game of golf,'' he said.

	``It's just exciting to see him,'' said Teri Kozina, who had her  
6-year-old son, Eric, in tow as she watched Jordan's round. She and 
her son watched his practice round on Tuesday, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got so carried away watching him practice, we had to make  
ourselves go back and give dad some support,'' Kozina said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Gus, is a Chicago-area amateur who played in the  
tournament Wednesday. He shot 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other Jordan-watchers were former NBA player Quinn Buckner  
and Chicago Cubs Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, who made a special trip to Birmingham, Ala., when Jordan  
tried his hand at minor-league baseball, said he was on the golf 
course Wednesday to give Jordan moral support. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my second go-round,'' Banks said. ``Mike's always been  
so successful, I'm sure he'd do well as a pro if he wanted to. I 
think he has a lot of talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckner was more of a realist, saying he doesn't think Jordan is  
ready for the big time on the links. Golf pro Dewey Lewis agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a long, long way to go,'' said Lewis, who once gave  
Jordan golf lessons. ``Right now, he plays like what he is -- a good 
country club player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second round of the 54-hole event is scheduled Thursday and  
only the top scorers advance to Friday's final round. Jordan knows 
he's through after the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the game of golf,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mich. State Bar Honors Gerald Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- President Gerald Ford, who worked as  
a lawyer here after graduating college, has been honored by the 
Michigan State Bar for his public service. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks Wednesday at the association's luncheon, Michigan  
Gov. John Engler said Ford has integrity that transcends partisan 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any president in living memory has been  
considered more trustworthy by both sides of the aisle,'' Engler 
said. ``We are proud of you, and we are proud you are one of our 
own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former president received two standing ovations.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who worked in Grand Rapids after attending Yale Law  
School, said he appreciated the recognition by his colleagues. In a 
speech, he criticized term limits, saying they negate voters' 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't like ... public officials or what they're doing,  
it's up to you, not the Constitution, to replace them with people 
more to your own liking,'' he said.

	Floyd Moving Closer to Southeast U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	COCOA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Monstrous Hurricane Floyd moved closer  
toward the Southeast, sending wind-whipped rains through Florida's 
deserted streets and leaving coastal residents from Georgia to 
Virginia bracing for a more severe thrashing. Early today, near 
hurricane force winds arrived at Cape Canaveral while the rest of 
Florida's eastern coast was met with tropical force winds and gusts 
up to 73 mph, said a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in 
Miami. Heavy rain fell from West Palm Beach to Cape Canaveral. 
Floyd's eye was expected to continue to swirl over the Atlantic 
Ocean before making landfall on Thursday at Wilmington, N.C.

	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of desperate refugees  
hiding in the sun-scorched East Timorese hills waited today for 
planes to drop the first food since militiamen and Indonesian 
troops forced them from their homes. People scavenged for food 
wherever they could find it, and thousands of refugees who have 
fled the provincial capital, Dili, to escape rampaging militias 
were without adequate food and water. Some people reportedly were 
subsisting on roots and leaves. Although houses burned today and 
sporadic gunfire was heard this morning, Dili was relatively calm, 
with phone lines and electricity restored to much of the city.

	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Federal forces regained control of  
one village in southern Russia and were making progress against 
Islamic militants who remained in four more, the Defense Ministry 
said today. The claims of success against rebels in western 
Dagestan comes only days after the government recaptured villages 
in central Dagestan, where militants had established their own 
version of Islamic law. Government troops took back the western 
village of Tukhchar last night, killing 30 militants in the attack, 
said Defense Ministry spokesman Viktor Gubry.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bell telephone companies won't be forced to  
lease to their rivals equipment used for high-speed Internet 
services but still will have to provide them access to parts of 
their local phone networks under action expected today by federal 
regulators. Long-distance companies and other upstart competitors 
had sought access to the local phone companies' equipment that 
delivers advanced telecommunications services. They had argued that 
such equipment is needed so they can roll out high-speed Internet

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Rain contaminated with mercury from coal-fired

report released by several environmental groups. Mercury is showing 
up in Chicago rainfall at levels 42 times greater than federal 
standards consider safe, according to Andrew Buchsbaum of the

much -- from anybody,'' said author Gary Lavergne, who worked with 
Johnston while writing a book about executed killer Kenneth McDuff. 
Johnston, 40, appointed an assistant U.S. Attorney in 1987, is at

<HEADLINE> Studies Find Housing Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blacks and Hispanics who have the same  
financial status and credit records as whites continue to face 
pervasive discrimination from home mortgage lenders, a study said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the Urban Institute study,  
combined with another report on lending, stands as evidence that 
``discrimination is not just alive and well but flourishing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo is using the findings to help fight Congress over proposed  
cuts in spending on housing discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Loan denial rates for blacks and Hispanics ``cannot be explained  
away by differences in creditworthiness'' or other legitimate 
factors, it says. Cuomo said: ``The only difference is the color of 
the skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Urban Institute used testers, including whites and one or  
more minorities, who applied for mortgage loans in separate 
interviews and presented similar credit histories, incomes and 
financial histories. 
</P>
<P>
	The report asserts that discrimination can begin early in the  
process, with minorities less likely to receive information about 
loan products and more likely to be quoted higher interest rates 
than whites. It provided no specific figures about alleged 
discriminatory practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a 41-city survey by the Association of Community  
Organizations for Reform Now found that 15.6 percent of whites were 
denied loans in 1998 compared with 33.8 percent of blacks and 28.5 
percent of Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mortgage lending discrimination is intolerable because it  
contributes to the vast home ownership gap that divides whites from 
minorities in America today,'' Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fritz Elmendorf, a spokesman for the Consumer Bankers  
Association in Arlington, Va., conceded a gap in loan approval 
rates but cited improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There hasn't been a catch-up but there's been very impressive  
progress,'' Elmendorf said. ``Banks are doing a number of things 
that are responsible for making more mortgages available to 
minority groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HUD officials said that the disparities are clear in the most  
recent statistics showing that in the second quarter of this year 
73 percent of white families owned their own home while just 46 
percent of black families and 45 percent of Hispanic families were 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo used the studies to pitch for more money for his  
department's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, which 
enforces the Fair Housing Act. That law bars housing discrimination 
based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, family status and 
national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton asked Congress to increase housing enforcement  
money to $47 million in fiscal 2000, from $40 million this year. 
The House voted to cut the total to $37 million. The issue is being 
considered by the Senate.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `American Beauty' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Now and then -- far too infrequently -- a film comes along that  
offers a sliver of legitimate wisdom about the condition of the 
family in 20th-century America. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Redford's ``Ordinary People'' (1980) did it. So did Ang  
Lee's ``The Ice Storm'' (1997). Now, director Sam Mendes' 
``American Beauty'' takes its place among the best family dramas of 
recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Subtle and harrowing, full of cockeyed humor and visceral pain,  
``American Beauty'' explores a modern family -- what makes it tick, 
and how each tick can herald the existence of a time bomb moving 
inexorably toward detonation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), writer for a booster-oriented ad  
magazine, is coping with early middle age. A comfortable, suburban 
life has left him self-indulgent and a bit disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've lost something,'' he says, ``but I don't know what  
it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is insolent and  
self-pitying, driven inside her frosty shell by years of rising 
anger at her husband and her lot. A real-estate agent who dresses 
and furnishes like a bon vivant, she nonetheless is so emotionally 
eviscerated that, when she cries, she simultaneously upbraids 
herself for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Their high-school-age daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is hovering  
near the junction of adulthood and troubled teen -- certain she's 
ugly, thoroughly disgusted at her parents' suburban artificiality. 
</P>
<P>
	Add a cryptic boy who lives next door named Ricky (Wes Bentley)  
and his strange parents, throw in a teen-age Lolita named Angela 
(Mena Suvari) and you have a potboiler that could go any direction. 
</P>
<P>
	And it does.  
</P>
<P>
	Lester encounters Angela, Jane's cheerleading buddy, and falls  
immediately and obviously in lust with her, much to his daughter's 
disgust. Jane catches Ricky watching her and is both repelled and 
fascinated. Carolyn flirts with her competitor (Peter Gallagher, at 
his oiliest). Ricky's Marine Corps father grapples with the 
presence of a gay couple in the neighborhood. Illicit lusts 
blossom. 
</P>
<P>
	If all this seems dizzying and disjointed, that's sort of the  
point. What unifies it all is Lester, who is either falling apart 
or finally waking up. His attraction for Angela and the confusion 
it produces sends him on a journey of self-destruction and 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	He molts convulsively from a randy Walter Mitty into some sort  
of rampaging suburban John Belushi, energized by the very things 
that should hurt him, watching his life unravel even as it becomes 
enjoyable again. 
</P>
<P>
	As matters hurtle toward their conclusions, it is Lester who --  
with both his vices and his formidable attempts at being honorable 
-- pushes them along. 
</P>
<P>
	Spacey's Lester is a wonderful, terrible junk pile of whimsy and  
rage, self-doubt and resurgent hormones. And Bening, who deserved a 
break after an unintelligible script scuttled her fine work in 
January's ``In Dreams,'' gives a career performance here. 
</P>
<P>
	Birch, whose emotions bubble quietly and sear viciously, plays  
Jane just right -- an adolescent struggling between wanting to love 
her parents and seeing their blemishes in stark relief, as only an 
offspring can. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Cooper and Allison Janney are just as spellbinding as  
next-door neighbors Col. Frank and Barbara Fitts. He is a barking, 
sinewy disciplinarian who'd just as soon bloody his own son as face 
up to his failings; her years of obedience have left her one tiny 
notch away from catatonia. And both Bentley and Suvari give 
performances of astonishing depth that are beyond their years. 
</P>
<P>
	As haunting piano and strings push this misfit block party to  
its agonizing climax, you know what's ahead, because Lester's 
narration told you at the beginning: He is going to die. Things 
will implode. But in what manner? 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Lester's end comes at his moment of redemption, and  
it resonates with quiet irony. His liberation becomes his undoing, 
but not before he has emerged as the kindest, most stouthearted 
person in a confused lot of misdirected souls. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the film such a desolate snapshot of American life is  
the normalcy of its dysfunction: Everybody's horrible and 
everybody's normal. ``American Beauty'' is American tragedy. In it, 
we can recognize ourselves. And the mirror is not only cracked; 
it's shattered and cannot be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``American Beauty,'' a Dreamworks release, is written by Alan  
Ball and produced by Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks. It is rated R.

<HEADLINE> Callaway Cuts Daly Loose  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	John Daly wants to lead a sober life. He'll have to do it  
without the support of Callaway Golf, which said Daly reneged on a 
deal to stay away from alcohol and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, the former PGA and British Open champion whose life has  
been as wild as some of his tee shots, lost his main sponsor 
Wednesday when Callaway tore up his contract after Daly refused its 
offer to help him with his addictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like him, we admire him, and we wish that he would get into  
a serious recovery program,'' said Ely Callaway, the 80-year-old 
chairman and a ``father figure'' to Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway declined to say when or where Daly started drinking and  
gambling again, only that it was confirmed by company employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of sadness around here,'' Callaway spokesman  
Larry Dorman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The split comes at the end of a difficult summer for Daly, who  
purposely struck a moving ball with his putter in the U.S. Open to 
make an 11 on one hole, then withdrew from the British Open and PGA 
Championship to get his life and game in order. 
</P>
<P>
	One source said Daly resumed drinking nearly two months ago, but  
denied it when confronted by Callaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway offered to pay for him to see a national expert on  
addictions, and the source said Daly went as far as the front door 
of the clinic before turning around. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to AA meetings every day,'' another source close to  
the situation said. ``He didn't feel like inpatient treatment would 
be any different the third time around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly was returning from Callaway headquarters in Carlsbad,  
Calif., to his home in Arkansas and couldn't be reached for 
comment. His agent, John Mascatello, referred questions to a 
statement posted on Daly's Web site -- gripitandripit.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``My commitment to live a sober life remains strong,'' Daly  
said. ``Alcoholism is a disease which will continue to challenge me 
the rest of my life. I accept the difficulties presented and hope 
that I will overcome whatever obstacles I face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was another sad turn in the career of Daly, one of golf's  
most exciting and volatile personalities since he came out of 
nowhere to win the PGA Championship at Crooked Stick in 1991, 
thrilling galleries with his ``Grip It and Rip It'' style that make 
him the longest hitter in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But for every 350-yard drive, there were incidents. Daly trashed  
hotel rooms in a drunken rage, tanked rounds in tournaments in 
which he received appearance money, or was forced to write 
outrageous scores on his card. 
</P>
<P>
	He took an 18 in the Bay Hill Invitational last year by hitting  
a 3-wood into the water six times. Four months ago, he six-putted 
from 8 feet on the 18th hole in the Memorial and stormed off the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad,'' Ernie Els said from Paris, where he is playing in  
the Lancome Trophy. ``He's a great friend of mine, and hopefully he 
knows what he's doing. He's a hell of a talent, but he needs to be 
happy with himself, and only John Daly knows what it will take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who says he started drinking when he was 8, first went  
through alcohol rehab in Arizona at the end of the 1992. He 
returned to win the British Open at St. Andrews in 1995. Two years 
later, he trashed a hotel room after a drinking binge during The 
Players Championship, and it really cost him. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson Sports canceled its contract, and Daly's second wife  
filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway took him on when everyone else abandoned ship, putting  
its Big Bertha products into the hands of a player who has led the 
PGA Tour in driving distance every year but one since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Callaway is like a father figure,'' Daly said when he  
returned to the tour in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's recovery has been very public. A year ago in Vancouver,  
he got the shakes so bad on the 15th hole in the first round that 
he cried uncontrollably. He gathered himself, made the par putt and 
finished the round. 
</P>
<P>
	In 19 events this year, Daly has missed the cut seven times,  
withdrawn four times and finished in the top 50 only four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to recover on the stage of one of the more  
stressful, difficult games on earth, and be a champion in front of 
millions,'' Callaway said in late July. ``I don't know of anybody 
who has ever tried to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly had two years remaining on his contract with Callaway,  
which was loaded with incentives for the later years. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway said there was an outside chance he could renew the  
contract with Daly if the golfer got help, but ``with his present 
attitude, we're not very hopeful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We care a great deal about John as a person, a golfer and a  
friend,'' Callaway said. ``Regrettably, we cannot continue to have 
John as a company representative when he is not prepared to take 
the future steps that we feel are necessary to deal with the 
alcohol and gambling problems facing him.''

<HEADLINE>  DaimlerChrysler Has Big Tech Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Putting their huge merger behind them,  
DaimlerChrysler executives on Wednesday proclaimed a ``new phase'' 
in the company's development spurred with $49 billion in spending 
on new products over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	All brands under the corporate parent -- Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler,  
Jeep, Dodge, Plymouth and Smart -- will be rolling out new products, 
DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Bob Eaton told reporters at the 
Frankfurt International Motor Show. The company plans to unveil a 
total of 64 new passenger and commercial vehicles across the globe 
by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the amount of spending was in line with the  
previous research commitments of both companies. Lincoln Merrihew, 
an analyst with BRIMcGraw-Hill, called the spending pledge a 
message that ``the momentum each company had before the merger will 
continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plans by the German-American automaker come in the wake of  
disappointing stock performance as earnings have come in below 
expectations. DaimlerChrysler's New York-listed shares slipped 
$2.50 Wednesday to $72.06 1/4, near its low for the year. The stock is 
well off its high of 108.62 1/2 reached Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports that a management shakeup is in the  
works aimed at trimming the company's large board of directors. On 
Wednesday, DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Juergen Schrempp declined to 
confirm specifics, but hinted change could be in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``An organization has to be continuously developed, and the same  
goes for the board of management,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp said the auto giant will not blend its various brands  
together, but work to preserve the association customers have with 
each different make. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp and Eaton staunchly defended the ailing Smart division,  
which produces tiny, two-seat cars sold only in Europe. Only about 
70,000 of the boxy coupes have been sold through the end of August, 
far short of a pace for predicted sales of 140,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The division also is in the middle of a management change.  
DaimlerChrysler announced Tuesday the resignation of Lars Brorsen, 
who had headed the Micro Compact Car division that makes the Smart. 
Schrempp said a successor will be named by early next week from 
within the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives said they were being patient to wait for profits  
from Smart until the second generation of models. ``We are building 
something new, investing for the future,'' Schrempp said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the new vehicles that could be rolled out may be a Smart  
four-seater, the officials said. A concept Smart roadster also was 
one of the hits of the auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new products that could be in the DaimlerChrysler lineup  
in the coming years may include a high-performance sport utility, 
sure to compete in that frenzied sector in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The bi-annual Frankfurt auto show is a forum for automakers to

<HEADLINE>  McNown Mum About Parking Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Cade McNown would like to say why he  
had a handicapped parking pass. He wishes he could explain why he 
shouldn't be lumped in with other players in UCLA's handicapped 
parking scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``But right now I can't because it's a legal matter,'' he said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-America quarterback, drafted 12th overall by the Chicago  
Bears last spring, was among five former or current UCLA players 
charged Monday with illegally possessing a handicap parking 
placard, a misdemeanor. Their cases were continued until Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen current or former Bruins have been charged as part of  
the disabled parking scam. Thirteen have pleaded no contest, and 
were ordered to pay $1,485 in fines and perform 200 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	``His case is so different from the others,'' Ron Safer,  
McNown's lawyer, said. ``He was a one-time applicant. He was 
injured. He did not falsify the signature. These factors put him 
outside the essence of this charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles city attorney's office, however, disagrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at these cases long and hard before we filed them,''  
deputy city attorney Brian Williams said. ``We know we can prove 
the cases, there's no doubt about that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're alleging there is a false name on the application, or  
the doctor who signed it says she didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation into the parking scam began Jan. 16 when a  
motorist with an improperly placed handicapped placard told a UCLA 
police officer he borrowed it from a football player. McNown wasn't 
among the 14 players originally charged, but the investigation was 
reopened after reports McNown also had a handicapped pass. 
</P>
<P>
	While his injury might have been legitimate -- the Orange County  
Register reported that a ``possibly torn ACL'' was listed as his 
disability -- the doctor whose signature appeared on the application 
told investigators she did not sign it and that McNown wasn't her 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cade did not complete that portion of the form,'' Safer said,  
adding that he can't say who did. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown did have a handicapped pass, Safer said, but he applied  
for it after he was injured during offseason training. He was still 
recuperating when he received the pass a few weeks later, Safer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never used it to park in a handicapped spot. He carried it  
with him only a handful of times when he was recuperating,'' Safer 
said. ``If he had it to do over again, because of the way others 
used stickers, he would not have applied for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown stopped carrying the pass once he got healthy, even  
though it was good until June 1997, Safer said. When he played in 
spring practice, the pass was in a drawer, Safer said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown never applied for another one, Safer added.  
</P>
<P>
	McNown, who didn't appear in court Tuesday, was upbeat after  
Wednesday's practice. He had an animated discussion with coach Dick 
Jauron as they walked off the field, and then addressed a large 
crowd of media around his locker despite not having much to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to ask football questions at this point, you're  
probably better off,'' he said. ``You'll get an answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While McNown admits the case is ``a distraction,'' Jauron said  
he hasn't shown it. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the general terms that we've ever spoken about it, he  
understands there's clearly something wrong with the general issue 
and the specifics of it,'' Jauron said. ``He's focused, and 
hopefully this will get cleared up real soon.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Davis Plans To Play Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis, his  
right wrist heavily taped, insisted the injury won't keep him out 
of Sunday's game at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was injured during the Broncos' 38-21 loss to Miami on  
Monday night, but he wasn't listed on the team's postgame injury 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know when it happened,'' he said. ``I just know that  
when I left the stadium, it was stiff. When I woke up Tuesday 
morning, it was real stiff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays proved negative, and Davis was confident that with  
treatment the rest of the week he won't be encumbered on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels pretty good,'' he said Wednesday. ``The motion was  
good this morning when I woke up. I treated it all night, so I 
don't expect to have any problems with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who led the NFL with 2,008 yards rushing last season but  
was limited to 61 yards on 19 carries by the Dolphins, was listed 
as probable on the team's injury report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis suffered minor shoulder and ankle injuries during the  
preseason, but he said he isn't concerned about the early onset of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not anything different from what I experienced last  
year,'' he said. ``I just have a bum wrist right now, but it's 
nothing major. I'm sure that when Sunday comes around, it shouldn't 
be a problem. Other than that, I feel fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At most, Davis said, he might wear a small wrap on the wrist on  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos listed 10 other players as probable on their injury  
list, including quarterback Brian Griese with thigh and shoulder 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty sore, but in the next couple of days I'll get my  
body back,'' the 24-year-old quarterback said. ``I'm still kind of 
young, so I think I can recover fast. I took a lot of hits, but in 
a game like that against a defense as good as theirs was, I 
expected that.''

<HEADLINE> Acid Rain May Prompt Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's attorney general threatened  
Wednesday to sue coal-fired power plants in the Midwest and South 
if they don't stop spewing pollution that causes acid rain and smog 
in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Air pollution simply knows no boundaries,'' Eliot Spitzer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits would be the first by a state attorney general  
against private companies in another state over pollution, Spitzer 
spokesman Darren Dopp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounded by images of belching smokestacks and acid-rain  
devastated forests, Spitzer said he would seek ``enormous'' damages 
from 17 plants in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and West 
Virginia if they do not reach an agreement with the state in two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused the plants of failing to upgrade equipment that  
cleans smokestack emissions when they made other big investments in 
their facilities, a requirement under the federal Clean Air Act. 
The plants produce a third of the emissions that come from their 
regions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for American Electric Power Co. -- which owns 11 of  
the 17 plants on Spitzer's list -- said AEP hasn't expanded plant 
capacity so it hasn't been required to make pollution equipment 
upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	``What AEP has done at our facilities meets the definition of  
maintenance,'' said AEP spokesman Pat Hemlepp. ``We're required to 
provide a reliable source of electricity for customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other industry representatives said they were confident that  
they would prevail in court against any New York lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	David M. Flannery, a spokesman for the Midwest Ozone Group, a  
coalition of coal and power companies, said much of the pollution 
in the Northeast is generated there, not carried by the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``There still isn't any good science showing otherwise,''  
Flannery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Brash, spokesman for the Cincinnati-based utility Cinergy,  
said, ``This simply is another in the 25-year continuing effort in 
the Northeast to blame their problems with air quality on other 
areas of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increased acid rain problems in the Northeast over the last  
20 years have been linked to sulfates and nitrates, which are 
products of coal-fired power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent federal studies indicate that 85 percent to 90 percent of  
the sulfates over the Middle Atlantic and New England states 
originate in Midwestern power plant emissions.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Gains in New York State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In a crucial early presidential primary  
state, Vice President Al Gore's once hefty lead over Bill Bradley 
among New York Democrats has vanished, a statewide poll said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was favored by 42 percent of Democrats questioned to 40  
percent for the former New Jersey senator, a statistical dead heat, 
according to the survey from the Quinnipiac College Polling 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the (New York) primary just six months away, Vice  
President Gore better get his incredible shrinking candidacy in 
gear and stop the Bradley fast break,'' said Maurice Carroll, 
director of the polling institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president led Bradley, 52 percent to 34 percent in  
July, and 47 percent to 38 percent in August, according to 
institute polls. 
</P>
<P>
	In a matchup with Republican presidential front-runner George W.  
Bush, Bradley led 47 percent to 37 percent. Gore, meanwhile, was in 
a statistical tie with the Texas governor: 46 percent for the vice 
president and 43 percent for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 911 New York voters was conducted Sept.  
7-13 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. The portion of the poll based on questions to 372 Democrats 
has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Farm Law Failing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration says the  
government's market-oriented farm law is failing and wants 
lawmakers to come up with a new way of subsidizing growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a farm policy that empowers farmers not only to  
survive, but to prosper,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law that ended a Depression-era system of crop  
subsidies has come under increasing criticism from Democrats and 
some farm groups after a second straight year of depressed 
commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	With Congress considering another multibillion-dollar bailout of  
the farm economy, Glickman told the House Agriculture Committee on 
Wednesday that it's time to change the way that federal farm aid is 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	He indicated support for a proposal by Rep. Charles Stenholm,  
D-Texas, to set up a new system of farm subsidies that would be 
tied to changes in crop yields and commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not lurch from one emergency bill to the next,''  
Glickman said. ``It is not good for the taxpayers and it is not 
good for agriculture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for corn and soybeans are at their lowest levels in more  
than a decade because of a worldwide glut of grain. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House budget office sent a letter to congressional  
leaders saying it ``generally agrees'' with the size of a $7.4 
billion farm-aid package approved last month by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the letter criticized both the way the money would be  
allocated to growers and its lack of disaster aid for 
weather-related losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also said Congress should address the ``fundamental  
shortcomings'' of the 1996 law. Clinton signed the law which was 
aimed at ending much of the government intervention in agriculture, 
moving towards a more market-based system and giving farmers the 
freedom to plant what they choose, but the administration has 
always maintained that farmers need some type of price support. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill was designed primarily to compensate farmers for  
low commodity prices, not damaged crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department estimates this year's drought has  
cost farmers $800 million to $1.2 billion, and is monitoring 
Hurricane Floyd for potential damage to crops that haven't been 
harvested yet, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some states this is the driest growing season in history --  
or at least since such records have been kept,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Democratic senators -- flanked by dozens of  
farmers from across the country -- demanded that Congress pass 
emergency farm relief and overhaul the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Congress cannot leave without acting on agriculture,''  
said Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. ``We cannot 
afford to wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money in the Senate bill would go toward doubling  
the annual ``market transition'' payments that farmers are 
guaranteed under the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said that shortchanges soybean growers, whose crop  
wasn't included in calculating those payments. And he said some of 
the payments go to producers who aren't even farming anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau  
Federation, said it's too late in the year to write a new subsidy 
program, such as the one Stenholm has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we gave the administration a new program like this to deal  
with, sure enough, we'd have them getting out the money eight 
months from now,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman also suggested other measures, including an expansion  
of the land-idling Conservation Reserve Program to take additional 
acreage out of production and subsidies for storing grain on farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 31 million acres is currently idled under the conservation  
program. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate negotiators are expected to begin work next  
week on the USDA spending bill that includes the farm assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, President Clinton vetoed a $4 billion farm-assistance  
package and forced Republican congressional leaders to spend 
another $2 billion.

<HEADLINE>  DaimlerChrysler Has Big Tech Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Putting their huge merger behind them,  
DaimlerChrysler executives on Wednesday proclaimed a ``new phase'' 
in the company's development spurred with $49 billion in spending 
on new products over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	All brands under the corporate parent -- Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler,  
Jeep, Dodge, Plymouth and Smart -- will be rolling out new products, 
DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Bob Eaton told reporters at the 
Frankfurt International Motor Show. The company plans to unveil a 
total of 64 new passenger and commercial vehicles across the globe 
by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the amount of spending was in line with the  
previous research commitments of both companies. Lincoln Merrihew, 
an analyst with BRIMcGraw-Hill, called the spending pledge a 
message that ``the momentum each company had before the merger will 
continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plans by the German-American automaker come in the wake of  
disappointing stock performance as earnings have come in below 
expectations. DaimlerChrysler's New York-listed shares slipped 
$2.50 Wednesday to $72.06 1/4, near its low for the year. The stock is 
well off its high of 108.62 1/2 reached Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports that a management shakeup is in the  
works aimed at trimming the company's large board of directors. On 
Wednesday, DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Juergen Schrempp declined to 
confirm specifics, but hinted change could be in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``An organization has to be continuously developed, and the same  
goes for the board of management,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp said the auto giant will not blend its various brands  
together, but work to preserve the association customers have with 
each different make. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp and Eaton staunchly defended the ailing Smart division,  
which produces tiny, two-seat cars sold only in Europe. Only about 
70,000 of the boxy coupes have been sold through the end of August, 
far short of a pace for predicted sales of 140,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The division also is in the middle of a management change.  
DaimlerChrysler announced Tuesday the resignation of Lars Brorsen, 
who had headed the Micro Compact Car division that makes the Smart. 
Schrempp said a successor will be named by early next week from 
within the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives said they were being patient to wait for profits  
from Smart until the second generation of models. ``We are building 
something new, investing for the future,'' Schrempp said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the new vehicles that could be rolled out may be a Smart  
four-seater, the officials said. A concept Smart roadster also was 
one of the hits of the auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new products that could be in the DaimlerChrysler lineup  
in the coming years may include a high-performance sport utility, 
sure to compete in that frenzied sector in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The bi-annual Frankfurt auto show is a forum for automakers to  
showcase models largely intended for the European market -- 
emphasizing compact cars that meet the demands of customers in 
crowded European cities interested in fuel efficiency and fitting 
into small parking places. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler lacks a model selling in that highly competitive  
segment between Smart and Mercedes. At the show, Chrysler showed a 
concept car that looked much closer to a production vehicle than a 
futuristic designer's dream. Eaton said the Java could possibly be 
a part of the company's future small car strategy.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Fall on Fed Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Stocks fell in Europe Wednesday as traders worried  
about a possible interest rate increase by the Fed next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies fell 1.07  
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 311.33. 
</P>
<P>
	A report Tuesday showing strong consumer spending in the United  
Staets helped fan fears that the Fed may raise rates when it meets 
again in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chance of a rate rise by the Fed in October is still on  
the table,'' said Mark Wall, equities economist at Deutsche Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed down 0.82 points 
at 328.85. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 9.33 points to 3,816.53,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 9.22 points at 3700.92. 
</P>
<P>
	In European markets, Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.3 percent,  
with software company SAP down 3.8 percent. However, energy 
companies Veba and Viag were higher, after a report, on which the 
companies declined to comment, claimed a merger of the two would 
result in an even split of their boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris and London bourses were the worst performers, with a  
drop of 0.8 percent in both the CAC-40 and FTSE 100 indexes.

	In London, heavyweight oil stocks came under pressure, with BP  
Amoco and Shell closing down. Crude oil futures came under pressure 
amid profit-taking and some bearish comments from Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez, who said oil prices shouldn't rise too much.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Jams As Residents Flee Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- First came the hurricane warnings. Then  
came the traffic. Hours and hours and hours of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the Southeast, the bumper-to-bumper traffic jams from the  
biggest peacetime evacuation in U.S. history spawned fierce 
criticism of both politicians and emergency planners. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, first-term Gov. Jim Hodges was blamed by  
those who said he waited too long to turn Interstate 26 into a 
one-way road inland. The highway backed up quickly after Hodges 
ordered an evacuation at noon Tuesday that affected an estimated 
800,000 people in coastal areas. Traffic continued at a crawl 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. John Graham Altman, a Charleston Republican and a  
consistent critic of the Democratic governor, accused Hodges of 
``incompetence and ineptitude of epic proportions'' and called I-26 
a ``Hodges parking lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Altman suggested future evacuations be taken out of the  
governor's hands, ``because he can't handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One evacuee, Pat Wylie, said it took his brother-in-law 10 1/2  
hours Tuesday to get from Charleston to Greenville -- a trip that 
usually takes 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the politicians had a clue,'' he said. ``They  
evacuated everybody, and they had no plan for the numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., was more blunt. ``What  
you're doing is running the risk of killing my people. It was 
terrible,'' he said in an uncharacteristic attack on Hodges, a 
fellow Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges said the disaster plan developed by the state after  
Hurricane Hugo struck in 1989 did not call for opening both sides 
of the highway. He said experts had questioned the safety of 
opening the highway's eastbound lanes to westbound traffic -- 
concerns that were echoed by state transportation officials Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `I hear what you're saying, but I think the bigger  
public safety issue right now is those people stranded on the 
Interstate,''' the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2.6 million people in South Carolina, Florida and  
Georgia were urged to flee the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, traffic backed up 30 miles or more as 1.3 million  
people left their homes. One motorist reported taking five hours 
for a usual 30-minute drive across Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Jebbie Bush, the 15-year-old son of Gov. Jeb Bush, told his  
father it took him eight hours to get from Jacksonville Beach to 
Tallahassee, about twice as long as normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Highway Patrol turned down a request by Jacksonville  
Mayor John Delaney to reverse the eastbound lanes of Interstate 10 
to allow for additional westbound traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, Karlene Barron of the state Transportation  
Department said the highways were mostly clear Wednesday, with some 
congestion on I-20 caused by people coming from South Carolina. On 
Tuesday, both sides of I-16 were opened to westbound evacuees. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, some people gave up, pulling over to sleep in  
their cars on the shoulder of the road. Every mile or two a car was 
parked along the side of I-95. Someone even left behind a boat with 
two outboard engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie Simmons, 22, of Charleston, said it took the 10 people  
in her van 12 hours to reach a Columbia shelter. She said she was 
disgusted to see people urinating along the road as they waited in 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was funny when people started walking along  
offering toilet paper to people with young children,'' Simmons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints were so numerous that The (Charleston) Post and  
Courier created a bulletin board on its Internet site so people 
could vent their frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not once did I hear of any instructions by public officials to  
the general public as to what to expect. I had no idea when I 
joined the exodus that a two-hour drive would become 13 1/2 hours,'' 
one woman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges waited until almost 7 p.m. Tuesday before ordering that  
I-26 be turned into a one-way highway leading out of Charleston, 
but it took almost three hours to complete the switchover. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is that the plan didn't work because there was so  
much traffic on the interstate,'' Hodges said. ``We're dealing with 
a problem that no one has had to deal with before, nothing of quite 
this magnitude.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson, Jones Benefit in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Michael Johnson will get a chance to replicate his  
historic sprint double in Sydney next year, and Marion Jones will 
be able to chase a record five gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Jones were among the main beneficiaries of the track  
and field competition schedule announced Wednesday for the 2000 
Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule allows Johnson to defend the titles he won in the  
200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, where he became the 
first man in history to sweep both events at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the sport's top female star, will have the opportunity to  
bid for gold in the 100, 200, long jump and both relays. 
</P>
<P>
	The timetable also clears the way for doubles by American  
sprinter Maurice Greene, the world champion in the 100 and 200; 
Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, world and Olympic champion at 10,000 
and world record-holder at 5,000; and Russia's Svetlana Masterkova, 
the 1996 Olympic champion in the 800 and 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation, the sport's  
governing body, arranged the schedule specifically so top stars 
could compete in more than one event. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said particular attention was  
given to accommodating Johnson and Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who set a world record of 19.32 seconds in the 200 in  
Atlanta, struggled with injuries and other setbacks for much of the 
next three years. But he reasserted his greatness at last month's 
World Championships in Seville, Spain, breaking the 11-year-old 
world record in the 400 with a clocking of 43.18. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most highly anticipated races in Sydney would be a  
200-meter showdown between Johnson and Greene, the 100-meter world 
record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, meanwhile, won the 100 in Seville, but her bid for four  
golds was dashed when she settled for bronze in the long jump, her 
weakest event. Jones' season came to an end when she collapsed with 
back spasms in the 200 semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Sydney schedule, Jones will be able to complete both  
the 100 and 200 before the long jump final. The physical strain of 
jumping was blamed for her injury in the 200 in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney schedule includes a rest day between the qualifying  
rounds and finals of the triple jump, as well as other jumping 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	The timetable allows at least one rest day between semifinals  
and finals of races of 800 meters and more, and the 400 meter 
hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	Track and field events in Sydney will be held from Sept. 22 to  
Oct. 1, with a day off on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``This schedule protects the rights of the athletes to compete  
at the highest level without incurring any risks to their health, 
while offering spectators a balanced distribution of finals 
throughout the nine days of competition,'' IAAF president Primo 
Nebiolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule was approved Tuesday in Monte Carlo, Monaco, by the  
IAAF's technical delegates and representatives of the Sydney 
organizing committee, ending a protracted dispute between the two 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney officials, accusing the IAAF of dragging its feet on the  
schedule, put tickets on sale earlier this summer based on a 
timetable that had not been authorized by the world body. The IAAF 
criticized SOCOG and said it wanted to make several changes, mainly 
to allow for a rest day between the semifinals and finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the final schedule, 11 finals were moved to different days  
than those on the ticket order form. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sydney won its main battle: The date of the women's 400  
final -- Sept. 25 -- remains unchanged. The women's 400 is the 
highest demand event in Australia because Cathy Freeman, 
Australia's two-time world champion, is expected to be a favorite 
for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made an exception for the 400 meters out of respect for the  
Australian public,'' Reineri said. ``But the principle of having a 
day of rest was respected in all other events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the schedule negotiations had nothing to do with  
the IAAF's long-running demands for free tickets and a greater 
share of Olympic TV revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Those matters will be addressed later this month at a meeting  
between Nebiolo and International Olympic Committee president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch.

<HEADLINE> Panel Eyes Curbs Vs. Web Hate Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After hearing the Internet described as a  
``terrorism tutor,'' the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee 
advocated pressuring Internet providers to prohibit violent groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders from several civil rights groups told a committee  
hearing Tuesday that hate groups are thriving on the Internet 
because it is inexpensive and widely available. But they opposed 
censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Hate groups sponsoring computer sites were linked to a gunman  
who carried out a string of drive-by shootings in July in Illinois 
and Indiana and to arsonists who burned three synagogues in June 
around Sacramento, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1999, the Internet can serve as a terrorism tutor,'' said  
Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Internet providers should be as creative in blocking  
access to sites as they were in creating the network and commended 
Yahoo.com for recently banishing 70 sites hosted by hate groups. 
</P>
<P>
	To encourage Internet providers to banish World Wide Web sites  
inciting violence, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the committee 
chairman, proposed legislation similar to that already in place to 
eliminate child pornography sites. The providers could get 
protection from civil lawsuits in exchange for dropping the sites, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet providers were invited to the hearing but did not  
attend, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional attention followed an explosion of computer-savvy  
hate groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Poverty Law Center of Montgomery, Ala., which  
counted one computer hate-group site in 1995, reported 254 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Residents Flee Hurricane Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- They fled by the thousands, or tried  
to. Instead, their mass exodus became a giant gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Running from Hurricane Floyd, residents came bearing TVs, VCRs,  
dogs, photos and even a caged cockatiel, buckled into the passenger 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
	They pulled trailers, boats and wooden wagons, only to sit for  
hours Tuesday on Interstate 10 in a stalled line stretching nearly 
200 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is insane,'' said Vicki Drake, whose family was traveling  
in a four-car caravan that included the seat-belted bird. Where 
were they going? Mrs. Drake just laughed. ``We're not sure. Just 
west somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West seemed to be the direction favored by much of Florida as  
Floyd rumbled up the coast, spreading more panic than bad weather. 
Jacksonville was expected to get heavy winds and rainstorms early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 10 is the only major westbound highway out of  
Jacksonville, which is the last big city before hitting Georgia's 
state line. The airport began cutting flights Tuesday evening, 
curtailing the biggest escape route on Florida's Atlantic coast. 
Airports in Miami, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale closed hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	And so Jacksonville, which hasn't seen a destructive hurricane  
since Dora blew through 35 years ago, became a traffic bottleneck, 
clogged not only by its residents, but by people running from as 
far as Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At a rest stop on I-10, just west of Jacksonville, the parking  
lot overflowed with hundreds of cars filled to the roofs with 
snatched mementos and supplies, looking like a modern-day version 
of ``The Grapes of Wrath'' complete with cellphones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rhodes family left Jacksonville Beach at 9 a.m. It took them  
nearly seven hours to travel 35 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Rhodes didn't want to leave, but her grown son, Ben,  
threatened to tie her to the car, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived there 50 years through Dora, and the worst that  
happened was my fence blew down,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son shook his head and jerked his thumb toward his mother.  
``I told her we weren't messing around with this one,'' he said. 
``This one is bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So they packed photos, clothes, food, the VCR, the CD player and  
all of Ben's compact discs. ``Three boxes of them,'' laughed his 
wife, Colleen. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother-in-law snorted. ``We brought so much stuff, I said,  
`Why don't we just hook the house up to the bumper.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Many at the rest stop said they'd called ahead to Tallahassee,  
but were told there were no hotel rooms left. 
</P>
<P>
	Local radio stations warned there wasn't a room to be found  
within a 120-mile radius of Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone headed north first,'' said Ben Rhodes. ``Now everyone  
is going west. We don't even know where we are going. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going that way,'' he said, pointing to the blinking  
rows of tail lights headed towards Tallahassee.

<HEADLINE>  Terrell Davis Injures Right Wrist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terrell Davis is unsure about his status for  
Sunday's game after he injured his right wrist in the Denver 
Broncos' 38-21 loss to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' wrist was bandaged when he arrived at Mile High Stadium  
Tuesday to film a soup commercial. He also was nursing a scrape on 
his back from the Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a physical game, but the game wasn't any more physical  
than games I've played in the past,'' said Davis, who gained 61 
yards on 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	The running back isn't sure when the wrist injury occurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just know that when I left the stadium, (the wrist) was  
stiff then,'' he said. ``When I woke up (Tuesday) morning, it was 
real stiff. I don't think it's broken or anything. But it's stiff, 
and it swelled up a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis will be a spokesman for Campbell's Chunky Soup, and a  
Davis label will adorn cans of the soup.

<HEADLINE> Chris Perry Defending PGA Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENDICOTT, N.Y. (AP) -- Last year, Chris Perry notched his first  
PGA victory in the B.C. Open. Now the sky seems to be the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last three years have been very, very consistent, and I'm  
trying to get my game to another level,'' Perry said as he prepared 
to defend his B.C. Open title starting Thursday. ``The consistency 
is there. I'm there a lot in the top 10. But I haven't won (again), 
which is disappointing, and I just missed out on the Ryder Cup 
(team), which was really my goal, to play my way onto the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would seem that goal is attainable. Perry leads the PGA Tour  
in birdies, and is 10th in putting, greens in regulation, and total 
driving. He also ranks 13th in scoring average (69.95). 
</P>
<P>
	His excellent play also has seriously fattened his bank account.  
He has earned $1.6 million in 1999, 10th on tour and more than 
double last year, which was by far his best since joining the tour 
full-time in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at my stats, and I'm driving it longer and straighter,  
hitting more greens,'' Perry said. ``And when you do that, you're 
having more chances for birdie and fewer chances of having to get 
the ball up and down, so your scores are going to be better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry's B.C. Open victory last September came one week before  
his 37th birthday, and in his 377th career tour start. Not only did 
it give him a huge boost of confidence, it has elevated his status 
on tour and contributed greatly to his improved play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts me into that winners' category,'' said Perry, fresh  
from a two-week vacation. ``That's another big thing, the fact that 
for all those years, you never really got a chance to play with the 
elite players on the tour unless you played well in the tournament 
Saturday and Sunday because of the way we pair for the first two 
rounds. They have the categories 1, 2 and 3, and if you're not in 
the winners' category you don't get paired with Tom Lehman and Lee 
Janzen and these guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in that category, you do see how they play, you  
mentally take notes and you have to realize that everybody misses 
shots. Everybody has a misconception out here that they play 
perfect all the time. That's not the case. It's how you react to 
situations where you make bogey or double bogey, just being able to 
hang in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, son of former major league pitcher Jim Perry and nephew  
of Hall of Famer Gaylord Perry, has seven top-5 finishes this year, 
including a second in his most recent start, the Reno-Tahoe Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, it seems week in and week out I'm more comfortable with  
my game,'' he said. ``There is room for improvement, but when I tee 
off every week I feel like I've got a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd was expected to play havoc with the first two  
rounds and already had had an effect by Wednesday. Payne Stewart, a 
member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team and the third-ranked money-winner 
on tour this year, was unable to fly north from his Florida home 
because of the huge storm and had to cancel his appearance.

<HEADLINE> London Theater: Veteran Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Veteran stars, new plays and the British premiere  
of the Disney smash musical ``The Lion King'' are among the theater 
offerings on tap for London this fall, an attempt to reverse what 
many have seen as a sluggish year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a less-than-colorful summer,'' conceded Bill  
Kenwright, the West End producer of ``Blood Brothers'' and many 
other shows. ``I think the autumn's going to be fascinating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly will be busy.  
</P>
<P>
	Between now and Christmas, as many as 40 major openings will be  
competing for audiences. They range from highbrow, limited-run 
revivals (Tara Fitzgerald in Sophocles' ``Antigone,'' opening Oct. 
11 at the Old Vic) to the European debut of the Tony-winning ``Lion 
King,'' a $10 million behemoth that bows Oct. 19 at the Lyceum. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does feel like an incredible occasion,'' said Josette  
Bushell-Mingo, the Londoner who stars as the shaman Rafiki in the 
musical. Director Julie Taymor's 46-strong cast is entirely 
separate from the ensemble that opened to ecstatic reviews on 
Broadway nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	This version, Bushell-Mingo said, is for people who cannot go to  
New York or Tokyo, where the show also can be seen. ``Everyone is 
open to the fact that this is a new English ensemble,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many major London musicals -- the Broadway transfer of ``Fosse,''  
for example -- are waiting until 2000 to escape the shadow of ``The 
Lion King,'' which sold out long ago. But an array of other new 
plays and revivals are available. 
</P>
<P>
	The musicals that are braving concurrent debuts tend to be as  
modest as ``The Lion King'' is huge (``Spend, Spend, Spend,'' with 
one-time ``Blood Brothers'' star Barbara Dickson, opening Oct. 12 
at the Piccadilly) or retreads of time-tested warhorses (``The 
Pajama Game,'' with sets by American artist Frank Stella, opening 
Oct. 4 at the Victoria Palace). 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Ayckbourn, the prolific English playwright who turned 60  
this year, opens play No. 53 at the Lyric Theater on Oct. 13. Its 
name, like most Ayckbourn material, is ``Comic Potential.'' It 
pairs English actress Janie Dee with David Soul, who starred on TV 
in ``Starsky and Hutch'' and now lives in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about the nature of being human -- the nature of love, the  
nature of laughter,'' writer-director Ayckbourn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other veteran dramatists joining Ayckbourn on the West End this  
fall include Ronald Harwood, with ``Quartet,'' and Alan Bennett, 
with ``The Lady in the Van.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think one has to be avant-garde all the time or  
revolutionary,'' said Harwood, the 65-year-old author of the play 
and subsequent film ``The Dresser.'' ``One simply wants to write 
plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newly opened at the Albery, ``Quartet'' takes a comic yet rueful  
look at four retired opera singers living in an English old age 
home. Donald Sinden stands out as an indomitably randy baritone 
determined to bluff and bluster his way to the grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's play opens Dec. 7 at the Queen's. Its star is Maggie  
Smith, heading a cast of 12 in the role of the real-life woman who 
parked her van in Bennett's north London garden and lived in it for 
years until she died. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Mirren opens in late November at a theater to be  
confirmed, inheriting Uta Hagen's off-Broadway role as a legendary 
writer in American dramatist Donald Margulies' ``Collected 
Stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anne-Marie Duff completes the cast of two under the direction of  
Howard Davies, who had a Broadway smash this past season staging 
Kevin Spacey in ``The Iceman Cometh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zoe Wanamaker, a Broadway sensation in ``Electra,'' stars in a  
historical drama, ``Battle Royal,'' from English writer Nick 
Stafford. Opening Dec. 8 at the Royal National Theater's Lyttelton, 
the play also features Brendan Coyle, the tenderly observant 
bartender in the acclaimed Irish play ``The Weir'' by Conor 
McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson opens his next play in December at the Royal Court  
Theater in Sloane Square, which has been rebuilt at a cost of about 
$40 million. Entitled ``Dublin Carol,'' the play stars Brian Cox, 
an alumnus of McPherson's solo show, ``St. Nicholas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining ``Antigone'' as an eagerly awaited revival is a new  
staging of Sean O'Casey's Irish classic ``Juno and the Paycock,'' 
with film and TV actor Colm Meaney (``The Commitments,'' ``Star 
Trek: Deep Space Nine'') marking a rare return to the British 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The play doesn't need rewriting,'' said Meaney, the  
46-year-old Irishman whose home is Los Angeles, explaining his 
attraction to the project. Director John Crowley's revival opens a 
six-week run Sept. 20 at the studio-sized Donmar Warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't need fixing. It's sort of there,'' Meaney said,  
``so I thought, `Why not?'''

<HEADLINE> Stanford President Stepping Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- The president of Stanford University has  
announced he will step down next year as head of the prestigious 
university, but he said he won't go too far. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerhard Casper, a 61-year-old constitutional law scholar, said  
Tuesday that he will resign next summer, take a sabbatical and then 
return to teach at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always carry the Constitution with me, as is well known. And  
the 22nd Amendment says eight years is the maximum for the 
president of the United States. If eight years is good enough for 
the president of the United States, it's good enough for me,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casper has recently faced criticism over the financially  
troubled merger of Stanford's teaching hospital with the University 
of California at San Francisco's hospitals. Together, they lost $60 
million in the second year after the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	While president of Stanford, a job that paid him $375,622 last  
year, Casper has focused on improving undergraduate curriculum, 
launching a new program for freshmen and sophomores that encourage 
mentoring relationships between students and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
	Provost John Hennessy said Casper has shown that a university  
president can provide dedicated leadership while maintaining 
intellectual vitality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I particularly admire his active engagement with the academic  
programs of the university as well as his significant interaction 
with individual faculty and students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casper said he had no regrets for his time at the top.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let me invoke my favorite adjective in student's use these  
days for anything they like: awesome. This is an awesome university 
and I have had no disappointment.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Schilling Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Philadelphia ace Curt Schilling, scratched from  
his scheduled start Monday, will not pitch the rest of the season 
because of shoulder trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reoccurrence of an old problem, I don't want to shut it  
down, it was a decision made by the general manager, the manager, 
the trainer and me,'' Schilling said Wednesday. ``I just never got 
any better. No one knows exactly what the problem is, I just have 
to rest it until it gets better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling (15-6) leads the team in victories, complete games (8)  
and strikeouts (152). He pitched 180 1-3 innings this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I care about those guys, they give up their bodies for the  
team,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona said. ``But we have to do 
what the docs say. It's a biceps problem and some tendinitis and it 
just moved around. He's just not recovering. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling's 3.54 ERA is the eighth-best in the league. He is  
second in the NL in complete games behind Arizona's Randy Johnson 
(11). 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling last pitched Sept. 8 against Houston at Philadelphia,  
allowing four runs and five hits in 5 1-3 innings. He was scheduled 
to start against the Astros on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies, 69-77 after snapping an 11-game losing streak  
Wednesday against Houston, have been eliminated from postseason 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Schilling led the majors in strikeouts (300),  
complete games (15) and innings (268 2-3). He became only the fifth 
major league pitcher to strike out 300 in consecutive seasons.

<HEADLINE> House Gets Atlanta Olympics Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Organizers of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics gave a  
House investigating panel Wednesday a revised report on the bidding 
practices they used to win the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, prepared by former Attorney General Griffin Bell,  
was delivered to the House commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations, which is examining the Atlanta bid in the wake of 
disclosures that organizers of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake 
City gave out scholarships or cash to woo IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, declined  
to release the report, saying through an aide that he was honoring 
a request from Bell that Atlanta officials be permitted to disclose 
the report Thursday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	But one source, who asked not to be identified, said the report  
provides a detailed and factual accounting of all the city's bid 
activities, including a list of every gift worth $100 or more that 
Atlanta officials provided IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Echols, a spokesman for the Atlanta organizers, said the  
characterization of the report as ``detailed and factual'' was 
accurate, but he declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Echols said Bell and other Atlanta officials intend to release  
the report Thursday and discuss its findings. Dave Woodruff, a 
spokesman for Upton, said the Atlanta officials also have agreed to 
release eight boxes of previously secret records that were turned 
over to the subcommittee under subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Those records reportedly include documents indicating that  
Atlanta organizers thought IOC members could be bribed into voting 
for the city, although no evidence has surfaced that any such 
bribes were ever offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial report the Atlanta organizers submitted to the  
subcommittee in June listed 38 gifts that exceeded the IOC's $200 
limit. But records subpoenaed by the panel turned up evidence of 
other gifts, and Atlanta officials then agreed to provide a more 
complete accounting of their bid activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Echols said Atlanta officials expect the Bell report will  
``bring closure'' to all the questions that have been raised about 
the city's bid in the aftermath of the Salt Lake revelations.

<HEADLINE> Oracle Slips After Earnings Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Shares in Oracle Corp. tumbled after the  
database software developer reported first quarter profits that met 
Wall Street estimates, but fell short of more ambitious 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Aug. 31, Oracle reported net income  
of $236.7 million, or 16 cents a share, up 21 percent from $195 
million, or 13 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 13 percent, to $1.98 billion from $1.75 billion.  
The results were reported late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle opened at 40 1/8 Wednesday, down 5 5/16 from the previous  
day's closing. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings came weeks after the company's stock rose sharply  
following unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter estimates. That had 
raised expectations Oracle easily would beat first-quarter analyst 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives said it had problems closing several large  
deals in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Software sales growth slowed significantly from the fourth  
quarter. First-quarter software licenses and other revenue grew 9 
percent from the corresponding period last year, compared with 22 
percent year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. Database 
revenue grew by 8 percent to $443 million, and applications 
software sales rose 11 percent, to $109 million, compared with the 
first quarter last year.
