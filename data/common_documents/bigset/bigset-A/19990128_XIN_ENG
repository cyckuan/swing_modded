<HEADLINE> British Trade Gap Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The UK's trading account with
the rest of the world has plunged further into the red, according
to the latest official figures released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit widened to 2.2 billion pounds (3.64 billion U.S.
dollars) in November from 1.6 billion pounds (2.65 billion
dollars) in October, which was the worse Britain has faced for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics also reported that while
Britain's trade shortfall with non-European Union countries
narrowed slightly to 1.65 billion pounds (2.73 billion dollars) in
December, that still left a record non-EU deficit of 15.7 billion
pounds (25.98 billion dollars) for 1998 as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The statistics office said the figures showed Britain's trade
gap is on a firmly widening trend, with exports flat and imports
rising. In 1997, the UK's non-EU deficit was just 7.9 billion
pounds (13.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists said the strong pound and a slowdown in worldwide
economic growth have caused exports to plummet. The strength of
sterling has also had the effect of making imports cheaper.
</P>
<P>
The figures make grim reading for the UK's manufacturing
industry, and have intensified calls for further cuts in interest
rates to help prevent a recession, they added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Wednesday that Britain warmly welcomed Indonesia's
announcement that it may consider independence for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"Our view all along is that the solution to the problem of East
Timor must be one which is acceptable to the peoples of East Timor
and we regard this very much as a step in the right direction,"
Cook told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indonesia said the country's top legislative body
might consider independence for the troubled province of East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
"That is a sensible and a welcome step which may help pave the
way to a resolution to this long-standing conflict and
long-standing dispute," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia invaded and annexed East Timor in the seventies in a
move not recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Although always under very serious pressure from international
communities, Indonesia until now has staunchly refused to consider
allowing independence for the eastern half of the Timor island.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Supports Cyprus' EU Accession: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Foreign Minister
Jaime Gama said Wednesday that his country supports the
enlargement of European Union (EU) and Cyprus' accession to the
union.
</P>
<P>
Gama made the remarks at a joint press conference with Cypriot
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides before his departure Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Gama said that "Cyprus is doing excellent progress regarding
the economy and the adaptation of internal law." But work in other
fields will be speeded up, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "integrating into the EU depends on the
will of the union, but also on the capacity of the newcomers,"
namely, on whether their economy "responds to those patterns" set
by the EU.
</P>
<P>
Gama also noted that Cypriot EU accession talks, which began
last March, and a solution to the Cyprus problem are two things
that can and must go in parallel ways as they can have positive
mutual influence.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 as Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula, but the peace talks
between the two sides broke down in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides termed Cypriot-Portuguese ties as
excellent, saying he and Gama have discussed the EU enlargement,
cooperation in combating organized crimes, illegal immigration,
issues of common interest regarding the Euro-Mediterranean
partnership, Cyprus' EU accession course and the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Gama, who arrived here Tuesday night, held talks with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides, House of Representatives Speaker
Spyros Kyprianou and head of the Cyprus delegation for EU
accession talks George Vassiliou.

<HEADLINE> Censure Debate Kicked Off in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A two-day no-confidence debate
against three Thai senior ministers began on Wednesday but Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai's government was expected to pass through
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, Interior Minister
Sanan Kajornprasart and Transport and Communications Minister
Suthep Thaugsuban were under the attack, with accusations ranging
from corruption to mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
"You three ministers are incompetent and public tolerance of
you is lessening every minute, we can't allow you to carry on your
duties any more," opposition New Aspiration Party (NAP) leader and
former prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said in his opening
address.
</P>
<P>
Chuan responded by saying the government would not allow the
debate to distract it from reforming the economy to pull Thailand
out of its worst recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
Sanan was the first target of two days of lower house
questioning. The NAP said Sanan would be grilled over issues
ranging from road toll increases, alleged bribery over civil
service appointments and alleged purchase of illegally felled
logs.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the opposition plans to turn its attention to
Suthep and its allegations of irregularities in telecoms projects,
and to Tarrin's handling of the economy, which has hit some vested
business interests.
</P>
<P>
As the debate opened, Tarrin hit back at opposition criticism,
saying it was Chavalit's administration until late 1997 that
dragged Thailand into crisis.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Strives to Raise Public Awareness on Nation's Physical Constraints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 27 (Xinhua) Singapore launched a gallery
Wednesday with an aim to create public awareness and understanding
over the constraints, solutions and blueprint for the nation's
physical development.
</P>
<P>
At the gallery set up by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, the
various exhibits trace Singapore's development and demonstrate
ways to overcome physical constraints with emphasis on the
difficult trade-offs the nation has to make to balance the
competing demands of various segments of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Singapore Minister for
National Development Lim Hng Kiang said Singapore, with a
population of more than three million, has to meet all the needs
of a nation -- defense, water catchment, industry, offices,
housing and recreation within a land area of 647 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is even subject to height limit imposed by five
military and civil airports, he said, adding: "This means that in
large parts of our island we can only build up to 12 storeys."
</P>
<P>
Lim said the broad strategy is to plan long-term, and to plan
comprehensively so as to minimize the use of land within these
constraints.
</P>
<P>
Through public dialogues and exhibitions, he said, the
government tries to explain to Singaporeans the reasons for the
various ideas and solutions adopted and to show how planners have
performed a difficult balancing act in meeting the varied needs of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
He listed the storm-water reservoirs, integration of MRT
station and bus interchanges, multi-storey factories, land
reclamation, underground sewerage treatment plants and buffer
zones around pollutive industries as examples of some creative and
sometimes unique solutions that the gallery will allow the public
to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
"Understanding these considerations and realities will help the
younger generation of Singaporeans to make more realistic and
sound decisions in the future," Lim said.

</P>
<P>
He said China and Ghana have long cherished a traditional
friendship which was fostered by the old-generation leaders of the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he continued, the development of political and
economic relations between china and ghana has played a positive
role in promoting friendly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
late premier zhou Enlai announced eight principles guiding
china's external aid when he paid a visit to ghana in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president noted that although great changes
have taken place in the international situation and domestic
conditions in both countries, the basic principles of equality,
mutual benefit and non- political conditions still have guiding
significance.
</P>
<P>
China has gradually reformed its ways of external aid with its
focus on providing interest-discounted preferential loans to
recipient countries, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the loans are mainly used to benefit the joint
ventures and cooperative firms to run manufacturing projects that
have resources, markets and rewarding, with the aim to explore new
cooperation areas, upgrade the cooperation scope and efficiency,
and realize common development.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that China and Ghana, both as developing nations,
share many common interests, and hold identical or similar views
on many major international issues.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have all along supported and cooperated with each
other in international affairs, he said, adding he thanked Ghana
for adhering to the "one china" policy, having no official contact
with Taiwan and support China's reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the international situation has undertaken
major and drastic changes, but the China-Ghana friendship has by
no means changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is our shared duty to consolidate traditional friendship and
expand cooperation under the new circumstances, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of this century, Hu continued, China is ready to
join Ghana to positively explore new ways and areas to further
bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
This will serve to add new contents to the China-Ghana
friendship and draw a new blueprint for a new yet energetic
friendly relations in the forthcoming century, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Hu attended a signing ceremony on two
documents: a framework agreement on China's supply of preferential
loans to Ghana, and an exchange of letter that China offers
materials assistance to Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Ghanaian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ACCRA, Ghana, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to join
Ghana to push the existing traditional friendly relations of
cooperation to a new high, the visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who arrived in Accra Tuesday noon on a three-day official
visit, said this in a meeting with Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
He said Ghana is one of the earliest nations in the sub-Saharan
Africa who forged diplomatic ties with China, and the
old-generation leaders of the two countries were the founding
fathers of bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
In many years, he continued, bilateral ties have maintained a
healthy and steady development, and friendly cooperation in
various fields has enjoyed a continuous enforcement.
</P>
<P>
China and Ghana, both as developing countries, share the
similar historical experiences and today are facing the same
development task, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president stressed that the basis for bilateral
cooperation is solid, with areas varied and prospects broad.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciated the Ghanaian government and people who
have taken a positive attitude in exploring a political system and
development road suitable to their own circumstances under the
leadership of Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of Rawlings' contributions to promoting
China-Ghana friendly ties of cooperation after his two visits to
China.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Ghanaian people who have scored remarkable
achievements with the help of their wisdom and unremitting
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is politically stable, with a continuously growing
economy and a improving living standard, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Rawlings said that Ghana appreciated
China's policy towards Africa.
</P>
<P>
In many years, he said, China has always supported the
developing nations in safeguarding their national independence and
sovereignty and made outstanding contributions to protecting
interests of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
With limited finance, China has provided precious aid to
African nations, including Ghana and now is striving to develop
mutually beneficial cooperation, for which ghana expressed
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
In the development, he went on to say, China has faced many
problems, but under the leadership of generations of Chinese
leaders, China has adhered to independence, scored wonderful
progress after unremitting efforts and won wide international
respect.
</P>
<P>
Ghana and other developing countries hope that China play an
even greater role in international affairs and that they listen to
more voices from China, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's progress has proved that it has effectively protected
its people' s basic human rights, he said, adding otherwise no one
can image that it has maintained such a long-term stable
advancement.
</P>
<P>
Hu's entourage who are accompanying Hu on his first African
tour, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Hu met some representatives of overseas
Chinese in Ghana, and visited a cocoa processing factory in Tema
Industrial Zone, about 30 kilometers east of Accra.
</P>
<P>
Hu will go on to Cote d'Ivoire on January 28 to continue his
13-day four- nation African tour, in which South Africa will be
the last leg.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: All Israelis Praying for King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that all Israelis are praying
for the health of Jordanian King Hussein, who has flown back to
the U.S. for further cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu spoke highly of Hussein, saying he has played an
instrumental mediating role in the Palestinian-Israeli
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
One week after returning home from six months of cancer
treatment in a Minnesota clinic in the U.S., the king flew back
Tuesday for urgent tests after suffering exhaustion and recurrent
fevers.
</P>
<P>
"We are following the situation in Jordan, most specially with
the situation of King Hussein's health," Netanyahu told Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
"Our prayers follow him, our hopes follow him...I represent
every and last person in Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The king's health and the situation in Jordan is one of the
focus of discussion in the Knesset (Parliament) Wednesday, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
During his one-week stay at home, Hussein removed his brother
Hassan Ibn Talal as heir to the throne and named his eldest son
Abdullah Bin Hussein as crown prince.
</P>
<P>
When Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were bargaining over
a land-for-peace deal at the Wye Plantation near Washington last
October, Hussein flew there several times from his sickbed to help
narrow the gaps.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in early 1997, it was his personal intervention that
helped overcome the last hurdle to the signing of the Hebron
agreement, under which Israel pulled back its troops from most part
of the West Bank city.
</P>
<P>
Israel has kept a cautious note over Hussein's decision to
change the succession to the throne.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that Israel respects the internal affairs of
Jordan, Netanyahu has expressed his hope that the
Israeli-Jordanian relations, which he described as "of strategic
importance," will continue.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the only two Arab states which signed peace
treaties with Israel. The other is Egypt.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Joint Venture in Silicon Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
Wednesday announced a decision to authorize the creation of a
joint venture in the silicon metal sector by French company
Pechiney Electrometallurgie (PEM) and South African company
Samancor Ltd. (Samancor).
</P>
<P>
The commission said the concentration does not create or
strengthen a dominant position in view of the limited impact of
the transaction on a global scale and the existence of strong
competitors.
</P>
<P>
Usually, if a joint venture posed a result that significantly
impeded effective competition in the European Union (EU)'s
economic area or any substantial part of the area, it would be
determined as violation of the EU's competition regulation,
according to the commission, the EU's executive branch responsible
for proposing and enforcing the EU's policies and legislation.
</P>
<P>
The French PEM manufactures ferroalloys, corindons, silicon
metal and magnesium. And South Africa's Samancor produces a number
of minerals, such as chrome, manganese and manganese ores,
ferrochrome and ferromanganese alloys, and silicon metal. The EU
commission said the notified operation consists of the parties
transferring their respective silicon metal businesses into a
newly created joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Silicon metal is frequently divided into three grades:
chemical, primary metallurgical and secondary metallurgical. It is
used primarily in the chemical and metallurgical industries to
produce silicones and casting aluminium alloys mainly used in the
automotive industry. Silicon metal is also used to a lesser extent
in the electronics industry to produce electronic semi-conductors
and in refractory and steel production.

<P>
MOGADISHU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- There are reports of serious
ambushes on public buses,just outside the troubled town of lwdoa
Wednesday as the political situation between the Rabanwein
communities and Hussein Mohamed Aidid's faction is growing from
bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 people were killed and 15 others were wounded when
armed men suspected to be among the fighters of the Rahanwein
Resistance Army (RRA) have launched two separate attacks on buses
leaving the town of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The first attack caught the first bus, a Japan-made Coaster,
that left Baidoa town to Mogadishu early in the morning Wednesday
when gunmen had opened fire indiscriminately on the passengers
killing two of them on the spot and wounding several others.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that the bus had managed to escape with
all the victims of the attack on board after security men guarding
the bus had returned fire.
</P>
<P>
The second bus, a Besani, has also fallen into the trap of the
ambush after few hours at the same spot.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the RRA gunmen have opened fire on
the bus from every corner of the street, killing nine of the
passengers on the spot and wounding 14 others.

humanitarian and commuters not to travel on that road which he
had characterized it as not safe for civilians.

<HEADLINE> France Proposes Tougher Action Against Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- France said Wednesday that
tougher action should be made against the territories serving as
offshore centers for money laundering activities and financial
crimes.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy and Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn
said that diplomatic pressure should be exerted on the countries
whose dependent territories have excessively accommodating laws on
protection of banking secrets.
</P>
<P>
He said that France has proposed to the Group of Action on
Money Laundering, which gathers 26 countries as well as the
European Commission and the Council of Cooperation of Gulf States,
that these territories must open documents concerning operations
of suspected money laundering.
</P>
<P>
France itself has established a government mechanism for
checking banking operations and making it obligatory for banks to
declare any operation which appears suspicious to the government
body.
</P>
<P>
The French minister said that an ultimate way to fight money
laundering in offshore financial centers would be a banning of
financial relations with these places by member countries of the
group.
</P>
<P>
He called on some member countries of the group to clean up
houses in some territories under their sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Plan to Topple Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran Wednesday rejected any
foreign plan to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime,
stressing that Iraq's future should be determined by the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi said that no foreign country has the right to
determine the future of Iraq and Iran will not accept the
U.S. plan to support Iraqi opposition groups to topple Saddam.
</P>
<P>
He also turned down the call made by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to
the Iraqi people against Saddam's regime.
</P>
<P>
Iran is against any action violating Iraq's territorial
integrity and believes that Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity should be respected, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announced its support for Iraqi opposition groups to
overturn Saddam following the mid-December military strikes on
Iraq for what it said Baghdad's failure to fully cooperate with
the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Washington even stated that it would support Iran's efforts
in helping the Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq to fight
against Saddam's regime.
</P>
<P>
However, Asefi said that the U.S. plan would escalate tensions
and instability in the region, adding that the presence of alien
forces in the region was the real source of instability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also condemned the recent U.S. military strikes
on Iraq and expressed regret that some innocent Iraqi civilians
were killed or injured in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes on Monday raided residential quarters in the
southern Iraqi city of Basra.

It will also strengthen contacts between bilateral leaders,

He stated that the Chinese government will continue to provide
aid it can to African nations without any political
pre-conditions.

It will also develop various forms of economic and trade
cooperation with these nations in line with the principles of
mutual benefit and making up each other's deficiencies, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albright in Riyadh for Talks on Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Wednesday for
a short visit which analysts said is aimed at shoring up an
anti-Iraq Arab alliance.
</P>
<P>
Albright flew in from Egypt and is expected to hold talks with
Saudi leaders on the latest developments of the Iraqi crisis, the
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
She is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the Gulf
region since the U.S.-led air strikes against Iraq in
mid-December.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the U.S. top diplomat "has come at a time
when a desperate Iraq has been more unyielding" after the strikes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain carried out military strikes against Iraq
on December 16-19 to retaliate what they claimed Iraq's
non-cooperation in U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of U.S. threats of more strikes, Iraq rejected the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It also declared that it did not recognize the no-fly zones
imposed by the U.S. and its allies in southern and northern Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf war, and vowed to shot down any foreign
planes violating Iraq's airspace.
</P>
<P>
What makes things more difficult is that Baghdad recently
stepped up its verbal attacks against some Arab nations for not
taking a firm stand on the lifting of economic sanctions slapped
on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials also accused Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for being
directly involved in the U.S.-British air strikes by providing
them with air bases and airspace.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources was quoted as saying that Albright will
discuss with top Saudi officials Iraq's continuing confrontation
with allied forces over the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
They will also exchange views over the outcome of the Arab
foreign ministers' meeting held in Cairo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Washington, by sending Albright to the Middle East, is trying
to seek Arab backing for its efforts to end the latest Iraq
crisis" following Iraq's non-cooperation with UNSCOM, political
analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
However, they still doubted that if Albright could gather
enough support much needed to clear up the Iraq mess resulted from
the military operation.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to conclude her visit to Saudi Arabia on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Clinton's Order to Expand Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Wednesday strongly
condemned U.S. President Bill Clinton's order to expand air raid
targets of the Iraqi air-defense system, calling it "a flagrant
violation of Iraq's sovereignty and political independence."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted an Information Ministry spokesman
as saying that no international law or U.N. resolution authorizes
the imposition of the no-fly zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has reportedly agreed to the U.S. military request to
go ahead with responding more aggressively to Iraq's challenges to
U.S. and British aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones in both
northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq after
the 1991 Gulf War to allegedly protect the Kurds in the north and
the Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the zones have for
several times fired missiles at Iraq's ground military targets,
citing Iraqi radar provocation.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is determined to continue its confrontation with the
on-going U.S.-British aggression against Iraq's sovereignty and
airspace," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq is practicing its legitimate right when
defending its airspace against aggression, pointing out that
U.S. jets were violating Iraq's airspace.
</P>
<P>
"So how come that they claim that they are practicing
self-defense when they attack Iraqi targets?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Clinton, who is under impeachment
trial in the U.S. Senate, approved U.S. military commanders'
request for "more expansive rules of engagement to attack Iraqi
air defenses" in order to regain his lost dignity.
</P>
<P>
He added that Clinton's order came after the Arab foreign
ministers' meeting issued a weak communique Sunday which did not
condemn the mid-December U.S.-British aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The communique gave the U.S. the green-light to continue its
aggression against Iraq and its flagrant violation of Iraq's
sovereignty and airspace, said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Truck Permits for Swiss Transit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here Wednesday that it has made a proposal for fair distribution
of permits between the European Union (EU) member states for heavy
goods vehicles to circulate on Swiss territory.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Switzerland reached an agreement in December 1998 on
grants of unlimited access to the Swiss road network with 40-ton
trucks from January 1, 2005. However, a fixed number of permits
will be issued annually for EU trucks to circulate on Swiss
territory during the period of 2000-2004, while a fixed number of
permits of transit for empty and light trucks at a reduced
infrastructure charge will also be granted from 2000 to 2004.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive arm maily responsible for
proposing and enforcing legislation, proposes that each member
state shall be given a minimum number of 1,500 permits per year to
ensure that all member states shall benefit from the increased
weight limits.
</P>
<P>
The total number of permits for EU trucks of up to 40 tons is
set at 250,000 for the year 2000, 300,000 for 2001, and 400,000
for 2003 and 2004. These permits shall be distributed
proportionally among the EU member states according to the current
distribution by nationality of empty trucks and trucks under 28
tons weight transiting switzerland, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Premier Leaves for Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile left Wednesday afternoon for Germany, where he will pay a
working visit on January 27-30.
</P>
<P>
Radu Vasile said before departure that the visit was important,
as Romania was interested to have in Germany one of its most
important economic and political partners, and also as Germany
held at present the European Union's Presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Such a visit, notably after events responsible for a bad image
of Romania, namely the Jiu Valley miners' movement, proves trust
in the current government and in its capacity to continue the
reform process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister underscored that his reception by Federal
Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder was a special event, taking into
account the chancellor's busy agenda. Radu Vasile said the visit
had an economic component, with talks about banking matters, with
talks attended by businessmen interested to invest in Romania,
especially in small and medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
Radu Vasile added that in his talks with the federal chancellor
he would point to some elements regarding the EU intervention in
supporting Romania in the process of European and Euro-Atlantic
integration.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Turkey Tries to Draw Athens Into Unwanted Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Wednesday that
Turkey was trying to draw Athens into dialogue on issues on which
there could be no dialogue.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish army report warned Tuesday that if the problems
between Greece and Turkey were not resolved, new tension in the
Aegean Sea could easily lead the two neighboring countries to an
unwanted armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said that there was no reason for Greece to be drawn into
Turkey's "gibberish."
</P>
<P>
Turkey was heading for its general elections and all this was
for domestic consumption, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reaffirmed that if Turkey believed a problem
existed between the two countries, it should refer the matter to
the International Court at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Greece and Turkey almost went to war over the disputed
Imia islet in the Aegean Sea. The tension eased after the U.S.
mediation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Marketing to Start in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association
(ZTA) said Wednesday the tobacco marketing season is expected to
commence on April 21, amid fears of depressed export prices.
</P>
<P>
ZTA marketing director Pat Davis told the Zimbabwe News Agency
that "it is going to be business as usual but there is a lot of
uncertainty on what the exchange rate will be like and how active
buyers will be."
</P>
<P>
During the marketing season which ended in September last year,
growers suffered serious losses with the average grower hardly
breaking even, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the devaluation of the Brazilian currency against
the U.S. Dollar by over 30 percent would have the impact of
lowering the export price of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
As Brazil was one of Zimbabwe's main competitors, he said, this
would most certainly affect the price of local tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The average selling price for flue-cured tobacco per kg in
Zimbabwe last year was 1.73 U.S. Dollars, down from 2.33 Dollars
in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
This season farmers reduced production by 10 percent and about
185,000 tons of flue-cured tobacco was expected, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner. Last
year, Zimbabwe got more than 300 million Dollars from tobacco
export.

<HEADLINE> Flu Epidemic Hits Romanian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Bucharest local health
authorities decided to declare flu epidemic in Romania's capital
after a sudden rise in the number of influenza occurrences among
Bucharesters over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
According to a Wednesday report of Rompres news agency, over
only the past week, Bucharest hospitals scored 288 flu cases, 757
cases of pneumonia and bronchial pneumonia, and other 5,109
occurrences of acute breathing infections.
</P>
<P>
The Bucharest Cantacuzino Institute isolated four type A flu
viruses and other eight of the B type. Experts said that an
epidemic could not be stopped unless at least 20 percent of the
populace were vaccinated. Nevertheless, less than 20,000
Bucharesters out of more than 2 million capital residents have so
far had vaccination against influenza.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for declaring flu epidemic countrywide as
the total number of influenza cases, Bucharest ruled out, is not
significant," said Mircea Popa, head of the Prophylactic Medicine
Direction under the Health Ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
might visit Greece later this year for talks with Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis on the Cyprus problem and Greek-Turkish
relations.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted diplomatic
sources here as saying that Clinton desired to visit Athens in
November when he attended a summit of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece was however very guarded about whether Clinton's visit
would have a successful outcome, particularly in the absence of
the necessary groundwork, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Greece had proposed that Clinton should also visit Cyprus,
which has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north
and the Greek Cypriots-controlled south since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
An earlier meeting between Clinton and Simitis could not be
ruled out in April on the sidelines of events marking the 50th
anniversary of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) in Washington.

WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Republican-led
Senate Wednesday authorized House prosecutors to question former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses in the
impeachment trial after refusing to dismiss the perjury and
obstruction of justice charges against President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Both votes were along party lines with a single exception,
Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold who voted with Republicans.

of West Virginia that would have dismissed the case brought by the
House against the nation's 42nd president.
</P>
<P>
Senators immediately recessed the trial to discuss among
themselves how to proceed next. Republicans were pressing a plan
that could end the proceeding within 10 days if the White House
did not seek witnesses. Both presidential aides and Senate
Democrats reacted warily.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The votes authorized House prosecutors to question Lewinsky,
White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal and presidential friend
Vernon Jordan about the president's efforts to conceal his affair
with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
The White House said it was concerned that Republicans were
trying to "put a blindfold on us" with an accelerated plan to end
the trial without defense witnesses.
</P>
<P>
"The country wants this over.... As we move forward here, the
country will understand that this trial belongs to the Senate
Republicans and the Republican House managers and that they alone
are responsible for extending this process," press secretary Joe
Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Under Control in Mozambique: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Cholera which broke out last
September has been under control in Mozambique, a senior
Mozambican health official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Avertino Barreto, Deputy Director of the Mozambican National
Health Bureau, said at a press conference that the situation in
the country as a whole is encouraging because the death rate has
now dropped to 1.9 percent from 4.9 percent three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The death rate from cholera in Mozambique has been among the
lowest in the African continent, said Barreto.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there was no choleric cases in central Manica
Province in last eight days while there has been no people
suffering from cholera in southern Inhambane Province since last
September.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Mozambican government has allocated
some 50 billion Metical (about 4.16 million U.S. Dollars) in
addition to the health budget to provide medicine and drinking
water to residents in the affected area in a bid to wipe out
cholera.
</P>
<P>
Barreto said that there were 18 deaths in the last two days
from cholera in three provinces in northern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Since the breakout of cholera in the southern African country
last September, choleric cases have been reported in nine
provinces, most of them in north.
</P>
<P>
So far, 1,346 people have died of cholera and 27,245 others
suffered from the disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada Wednesday
submitted to the United Nations Security Council a revised
proposal on how to move forward in addressing disarmament and
humanitarian issues concerning Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the Security Council would call for
the establishment of three panels, each under the chairmanship of
the current president of the council, Ambassador Celso Amorim of
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The proposal said that in an effort to maintain continuity, his
chairmanship would run beyond his current tenure as president of
the Security Council in order to complete this work.
</P>
<P>
Canada suggested the first panel, on the disarmament issue,
would be comprised of commissioners from the United Nations
Special Commission, experts from the International Atomic Energy
Agency as well as the U.N. under-secretary-general for disarmament
affairs.
</P>
<P>
It would assess the existing body of information relating to
the state of disarmament in Iraq and make recommendations to the
Security Council regarding the re-establishment of an effective
disarmament regime in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The second panel, on humanitarian issues, would be make up of
officials form the Office of the Iraq Program, the Secretariat of
the 661 Committee as well as the U.N. under-secretary-general for
humanitarian affairs.
</P>
<P>
This panel would assess the current humanitarian situation in
Iraq and make recommendations to the Security Council regarding
measures it might take to improve the humanitarian situation in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The third panel, on prisoners of war, Kuwaiti property and
archives, would consist of the executive director of the Office of
the Iraq Program and expert advisers from the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
It would make an assessment of Iraqi compliance relating to
prisoners of war, Kuwaiti property, and Kuwaiti archives, as
stipulated by Security Council resolutions, and make
recommendations to the Security Council with regard to these
matters.
</P>
<P>
The proposal said the chairman would maintain close liaison
with the secretary-general on all matters under consideration by
the panels. The chairman, in consultation with panel participants
and members of the Security Council, would adopt appropriate
working methods and plans of work, bearing in mind the urgent need
to re-establish Iraqi compliance with U.N. Security Council
resolutions.

Robert Fowler, Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, told
the press that it was still too early for the council to negotiate
the substance of the issue of Iraq, and the council was working to
narrow the differences between them and get to the position to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Votes to Subpoena Witnesses in Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Republican-led
Senate Wednesday authorized House prosecutors to question former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses in the
impeachment trial after refusing to dismiss the perjury and
obstruction of justice charges against President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Both votes were along party lines with a single exception,
Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold who voted with Republicans.
Though the Democrats lost, the votes showed the Republicans were
still well short of the two-thirds majority, 67 votes, that would
be needed to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
The identical 56-44 votes authorized the subpoenas to the
witnesses and rejected a motion by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd
of West Virginia that would have dismissed the case brought by the
House against the nation's 42nd president.
</P>
<P>
Senators immediately recessed the trial to discuss among
themselves how to proceed next. Republicans were pressing a plan
that could end the proceeding within 10 days if the White House
did not seek witnesses. Both presidential aides and Senate
Democrats reacted warily.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The votes authorized House prosecutors to question Lewinsky,
White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal and presidential friend
Vernon Jordan about the president's efforts to conceal his affair
with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
The White House said it was concerned that Republicans were
trying to "put a blindfold on us" with an accelerated plan to end
the trial without defense witnesses.
</P>
<P>
"The country wants this over.... As we move forward here, the
country will understand that this trial belongs to the Senate
Republicans and the Republican House managers and that they alone
are responsible for extending this process," press secretary Joe
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"The president will not be removed from office," Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle said moments after the vote. "It is
time to move on."
</P>
<P>
Under the Republican plan, the depositions of the three
witnesses would begin as early as Thursday and would be
videotaped. Each deposition would last six hours, equally divided
between the White House and House prosecutors with two senators
sitting in as mediators.
</P>
<P>
The videotaped sessions and transcripts would be distributed
next Monday to senators, who would then vote Tuesday on whether to
permit live testimony. The timetable would allow for that
testimony and then closing statements from the House managers and
White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Senate Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, a Republican,
acknowledged that "we kind of need to get a little bit closer on
some details" before any bipartisan agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
After days of being blamed for considering extending the trial,
Senate Republicans suggested their plan would turn the tables on
the White House. "The longer it is prolonged, the more risk to
their client. If another shoe drops, it's their fault, not ours,"
Republican Senator Ted Stevens said.

<P>
GENEVA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The office of the
secretary-general of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
received the resignation of Charles Nderitu Mukora of Kenya via
telephone on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to an IOC press release, IOC President Juan Samaranch
accepted Mukora's resignation by saying that Mukora had taken "the
honorable path in stepping down".
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the IOC head renewed his call for the other five
members, who the IOC temporarily excluded them from the committee
in a decision on January 24, to follow Mukora's lead and tender
their resignations in order "to put an end to this very
unfortunate chapter in the history of the Olympic Games".
</P>
<P>
The expulsion of the five has to be confirmed by the full IOC
session in March. Three IOC members involved in the Salt Lake City

<P>
LUANDA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defense Minister Pedro
Sebastiao confirmed here Wednesday that the rebel UNITA troops
Wednesday morning took over Mbanza-Congo, the capital of northern
Zaire Province.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency ANGOP said that the troops of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
helped by the Banyamulunge rebels from the Democratic Republic of
Congo and the mercenaries from Uganda and Rwanda, launched heavy
attacks against the city in the wee hours of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
ANGOP quoted Ludy Kissassunda, Governor of Zaire Province, as
saying that the loss of the provincial capital has great
implications because the well-conditioned international airport
near the city will offer the UNITA an easy access to men and
weapons from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the UNITA is also aiming to halt the oil
export by the Angolan government from Soyo Port, some 200
kilometers west of Mbanza-Congo.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Bill on Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran Wednesday condemned a bill
passed by Israeli Knesset (parliament), which says that a
referendum is needed on withdrawal from the Israeli-annexed Golan
Heights and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said the Israeli
move indicated the interventionist policy and greed of the regime
as well as the baselessness of its claim for peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel is required to withdraw from the
Islamic and Arab land in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine,
especially from Jerusalem, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Knesset passed a bill Tuesday, saying that a national
referendum and a special parliamentary majority are needed before
withdrawing from the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority also condemned the bill,
terming it a "new obstacle to peace."
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the strategic Golan Heights from Syria and
Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and
later annexed them to Israeli territory through Israeli laws.
</P>
<P>
Israel sees Jerusalem as its "eternal capital" and rejected
any compromise with the Palestinians, who want to establish an
independent state with Arab East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the fate of Jerusalem will be
determined in the final status talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Targets $273M in Revenue for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Rwanda Revenue Authority
(RRA) has targeted 86 billion Rwandan Francs (one U.S. Dollar
equals some 317 Rwandan Francs) for 1999, according to a report
reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This has been revealed by the Commissioner General of the RRA
Edward O. Larbi Siaw in a press conference in Kigali Monday, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
"The inflation will drastically increase due to a decrease in
the government revenue brought about by unpaid taxes," the
commissioner general was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Unpaid taxes will also encourage the government to borrow at
higher interest rates from the international agencies which
undermines the sovereignty of the people and of the state's
economy.
</P>
<P>
New strategies which will be undertaken to increase the revenue
 collection and make it more efficient include improving on time
management to enable the clients to efficiently attend to their
work.
</P>
<P>
"Preventive systems will be undertaken this year to minimize
fraud and achieve the budget for 1999," the commissioner general
noted.
</P>
<P>
Due to embarking on the structural adjustments demanded by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the revenue collection targeted
in the course of 1998 increased by 11% from previously 59.1
billion to 65.1 billion Rwandan Francs.
</P>
<P>
The government collected 65.6 billion Rwandan Francs at the end
of 1998.

<HEADLINE> France to Reinforce Security Measures in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The French government decided on
Wednesday to reinforce security measures in the urban areas which
are haunted by acts of violence from teenager offenders.
</P>
<P>
After chairing a cabinet meeting on home security, French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said that 7,000 more police officers will
be posted in three years in 26 departments most struck by crimes
and delinquencies committed by young hooligans.
</P>
<P>
The government will post 1,900 more police officers in 1999
alone to reinforce security force in sensitive areas with high
crime rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that 50 detention centers will be built from now
till 2001 to control teenager offenders in the period from their
arrest till their trial, while 30 more police stations will be
built this year in the crime-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that heavy punishment be given to those youngsters
who attack their teachers and ordered that police better protect
education establishments.
</P>
<P>
France is alarmed by the soaring crime rates in urban areas,
particularly in the low income suburbs of big cities, over the
past few years.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian PM Calls on OAU Members to Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi Wednesday called upon all member states of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to stand by the side of
Ethiopia for the implementation of the OAU peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Briefing African diplomats based in Addis Ababa, Meles said
that failure by a member state (Eritrea) to implement the peace
plan drawn by the OAU is an insult to all member states.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted the prime minister as saying
that all OAU member states should put direct or indirect pressure
on Eritrea to accept the OAU high level delegation's proposal for
a framework agreement for the peaceful settlement of the crisis in
the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"If those forces (Eritrea) have nothing but contempt for our
collective decision (and) continue to occupy the territory of a
member nation, we would ask (you) to come to our rescue. The
request would be feasible but unnecessary," Meles said.
</P>
<P>
"We would expect you to fully understand and defend our right
to defend ourselves," the Ethiopian prime minister told the
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The OAU peace proposals call for, among others, Eritrean
withdrawal from Ethiopian territory and the restoration of the
Ethiopian civilian administration there.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council members last Friday expressed their
concern over the failure of recent mediation efforts and a
continuing military buildup along the Ethio-Eritrean border, which
has raised fears of renewed fighting over contested border areas
after a seven-month lull.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. embassies in Asmara and Addis Ababa last
week told non-essential staff that they could leave as fears
mounted that the Horn of African nations were on the verge of
renewed war.

<HEADLINE> FM: Turkish Military Base Not to be Used for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said Wednesday that Turkey would not allow the United States
to launch attacks on Iraq by using warplanes based in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. warplanes based at the jointly-operated
Turkish-American Incirlik Air Base in Adana, southern Turkey, were
solely commissioned with reconnaissance flights over northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The goal of patrolling the no-fly zone in northern Iraq was to
deter Iraqi forces from attacking Kurds and creating another
exodus of refugees to Turkey similar to the one that followed the
1991 Gulf War, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 17 U.S. warplanes took off from Incirlik and
bombarded two radar units and one anti-aircraft system in Mosul
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 17 U.S. fighter jets also took off from the base
along with six tanker aircraft, four transport planes and one
AWACS plane for patrolling the no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, the U.S. and its allies imposed two no-fly zones in
southern and northern Iraq with the claimed aim of shielding the
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
suppression.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British forces launched four consecutive days of air
strikes on Iraq in mid-December to retaliate what they said Iraq's
non-cooperation with the United Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has sent three Patriot missile batteries to the
Incirlik base in response to the "developments in northern Iraq,"
after Iraq threatened to attack those neighbors which allow the
U.S. to use their bases for strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 warplanes of allied forces stationed at Incirlik
as part of the Operation Northern Watch to patrol the northern
no-fly zone in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Re-affirms Support for S. Leonean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has re-affirmed its
support for the elected government of Sierra Leone led by
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, which has just survived a rebel
attack on the capital with the assistance of the Nigerian-led
sub-regional intervention force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement faxed to Xinhua Wednesday by the
ECOMOG headquarters in Sierra Leonean capital Freetown, the two
governments have signed a memorandum of understanding, in which
they pledged to strengthen bilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was signed during a one-day assessment tour of
the situation in Freetown by a Nigerian delegation headed by Chief
of Defense Staff Air Marshal Al Min Daggash.
</P>
<P>
Also in the delegation which left Nigerian capital Abuja Monday
were Nigerian Foreign Minister Ignatius Olisemeka and Sierra
Leone's Ambassador to Nigeria, Joe Blel.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had a defense agreement with Freetown before the May
1997 military coup that temporarily ousted President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the delegation was briefed by ECOMOG force
commander, Major-General Timothy Shelpidi on the situation in
Freetown, where rebel troops have just been expelled by the ECOMOG
force after fierce fighting that started on January 6.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi said the recent incursion of rebels in Freetown has
been made possible by the ex-fighters loyal to Liberian President
Charles Taylor during the Liberian civil war.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Talyor's ex-fighters have massively crossed the
border to render assistance to the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Mercenaries from Israel, Burkina Faso, Ukraine, Mauritania and
South Africa have added an international conspiracy to the war,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The general explained that the rebels were able to enter
Freetown because they used women and children as human shields,
while ECOMOG abstained from engaging the rebels to avoid the loss
of innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
He also cited the shortage of manpower and defection of Sierra
Leonean troops deployed to the front-line as reasons for ECOMOG's
retreat at the beginning of the war.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the odds, he said that ECOMOG troops are
intensifying its mop-up operations in the eastern part of the
capital, with a view to breaking up the backbone of the enemies
who are currently faced with logistical problem.
</P>
<P>
The chief of defense staff commended the gallantry and
professionalism displayed by ECOMOG troops in flushing out the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the Defense Headquarters would do its best to
assist ECOMOG operations and appealed to other countries in the
sub-region to compliment Nigeria's efforts by sending troops to
beef up ECOMOG forces.

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Globe Ban on DDT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
has demanded a global ban in 2007 on DDT, citing a report full of
new scientific evidence of hazards to human health and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based organization made the call here Wednesday
as a United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) committee is
holding its second round of talks to reach a global treaty to
reduce or eliminate environmental emissions and discharges of
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) like DDT.
</P>
<P>
Although DDT is banned in 34 countries and severely restricted
in 34 others, it is still used to control mosquitoes and other
disease-carrying insects in many developing countries, according
to the WWF.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled as "Hazards and Exposures Associated with
DDT and Synthetic Pyrethroids," summarizes new scientific findings
regarding serious damages on human health and environment caused
by DDT and its most popular alternative -- synthetic pyrethroids.
</P>
<P>
It also illustrates the persistence and pervasiveness of
chemicals such as DDT, which can be sprayed in a village in Africa
and end up in the fat of polar bears in the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
However, DDT is still endorsed by the World Health Organization
(WHO) for controlling malaria, because last WHO review of DDT's
effects took place in 1993, well before much of newly emerging
scientific findings were released, said the non-governmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
WWF recommended that DDT be phased out in 2007, using
alternatives without damage to the environment and available in
places such as west Africa and India.

<HEADLINE> W. B. to Assist Kenya's Small Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 28 (xinhua) -- The World Bank has given the
Kenyan government over 1.2 billion Shillings (some 20 million U.S.
Dollars) to support the Jua Kali or small business sector,
according to a bank official.
</P>
<P>
Thyra Riley, the World Bank team leader on the Jua Kali
project, said Wednesday the World Bank was working closely with
the Jua Kali community to build structure, the Kenya Times
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jua Kali in Kenya is an informal sector, so most of the Jua
Kali traders do not have a fixed place to do business.
</P>
<P>
Riley said the land ownership in Kenya still remains the major
inhibitor to the development of the Jua Kali sector, adding that
the World Bank would take care of 95 percent of the cost for
building structure while the Jua Kali traders do the rest.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2-billion-Shilling scheme is being used to train Jua Kali
traders in management and technical skills, said Riley.
</P>
<P>
William Steel, a consultant from the World Bank, said the Bank
believes that supporting the informal sector will make Kenya
achieve its aim of having a private sector to lead the economy.
</P>
<P>
Jua Kali still remains the only hope for most Kenyans as
getting a white collar job is increasingly becoming a nightmare.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Gets New Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Excited crowds in Tianjin Zoo
on late Wednesday witnessed the marriage of Zhaizhai, a
28-year-old male panda to 16-year-old Lannier, an even tempered
female panda from southwestern Sichuan Province. The wedding
ceremony took place in Tianjin Zoo in north China, and it is his
second marriage.
</P>
<P>
The bridegroom first came to Tianjin from northwest China's
Gansu Province 19 years ago, immediately becoming the zoo's star
inhabitant.
</P>
<P>
And he drew a rousing welcome by the Japanese people during
his six-month stay in Japan's Kobe with his ex-wife Rongrong at
the International Fair back in 1982 .
</P>
<P>
However, after Rongrong died suddenly in 1992 he was left
alone and became unhappy, and contracted epilepsy and a cataract
due, some said, to his old age and loneliness.
</P>
<P>
Animal psychologists thought that a happy remarriage may help
to improve his lot in life and cheer him up. However, it was very
hard to find a suitable mate for him since there are now only
less than 1,000 giant pandas in the whole of China, and only just
over 50 in zoos.
</P>
<P>
Then, after a long search zookeepers found Lannier living in
southwest China's Sichuan Wolong nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
She had been rescued six years ago from the wilderness where
she was almost starving to death.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Outgoing Electoral Chief Explains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Independent
 Electoral Commission (IEC) has been reduced to another government
 bureaucracy unable to fulfill many of its tasks, outgoing IEC
chairman Johann Kriegler said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday with The Star newspaper in which he
elaborated on the reasons for his resignation, Kriegler warned
that the IEC's independence was being compromised by a shortage of
funds, the use of civil servants as electoral workers, and that it
now reported to the Home Affairs Department instead of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kriegler hinted at disagreements with the government when he
announced his resignation on Tuesday, saying he hoped his
departure would ease tensions between the politicians and the
electoral body.
</P>
<P>
But he went further Wednesday, warning that the IEC was being
hampered in its efforts to organize this year's general election,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"The IEC has come to be regarded as a government-funded agency
to run elections, like a meat control board. This is not my
perception, and this has been irksome," Kriegler said.
</P>
<P>
"We only have a few months to go before the elections and we
are still arguing about who controls the staff. It has to be
sorted out."
</P>
<P>
The deployment of civil servants for voter registration had
resulted in a loss of independence for the IEC. "If you don't
control the people on the job, if you can't hire and fire them,
then you are not independent.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has a basic mandate to support the growth of
representative participatory democracy in a country where we have
pitifully little experience of it.
</P>
<P>
"By getting local people involved in the process is how we can
exchange ballots for bullets. The elections must belong to the
people, not to the government."
</P>
<P>
Because the commission had been cut to the bone financially,
the truly valuable work, such as voter education, had been left
undone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has contributed to the depressingly low
under-25-age-group registration. While this is not a South
African disease, it needed a development program, not double-page
advertisements," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had realized he was not the right person to solve
these problems.
</P>
<P>
"My style is not necessarily the most successful in the area of
 negotiation and deal-making, and manifestly I have not succeeded.
 I care about the elections, and that is why I am leaving," the
paper quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
But he was confident that his successor and the remaining
commissioners would succeed.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped his departure would encourage all parties
concerned, including the government, the media, political parties
and the electorate, to think about the reasons for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional Court judges Pius Langa and Richard Goldstone
have emerged as possible replacements for Kriegler, the paper
said.

<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Wang Chang, who was in a coma
for a long period of time, has regained consciousness after more
than two years of special treatment at a rehabilitation center at
the Nanjing Navy Medical College.
</P>
<P>
Science and Technology Daily reports that Wang is one of 124
comatose people who were rehabilitated at the hospital. Some can
even ride a bicycle and engage in other forms of exercise after
receiving the special treatment.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the hospital say that their recovery rate for 150
comatose patients has been 82.6 percent. In foreign countries,
the average is 54 percent, they say.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has been resorting to hyperbaric oxygenation
therapy, along with electric current stimulation, acupuncture,
moxibustion, and massage for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
Doctors also "chat" with comatose patients when they are still
in a coma and help them recover the use of their arms and legs
with specially-designed rehabilitation equipment after they
regain consciousness.

<HEADLINE> EDS-China-FM-National Reunification Policy Toward Taiwan Remains Unchanged, FM Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- It has been a sacred task for
the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to achieve
reunification of the motherland and jointly invigorate the
Chinese nation, Zhang Qiyue, spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry,
 stated here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"This is in the fundamental interests of the entire Chinese
nation. There is not any change in the policy of the Chinese
government on this issue," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The idea of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" which
Taiwan authorities have spread in the international community has
sabotaged the cause of the reunification of the motherland. It
has also damaged the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation.
So, it is doomed to failure, the spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Taiwan authorities will give priority to the
national interests, proceed from the interests of the Chinese
people and contribute to the development of the relationship
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits and the great cause
of peaceful reunification of the motherland," said the
spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President in Ethiopia to Mediate Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi
of Kenya arrived here Thursday morning as part of his latest peace
efforts on the Ethio-Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day official visit in Ethiopia, Moi will discuss
with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on ways and means of a peaceful
solution to the border conflict between the two Horn of Africa
neighbors. The two leaders will also discuss bilateral and
regional issues of mutual concern, today's Monitor newspaper
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader went on a similar mission on Sunday to
Asmara, capital of Eritrea, where he met his Eritrean counterpart,
Isaias Afwerki on the same issue..
</P>
<P>
On January 22, Moi held talks with Meles during an east African
summit in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Moi's visit comes amid heightened tensions and heavy military
build-up on both sides of the Ethio-Eritrean border which has
already been feared to result in a renewed outbreak of clashes.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president has reportedly appealed to the leaders of
Ethiopia and Eritrea to exercise restraint in order to avoid
renewed hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Asmara has rejected to accept the proposals endorsed by the
summit of countries of the Central Organ of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) held in Ouagadougou on December 17-18, last
year.

<HEADLINE> Air Tanzania to Resume Flights to Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Air
Tanzania Corporation (ATC) confirmed Thursday it will resume
flights to Burundi and at the same time suspend air links with
Dubai next month.
</P>
<P>
ATC senior public relations officer Innocent Mungy told Xinhua
Thursday that the company will resume flights from Dar es Salaam
to Bujumbura, the Burundian capital, through Kilimanjaro in north
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"Burundi is a land-locked country... It depends on our port,"
Mungy said,

adding that ATC will resume flights on January 14.
</P>
<P>
Initially, ATC will fly to Burundi once a week but if traffic
is busy, the company will increase flights, he said.
</P>
<P>
The flights, however, are limited to passenger service, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of flights came after regional leaders suspended
economic sanctions last Saturday on the tiny, strife-torn central
African country to encourage peace talks between the government of
Pierre Buyoya and Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, including a total trade ban and a flight
embargo, were imposed in August after Buyoya took power in a
military coup in July of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Burundi was a lucrative market for Tanzania and was served by
the Dar es Salaam port, railways, state airline and private road
haulers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mungy said ATC will suspend flights starting
February 1 to Dubai of the United Arab Emirates, because the
company, operating with smaller planes, is facing competition in
prices and services from the Gulf Air.
</P>
<P>
"We want to do research on how to improve to services," he
said. "We will announce to the public when we resume flights."

BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua)-- China hopes that the Macedonian

and make a "wise decision" not to recognize the validity of the
communique on establishing the so-called "diplomatic relations"
with Taiwan.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here
this afternoon when commenting on the communique signed in Taipei
Wednesday by Macedonian Foreign Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov and
the so-called Taiwan "Foreign Minister" Jason Hu.
</P>
<P>
As it is widely acknowledged that the issue of Taiwan is
related to China's sovereignty, territorial integrity and its
national reunification, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly oppose any country that has established diplomatic
relations with China has any official contacts with Taiwan," said
Zhang.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Welcomes Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A 6-month-old panda cub that
is the offspring of two giant pandas from the cities of Shanghai
and Chongqing appears to have adapted to the Shanghai Zoo,
China's second largest zoo.
</P>
<P>
It plays with rubber balls, climbs iron railings, or rolls on
the ground and goes up to the keeper to shake hands with him.
</P>
<P>
The rare cub was born at a zoo in Chongqing, where its mother
lives, and was flown to Shanghai, where the father is, on January
26. The father was Shanghai's only giant panda. The zoo has more
than 600 animal species, second only to Beijing Zoo in number.
</P>
<P>
The cub weighed only 110 grams at birth. It was left in the
mother's care until it grew strong enough to move to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Four keepers took turns looking after the cub round the clock
for the first month. The baby has easily adapted to life in the
zoo and has 760 milliliters of milk, 20 grams of calcium powder,
and bamboo leaves each day.
</P>
<P>
An air-conditioned shed has been prepared, as well as a slide,
a rockery, rubber balls and other toys. Keepers are still not
certain about its sex because the giant panda's genitalia are not
recognizable for about two years.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered animal
species. It has a very low reproductive capacity. A female giant
pandas become pregnant once a year and has one or two offspring
each time. Only 10 percent of the male giant pandas raised in
captivity have produced offspring.
</P>
<P>
China has tried many ways to increase the number of the speci
es and succeeded in breeding the first giant panda by artificial
insemination in 1963. Since then, 12 zoos and one animal reserve
in the world have bred about 140 giant pandas, but the survival
rate has been a rather low 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 1,000 giant pandas in existence, 80
percent of them in China's Sichuan Province.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Invites U.N. , OAU to Probe Angola Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has invited the United
Nations (UN) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to send
independent monitors to thoroughly investigate persistent Angola's
charges for providing military support to the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Wednesday night by Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the Zambian government said the Angolan government
threatened "to wage a war without truce" against UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi and what Angola calls his "co-regionalists" in
reference to Zambia, Uganda, Rwanda, Togo and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Thursday quoted the statement as
saying the Zambian government further requests Angola to provide
"credible information" on authorities involved in the logistic and
military support to Savimbi inside Angola.
</P>
<P>
After receiving formal complaint from Angola on the
allegations on January 18, Zambia summoned the charge d' affaires
of the Angolan embassy to explain his government's serious charges
and to convey to his government Zambia's request for information
which Angola said they had so that further investigations could be
instituted.
</P>
<P>
"Since then no response has been received from the Angolan
government," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government was forced to summon the envoy again on
January 26 to query when the "evidence" would be released but the
effort drew a blank, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Zambia had in 1998 invited the U.N. and the OAU to separately
carry out verification missions to areas where the Angola
government alleged Zambia was using to transport arms to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
All the teams cleared Zambia of the charges but surprisingly
Angola has threatened "to wage war without truce against Savimbi
and his co- religionists" again, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Official Quits IOC Seat over Alleged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the National
Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) Charles Mukora has announced to
quit the International Olympic Committee (IOC) council, but not to
let go his position in NOCK until the year 2001, media reports
here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mukora, one of the six IOC officials involved in the worst
scandal in the Olympic history, said Wednesday his resignation
from IOC was a matter of principle, following advice from IOC
President Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
He said he was a victim of circumstances, claiming that in his
last 40 years as a sport administrator, he has never been involved
or implicated in any scandalous deal.
</P>
<P>
The NOCK chief said his post of NOCK was elective and that he
will not relinquish before the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
Mukora alleged that the money he received from the Salt Lake
City Olympic bidders was used to set up a high altitude training
camp in Nayuki. "I have not used the money for my personal
purposes," he said. However, he did not mention where the
proceeds from the training establishment goes.
</P>
<P>
But when asked in what form the transactions were made, Mukora
retorted in one of largest attended sports news conferences at
NOCK office: "Find out from those who gave them out. I'm not the
one to tell you that."
</P>
<P>
Mukora is said to have been given 19 computers by the South
African Olympic body in 1991 so he could utter a voice for the
hitherto international isolated country's quick admission to the
Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports that in 1992 the NOCK boss had 1,200
color political campaign posters printed for him by the Kuala
Lumpur Commonwealth Games Federation.

SHENZHEN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province expects to raise local tax revenues by 12
percent this year to 13.45 billion yuan (1.62 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A local tax official said the city which borders Hong Kong wi
ll use taxation policies, especially favorable ones for new and
high-tech industries, to support development of large and key
businesses as major tax payers, and accelerate efforts to crack
down on tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen levied taxes totaling 14.68 billion yuan in 1997,
including local taxes of slightly over 12 billion yuan. The
latter figure was 25.8 percent growth on 1997 and was 12.5
percentage points higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The tax sharing system between the Central Government and the
governments at local levels has effectively increased state
coffers and spurred enthusiasm in different localities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The upward trend for real
estate prices in 35 major Chinese cities slowed during the forth
quarter of 1998, according to statistics released by the State
Development Planning Commission (SDPC) and the National Bureau
of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Prices for housing rose by one percent on a year-on-year basis
during the period, but dropped by 0.3 percentage point when
compared to the third quarter in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Prices for units in luxury housing complexes fell by an
average 4.3 percent on the 1997 period, with prices for units in
comfortable housing projects which are designed for low-income
earners jumped by 5.2 percent due to an increasing number of
purchasers.
</P>
<P>
Land prices grew by 1.3 percent on the basis of increasing
public land auctions of property for commercial development in
many cities.
</P>
<P>
Leasing costs dropped 1.7 percent on a year-on-year basis and
were down 2.6 percent on the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Official sources pointed to the large number of unsold
commercial houses in many Chinese cities, and the SDPC has urged
local governments to tighten supervision over housing prices in
order to expand domestic demand and promote economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Polices to Stimulate Agricultural Machinery Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese policies designed to
stimulate consumption are expected to promote sales of
agricultural machinery during 1999, according to an official with
the China Agricultural Machinery Distribution Association.
</P>
<P>
He predicted increased sales of small and heavy-duty tractors
and combines, and acknowledged that the agricultural sector's
strong demand for trucks will continue.
</P>
<P>
Replacing labor-intensive farming with mechanized operations
is inevitable along with the continued improvements in the living
standards of Chinese farmers and the introduction of new farming
methods.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only approximately 10 percent of the
nation's 230 million farming households own farm machinery.
</P>
<P>
The demand for agricultural machinery is expected to rise in
the wake of large-scale infrastructure construction which will
continue through this year, especially the development of
farmland and water conservancy projects, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, the central government will increase
funding to promote development in the sector. The central
government introduced a three-year plan last year to provide
annual subsidies of 20 million yuan (2.4 million US dollars) to
expand lightweight and heavy-duty tractors fleets in seven major
grain producing provinces.
</P>
<P>
The industry is, however, faced with various unfavorable
conditions, including low income expectations for farmers, the
official said, adding that the market has reached a relative
saturation point as a result of booming sales over the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
The total power output for agricultural machinery in 1998
approached 440 million kw, up five percent on the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> Greater Efforts Urged to Protect Antarctica's Ecosystem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The four-day Activity of
Ministerial Visit to Ice ended Thursday in Antarctica with
participants pledging to boost efforts to reinforce the Antarctic
Treaty, which was signed 40 years ago with an aim to protect the
fragile icy continent.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and senior officials from 24 out of the 43
consultative countries to the Antarctic Treaty gathered in
Antarctica over three days for a fact-finding trip and one-day
informal meeting at New Zealand's scientific research base of
Scott Station on Ross Island, and at the U.S. research base of
McMurdo Station, according to information reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The participants issued a communique Wednesday evening, saying
they pledge to combat illegal fishing in the Antarctic region.
</P>
<P>
"Representatives expressed in particular their grave concern at
the threat posed by continuing illegal, unregulated and unreported
fishing for toothfish," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The representatives pledged to work to meet these new
challenges and maintain the integrity of the Antarctic Treaty
system, the document said.
</P>
<P>
It added that there is a move towards recognizing the continent
as an integrated ecosystem covering both the land and surrounding
seas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the informal meeting, New Zealand Environment
Minister Simon Upton noted that the great bulk of the
uncontrolled fishing for toothfish in the waters has been and is
being carried out by companies and citizens domiciled in treaty
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic Treaty, which arose out of the Cold War, sets out
to foster the peaceful and non-commercial use of the world's
coldest and most inhospitable land mass.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the activity, which was sponsored by New
Zealand, included Australia, Austria, Britain, Sweden, Bulgaria,
the United States, Peru, Finland, the Netherlands, Argentina,
Canada, Chile, the Republic of Korea, Italy and Norway.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Wang Guangya took part in
the activity on behalf of the Chinese Government.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Takes No Initiative on East Timor Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
will not be taking any initiative to encourage independence for
East Timor, despite the U-turn by the Indonesian Government on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Television New Zealand (TVNZ) Thursday quoted New Zealand
Foreign Minister Don McKinnon as saying he welcomed comments by
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, suggesting that
independence for East Timor may be considered if his country's
current proposal for autonomy is not accepted.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon said Indonesia's suggestion about East Timor's future
needs to be clarified and he is waiting for more detailed reports
about Foreign Minister Alatas's remarks.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, what Minister Alatas has said is very
significant. It shows that there is flexibility in Indonesia's
thinking," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great opportunity for the parties to reach agreement
and settle the East Timor issue for once and all."
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand can live with any solution the parties agree to.
Any durable solution must meet the aspiration of the East
Timorese people themselves and we have been urging the parties to
the negotiations to ensure that their voice is more fully
represented in these talks," McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
But he said he does not want to preempt talks between the
Indonesian and Portuguese governments.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Private Press Rapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of the Information
Ministry of Zimbabwe Willard Chiwewe has strongly condemned local
privately-owned press and some sections of the foreign media for
advancing their political agenda by painting a bad image of
Zimbabwe, the Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an address at a workshop Wednesday to map out strategies on
how his ministry could face the challenge, Chiwewe said it was
unfortunate that some people were turning the journalism
profession into a weapon for attacking the government.
</P>
<P>
"Our image as a nation and government is under severe attack.
Information about Zimbabwe is being manufactured and manipulated
into lethal weapons for our downfall," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The targeted victims of this attack is our sense of pride and
confidence as a nation, government and citizens of this country.
Prophets of doom already see us as a nation without pride, nor
with will to govern itself.
</P>
<P>
They already see a Zimbabwe under a new puppet government which
serves foreign interests, at the expense of those of its own
citizens and electorate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The land policy, under which the government intends to take
back land from foreign ownership to the majority of Zimbabweans,
was the root cause for the attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our government has said 'land to the people', and we have
noticed that any government that is nationalist and defends
ownership of the land becomes an enemy," Chiwewe said.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry, in consultation with all stake-holders,
would soon come up with an information policy to regulate the
operations of the media while at the same time not negating the
basic tenets of press freedom.

BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Fixed asset investments in
China's telecommunications industry surged 39.2 percent on the
1997 figure to 175.4 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the postal sector attracted total investments
of 17 billion yuan, with 149.36 billion yuan going to China
Telecom, the nation's largest public telecommunications service
provider; and 7.35 billion yuan to Unicom, the second largest
provider.
</P>
<P>
Increases in telecommunications investments in the central and
western regions outstripped the level for relatively developed
eastern regions.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the rapid growth to central government
investment policies designed to stimulate the economy.

NAIRROBI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
developing a national biodiversity action plan to implement the
objectives of the Convention on Biodiversity, Environment Minister
Francis Nyenze has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Wednesday at the opening of a national workshop on
agricultural biodiversity, the minister said his government has

according to Thursday's Kenya Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The measures include a national policy on environment and a
draft environment management and coordination bill which have
adopted and reviewed biological diversity conservation in a more
comprehensive manner than before.
</P>
<P>
Nyenze told the workshop that in Kenya as in many other
developing countries, an important share of genetic biodiversity
has been rapidly lost together with the indigenous knowledge with
the adoption of high yielding varieties of crops and animals.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government recognizes the value and potential
of biodiversity in national economic development and is committed
to ensuring its sustained management within the prevailing
circumstances.

Feng said Christian scriptures from the Old and New testaments
have been published in over 20 different versions, including
English editions with Chinese translations, Chinese editions in
traditional and simplified characters, editions in ethnic mi
nority languages and in both portable and desk forms.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Professor Feng noted, eight million Hymnals have
been published since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The works are published and distributed by the Shanghai-based
Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant
Churches of China and the China Christian Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has published a large number of works
relevant to the Bible and Christian culture since the country
introduced reform and opening-up polices in the late 1970s, said
Feng.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that a dozen editions of Stories of the
Bible have been published, with the total number of the books
sold quite likely surpassing sales for the Bible.
</P>
<P>
"The country's economic disparity has created diversity in
terms of culture, ideology and beliefs," said Feng, adding that
"publication of the Bible at least to some extent contributed to
diversification."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a number of universities have set up Bible Studies
as a required course for students majoring in politics, art,
philosophy and literature, according to Feng.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the National Situation Research
Center under the CASS shows that the Bible has ranked 32nd on the
list of the most influential books in the country since the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, generally speaking, religion exerts less
influence upon the Chinese people than on the people in the West.
But as a matter of fact, an increasing number of Chinese
students traveling abroad and the expansion of cultural and
scientific exchanges between China and the outside world have
sparked a trend towards the growing influence of religion on
young people, said Feng.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women, most of whom live in rural areas in east and
central China, account for some 60 percent of the nation's
Christian population. In addition, many individuals with higher
education backgrounds follow Christianity, with a number
occupying leading positions in the National People's Congress,
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference and various government departments.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries Urged to Form Partnership for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister of Trade
and Industry Lee Yock Suan has urged ASEAN countries to form
partnership in the efforts to turn their sagging tourism
industries around and to attract a larger share of world tourist
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ASEAN tourism conference that opened here
Thursday morning, the minister said the theme of this year's ASEAN
Tourism Forum emphasizes the importance of partnership and
cooperation in restoring the vibrancy of the tourism industry and
helping to overcome the current economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Quoting data from the World Travel and Tourism Council, Lee
said GDP generated from tourism in South East Asia last year
dropped by 7.5 billion U.S. dollars or 11 percent to 70 billion
dollars from original estimate of 77 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Estimated employment in the regional tourism industry has
fallen by about 2 million jobs to 20 million jobs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the World Tourism Organization, the minister said the
tourism industry is going through a tough time as a result of the
Asian financial crisis with an estimated three percent decline for
the next two years in the international tourist arrivals around
the world and a projected drop of about 11 million tourist
arrivals in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention to the fact that ASEAN has much to offer in
terms of scenic beauty, history, culture, shopping and
traditional Asian hospitality, Lee said: "By combining our diverse
attractions into various tour packages, we will be better able to
entice tourists from distant locations who may otherwise not
come."
</P>
<P>
"Travelers tend to view the ASEAN region as a whole. The
challenge is for us to develop new ideas and products to enhance
the ASEAN tourism product and combat the negative fallout from
regional crisis," Lee stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China exported 211,000 tons
of caustic soda in 1998 in spite of the sluggish international
market, a year-on-year rise of 22.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
China faced great difficulties in selling caustic soda on
international market in the first seven months of last year due
to the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rebounding prices in the latter half of the year provided
Chinese producers with an opportunity to promote exports, which
rose by a wide margin after October.
</P>
<P>
Producers with export authority, especially large state-owned
enterprises, dominated exports for the year, with foreign trade
companies losing interest due to low profits.
</P>
<P>
The three leading exporters were the Shanghai Chlorine Caustic
Soda Co. Ltd., Sinopec International Qilu Company and Dagu
Chemical Plant of the Bohai Group.

Exports of liquid caustic soda outstripped the volume for both
flake and solid products.

<HEADLINE> Bohai Oil Field Plans Extensive Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bohai Oil Field, located
near the largest port city of Tianjin in north China, is carrying
out a new development strategy designed to increase its annual
production capacity to 10 million tons by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Lin Shaodong, president of the China Offshore Oil Bohai
Corporation (COOBC), said the 60,000-sq.km. field has carried out
extensive exploration and development over the past 30-odd years.
It will become the country's first offshore oil field capable of
producing over 10 million tons of oil annually.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the scientific planning and overall development
strategy covers four oil exploration areas around Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
The Liaobei Oil Exploration Area includes the Jinzhou 20-2 and
Jinzhou 9-3 oil fields; with the Liaozhong area covering Suizhong
36-1 field and Shijiu area focusing on the Qinhuangdao 32-6 field.
</P>
<P>
He said exploration efforts in recent years have determined
the Bohai Bay has abundant proven oil and gas reserves topping
800 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Suizhong 36-1 and Qinhuangdao 32-6 fields in the Bohai
Bay, China's largest offshore oil fields, have proven oil
reserves of over 100 million tons each.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that his corporation will use different oil
exploration and development methods in line with conditions in
the four areas, including both onshore and offshore exploration,
fast drilling techniques and ling pipelines.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully built
caissons for offshore oil platforms at the Jinzhou 9-3 Oil Field
in the Bohai Bay, according to Lin Shaodong, president of the
China Offshore Oil Bohai Corporation (COOBC).
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the Jinzhou field to develop 27 oil and 26
water injection wells, as well as one natural gas well. New
technology will be used to raise the field's annual oil drilling
capacity to one million tons. The Jinzhou 9-3 field is scheduled
to enter operations by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the field, which is located in icy waters about 20 km
from Jinzhou in Liaoning Province, has verified oil reserves of
well over 30 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that the use of high cost conventional methods
would have made it difficult to recover the investment.
Therefore, Chinese petroleum geologists have spent eight years
developing new technology to build platforms for oil production
and development.

<HEADLINE> More Attention to Be Paid to Poor Girl Dropouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- "Spring Bud Program", aiming
at helping impoverished girls continue schooling, is making
headway and will continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
"The program is progressing well and has higher goals to
reach," Gu Xiulian, vice-president of the China Children's and
Teenagers' Fund (CCTF), was quoted as saying by today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of 1998, the program has already helped 750,000
girls across the nations," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
"Spring Bud" has received 220 million yuan (about 27 million
U.S. dollars) of donations during the past 10 years. Special
classes were opened for girls in 29 provinces across the country.
</P>
<P>
Publicity has not only drawn donations for the program, but
also has helped root out the idea that men are superior to women,
the CCTF vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
"Spring Bud" began with a grant for poor girls in 1989. It
developed into a national program with a goal that all girl
drop-outs return to school and finish receiving nine-year
compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
CCTF president Chen Muhua expressed her gratitude for support
for the program from all walks of society, both from at home and
abroad, over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
More concern will be paid to poverty-stricken girls, Chen
said.

MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Intense fighting between
Philippine government forces and Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) rebels continued Thursday in Buldon, Mindanao, despite the
signing of a ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported that the ceasefire
agreement, which will be implemented within the next 48 hours, was
signed by members of the government and MILF peace panels in an
emergency meeting here Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are some facts and
figures about the population in the Tibet Autonomous Region and
the medical care for the people there:
</P>
<P>
After many years of effort, a basic medical and public health
network now covers the whole of the Tibet Autonomous Region. By
the end of 1997, Tibet had 1,324 medical and health
establishments, 214 more than in 1991; 6,246 hospital beds, 1,169
beds more than in 1991, averaging some 2.5 beds per 1,000 people;
10,929 medical and health personnel, 1,189 more than in 1991;
2.12 doctors and 0.7 nurse per 1,000 people; and 4,402 rural
medical and health personnel, a 24.46 percent increase over 1991.
Old Tibet, under the feudal serfdom, had only three officially
operated, small traditional Tibetan medical establishments, with
only crude medical equipment, and a few private clinics,
employing fewer than 100 medical practitioners. Even including
folk doctors of traditional Tibetan medicine, the number totaled
only about 400.
</P>
<P>
Medical treatment is free in farming and pastoral areas in
Tibet, and is financed jointly by personal medical insurance and
the state in cities and towns. From 1992 to 1997 the Central
Government and governments at different levels in Tibet disbursed
964.61 million yuan in expenditures for public medical services.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997 a total of 48 maternity and child care
centers and eight baby-friendly hospitals had been set up in
Tibet. In addition, 108 hospitals at and above the county level
now have departments of gynecology and obstetrics, and 110 key
townships have maternity and child care departments which have
monitored the development of more than 250,000 children and given
general surveys and treatments of common and frequently-occurring
diseases among them.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986 about 85 percent of the children in Tibet have
received BCG vaccine inoculations or drugs and inoculations
against poliomyelitis, pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus and
measles. Now 51.25 percent of children in the region below the
age of seven benefit from the local health care system specially
for children. Besides, modern delivery methods are available for
50.8 percent of child-bearing women in Tibet, and the rate
reaches 100 percent in Lhasa. In the counties where children's
health projects have been carried out, the infant mortality rate
decreased from 430 per thousand 40 years ago to 36.77 per
thousand in 1998.

Smallpox was eradicated in Tibet early in the 1960s, and some
other dangerous infectious and endemic diseases have also been
effectively controlled or wiped out. In 1996 the overall
incidence of and the mortality resulting from 14 infectious
diseases, such as typhoid fever, hepatitis, epidemic encephalitis
and influenza, dropped by 45.52 and 67.16 percent, respectively,
compared with the 1991 figures.
</P>
<P>
By 1995 poliomyelitis had been totally eliminated. The
government of the Tibet Autonomous Region is determined to keep
in step with other areas of China and stamp out diseases caused
by iodine deficiency by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In old Tibet, deadly infectious diseases such as smallpox and
the plague were endemic. It is recorded that during the 150 years
before Tibet was peacefully liberated there were four pandemic
outbreaks of smallpox, one of which, in 1925, killed 7,000 people
in the Lhasa area alone. Outbreaks of typhoid fever in 1934 and
1937 carried off some 5,000 people in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
The steady improvement of health care and living standards has
raised the average life expectancy of Tibetans from 36 years in
old Tibet to the present 65 years.
</P>
<P>
According to a thoroughgoing census carried out in Tibet
during the period 1734-1736 by the Central Government of the Qing
Dynasty, the population at that time was 941,200.
</P>
<P>
About two hundred years later, in 1953, the local government
of Tibet declared the region's population to be one million. That
is to say, the population of Tibet was almost at a standstill for
some two hundred years, only rising slightly by 58,000 people.
</P>
<P>
But in the 40 years from 1953 to 1993, after Tibet was
peacefully liberated, the population of Tibet grew from one
million to well over 2.3 million, of which the population of
Tibetans increased by 1.16 million, or a more than one-fold
increase in 40 years. By the end of 1997 the population of Tibet
had reached 2.44 million, 95 percent of whom were Tibetans.

BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans
to offer comprehensive management training to a greater number of
managers during 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent national enterprise training conference,
Zheng Silin, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC), said the training will cover small, medium and
large enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission will make a special effort to combine
elements such as how to extricate businesses from difficult
situation, and will offer intensified training to high-level
managers of enterprises on the road to profitability.
</P>
<P>
The commission initiated a three-year management training
project in early 1998, with over 180,000 executives from medium-
to large-sized state-owned enterprises attending the business
administration program by the end of the year. Participants came
from 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said training programs in some areas have been extended
to non-state businesses. He also noted that the commission will
designate 30 key training centers nationwide during 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Most shops across Zimbabwe had
run out of maize-meal, the country's staple food, by Wednesday,
with many blaming the millers for dragging their feet in an effort
to push up prices while millers blaming the railways for not
delivering grain, the daily Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a random survey by the Herald, it was found that most Harare
shops did not have maize-meal. Those few with supplies were
expected to run out by the weekend. Critical shortages have also
been reported in some other cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
The shortage began to be felt last week. Some chain stores in
central Harare and in low-density suburbs still had some packs.
Shop owners and managers did not know when they would get new
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
According to millers, the shortage of maize-meal is due to
inadequate supplies of grain from the Grain Marketing Board (GMB),
although the GMB has repeatedly assured the nation that there was
enough maize in the country to last until the next harvest.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been problems with the distribution of
maize, which have been blamed on the National Railways of
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
While the slow distribution of maize could be a factor, blame
is also being partly laid on the millers who are alleged to be
refusing to mill to force the government to increase maize-meal
prices.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM to Lobby EU Support for Bid to Secure WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan is to travel to Europe to lobby support for Thailand's
bid to secure the World Trade Organization's (WTO) top post.
</P>
<P>
Surin will meet European Commission Vice President Sir Leon
Brittan in Brussels on February 8 at the start of a five-day
visit, government sources said on Thursday. Sir Leon is
responsible for trade affairs for the 15-nation European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
Talks with Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Deryke are scheduled
for February 9 before Surin continues his tour to Austria and
France.
</P>
<P>
The WTO is expected to appoint a new chief to succeed Italy's
Renato Ruggiero by February 16. By early February, Swiss
ambassador William Rossier is due to report on the outcome of a
third round of consultations with member states.
</P>
<P>
Results of soundings announced in mid-December and January 20
put Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi clearly in
the lead, followed by Morocco's former trade minister Hassan
Abouyoub. But former New Zealand prime minister Mike Moore topped
the list of second preferences, followed by Roy Maclaren, Canada's
former trade minister and current High Commissioner in London.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries remain split in preference between Maclaren
and Abouyoub -- although most agree that a developing country's
candidate should take the top job at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is the only EU country opposed to a candidate from a
developing country, according to Thai ambassador to the WTO
Krirk-krai Jirapaet.
</P>
<P>
France is known to support Abouyoub. The positions of Austria
and Belgium are not known.
</P>
<P>
Germany has not yet made up its mind, said Krirk-krai. And
Britain "for whatever reason" will either choose Supachai or
Maclaren, he said, commenting on unconfirmed reports in Geneva
about a possible change of mind in London.
</P>
<P>
But a British embassy official in Bangkok on Wednesday
confirmed that London's position in support of Supachai, as
expressed in a letter to Surin by Ambassador James Hodge on
December 16, remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among WTO members have been going on for months
and they are to establish which candidate can be appointed by
consensus.
Only if that cannot be established could a formal vote be held.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and trade officials say they would prefer to
avoid such an outcome, arguing that the WTO director-general has
to be the "candidate of all the members" and not a figure whose
appointment is opposed by anyone.
</P>
<P>
The world trade body chief will have to steer the organization
to the expected launch in December of fresh global trade
organizations, to last until 2003.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the WTO and its predecessor the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade have always been headed by a European, and
developing countries have been increasingly vocal in calling for
appointment of a figure from their midst.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has promised to bridge the gap between developing
economies and richer nations if he wins the position.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has already won backing from Japan and other Asian
countries and has earned international respect for his role in
ensuring that Thailand resisted pressure to put up trade barriers
in reaction to the financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Issue 200m Dollar Industrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
issue industrial development bonds amounting to 200 million U.S.
dollars in a bid to prop up investment in the industrial sector,
the Financial Express daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The process has been initiated to release bonds by the first
half of the year, and the bonds will be sold at home and abroad, a
competent source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bond money will be used to finance term lending in the
industrial sector, and the return for the bond-owner will be made
attractive to allure buyers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will privatize the Bangladesh Shilpa
Rin Sangstha (Bangladesh Industrial Loan-giving Agency -- BILA)
since it has no role to play in the industrial sector, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Industrial loan disbursement in the first three months of the
July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year was 2.57 billion taka (about 53
million dollars), 11.4 percent higher than that made in the same
period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
But industrial circles said this quantum of disbursement in a
quarter of a year was not adequate for any tangible or worth
mentioning growth in the industrial sector or the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The agency will submit its report by March this year, and on
receiving the report, the government will move towards
privatization of the BILA. Open invitation will be made so that
interested local and foreign firms can participate in the bid.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the two measures taken by the government to step
up the functioning of the financial institutions and banks.
</P>
<P>
The other is to secure a 60-million-dollar loan from the World
Bank to finance industrial development through financial
institutions and local private and foreign banks, he added.

Western Provincial Council election results in Court, party

<HEADLINE> More State-Owned Enterprises to Be Privatized in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-eight more state economic
enterprises (SEE) in Myanmar will be privatized under the
country's privatization scheme, according to the Privatization
Commission Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SEEs to be sold through competitive bidding include four
factories, seven rice mills and 57 cinemas.
</P>
<P>
The SEEs also include those nationalized during the time of the
Revolutionary Council, the former government in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 134 state-owned
cinemas and more than two dozens saw mills have been privatized in
Myanmar. Some 42 factories and two livestock breeding farms have
earlier been designated to be sold through competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has, since January 1995, been implementing a
privatization plan for its SEEs, aimed at transforming them into
effective business organizations.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the scheme covers 51 SEEs including
processing and manufacturing factories, livestock breeding farms
and cinemas, and is being implemented in various forms --
auctioning and leasing out the enterprises or establishing joint
ventures with local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In a significant move to accelerate the privatization of heavy
industries, Myanmar transferred to local private entrepreneurs the
 Ywama Steel Mill last September, the biggest state-run enterprise
 leased out since the privatization plan began.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the first-phase privatization of all
small-scale SEEs has been completed and the second phase which
deals with about 1,760 medium- and large-scale SEEs is underway.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Spreads in Vietnam's Mountainous Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- HIV infection in Vietnam's
mountainous provinces was spreading at an alarming rate, Vietnam
News Agency (VNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's northern border province of Quang Ninh recorded a
rapid increase in the number of people who were HIV positive with
606 cases in 1997 and 1,500 cases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Other mountainous and central highlands provinces having high
numbers of HIV carriers include Lang Son with 500 detected cases,
Dac Lac 220, Lam Dong 152, Gia Lai 64 and Kon Tum 33.
</P>
<P>
Surveys jointly conducted by Vietnam's central epidemiology
institute and provincial medical centers showed that high risk
HIV/aids infection groups focused on drug addicts and ethnic
minority people.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase of the deadly disease in the Vietnam's
mountainous provinces is due to local inhabitants' habit of using
opium as their mountainous lands are home of opium poppy.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the disease from spreading, VNA said, the
eradication of poppy should be enforced in parallel with the fight
against drug smuggling and stockpiling. The availability of
information about the threat of HIV/aids must be improved among
mountainous community and care and consulting services should be
provided for detected HIV carriers.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam had detected 11,681 HIV carriers by January 9, 1999, of
them, 2,231 had developed full-blown aids and 1,180 had died of
the disease.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Plan to Bid for Expo 2002 Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Plans by Australia's
Queensland to bid for Expo 2002 have been dropped and the state is
considering to bid for a new expo in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Queensland Premier Peter Beattie said Thursday from Paris where
he met members of the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE),
that the BIE was unable to offer any flexibility to a Queensland
bid to host the event after the Philippines surrendered it,
Australian Associated Press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Queensland government wanted the bureau to grant the state
a number of concessions, the major one being allowing the event to
be pushed back to 2003.
</P>
<P>
Other concerns were a change in the theme of the Expo from
information technology, and the cost which the Treasury had
predicted could blow out to around 250 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Beattie said as almost a year had been lost because of the
delays caused by the Philippines decision, Queensland would have
been forced to rush ahead with construction of Expo 2002
facilities, which would have caused a massive cost increase.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines narrowly won the right to host the Expo 2002
over Queensland in June last year, but subsequently said it would
withdraw because of problems caused by the Asian downturn.
</P>
<P>
Beattie said Queensland could have launched a totally new bid
for an expo in 2003, but there would have been no guarantee of
getting it because the bid would have been open to competition
from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Beattie said the BIE had indicated the only other date open for
a Queensland bid was 2007, following an expo in Japan in 2005.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- American Michael Chang has
confirmed he would compete at the 350,000-U.S.-dollar Salem
Tennis Open in April, according to the reports reaching here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joining the former world number two player are former world
number one Boris Becker of Germany and reigning U.S. Open
champion Pat Rafter from Australia.
</P>
<P>
Chang, three-time winner in this ATP Tour event, is hoping
that his excellent run in Asia will help him move back into to
the top 10.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Chinese American, ranked 27th now, is not in
his best form due to some injuries. He has collected 12 titles in
Asia including the last one in Shanghai Open last year.
</P>
<P>
"I see every time I play in Hong Kong there is more support,
not just for me, but for the sport as well," said Chang, always a
favorite for the Hong Kong fans.
</P>
<P>
World No.70 Becker, now in semi-retirement, is still a
formidable force despite his modest ranking.
</P>
<P>
The 32-draw tournament will be held from April 5 to 11.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Vows to Upgrade Sino-Russian Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice Foreign Minister
Zhang Deguang on Wednesday called for confidence and patience in
boosting economic and trade relations between China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who is here attending the second plenary session of the
Sino-Russian Committee for Friendship, Peace and Development,
acknowledged that the biggest problem in bilateral ties was that
economic relations lag far behind political ties.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the minister said that China
stood ready to work together with Russia to improve trade
patterns, explore new areas of cooperation and look for new
points of trade growth.
</P>
<P>
It was especially important for the two sides to strengthen
economic and trade cooperation at regional levels, create a favora
ble legal environment and pay attention to ways of complementing
each other's strengths, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that confidence and patience were essential in
addressing bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Only on the basis of full understanding and confidence can
bilateral economic and trade relations be really developed,"
Zhang said, adding that time was needed for the two sides to move
from ordinary exchanges toward substantial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Due to an unstable ruble and a slump in the Russian economy,
Sino-Russian trade was estimated to drop 10 percent to 5.5
billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from 6.12 billion dollars in 1997,
according to China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Port City Opening up Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The port city of Qingdao in
east China's Shandong Province has drawn a steady stream of
overseas investments to its agricultural sector, said its deputy
mayor Cui Xizhu.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city approved 269 overseas-funded agricultural
projects, with combined contractual overseas capital of 440
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The funds have come from 18 countries and regions, including
Japan, the United States and Australia, with those from Asia
constituting the major part, despite the negative impact of the
deepening Asian financial crisis, according to Cui.
</P>
<P>
About half of the projects are engaged in the processing of
farm produce. One of them is a food products factory funded by an
entrepreneur from the Republic of Korea with 30 million U.S.
dollars. It aims to produce 1,800 tons of dehydrated vegetables,
1,900 tons of flavorings and 900 tons of other foodstuffs a year
upon operation.

<HEADLINE> Troubled Di Canio Joins West Ham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Paolo Di Canio, who was banned
last year for 11 games for pushing a referee, joined West Ham on
Wednesday after four months out of the game and immediately vowed
to clean up his act.
</P>
<P>
The Italian joined the London club in a double swoop which
also saw Cameroon midfielder Mark Vivien Foe arrive from French
champions Lens for a West Ham record fee of more than 4 million
pounds (6.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two deals are believed to have cost The Hammers around 6
million pounds, but money was available following the recent sale
of John Hartson to Wimbledon for 7.5m.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio, who has agreed a two and a half year deal, has not
played a competitive game since pushing over referee Paul Alcock
during Wednesday's game with Arsenal last September.
</P>
<P>
He was banned for 11 matches by the Football Association and
then returned to Italy, where he claimed he was suffering from
stress and depression.
</P>
<P>
"I made a mistake. Now I am here to play good football for my
new club. Just now I have only that thing in my mind," said Di
Canio.
</P>
<P>
"I want to play football because I miss it. I have paid a big
price and now I want to play."
</P>
<P>
Foe was a target for Manchester United last season but their
interest cooled when he suffered a broken leg, which put him out
of the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
He moves to the Premiership from French club Lens on a
five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
West Ham is also reported to be interested in signing
Liverpool full-back Rob Jones.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Stays Firm on Myanmar Participation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) would continue to press the European Union
into granting Myanmar full participation in the upcoming ASEAN-EU
ministerial meeting, a Thai official said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting scheduled for March 30 in Berlin is a bloc-to-bloc
gathering and ASEAN would not accept any "discriminatory"
treatment against its members, said Thai Foreign Ministry
permanent secretary Saroj Chavanaviraj, quoted by Thursday's
Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the EU decided not to ease sanctions against
Myanmar, an indication that Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung
would not be invited to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would not abandon its efforts to press for Myanmar's
participation in the meeting, said Saroj.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Thailand has not consulted the other
ASEAN members on the latest EU decision, he would reiterate
ASEAN's position with the EU and Germany, which has the EU
presidency, that the meeting should be involved the same level of
ministers on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Saroj, who left for Berlin on Wednesday to prepare for the
meeting, said he would seek the opportunity to raise the Myanmar
issue.
</P>
<P>
The EU and ASEAN have been at loggerheads over Myanmar since it
was admitted into ASEAN in July 1997. The EU imposed six-month
sanctions on the issuing of visas for members of the Myanmar
military leadership. The sanctions were extended in October for
another six months.
</P>
<P>
Saroj said Thailand and Germany have been trying to resolve
the Myanmar issue, particularly to ease visa sanctions, so that
the Myanmar foreign minister could join other ASEAN counterparts
in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN had repeatedly argued that Myanmar has twice participated
at the same level with Europeans in meetings such as the
Post-ASEAN Ministerial Meeting which ASEAN holds with its dialogue
partners and the ASEAN Regional Forum on security issues.

BUCHAREST, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Romania ranks 37th among the
50 most corrupt countries in the world, a symposium here quoted
United Nations statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, entitled, "Corruption -- Social Reality and An

Nine O'Clock reported.
</P>

Emilian Stancu, dean of the national police academy, said at

</P>
<P>
Corruption's ugly head is looming over Romania, from the
highest levels of society and working its way down, he added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rise in corruption partially to the poor
economic condition of the country.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Flood Victims Enjoy Increased Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The average income per capita of
farmers in central China's Hubei Province, an area devastated by
last summer's record flooding, has jumped by some 70 yuan thanks
to the post-flood vegetable harvest.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government not only extended great efforts to
reinforce levees, but also adopted timely measures to shift the
focus of agriculture from grain to vegetables and animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the vegetable output hit 30 million tons and for
the first time ever surpassed grain production. This alone added
100 yuan to the per capita income of local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that vegetables were planted on 200,000
hectares after flood water receded in the Yangtze River Valley.
In addition, farmers compensated for losses by raising several
million pigs and over 80 million chickens and ducks.
</P>
<P>
The flood impacted over 530,000 ha. of farmland in the
province, one of China's main major grain cultivation bases.
Nonetheless, the 1998 grain harvest of 24.7 million tons
represented a bumper harvest in the third place in history, with
the output of oil-bearing crops hitting a record 2.17 million
tons.

<HEADLINE> Spain Asks Britain to Release Detained Boat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The government of Spain on
Wednesday asked Britain to unconditionally release within 72
hours a Spanish fishing boat and the people on board detained by
the authorities of the Gibraltar Strait.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Spain will take "appropriate measures" to protect
its interests, including to "take back the sovereignty over the
Strait of Gibraltar," said the Spanish foreign ministry while
summoning British Ambassador to Spain Peter Torre.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Spanish official also warned that if Britain
does not meet his country's requirement, Spain will possibly take
control over the gate of the strait.
</P>
<P>
The boat was detained several days ago by the Gibraltar patrol
when it was fishing in the waters near the strait, which is
currently a colony of Britain. But Spain claims sovereignty over
the strait.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Britain have been quarreling about the sovereignty
of the Strait of Gibraltar for years. Last summer, the two
countries reached an agreement over fishing in waters of the st
rait, but conflicts over the issue still occur occasionally.

STOCKHOLM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A cold wave from the
Atlantic Ocean landed on Finland, Norway and Sweden Tuesday,
forcing delay of trains and close-down of airports and schools in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
In the three Nordic countries, the temperature in areas within

<P>
Northern Norway's Lautokeinko district recorded a temperature

</P>
<P>
According to Sweden's state weather bureau, the temperature in
the northern part of the country also went down to minus 49

crisis, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region handled 4.26 million
tons of traded goods in 1998, an increase of 5.8 percent over

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Charles Mukora, Kenya's
representative in the International Olympic Committee (IOC),
announced on Wednesday that he was resigning from the
organization but denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Mukora, one of the six IOC members facing expulsion, said he
was a victim of unfair "club" decisions which only punished the
juniors.
</P>
<P>
"You know how decisions are made in clubs. When any rules are
broken, big or small, it is likely that the sword will fall on
you," Mukora told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
"I am a victim of circumstances. I have never been party to
any improper activities in my 40 years in sports," he added.
</P>
<P>
"President Samaranch has advised the six IOC members,
including myself, to resign to save the IOC from its current
problems. I have decided to take President Samaranch's advice,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mukora reportedly received direct payments totaling 34,650
U.S. dollars from Salt Lake before it won a 1995 vote to stage
the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Mukora said he would not relinquish his other posts --
chairman of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya and
membership on the committees of the International Amateur
Athletic Association and the Commonwealth Games Federation.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Copper Agency Cuts Costs to Counter Price Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Chile's National Copper
Corporation Codelco announced a cost-cutting program Wednesday in
the face of a worldwide price slump.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Codelco chief Marcos Lima met with
Chilean President Eduardo Frei and with Finance Minister Eduardo
Animat to discuss a budget reduction of 430 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chile is the world's largest copper producer, with exports of
the metal accounting for 40 percent of the government's revenues.
The country has lost 1.8 billion dollars because of the global
price drop.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1998, copper prices have remained at 65 U.S.
cents a pound, the lowest level since 1987. In 1998, copper
prices on world markets closed at an average 74.97 cents a pound,
against an average of 1.03 dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Codelco has been one of the public companies hardest hit by
falling investment. It received 450 million dollars for this
year, 34.2 percent less than last year.
</P>
<P>
This year's budget is based on copper prices averaging 73
cents a pound. The government expects prices to oscillate between
70 and 75 cents, saying prices should go up in 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua)-- The Civil Aviation
Administration of China has suspended the sales licenses of nine
air ticket agencies after they were caught cheating airlines.
</P>
<P>
CAAC said that it has withdrawn the agencies' sales
certificates and requested industrial and commercial departments
to suspend or amend the firms' business licenses. An
investigation revealed the agencies obtained a combined 69,000
yuan (8,313 US dollars) by cheating airlines while selling 63
tickets.
</P>
<P>
The agencies recorded different prices on different pages of
the tickets. None of the figures recorded different prices
reflected the actual prices, which were withheld from the
airlines. The acts constituted violation of the Regulation on the
Management of Sales Agencies on civil Aviation Transportation.
</P>
<P>
The agencies are located in Xiamen, Shenyang, Dalian,
Changchun, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Lianyungang and shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 5,000 air fare agencies are located throughout
the country.
</P>

Cheating and price wars contributed to the Chinese airlines'
losses last year.

<HEADLINE> China Call For Prevention Of Work-Related Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua)-- China is taking strong measures
to bring down the rate of work-related accidents, which has risen
to a serious degree in the past 50 days.
</P>
<P>
Slack accident-prevention practices, insufficient inputs to
shore up safety infrastructures, shoddy products and project
quality were blamed for the high death toll of more than 84,700
lives since November last year. The accidents took place in
industrial, mining and transportation enterprises nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Shi Wanpeng, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said recently that production safety should be a top
priority for enterprises when they are working to improve
economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"The safety production responsibility system, as proven
effective for years, should be sustained and improved in each
sector," he said, adding that the governments at all levels
should incorporate work safety in local economic and social
development plans.
</P>
<P>
He urged every enterprise to conduct accident-prevention
inspections soon and to plug safety loopholes and rectify loose
management and discipline.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security has sent work groups
nationwide to supervise the implementation of safety rules in
work places.
</P>
<P>
To reduce accidents and protect environment as well, China
will continue to shut down illegal mines and irrationally
distributed small coal mines, while closing small glass and
cement factories, oil refineries and steel mills that waste
energy and pollute the environment.

MEXICO CITY, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A giant volcano 75
kilometers southeast of Mexico City was shaken by several quakes
Wednesday, spewing ashes and gas 3,000 meters into the air, the
National Disaster Prevention Center said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the frequency of the tremors, authorities are
maintaining a state of yellow alert -- an emergency level just
below red alert -- saying residents are not at risk at present.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists said they registered a quake lasting more than
40 minutes in the Popocatepetl volcano in the early afternoon and
predicted a rain of ash on communities on the mountain's
northeast side.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday night, the neighboring states of Puebla and
Morelos were hit by a quake with a magnitude of 3.4 on the
Richter scale. But it was unclear whether it was linked to the
volcanic activity.
</P>

A major eruption of the volcano would affect the states of

<HEADLINE> Animal Fossils Found in Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A local fisherman in east
China's Fujian Province hauled over 110 pieces of vertebrate
animal fossils into his nets as he fished in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The fossil fragments were later found to be from a wide range
of animals including horses, deer, rhinoceros, buffaloes, pigs
and ancient elephants which experts reckon date back to the last
glacier stage, or the late Quaternary period (15,000-30,000 years
ago).
</P>
<P>
The assessment of the find was made by Qi Guoqin, a vertebrate
paleontologist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who revealed
that the haul also contained the lower jaw bone of an extinct
elephant species; measuring 60 cm in length. It is believed to be
of high archaeological value.
</P>
<P>
Qi believes the discovery of the fossils can prove the
existence of the Dongshan continental shelf off China's
southeastern coast tens of thousands of years ago.
</P>
<P>
"These animals might have migrated from areas around the
Yangtze and Huaihe rivers and have spent winter in the area which
is now Fujian. For centuries this location has been covered by
water and is known as the Penghu Sea Trench," Qi said.

awards the Games to Athens, but with more transparent criteria."

Rutelli told Italian television RAI: "I know that after the

Rome's bid was the best and that a few hours before the final
vote, Rome was in first place. Then everything changed."
</P>

"If the IOC wants to restore transparency, it should entrust
the decision to a technical body which is above all suspicion and
then everyone will be at ease."

On Monday, Greece's Olympics chief said Athens had nothing to
hide and welcomed any probe stemming from the corruption scandal

BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China's township-run
businesses grew steadily in 1998, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The turnover of township enterprises were up 16 percent to 9.5
trillion yuan and profits rose 11 percent to 540 billion yuan.
The added value of such enterprises was estimated at 2.4 trillion
yuan last year, 17.5 percent more than for 1997.

<P>
The added value of township businesses in central parts grew
17.4 percent in the first 11 months and in western parts it grew
27.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses are a major force in township enterprise
growth, with the added value worth a trillion yuan, up 22.6
percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, township enterprises are facing difficulties, with
exports in 1998 estimated at 8 percent, 8.8 percentage points
lower than for the previous year. And, 15 percent of China's
township enterprises suffered losses in 1998, which was 7
percentage points higher for the previous year. Total losses of
companies operating in the red rose 25 percent to 60 billion
yuan.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Wheat Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China's wheat output will
continue to fall short of demand during the first 20 years of the
21st century, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
An article in a recent issue of China Business News estimated
the shortfall will hit 6.3 billion kg in 2010 and rise even
further to 7.35 billion kg by 2020. The estimates were based on
the assumption that land dedicated to the production of wheat
will remain unchanged and China's population will hit 1.42
billion and 1.5 billion in the respective years.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall will be even more critical if the cultivation
area continues to drop, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
China has dedicated around 29.33 million ha. annually to wheat
production since the 1980s, with output rising continuously due
to the rapid growth in unit output.
</P>
<P>
The country's total wheat output for 1992 hit 100 billion kg,
and the output per mu (15 mu equals to one hectare) jumped from
126 kg to 236 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate for output has headed to a continued
drop over the past few years. The situation will not improve
substantively unless there is a major breakthrough in breeding
technology, analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Home Ownership in U.S. Sets Record in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The home ownership rate in
the United States rose to a new high of 66.3 percent in 1998 from
65.7 percent recorded in the previous year, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 69.1 million households owned their homes during
1998, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
Economists cite last year's strong economic growth, which
brought the unemployment rate to a 29-year low of 4.5 percent,
and low interest rates -- under 7 percent since mid-June for
fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages -- as the forces propelling the
increase in home ownership.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration programs, including Federal Housing
Administration mortgage insurance, also have helped.
</P>
<P>
However, following the usual seasonal pattern, the home
ownership rate slipped a bit during the final three months of
last year, from a record 66.8 percent in the July-September
period to 66.4 percent in October-December.
</P>
<P>
The rate for whites last year was 72.6 percent, up from 72
percent in 1997. For blacks, it was 46.1 percent, up from 45.4
percent. And for Hispanics, it was 44.7 percent, up from 43.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Also, for the first time, the home ownership rate in central
cities hit 50 percent, up from 49.9 percent the year before. In
the suburbs, the rate rose to 73.6 percent, up 0.8 percent from
1997.
</P>
<P>
By region, home ownership rates rose from 62.4 percent to 62.6
percent in the Northeast, from 70.5 percent to 71.1 percent in
the Midwest, from 68 percent to 68.6 percent in the South and
from 59.6 percent to 60.5 percent in the West.

MADRID, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes on Wednesday urged the international community to make
every effort to resolve the Kosovo crisis through dialogue,
saying air strikes would not bring an end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
His comments came at a time when the international community
is trying to increase pressure on both the Serbian authorities
and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) to seek a negotiated
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Matutes said ethnic Albanians in the southern Serbian province
of Yugoslavia had not yet sent representatives to negotiate with
Serbian authorities, constituting a major obstacle to a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
He said the separatist guerrillas in Kosovo had received a
large amount of weapons from the ultra-nationalists, which
aggravated violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish foreign minister complained that the European
Union had no common foreign and security policies to handle the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany, Greece and Italy on Monday rejected proposals
to strengthen the EU's existing package of sanctions against
Belgrade by introducing a visa ban on ministers from both the
federal Yugoslav and Serbian governments.
</P>
<P>
Under an existing sanctions package, the EU has already
imposed a visa ban on Yugoslav officers or officials directly
involved in the repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It has also frozen Yugoslav and Serbian government assets held
in EU countries, banned new investment in Serbia and refused
landing rights to the Yugoslav state airline JAT.

<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Two major high-tech Chinese
companies, Great Wall Group and Legend Group, have been given the
"Chinese Renowned Trademark" award by the central government's
market watchdog, State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The award is given for market recognition and consumer
satisfaction and an overall assessment of the company's
performance and future prospects.
</P>
<P>
A senior Great Wall manager says that his company is China's

the industry in assets, profits, exports, and magnetic head and
integrated circuit card production in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Great Wall is improving its reputation in the world. It signed
an agreement with a Cote D'ivoire partner in June 1998 on a o
ne-million-U.S. dollar joint venture that is expected to produce
30,000 to 50,000 personal computers annually in its initial phase
of production.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares For Possible Flooding On Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- People on the middle and
lower reaches of the Yellow River have been preparing for
possible flooding this year and working on more than 1,000 km of
levees along the river.
</P>
<P>
The 5,464-km river is second in length after the Yangtze and
passes through 7 provinces and 2 autonomous regions before
emptying into the Bohai Sea. The water from the upper reaches of
the river has been decreasing and valleys along the middle and
lower reaches have been hit by prolonged droughts.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show major floods following severe
droughts, according to Chen Xiaoguo, chief engineer at the
Ministry of Water Resources' Yellow River Water Conservation
Committee, who told Xinhua that there could also be floods on the
Yellow River because the sub-tropical high pressure that caused
flooding on the Yangtze last year is likely to move northward to
the Yellow River Valley this year.
</P>
<P>
Hydrology records also show flooding on the Yellow River often
coming 3 or 4 years later than on the Yangtze. In 1954, flooding
occurred on the Yangtze, and a similarly devastating flood
happened on the Yellow River in 1958. Chen says that areas along
the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River need to
introduce the responsibility system that was used with success in
dealing with last year's devastating flooding on the Yangtze to
prepare for possible flooding.
</P>
<P>
They also need to work on the more than 1,000 km of existing
embankments along the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow
River, with special attention being paid to the levee along the
lower reaches so that it can withstand a flow of 22,000 cu m per
second.
</P>
<P>
Workers at the Xiaolangdi water control project near the city
of Luoyang in Henan Province are expected to build the dam to a
height of 210 m before this year's flood season starts, but if
there is flooding on the Yellow River, the Sanmenxia Reservoir
upstream will be used to protect the World Bank-financed project,
Chen says.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River drops 4,800 meters in its run to the sea and,
as a result of serious silting, the coast of the Bohai Sea is
constantly shifting.
</P>
<P>
Since the latter half of last year, China has increased
spending on flood-control works on the Yellow River. In 1998, it
spent 1.67 billion yuan (about 201 million U.S. dollars),
according to Chen.

OTTAWA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Wednesday that
it will contribute 1 million Canadian dollars (650,000 U.S.
dollars) in support of the efforts of West African peacekeepers
to re-establish stability in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has identified an urgent need to assist
forces of the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOMOG) as they work to restore security
in that country.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is deeply disturbed by the atrocities committed during
this conflict, particularly the terror inflicted upon children
and civilians by the rebel groups," said Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy in a release issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Sierra Leone illustrates the pressing need
for the United Nations and its member states to take practical
steps in order to protect civilians in armed conflict and curtail
access to arms," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Canada's contribution came amid reports of renewed atrocities
committed against innocent civilians by the rebel Revolutionary
United Front and continuing efforts of the West African
peacekeeping force ECOMOG to support the elected government of
President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has chosen ECOMOG as its peacekeeping
partner in the region and has called upon member states to
provide assistance to ECOMOG and the government of Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan, Turkmenistan to Intensify Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Turkmenistan
have reaffirmed their full commitment to an early restoration of
durable peace in the war-ravaged Afghanistan and agreed to
intensify diplomatic efforts towards this end.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries of Afghanistan have also agreed
to promote the Afghan peace process both bilaterally as well as
through the mechanism of the U.N.-sponsored "Six Plus Two" group.
(Afghanistan's six immediate neighbor plus Russia and the U.S.)
</P>
<P>
This is the major message contained in a joint statement issued
here Wednesday at the end of Turkmen Foreign Minister Boris
Shikhmuradov's two-day visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed that "the restoration of durable peace
and stability in Afghanistan is of utmost importance and outside
interference and the supply of arms to different Afghan factions
should be completed stopped."
</P>
<P>
It also said that Pakistan, Turkmenistan and other related
countries should work together, by promoting dialogue between
Afghan groups and sending a joint mission to the war-ravaged
country, to create necessary conditions for the Afghans to decide
among themselves a formula for sustainable peace.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that "the prevailing situation in
Afghanistan presented a unique opportunity for the establishment
of durable peace through the formation of a broad-based and
multi-ethnic government."
</P>
<P>
Shikhmuradov arrived here Monday evening at the invitation of
his Pakistani counterpart Sartaj Aziz. During his stay here, he
held a formal meeting with Aziz mainly focused on the long-running
Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen foreign minister said that his country would work
closely with Pakistan and other countries for an early ending of
the Afghan conflict which has lasted for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers exchanged views on the proposed "Six Plus
Two" meeting in Uzbekstan's capital of Tashkent next month which
six countries with common borders with Afghanistan including
Pakistan and Turkmenistan, plus Russia and the U.S. will take
attend.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will review implementation of the "Points of Common
understanding" reached in the last meeting of the group at New
York in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmuradov also called on Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif during his visit. They stressed the need for immediate
restoration of durable peace in Afghanistan so that the enormous
potential for commercial and economic cooperation between the two
countries would be fully tapped.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also reiterated their firm resolution on the
construction of a 915-mile gas pipeline project from Turkmenistan
to Pakistan via Afghanistan despite the withdrawal of the major
investor, American company UNOCAL.
</P>
<P>
During Shikhmuradov's meetings separately with Pakistani
Petroleum Minister Nisar Ali Khan and a high-level Taliban
delegation, it was decided that a tripartite meeting of senior
officials from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkmenistan will take
place in the next two months to activate the project.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmuradov's visit was part of the fresh international
efforts to promote a negotiated settlement of the long-standing
Afghan imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has also invited foreign ministers of Iran, Kyrgyzstan,
Kazakhstan for talks on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary General's special envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi is also expected to embark on an
extensive tour to Iran, Pakistan and Central Asian republics later
this month or next month to make last preparations for the
upcoming "Six Plus Two" meeting.

<HEADLINE> Children's Clothing Market Neglected in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China's huge market for
children's clothes has been seriously neglected by local
designers, according to the China Textile News.
</P>
<P>
This has meant headaches for parents when buying clothes for
their children. Many young people have also been forced to wear
unfashionable, adult style, outfits, which they dislike,
according to an article in the trade newspaper published by the
State Administration of the Textile Industry.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, foreign brand-names such as Nike, Puma,
Adidas, Benneton, and Fila have taken advantage of the situation
and snaffled a huge share of the youth clothing market in China.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, many primary and middle school children in the
cities wear rather dull school outfits during the week and change
into quite expensive foreign-brand sportswear at the weekends.
</P>
<P>
At several fashion fairs held in Beijing last year there were
only a few examples of modern, bright children's clothing and
even most of those exhibited were foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
With potential consumers estimated at over 300 million, the
children's clothing market in China has huge potential. It is a
pity, therefore, that it is largely occupied by foreign names,
many of which are ironically actually made in China with local
materials with only the logos identifying their foreign
provenance.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, local designers are scrambling for a share of
the already very crowded female clothing market, the article
observed.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's editorial urged Chinese fashion designers to
pay much more attention to the children's market in order to help
parents seeking out acceptable clothes for their offspring.

<HEADLINE> L.Americans Call for Canceling Of "Immoral" Debt in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The first Latin
American meeting on the region's foreign debts ended Wednesday
with a call to cancel next year what it called "the immoral and
illegal debt" owed by countries with low and medium incomes.
</P>
<P>
Participants from 27 American, African and European countries
agreed that the funds from the canceled debts should be used in
human development programs such as job creation and education.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Latin America's foreign debt had soared
from 60 billion U.S. dollars in the 1970s to a staggering 706
billion dollars at the end of last year, plus 123 million dollars
in interest.
</P>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1996, the region paid 739 billion dollars in
interest, more than the total accumulated debt.
</P>
<P>
The participants said that the debt was "impossible to pay
now," following the failure of two debt rescheduling programs in
the past 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Villa Step up Juninho Chase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Aston Villa boss John Gregory has held face to face talks with
Brazilian star Juninho in a bid to persuade him to join the club.
</P>
<P>
Villa are willing to pay 10 million pounds for the Atletico
Madrid midfielder but face opposition from his former club
Middlesbrough.
</P>
<P>
The club is believed to have offered the 25-year-old a
five-year contract worth 1.5 million pound per year, far less
than the 30,000 pounds a week he currently receives in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Doug Ellis is fully behind Gregory and the
possibility of a place in the Champions' League next season may
swing things their way.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough have, meanwhile, dismissed reports that they
have drawn up a 30 million pounds package in an attempt to lure
him back to the Riverside Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Assistant manager Viv Anderson said: "The figures people are
reading about are ridiculous. How could any club be expected to
find that kind of money for any player?"
</P>
<P>
They sold Juninho for 12.5 million pounds 18 months ago and
have first refusal if he decides to return to the FA Premiership.
</P>
<P>
"We have a valuation of Juninho. When the time comes, we will
let Atletico Madrid know what it is.
</P>
<P>
"If the fee turns out to be too expensive, then there is no
chance of any deal taking place. It is absolutely vital for any
club to stay within its own financial constraints," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting to see how much Aston Villa offer. Once we
have been given this information by Atletico Madrid, we will go
on from there," Anderson added.

WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Miami Heat coach Pat
Riley said he'd like to sign Dennis Rodman if the NBA "Worm" will
follow team rules.
</P>
<P>
"I would issue a challenge to Dennis in this way: I think
Dennis is a winner, a rebounder, a defender, and he may still
have enough in him to help a young team win a championship,"
Riley said in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, 37, changed his mind from retirement and said he would
play for Miami or Orlando, but the Magic have said they are not
interested in the Chicago Bulls' forward.
</P>
<P>
Heat general manager Randy Pfund has disccussed with Rodman's
representative about his salary. Riley said the Heat could offer
Rodman only US$1 million this season.
</P>
<P>
"I really think he has what it takes to teach a team how to
win. That could be a legacy of his," Riley said.
</P>

Rodman and his wife, Carmen Electra, are in Miami for the

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- New York Knicks forward
Buck Williams retired today, turning down a chance at an elusive
championship and ending a 17-year career in NBA.
</P>
<P>
"I feel proud to leave the game with dignity and honor while
there is still something left in the tank," said the 38-year-old
Williams. "Dr King once said longevity has its place and I have
reached the pinnacle of my career."
</P>
<P>
Williams admitted that the NBA lockout made his decision
easier. He still took a week to make his decision.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to rush to judgment. I think you really have to
be secure emotionally, physically and mentally to make this
important decision," he added.
</P>
<P>
Williams pulled down 13,023 career rebounds but an NBA title
just out of his grasp. He was a member of the 1990 and 1992
Portalnd Trail Blazers, who lost in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
Williams ranks 10th on the all-time rebounding list but has
been hampered by several minor injuries the last three seasons.
He began his career with the New Jersey Nets and spent seven
years with the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
Last season, Williams was slowed by a injured left knee and
played in just 41 games, averaging 4.9 points and 4.5 rebounds
per game.
</P>
<P>
Williams is one of only eight players in league history with
16,000 and 12,000 rebounds. He ranks fourth on the all-time list

farmer in Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province, has
spent 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars) over the past
three years on a 20-hectare botanical garden.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made some money quite early by opening a restaurant and
now also leases 400 hectares of coastal area for shallow
saltwater cultivation.
</P>
<P>
When he began to see China's need for environmental
protection, he decided to begin a second career in 1996 by
renting 4 hectares of land from the local government for trees
and then bought books on plants and consulted many prominent
botanists.
</P>
<P>
He also hired some botanists and built greenhouses to grow
plants from the southern part of China and has propagated more
than 100 types of plants. Then last year, he leased 14 more
hectares of land and added 300 more varieties, then used some of
his profits to plant some short-term rapid-growth rare trees like
yews and gingkoes on 6 hectares of land.

according to Cai Weimin, a member of the research team at Harbin
Polytechnic University in Heilongjiang province.

<HEADLINE> hke012804 -Australia Welcomes Prospect of East Timor Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Affairs
Minister Alexander Downer Thursday welcomed Indonesia raising the
prospect of an independent East Timor, an issue which he said had
sometimes complicated that country's relationship with Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government said it may grant independence this
year to the troubled territory, ending two decades of
quasi-military rule, if a majority of the people there reject an
offer of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made a forthwith response to the issue by
saying "the Australian government warmly welcomes the new
flexibility that Indonesia has shown in its policy towards East
Timor," Downer, who is in Dubai now, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said more details were needed before a definitive judgment
could be made.
</P>
<P>
"As a preliminary reaction, I welcome the willingness that
Indonesia is now demonstrating to take account of the wishes of
the East Timorese people themselves," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"As was made clear in the Prime Minister John Howard's recent
letter to President Habibie, Australia believes this is the key to
resolution of the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
"Australia supported the bold proposal for wide-ranging
autonomy that President Habibie offered East Timor last year and
we still hope that this will prove the basis for a lasting
settlement between Indonesia and the East Timorese people."
</P>
<P>
Downer said issues raised by the Indonesian announcement were
important and needed measured and careful consideration by all
parties to enable an orderly and peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
"The maintenance of peace and calm in East Timor is of
paramount importance and I urge all sides to exercise restraint
and good will," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A primary objective of Australia's foreign policy is to
maintain a close and cooperative relationship with Indonesia ...
</P>
<P>
"From time to time, differences between Australia and Indonesia
over East Timor have caused complications in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the new flexibility Indonesia is now
demonstrating in its policy will mean that the East Timor issue
will be less of an irritant in our relations with Jakarta."
</P>
<P>
Downer said he also welcomed the Indonesian government's
decision to move resistance leader Xanano Gusmao from the prison
where he has been incarcerated.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Congress Approves Austerity Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Congress on
Wednesday approved an austerity budget for 1999 that will comply
with the government's fiscal adjustment plan to acquire a primary
surplus of 8.58 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 21.7-billion-dollar budget, which was approved by 301-81
in the Chamber of Deputies and by 59-9 in the Senate, was 17
percent less than the original proposal introduced in August last
year.
</P>
<P>
The cuts are part of an austerity policy to save 14.7 billion
dollars this year through a series of tax hikes and budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
The austerity policy is required by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) in exchange for a 41.5-billion-dollar aid package
announced more than two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Pro-government legislators said the budget's quick approval
was a sign that Congress was serious about making the painful
cuts needed to boost investor confidence and solve Brazil's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The cuts affect almost every ministry and federal department,
but the heaviest trimmings are for investments in infrastructure
projects.

The government's recent problems in approving fiscal reforms
renewed investor concern, creating pressure on Brazil's currency,
the real.
</P>
<P>
After spending billions of dollars in foreign reserves trying
to prop up the real, Brazil last week began to take a series of
steps to devalue it.
</P>
<P>
At the close of Wednesday's trading, the real stood at 1.90 to
one dollar, approaching the psychological barrier of two to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's hard currency reserves now stand at about 36 billion
dollars, including nine billion dollars in loans from the IMF.

<HEADLINE> China's Poverty Elimination Drive Paying Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Xihaigu Prefecture, which has
one of the eight poorest counties in China, improved the lives of
250,000 people living below the poverty line last year, and
people in this Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region now have adequate fo
od and clothing.
</P>
<P>
One local government official attributes this success to large
scale farmland improvements, pillar industries, and greater
cooperation between the eastern and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the arid prefecture allocated 200 million yuan for
80,000 water wells and improving 20,000 ha. of farmland. It has
also built four enterprise groups to process fruits, medicines,
flax, and beans and a starch plant with an annual output of
60,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
To improve medical services, the region has used 25.7 million
yuan, part of that from World Bank loans, to build medical
centers in 31 townships in four poor counties in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, people in 13 poverty-stricken counties in
Gansu Province were living better lives, with their numbers down
by 10 million over the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
In a similar development, Shandong Province in east China
helped a poor county last year by raising the annual per capita
income of farmers there to 2,240 yuan and the provincial
government earmarked 1.5 billion yuan over the past 15 years to
help poor areas with 400 projects. By the end of last year, the
annual per capita income of people in 24 counties in Shandong was
above 2,000 yuan.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military will
remain in Panama after the year 2000 to clean up their army
bases, a foreign ministry official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Delgado Diamante, the Panamanian foreign ministry
consultant, said that under the Torrijos-Carter treaties, the
U.S. military would gradually withdraw from the canal and
decrease their presence in Panama's law-enforcement forces for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Delgado, a retired army colonel, said that Panama would have
to reach an accord with Washington to allow U.S. military to
remain in the country after the end of 1999 to clean up
ammunitions from firing practice zones, mine-fields and areas
contaminated by chemical weapons experiments.
</P>
<P>
He said experts from other countries would not be needed to
help decontaminate military zones since they themselves were
trained in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Making Tourism Pillar Industry In Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Tourism is expected to become
the third largest pillar industry in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, after oil and cotton, according to Chi
Chongqing, who is in charge of the regional tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
Chi recently said that tourism had rapidly developed since the
reforms and opening up began 20 years ago and will play an
important role in the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Xinjiang had more than 200,000 tourists from
overseas and earned 80 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange.
In 1978, the region had only 88 overseas tourists and earned
about 46,000 U.S. dollars worth of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Its beautiful mountains and rivers and ethnic minorities have
attracted 1.85 million overseas tourists in the past two decades,
earning 550 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chi says that by 2010 the region plans to have 400,000
overseas tourists and earnings of 160 million U.S. dollars, as
well as 12 million Chinese tourists and earnings of 19.5 billion
yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 27 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Mediterranean fleet will
monitor traffic at the Adriatic Sea to help Italy check the flood
tide of illegal Albanian immigration reaching Italian shores, a
fleet commander said in the south Italian port Bari Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Admiral David Stone, the fleet commander, said his NATO fleet,
which was ordered to the lower Adriatic Sea a few days ago as the
Kosovo crisis worsened, will monitor traffic in the area and will
inform the Italian Coast Guard and police of the flow of illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
As the ships prepared to go to sea Thursday, Stone said, the
illegal immigration and refugees are a very serious problem which
will require a political solution.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in January over 2000 Albanian refugees
arrived in Italy across the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
The commander also affirmed that the speedboats, large rubber
dinghies fitted with high-powered outboard engines used by
traffickers, are "a problem of concern to the entire
international community."
</P>
<P>
He said his fleet will photograph and signal speedboats to the
Italian police.
</P>
<P>
The fleet consists of six frigates from Germany, the
Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Britain and Turkey, two destroyers
from Greece and America, and one British support vessel.
</P>
<P>
It is a permanent naval force of NATO on call for immediate
action with high-tech means to intervene in any emergencies.

<P>
NEW YORK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Stocks fell sharply on Wall
Street Wednesday after a big surging previously.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 124.35 at 9,200.23. The Index closed Tuesday at 9,324.58, up
121.26.
</P>
<P>
The Dow gained 61 points after the open of trading but
retreated later and never regained its footing.
</P>
<P>
The plunge was a result of the profit-taking by investors. They
sold stocks today after scoring big gains on a two-for-one stock
split announced separately by IMB, McDnald's and Xerox Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow was also hit by the lower Brazilian currency and the
announcement of moderate gains by a number of the U.S. companies.
Brazil's real opened sharply lower against the U.S. dollar and
dollars were leaving the country at a rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index also declined 26.27
to 2,407.14 at the close session. The composite closed at
2,433.41, up 64.10 on the previous day.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday
proposed that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan continue to play
his unique role in solving the issue of Iraq, according to a U.N.
diplomat
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said the proposal was made by Chinese Ambassador to

</P>
<P>
The diplomat said Qin also recommended that the panel on
disarmament issues be well represented.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the panel should be comprised of experts from the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), the International
Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) as well as disarmament experts from
Council members and other international disarmament institutions.
</P>
<P>
Qin said UNSCOM, in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, is not trusted by most Council members any
longer because it played a most inglorious part in the U.S.-led
military strikes against Iraq last month, and its latest report on
Iraq's disarmament should not be the basis for the panel to assess
the disarmament situation in Iraq, the diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
Qin proposed the U.N. Secretary-General submit a report on
Iraq's disarmament, thus forming the basis for the panel to assess
the disarmament situation in Iraq, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said Russia and other Council members welcomed
China's proposals.
</P>
<P>
During the Council consultations, Canada also submitted a
revised version of its proposal on Iraq. Canada says the panel on
disarmament issues would be comprised of UNSCOM commissioners,
experts from IAEA, as well as U.N. Under-Secretary-General for
Disarmament Affairs.

<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Wednesday rejected again an opposition demand to halt
guerrilla prisoner releases as a result of so-called punishment
beatings in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Blair told the parliament: "I accept this often has to be an

</P>
<P>
He said fewer acts of violence had been carried out in the
province last year than in previous years and no reason existed

</P>
<P>
Under the Northern Ireland peace agreement, all prisoners
involved in the conflict will be freed from jail within two years.
More than 200 have already gained early release.
</P>
<P>
Conservative leader William Hague insisted the government has
"not only the power but has the justification" for halting early
terrorist prisoner releases in the face of on-going violence.
</P>
<P>
But Blair disagreed, although he contradicted an earlier
statement by Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam who said she
lacked the legal power to stop prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said: "We can stop them altogether. That is
true. We should do so in circumstances where we then declare the
ceasefire no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
"If that were to be the case the consequences would be immense
for the whole of the process in Northern Ireland," he added.

ABU DHABI -- Britain has said no-fly zones over Iraq will
continue to be an important humanitarian measure as long as
Baghdad regime remains a "threat" to its people, a local paper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been challenging the no-fly zones, but British
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchett said that
without the no-fly zones, thousands of people in northern and
southern Iraq will have less security and will have to endure more
suffering under Saddam Hussain.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, who arrived in the U.A.E. from Egypt, said his visit
is part of a broader British diplomatic effort in the region that
will include a visit shortly by British Defense Secretary George
Robertson. (BC-UAE-Britain)

Earlier, Albright visited Russia to mend rifts between the
U.S. and Russia over their difference about the Iraqi
crisis. Russia objected to recent U.S.-led air strikes on Iraq.

ANKARA -- Seventeen U.S. warplanes Wednesday took off again
from Incirlik Air Base in Adana in southern Turkey to patrol the
no-fly zone in northern Iraq Wednesday, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.

<P>
The agency said six tankers, four transport planes and one
AWACS plane also took off from the base at hours between 11:00 and
12:00 a.m. (0900 and 1000 GMT).

After the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, the U.S. and its allies set up two no-fly zones in
southern and northern Iraq with a claimed aim of shielding the
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's

The Iraqi News Agency quoted an Information Ministry spokesman

<HEADLINE> Canada's Employment Growth High Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Almost 450,000 jobs were created
in 1998, the best year for employment growth so far this decade in
Canada, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The big jump came in jobs for young people aged 15 to 24, which
shot up seven per cent after years of decline. There were 3.2 per
cent more jobs overall last year than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the start of last year, 64.9 per cent of people between 20
and 24 had jobs. That percentage rose to 68.4 per cent by the end
of the year, said the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
Growth in part-time jobs outpaced that of full-time jobs, 5.3
per cent to 2.7 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Last month, just over 11.8 million people were working
full-time, an increase of eight per cent since the start of the
decade. There were about 2.7 million part-timers, an increase of
24.4 per cent in the decade.
</P>
<P>
After almost two decades of steady decline, the number of
people 55 and older in the work force increased last year. There
were just under 1.5 million older workers, up 73,000 or 5.2 per
cent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Self-employment rose 4.8 per cent last year. Since the start of
the decade, the number of self-employed workers has risen 42.5 per
cent, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate to Ask Three Witnesses in Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate decided
Wednesday to take closed-door depositions from three witnesses in
President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
The Senate will issue subpoenas compelling former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal to appear at depositions and be
questioned by House prosecutors and White House defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Senate voted 56-44 to approve the subpoenas for
witnesses, an issue that had bitterly divided the Senate since
Democrats rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Once the depositions are completed, the Senate must vote again
on whether to call each of the witnesses to give live testimony in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The ground rules and procedures for the depositions are
undecided, with Republican and Democratic leaders expected to
begin immediate negotiations on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the vote on witnesses, the Senate had refused to
dismiss the impeachment case against Clinton, voting mostly along
party lines.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 56-44 to reject a motion by Democratic Senator
Robert Byrd that would have dismissed the impeachment case against
the nation's 42nd president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
He is the first president in U.S. to be subjected to a trial
since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one vote in
1868. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to convict
Clinton and remove him from office, which most still consider to
be unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Conflicts Holding Back W. African Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings said Wednesday that conflicts in west Africa are holding
back the economic and political stability of the sub-region, the
Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said the latest conflict, that in Sierra Leone, is
devastating and the worse part is that the west African countries
are not unanimous in their efforts to resolve it. The president
said this when he received visiting Canadian Foreign Affairs
Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, at the Castle, Osu.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy arrived in Accra, Ghana's capital, from Nigeria
Wednesday for a two-day visit to Ghana.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings said in resolving the conflict in Sierra
Leone following a rebel attack on capital Freetown on January 6,
few countries have made the necessary sacrifices with a majority
of the countries in the sub-region staying out.
</P>
<P>
''We do not have a synchronized approach to resolving the
conflict,'' he said, alluding to the fact that only Nigeria,
Guinea and Ghana have troops on the ground out of 16 countries in
the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings said some assistance has been received from
the international community and that help is appreciated.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the gratitude of his government and people of
Ghana for Canadian assistance, saying that this assistance had
been poured in during the country's most trying times.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said during his stay issues he would discuss with
government officials include protection of civilians during
conflicts as well as the spread of small arms.

LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the six
nation Contact Group on former Yugoslavia are expected to meet
again in London on Friday, a British foreign ministry spokesman
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to issue a summons to both sides in the
conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo, urging them to go back
to the table of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, comprising Britain, the United States,
France, Russia, Germany and Italy, held talks last Friday in
London but failed to reach any agreement to resolve the conflict
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.S. plan, Belgrade and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians will
be pushed into a political settlement through intense talks backed
by a NATO threat of strikes against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The United States Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, will
attend the meeting in London on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Albright is now on a visit to Saudi Arabia, seeking support

<P>
PARIS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine sent a letter to his Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan on
Wednesday to mark the 35th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations between France and China.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said in the letter that on the eve of the 21th century,
France and China have established a comprehensive partnership
which is aimed at working together to build a more secure and just
world order.
</P>
<P>
``One the eve of the Third Millennium, the chiefs of state of
France and China have decided to establish a partnership which
will allow our two countries to work together for the construction
of a more secure and just world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and French President Jacques
Chirac signed an agreement in May 1997 in Beijing on the building
of a comprehensive partnership between China and France.
</P>
<P>
``We have intensified our cooperation during the past several
years through increased political consultation on the most

</P>
<P>
He said that French-Chinese relations were expanded during the
visit to France by Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and the visit
to China by French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin last year.
</P>
<P>
France and China have begun lately cooperation in the fields of
international financial affairs and new information technology, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Expects Revenue to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Government revenue is expected
to exceed current expenditure by about 4,420 billion Cedis (one
U.S. Dollar equals 2, 335 Cedis) during the Medium-term
development Plan period (1997-2000), the Ghana News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's Vision 2020 document released in
Accra Tuesday, the estimated development expenditure amounting to
4,625 billion Cedis will result in an overall budget deficit of
205 billion Cedis during the period while the current account will
be in surplus in each year during the Plan period.
</P>
<P>
"Although this deficit (in nominal terms) is about five times
the deficit during the period 1991-95, the ratio of overall budget
deficit to gross national product (GNP) is expected to decline
from 1.6 percent in 1991 to 0.7 in 2000."
</P>
<P>
The document said the deficit will be financed by domestic and
external borrowing.
</P>
<P>
"However, the mobilization of resources to finance the deficit
will be pursued in ways which will not create inflationary
pressures on the economy or crowd out private sector credit
needs," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The document said the revenue of the central government is
expected to rise by 22 percent to 4,870 billion Cedis next year.
</P>
<P>
Direct taxes are expected to account for 4.5 percent, about the
same percentage as non-tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from direct taxes is expected to grow by 28 percent per
annum following the growth of incomes and improvement in the tax
collection machinery.
</P>
<P>
The document said despite the proposed review of taxes, which
inhibit growth and the commitment of Ghana under the World Trade
Organization on taxes on foreign trade, indirect tax is projected
to grow by 29 percent per annum with the re-introduction of the
value-added tax (VAT).
</P>
<P>
This will make indirect tax 14.6 percent of the GNP or 63
percent of total revenue receipts in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"This optimistic rate of growth is premised on anticipated
increases in the volume of domestic and foreign trade and
accelerated growth of domestic production," said the document.
</P>
<P>
It said that the central government's current expenditure is
estimated at 13,087 billion Cedis over the period 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
"Although this nominal amount will be nearly four times the
amount spent during the 1991-95 period, current expenditure is
expected to grow at 21.7 percent per annum during the Medium-Term
Development Plan period, compared with 45 percent per annum during
the period 1991-95.
</P>
<P>
The document said the wage and salary bill will account for
about 50 percent of total current expenditure, while other major
commitments include debt-service payments, purchase of supplies
and transfers to public boards, corporations and local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In terms of sectoral allocation, social services are estimated
to absorb the largest amount of the total current expenditure
reflecting government's commitment to the provision of increased
availability and improved quality of social services, especially
in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
It said efforts will be directed to increase productivity and
efficiency in the public service as an essential means to contain
the future growth of current expenditure.

<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Zhongguancun, which
has been called China's "silicon valley", is increasingly
attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the Asian Financial Crisis, more than 30
multinationals increased their investment in the area last year,
and some have opened product development centers. The area's
intellectual and technological advantages appeal to foreign
investors and many firms from overseas plan to settle there for
long-term growth, according to a marketing manager at Hewlett
Packard.
</P>
<P>
Zhongguancun is currently home to about 1,100 of the world's
top computer companies like IBM, Microsoft, Compaq, Hewlett
Packard, and Mitsubishi.
</P>

Last year, more than 100 foreign companies settled in the

<HEADLINE> Boom In Home Appliance Sales in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Sales of electric appliances
increased by 21 percent in China last year, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
</P>
<P>
In a survey carried out in 600 large and medium-sized home
appliances shops by the Zhongyikang Consultancy Corporation, an
affiliate of the NBS, it was revealed that sales of color TV sets
had increased by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the home appliance industry was actually affected by
feeble demand in the domestic market and sagging exports which
made competition much fiercer.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers and retailers of big brand-name products tried
every way to maintain their market share. But those with poor
marketing and shortage of funds to support their sales drives
failed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties the sales of air conditioners
rocketed up by 47 percent while that of washing machines 14
percent and refrigerators three percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey highlighted that the biggest selling brands of
color TV sets are made by Changhong, while Hai'er captured large
chunks of the refrigerator, air conditioner and washing machine
markets.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1997, imported brands have taken more market
share of hi-fi stereo component systems, washing machines and
refrigerators, while domestic brands have scored larger sales of
micro-wave ovens and VCD players.
</P>
<P>
With the market being a buyer's market, the price of most of
appliances went down and the sales channels were more diversified
in 1998, according to the survey.

<HEADLINE> 223 S. African Cops Murdered in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Two hundred and
twenty-three South African police officers were killed last year,
according to a research by the South African Police Service
(SAPS).
</P>
<P>
The research found that a third of all deaths over a
three-year period occurred during responses to hijackings,
burglaries and robberies. Most happened when members were robbed
of service pistols, the Star newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that South African policemen are three times
more likely to be murdered than the population in general and nine
times more likely than a U.S. law enforcement officer, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The murder rate is more alarming when compared with those in
England and Wales. Only one officer was killed there in 1995 and
no police were killed in 1996. There are five police murders a
year in New Zealand and Australia on average.
</P>
<P>
Of last year's 223 deaths, 85 policemen were on duty and 138
were off duty, the police research found.
</P>
<P>
Antoinette Louw, a researcher from the Institute for Security
Studies, said on-duty fatalities mostly took place during routine
police actions.
</P>
<P>
"Unsurprisingly, given that policemen are armed and guns are
prolific in the country, 86 percent of murdered policemen died in
shootings," he said. The ways in which the gunshots were fired
suggested attacks on police were intended to kill, he said.
</P>
<P>
A SAPS official said they had initiated several programs to try
to improve the situation, including special training to police on
safer ways to carry out their duties.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Wishes to Withdraw Troops in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian leader General
Abdulsalami Abubakar has expressed his government's wish that
peace would be soon restored in Sierra Leone so that Nigeria could
withdraw its troops before May 29, when the military government
will hand over to an elected civilian government.
</P>
<P>
He said this Wednesday while meeting with visiting Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy in Abuja, according to media
reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which contributed most of the 15,000-strong west
African peace keeping force ECOMOG now fighting rebels in Sierra
Leone, has been under increasing domestic pressure to withdraw its
troops as the date for the military hand-over approaches.
</P>
<P>
According to Sierra Leonean Finance Minister James Jonah,
Nigeria's has spent 568.5 million U.S. Dollars on ECOMOG
operations in Sierra Leone, since the sub-regional force
intervened shortly after the May 1997 coup that temporarily
toppled elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The estimated daily expenditure of one million Dollars has
become an increasingly heavy burden for Nigeria, which is facing a
serious financial strain due to the slump in the international oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
In preparing for the withdrawal of Nigerian troops, the Sierra
Leonean government has recently announced a plan to set up its own
defense force, for which the British government has pledged to
provide some equipment.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Approves Additional Funds to Fix Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said the additional funds which brought total allocation to
fix the bug to 200 million ringgit (52 million U.S. dollars), were
approved by the cabinet a few weeks ago and negotiations were
being held with the World Bank for more funds.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank team was here two days ago to talk to people
involved in the Y2K. Some figures have been discussed but nothing
has been formalized yet," he told reporters after launching "Easy
Reach", Malaysia's first e-mail paging for network personal
computers, here.
</P>
<P>
He also said negotiations were underway between the bank and
government for a 100 million U.S. dollars loan to address the
problem in high-risk areas such as power generation,
communications, finance and transportation like ports, airports
and railways.
</P>
<P>
Moggie said details of the World Bank funding had not been
finalized yet but it could be in the form of a loan or grant.
</P>
<P>
He said the government initially allocated 30 million ringgit
(about 8 million U.S. dollars) for government agencies to fix the
problem and during the last budget increased it by another 100
million ringgit (26.3 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Iran Lifts Restrictions on Disgraced Leader's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities have
decided to lift restrictions on Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri,
the disgraced designate successor of the late Iranian supreme
leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian daily Tehran Times reported on Thursday that an
informed source revealed the decision to it, but did not give
details of and the reasons for the decision.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the lifting have become a must as
Montazeri's supporters became more active in the country,
particularly in Najafabad, Montazeri's hometown in the central
Isfahan province.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Council of National Security decided to impose
restrictions on Montazeri in November, 1997 after he openly
defended Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami and criticized
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for his intervention in the
administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to his students in the holy city Qom, Montazeri
urged Khamenei to give a free hand to President Khatami to
administer the country since he was elected by more than 20
million voters out of 30 million.
</P>
<P>
Montazeri, a prominent Islamic canonist with huge followers in
Iran, was appointed by Khomeini as his designate successor in
1983, but was dismissed by Khomeini himself before his demise in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said that Montazeri was sacked for his
political differences with Khomeini. But Tehran Times said his
sacking resulting from his link with a terrorist group headed by
Mehdi Hashemi, brother of his son-in-law Hadi Hashemi.
</P>
<P>
Mehdi Hashemi established a foothold in Montazeri's office
through his brother Hadi Hashemi, who was head of Montazeri's
office, the daily said. He was arrested and executed in 1986 on
the charge of plotting against the Islamic system and killing his
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, some Iranian officials blamed supporters of
Mehdi Hashemi, labeled as "Mehdi Hashemi Band" by Iranian
authorities, for being behind several killings and bomb attacks
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says 24 Civilians Killed in Latest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four Iraqi civilians
were killed and nearly 100 others were wounded in the latest
U.S.-British bombardment on residential quarters in and around the
southern city of Basra, an Iraqi newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen civilians were killed and 59 others injured while
seven houses were completely destroyed and another 27 severely
damaged when the United States launched missile attacks on
al-Jamhuriya district of Basra Monday morning, said Al-Zawraa
weekly.
</P>
<P>
Six civilians were killed and tens of others were injured when
U.S. and British warplanes bombed residential quarters of Abu
Flous district on the same morning, the report said. Most of the
victims are women, children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes also bombarded Basra airport and
the northern Rumaila field, according to the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since the mid-December U.S.-British air
strikes against Iraq, allegelly to punish Iraq for non-cooperation
with U.N. international arms inspectors, that Iraqi residential
areas were attacked by missiles and bombs.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December bombardment, Iraqi air-defense forces
and U.S.-British jets patrolling the no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq have exchanged fires on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
Basra, some 550 kilometers south of Baghdad, is located in the
southern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed two no-fly zones in Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
suppression.

<HEADLINE> HK New Airport Praised by Travel Agents and Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reiterating Mr. Dale's comments, Ms Catherine Yeoh, director of
Reliance DWC (Canada) Inc, added "there is no doubt that Hong Kong
International Airport can be rated as one of the world's top
airports."
</P>
<P>
These praises were echoed by accolades from several members of
the international media visiting Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lee Woo-chul, executive vice-president and senior editor
of the Travel Trade Journal (TTJ), one of the leading travel trade
publications in Korea, was delighted with his experience at HKIA.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lee, who had also visited the airport before its opening,
said, "When I saw the new Hong Kong airport before it opened, I
had very high expectations of how spectacular a building it was
going to be, and I'm happy to say that my experiences on this trip
have more than confirmed those expectations."
</P>
<P>
Mr. Nik Walshe and Ms Jo Parkerson, news editor and presenter,
respectively, for the UK's Chrysalis Radio, were also in Hong Kong
recently. "It took us less than one hour between getting off the
plane and settling down in our hotel room. Immigration and customs
officers were very friendly, and the transportation service was
most efficient," they said.
</P>
<P>
These comments have been confirmed by an award won by the
airport earlier this month, as the media worldwide recognized the
HKIA's achievements and voted it the best airport in Asia Pacific
in the Journalists' Choice Awards.
</P>
<P>
The HKIA has also received a major international award from
the US-based Travel &AMP; Leisure magazine, in which it was voted
"Best Airport".
</P>
<P>
In addition, several recent surveys show that passengers' and
other users' levels of satisfaction with the airport's services
and facilities have risen substantially over the past six moths or
so.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Authority survey revealed that 92.6 percent of
users are satisfied with the services and facilities, with more
than one in three respondents giving them top marks.
</P>
<P>
In terms of security, the HKIA received high praise from the
U.S. Government's aviation safety regulatory body, the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), which commented that the overall
security at the HKIA is "excellent."
</P>
<P>
The FAA also said that security arrangements and practices
exceed guidelines set by the United Nations' International Civil
Aviation Organization.
</P>
<P>
The HKIA is confident that it will be a beacon for the ongoing
recovery of Hong Kong's tourism industry, said the HKTA survey
report.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reopens Embassy in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada has reopened its high
commission in Nigeria, which marks the restoration of full
diplomatic ties after three years of strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy Wednesday
presided the flag-hoisting ceremony held at Canada's new high
commission in Nigerian capital Abuja, press here reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries got sour in late 1995, when
Canada and other West countries slammed sanctions on Nigeria,
following the execution of minority activist and author Ken
Saro-Wiwa on murder charges by the then government of late General
Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Canada closed its high commission in Nigeria's old capital
Lagos in March 1997, when Nigeria said it could no longer
guarantee the protection of Canadian diplomats, who had helped
political dissidents flee the country.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports Thursday, Axworthy, while meeting
with Nigerian leader Abdulsalami Abubakar, commended the general's
efforts to restore democracy in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He advocated efforts to improve bilateral trade, especially in
the oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy also praised Nigeria's contribution to the restoration
of democracy and peace in Sierra Leone and announced a donation of
one million Canadian dollars (660,000 U.S. Dollars) to the
Nigerian-led sub-regional intervention force ECOMOG, besides an
undecided amount of humanitarian aid to Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parties Told to Forget Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC) has taken a firm stand on the proposed
alliance between two minor political parties, with an advise for
them to dump the idea for other options.
</P>
<P>
INEC Chairman Ephraim Akpata said Wednesday that the Alliance
for Democracy (AD) and the All People's Party (APP) should
consider their alliance unworkable and instead consider other
possible areas of electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in the capital Abuja while receiving
visiting Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, media here
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The electoral body's tough position came after the two parties
threatened they will withdraw from the transition program should
their alliance is refused by the INEC.
</P>
<P>
Akapata had last week written to the national chairmen of the
two parties that "the electoral law does not envisage a situation
where a candidate in an electoral is backed by two separate logos
belonging to two separate parties."
</P>
<P>
The letter dated January 21 is a reply to an earlier demand of
the two parties to use a common logo on the ballots in the
February 20 legislative elections and the February 27 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to Akpata, what the two parties want is actually a
merger, to which, he said, "they cannot eat their cake and have
it."
</P>
<P>
He further said "what they are proposing is a novel electoral
process which has never been practised in any true democracy
anywhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
The INEC chairman suggests the parties to consider other
options, saying that "they have a number of options open to them.
It is for them to decide which way to go. We on our part have an
open mind."
</P>
<P>
One of such options, observers said, is for the AD and APP to
run as a single party, whereby their members will vote for either
AD or APP.
</P>
<P>
The proposed alliance also received strong opposition from the
third and strongest party, the People's Democratic Party, which
has described the alliance as illegal and an attempt to win
elections by unholy means.

<HEADLINE> China to Build National Time Service Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Sciences plans to turn the Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory into
a national time service center, which will provide national time
scales across China.
</P>
<P>
 After its establishment, the National Time Service Center
(NTSC) will develop a united national time scale system, said
Yang Tinggao, vice-president of the observatory.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the NTSC will abandon its research projects in
other astronomical fields, and instead will focus on the scienti
fic projects which concern the improvement of the accuracy of
time scale.
</P>
<P>
The observatory is now cooperating with other domestic
research institutes to develop the Cesium Fountain, the world's
most advanced type of nuclear clock, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another important project in time scale research is the
observation of the millisecond pulsar, a kind of star, which has
a very short but steady rotation period, and can help scientists
provide high-accuracy time scales.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory has been providing the
time service across the country since it was founded in Pucheng
County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province in 1966, as well as
being involved in other astronomical research projects.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the NTSC will also help build up a national
satellite time service system along with other Chinese scientific
organizations. It is now experimenting with providing time scales
through telephones, television and computer networks.

LAGOS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Nigeria will open talks on development cooperation Thursday in
Nigerian capital Abuja, four years after such cooperation was
suspended because of Nigeria's alledged poor human rights records.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said Thursday that a two-man EU delegation led by
the Director of West and Central Africa, Hans Smida, are already
in Abuja for the talks.
</P>
<P>
They will meet with officials of the Independent National
Electoral Commission, the National Human Rights Commission, and
the ministries of national planing, foreign affairs and finance,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
EU slammed sanctions on Nigeria after the annulment of June
1993 election by the military government, which was further
strengthened after the execution of minority activist Ken
Saro-Wiwa by the government on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations began to improve in 1998, after Nigeria
embarked on a series of democratic reforms under the new
leadership of General Abdulsalami Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Information Unit of EU said in Abuja
Wednesday that bilateral cooperation will be restricted to the
support for human rights, the democratic process and poverty
alleviation for now, while the full restoration of ties would have
to wait until the inauguration of the elected civilian government
on May 29.
</P>
<P>
It, however, said EU's new position on Nigeria has "made it
possible to resume dialog on development cooperation, including
relevant studies and preparatory measures, with a view to the
re-engagement of full cooperation after the installation of a
democratically-elected civilian government."

declining exports of building materials resulting from the
financial crisis in Southeast Asia by concentrating on exports of
plate glass rather than cement this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Lei Qianzhi, deputy-director of China's State
Administration of Building Materials Industry, the financial
crisis has seriously affected the country's exports of building
materials, and concrete in particular.
</P>
<P>
However, China's exports of plate glass jumped dramatically
last year.
</P>
<P>
Lei urged building materials departments and enterprises in
various localities to explore international markets and pay
closer attention to quality control in order to expand their
market shares.
</P>
<P>
He called on the building materials enterprises to extend
great efforts to protect their markets in Southeast Asia, and at
the same time expand their presence in both the Middle East and
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Australian People Need More Fruits and Vegetables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian diet is getting
better but people still need much more fruits and vegetables, a
major national survey has found.
</P>
<P>
And Australians born in East Asia led the way as healthy
eaters, winning an A-plus rating from nutritionists.
</P>
<P>
The National Nutrition Survey awarded Australians a B rating
for their diet after surveying 14,000 people between February 1995
and March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and the Department of Health and Aged Care (DHAC).
</P>
<P>
"Not too bad, but certainly room for improvement before we can
claim to be a nation of healthy eaters," federal Health Minister
Michael Wooldridge said while speaking at the survey launch in
Melbourne Thursday, Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
He predicted Australians could improve their diet sufficiently
to win an A rating in about a decade.
</P>
<P>
Wooldridge said Australians born in East Asia probably had the
healthiest diet in the country, because of their "excellent daily
intake of cereal and cereal products (rice)".
</P>
<P>
The survey found that Australians' favorite foods are:
potatoes, bread, dairy milk, breakfast cereals, apples, carrots,
cabbage, meat, beer, sweet biscuits and fatty fast foods.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, DHAC nutritionists found Australians must
double their intake of fruit and almost double their intake of
vegetables, as well as eating more bread, milk and fish.
</P>
<P>
A problem area was the excessive consumption of foods like
sweet biscuits, pastries and pizzas, especially in South Australia
and Victoria, where that category scored C minus.
</P>
<P>
Nutritionists said these foods had hidden fats and should be
eaten only as a treat, not as a regular dietary item.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 42 percent of men and 24 percent of women
consumed alcoholic drinks, many of the men reported drinking three
standard drinks a day.

The inaugural fair will take place between October 5 and 10 in
Shenzhen, which will be the permanent location of the fair.
</P>
<P>
It will be China's third kind of international trade fair,
following in the footsteps of the China Export Commodities Fair
in Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong Province, and
the China Fair for International Investment and Trade in Xiamen
of coastal Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The fair will offer a place to exchange scientific and
technological achievements, to exhibit hi-tech and new
technological products, to contract the importing of technology
and cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang stressed that entrepreneurs, scientists and investors
from China's mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and across the
world will be invited to participate in the fair.
</P>
<P>
It will span such sectors as electronic information, biology
and medicine, new materials, optical-electro-mechanical
integration, energy-saving and environmental protection as well
as other technologies ready for application.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that despite its short history, China's technology
trade has got off to a quick start, and made remarkable progress
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
China signed 8,754 technology import and export contracts in
1998, with a total value of 23.062 billion US dollars. The number
of import contracts reached 6,254, involving 16.375 billion US
dollars, while export contracts added up to 2,500, involving
6.687 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Li Zibing, mayor of Shenzhen, commented at the press
conference that preparation of the fair is in full swing. The
54,000-square-meter exhibition hall is under construction, and

<HEADLINE> Ke Kim Yan Sworn in as Cambodian Royal Army Commander-in-Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 28 (Xinhua) -- An official ceremony for
General Ke Kim Yan to be sworn in as commander-in-chief of the
Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) was held Thursday at the
Ministry of National Defense.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen made an important speech at the ceremony
transferring the post of commander-in-chief of the RCAF to four
gold star Gen. Ke Kim Yan.
</P>
<P>
He said his withdrawal from the post marks a step in political
reform in the Kingdom of Cambodia and let the military maintain
its neutrality.
</P>
<P>
"My leaving is to focus my time and energy on social and
economic development that is the top priority to fight against
poverty," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
"It is a time to withdraw from being a commander-in-chief to
fight against the return of the Pol Pot regime and to find peace
for Cambodia, but to become a commander-in-chief to lead a fight
against poverty in accordance with the direction of the
economic-oriented government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also urged the armed forces to successfully
implementing military and police reform within the next five
years. "The armed forces must be reduced by 55,000 and the police
by 24,000," he stressed. He noted it would greatly benefit the
country.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the armed forces, government institutions
and foreign embassies in Cambodia attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk signed a royal decree on January 24,
1999, after his return from medical treatment in Beijing,
approving the nomination of Gen. Ke Kim Yan to replace Prime
Minister Hun Sen who has announced his resignation as
commander-in-chief of the National Armed Forces of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Four deputy commanders-in-chief and three commanders of the
Army, Navy and Air Force were also be formally sworn in during the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Under the royal decree, Gen. Pal Saraenn and Gen. Meas Sophea,

commanders-in-chief with Gen. Meas Sophea also being the army
commander.
</P>
<P>
Other deputy commanders-in-chief were Gen. Khan Savoeun and
Gen. Khem Sophan, while Lt Gen. Ung Samkhan was appointed Navy

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Situation Approaching Limit, U.N. Chief Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, on a visit to NATO, warned Thursday
that the worsening situation in the troubled Yugoslav province of
Kosovo is approaching the limit.
</P>
<P>
"The bloody wars of the last decade have left us with no
illusions about the difficulty of halting internal conflicts --
by reason or by force -- particularly against the wishes of the
government of a sovereign state," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"But nor have they left us with any illusions about the need
to use force, when all other means have failed. We may be
reaching that limit, once again, in former Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a U.N. chief to visit NATO at the
time when it is to issue a fresh warning against the conflicting p
arties in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that horror is no longer threatening but is present
for hundreds of thousands in Kosovo whose life has been disrupted
violently.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged the conflicting parties in Kosovo to fully and
unconditionally accept the peaceful negotiation as the only way
to resolve the crisis there and respect the authority of the
United Nations War Crimes Tribunal throughout the territory of
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to visit the European Union later in the day.
The U.N. chief warned that all parties involved in the Kosovo
crisis have to recall the lessons of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
That means, stressed Annan, "full and unconditional respect
for the human rights of all citizens in Kosovo" and "providing
the people of Kosovo with the degree of autonomy that is
consistent with their need to live lives free from terror and
violence."
</P>
<P>
He said: "What form such autonomy will take will depend not
only on the wishes of the Kosovo people but also on the actions
of the Yugoslav authorities."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that both the Belgrade authorities and the Kosovo
separatists have learned the lessons.
</P>
<P>
"We must seek and find new ways to prevent instability from
any source, even as we advance reconciliation in post-conflict
societies to prevent the all-too-frequent relapses into war and
violence," added Annan.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether his speech indicated that the U.N. would
authorize the use of threat of force in Kosovo, Annan said that
the use of threat is essential and it is already there though it
still needs discussion whether it becomes necessary to use force.
</P>
<P>
"I am pushing very hard for a political settlement and we are
pushing for an agreement on the autonomy discussions," said
Annan.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Textile Export (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China, the world's largest
textile supplier, is digging its heels in deeper to win more of
the American and European markets under the pressure of a
shrinking Asian market.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Administration of Textile Industry
said that China gained more market share in North America, Europe
and Japan than what it lost in Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China increased total textile export volume by nearly
three percent over 1997 despite a six percent drop in exports
revenue due to lower international prices.
</P>
<P>
In the year, export volume to Europe, the United States and
Japan increased by 10.75 percent, 7.62 percent and 2.82 percent
respectively over the previous year. Export revenue to these
regions also increased by 501 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the market share of Chinese textile products in
Hong Kong and Macao regions, the Republic of Korea and Southeast
Asia dropped by six percentage points to 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fan Min, director of the Trade and Market Management Division
of the State Administration of Textile Industry, said that the
Southeast Asia financial crisis and slow down of the world's
economy generally are a mix of blessings and strife for China's
textile exports.
</P>
<P>
China exported 42.9 billion U.S. dollars of textile products
last year, accounting for one-fourth of the world market.
However, it has been diversifying its overseas market and
upgrading products in the face of fierce competition from other
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Macao regions, the Republic of Korea and
Southeast Asia, which make up the largest market for Chinese
textiles, have seen their importance decrease in relation to
China's exports. Hong Kong and Macao regions made up 33 percent
of the country's total textile exports last year, decreasing from
38 percent in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> China Looking For Scientific Way To Deal With Natural Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are looking
for scientific ways to fight floods, droughts, earthquakes, fires
and the other natural disasters that have caused serious losses
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Disaster prevention has become a major government and science
task to use the most advanced technology to help control natural
disasters, according to Li Zhensheng, of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, who was at a disaster control symposium held by the
China Association for Science and Technology, along with more
than 100 other scientists here today.
</P>
<P>
Droughts cause about 200 billion yuan (24 billion U.S.
dollars) in losses annually. Last year's floods did more than 200
billion yuan worth of damage. Scientists think that China should
make a new comprehensive plan for sustained development on its
longer rivers and large lakes and improve flood prevention and
water conservation laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
They also think that China should establish a comprehensive
legal and supervisory system to help control geological disasters
by 2010 and to decrease losses by 50 percent and the number of
casualties by 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Claims 31 in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 31 people were
killed and more than 40 others wounded during armed confrontations
Wednesday between the clansmen of Eli-Omar and Abdalle-Aroneh at
Gabaho Village, some 70 km northeast of capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said more than 15 battle wagons and 300
heavily armed men were involved in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Both clansmen have been re-organizing for this latest round of
fighting for several days following the deadlock of peace talks
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The animosity between the two sides escalated after 12 men,
nine from one side and three from the other, were kidnapped by
gunmen from the opposing side in Mogadishu and in the countryside
a few days ago. However, with the help of several prestigious and
religious men all kidnapped men were released under what's called
an 'unconditional release'.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
Another serious confrontation also took place at Arro-Madowlth
village, some 110 km northeast of Mogadishu, between the same
clans. There are no exact casualty figures at this stages.
However, sources from the area said at least nine gunmen have been
killed and a fuel tanker was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The two clans live on the coastal line of northeastern
Mogadishu where they shared large pastoral and coastal lines for
fishing and grazing their herds for centuries. There has been no
historical animosity between the two sides. The hatred can be
attributed to the arms which all young men have in their hands and
use them freely. The free weapon movement in the past eight years
in Somalia has made neighbors to fight each other for one reason
or another.

At the same time, Chinese textile exports to North America and
Europe increased from 19.3 percent in 1997 to 21.7 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, exports of high value-added textile
products were on the rise while exports of raw materials decreas

</P>
<P>
The export volume of garments increased by 5.19 percent last

ned cotton mills by reducing their production capacity. However,
Fan said that this move won't have an immediate impact on exports
because raw materials such as cotton yarn only accounts for 30
percent of total exports.
</P>
<P>
Fan said that China is gradually losing its competitiveness in
raw materials due to decreasing labor costs and improving product
quality in Southeast Asian countries. It has become a net
importer of cotton yarn from a net exporter of the product.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's textile exports to Southeast Asia will
continue to drop this year. However, he noted that the adoption
of an integrated European currency (Euro) will lower costs of
Chinese textile products to the European market.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China Unicom, the country's
second largest telecommunications company, announced here today
that it will invest a total of three billion yuan to expand the
third phase of its GSM network in southern Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The main equipment for the expansion project will be supplied
by Motorola and Siemens. The Chinese company and Motorola signed
an agreement here today.
</P>
<P>
The third phase of expansion includes building and renovating
16 switching centers and building 676 new base stations. The
second phase of expansion was completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of China Unicom's GSM network in Guangdong, a
showcase of China's market economy reforms, will increase by
760,000 lines to 1.16 million lines by the end of this year,
according to a company official.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Textile Export (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC) will allocate 20 percent of the textile import quotas
that China get from the U.S. and the European Union (EU) directly
to textile companies this year. The value of this slice of quotas
is estimated at 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fan said that in the years before 1997, textile companies
seldom obtained U.S. and European quotas from MOFTEC. They had to
buy quotas from trading companies, thus increasing operation
costs by ten billion U.S. dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the open bidding system for quota allocations
puts all companies on an equal footing. State-owned enterprises
account for 70 percent of the shrinking fabric sector and less
than ten percent of the growing garment sector. Therefore,
competitive non-state-owned companies will have a much bigger
access to overseas market.
</P>
<P>
China is also to increase the tax rebate rate for textile
exports to 13 percent from the current 11 percent. This is
expected to add 400 million yuan (47 million U.S. dollars) to the
export revenue of the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
Du Yuzhou, director of the State Administration of Textile
Industry, told a national conference, which ended here today,
that China will strive to secure a modest increase in textile
exports this year.

<HEADLINE> HK's Export Drops by over 7 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
re-exports, domestic exports and imports all declined further in
December 1998 on a year-on-year basis and the aggregate export
volume for 1998 dropped by over 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the external trade figures for last December
released Thursday by the Census and Statistics Department, the
value of total exports (comprising re-exports and domestic
exports) fell by 13.6 percent over a year earlier to 107.5
billion HK dollars (13.8 billion U.S. dollars) in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Within this total, the value of re-exports was down by 12.7
percent to 92.3 billion HK dollars (11.8 billion U.S. dollars),
and that of domestic exports by 18.8 percent to 15.2 billion HK
dollars (1.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the value of imports also fell by 17.1 percent
to 114.3 billion HK dollars (14.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
For 1998 as a whole, the value of total exports fell by 7.4
percent. Within this total, the value of re-exports decreased by
6.9 percent, and that of domestic exports by 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports fell even more, by 11.5 percent. As a
result, a visible trade deficit of 81.4 billion HK dollars (10.4
billion U.S. dollars), equivalent to 5.7 percent of the value of
imports, was recorded.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that export
performance continued to be weak in December 1998, as exports to
Asia were severely hit by the sluggish import demand there.
</P>
<P>
The situation was aggravated by the fall-off in exports to the
United States and China's mainland, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Yet also magnifying the decline was a relatively high base of
comparison in December 1997, when export performance at that time
was still fairly robust, explained the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit of 1998, however, was much smaller than the
deficit of 159.1 billion HK dollars (20.4 billion U.S. dollars),
or an equivalent to 9.9 percent of the value of imports, recorded
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that the narrowed visible trade
deficit in 1998 was mainly due to the markedly reduced intake of
goods retained for local use, amid the adjustment process in the
local economy.

MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Local officials are still
negotiating the release of some 70 teachers and 500 students, who
were taken hostage Thursday at a public school in Mindanao, the
southern Philippines, reportedly by about 1,000 Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
Initial contacts with the hostage-takers through a two-way
radio by local officials and emissaries show that the hostages
were safe, according to a Philippine News Agency report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the local officials are expected to strike a
deal with the rebels Thursday night for the release of the
hostages, especially the children.
</P>
<P>
Government forces are remaining stand-by and monitoring the
development of the negotiation, it said.
</P>

Government soldiers were positioned within range from the
school in Barangay Kapinpilan, Midsayap, Cotabato, but could not
move closer fearing the hostages might be hurt, Rex Turino, a city
information officer, said over the radio.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the government forces and the MILF has
temporarily ceased because of the incident, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Cape Town may bid for the
2012 Olympics after its failed bid to host the 2004 Summer Games
a year ago, a South African Olympics bid official has indicated.
</P>
<P>
Chris Ball, the organizer of Cape Town's failed bid for the
2004 Olympics, said Wednesday that the city was probably not
ready to bid for the 2008 Summer Games but could try four years
later, South African newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely think we should bid for the 2012 Games. I think
that we would have a good chance," said Ball, chief executive of
Cape Town's bid.
</P>
<P>
Ball said the city was not ready to compete for the 2008
Games, for which he said Beijing was leading the list.
</P>
<P>
Juan Antonio Samaranch last year urged Cape Town to make
another bid to bring the Olympics to Africa for the first time,
saying the city would have a very strong case.
</P>
<P>
Ball made the comments a day after he said Cape Town had
refused to bribe IOC members during its bid for the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Cape Town bid team had been approached by "intermediaries"
who offered to influence IOC members in their voting, but the
team had rejected such offers, Ball said.
</P>
<P>
Another member of the bid team, Robbie Stewart, said they had
refused to buy car parts for an IOC member, Jean-Claude Ganga of
Republic of Congo. Ganga had gave the team a list demanding
"virtually a whole Land Cruiser full of motor spares", Stewart
said.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town, along with Rome, Stockholm and Buenos Aires, lost
the bid to Athens in September, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli had called for a new vote on the
2004 Olympics, suggesting Athens won the bid through suspicious
means.

purpose is solving common quality problems that has proven very

manufacturers must work together during installation and trial
operations of large generators, and must contribute their ideas
in trying to find any defects in power equipment and solve
whatever hidden problems are found that could lead to

<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese scientists say
that the expensive new granite floor that you have just installed
in your house during the home decoration craze in China could
cause lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
A national study of stone materials has shown that 27 percent
of the products on the market failed a consumer safety exam
because of excessive amounts of radiation, according to today's
"China Youth Daily", and the radiation emitted by some granite
products is 5 times the national standard.
</P>
<P>
Radon, a radioactive gaseous element that is often released
form granite and other types of stone, can cause lung cancer if
it is inhaled repeatedly and accumulates in the human body, the
paper reports. Costly but colorful stone decorations are favored
by many wealthy Chinese consumers over wood or other materials.
</P>
<P>
But, consumers should demand quality certificates for these
materials and a state-approved radiation index, says Ma Zhenzhu,
the director of the State Administration of Building Materials
Industry's Radiation Supervision and Examination Center.
</P>
<P>
However, many stone materials providers have no information
about the standards, the paper says, but it quotes Ma as saying
that quality inspection departments would do nationwide product
safety checks and demand that products be labeled in future.

ABU DHABI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The infant mortality rate
and the incidence of childhood diseases have declined considerably
in the United Arab Emirates over the past 26 years.
</P>
<P>
A latest report by the country's ministry of health indicates

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Renews Call for Removal of U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday renewed its
call for removal of all the U.S. sanctions against the country to
"fully normalize Pak-US relations."
</P>
<P>
"The removal of all the U.S. sanctions maintained against
Pakistan is essential on grounds of equity and fairness, to create
an environment conducive for the establishment of peace and
stability in South Asia and to fully normalize Pak-US relations,"
a Foreign Office spokesman told a weekly news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the call days prior to a visit by U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott who will be here from
February 1-2 for talks with Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmad on security and non-proliferation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that immediately after the nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan last May, Pakistan renewed its proposal for a
comprehensive dialogue on South Asian security, which was broadly
endorsed by the international community including the U.S.
</P>
<P>
During the last seven rounds of talks between the two sides, he
said, "notable progress has been made in the dialogue towards the
objectives of security and non-proliferation in this region."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and Pakistan have convergent approaches on a number
of issues such as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Export
Controls and the need for strategic restraint by both India and
Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a manifestation of this positive approach, Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif explained Pakistan's readiness to adhere to
the CTBT in an atmosphere free of coercion by September 1999 when
the Conference of States Parties to the treaty is expected to be
held," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman noted, India's approach to the nuclear
issues "so far does not contribute to the realization of the
objectives of security and non-proliferation to which both
Pakistan and the U.S. have subscribed."
</P>
<P>
"India's position on the CTBT remains ambiguous at best. India
has openly rejected non-weaponization and non-deployment of
nuclear weapons in the statements made by the Indian Prime
Minister in the Indian parliament recently," he said.
</P>
<P>
The huge buildup of conventional arms by India "will accentuate
further the asymmetry between India and Pakistan and inevitably
oblige Pakistan to rely even more on its capability for credible
nuclear deterrence," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Urban Residents Welcome Condom Machines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Condom vending machines
installed in front of department stores and residential areas
have been welcomed by residents in Shenzhen, a booming city in
Guangdong Province bordering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, 400 vending machines have been installed
across the city. Domestically made condoms cost one yuan a
packet and those imported three yuan.
</P>
<P>
"People welcome the machines because they offer a convenient
service but also quality condoms," said an official with the
city's population control office, which has overseen the
installation of the machines.
</P>
<P>
"And we are able to fund even more condom production from the
profits on sales," he added.
</P>
<P>
In China, condoms used to be distributed free of charge to
couples by family planning officials. But as increasingly people
are encouraged to use condoms for safe sex as well as birth
control, free distribution is becoming financially impractical.
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, it is estimated that one thousand
condom vending machines could realize a sales volume of about 3.6
million yuan (about 420,000 U.S. dollars) a year, or a net profit
of 800,000 yuan, the official explained.
</P>
<P>
He revealed the city will have installed another 600 such
machines by the end of July.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein in Stable Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein Ibn Talal
returned to stable conditions after he received emergency
treatment at a hospital in the United States, informed sources
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old monarch was rushed from Amman to the Mayo
Clinic, Minnesota, Tuesday, when his physicians said he was
suffering from recurrent fever and low blood counts.
</P>
<P>
Hussein returned to Amman on January 19 after a six-month
treatment for lymphatic cancer at the same hospital in the second
half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said they believed that Hussein suspended his
treatments in the U.S. and returned home only to solve the issue
of the heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
During his one-week stay in Amman, Hussein sacked his brother
Hassan Ibn Talal as his successor, and installed his eldest son
Abdullah Bin Hussein as the new crown prince at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a rare move, Hussein, before leaving for the U.S. again,
delegated all powers to Abdullah, except the rights of making
amendments to the constitution and signing major international
accords.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said he reconsidered the issue of the heir to the
throne in the best interests of the nation instead of personal
considerations.
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Amman said Hussein was apparently
unsatisfied with the domestic and foreign policies adopted by
Hassan, who had been the regent during the king`s treatments in
the U.S. in the second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
They said Hassan is also disliked by the U.S., Israel and
other western countries for what seemed to be a strong national
and Arab sentiment in home and foreign affairs, particularly in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Cairo
Wednesday, praised King Hussein for what she called a "magnificent
job" in naming Abdullah as the new crown prince and heir to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
"We will stand by Jordan and hope this transition is the one
that does not create problems," Albright was quoted by Jordanian
newspapers as saying in Cairo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to visit Amman later Thursday to
congratulate Abdullah on his new position.

<HEADLINE> Israel Scuttles Three-Way Talks in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) - Citing alleged Palestinian
violation of the Wye agreement, Israel has decided to boycott
proposed talks with Palestinian and U.S. officials in Washington
early next month, Israel Radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Israel has
informed the United States of its intention not to take part in
the talks, proposed by U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross during
his recent trip to the region earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Sharon told U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker during a meeting
Wednesday that it has no point in holding the talks since the
Palestinians have not fulfilled their commitments made in the
latest interim agreement signed last October.
</P>
<P>
But he did not rule out the possibility of holding such
three-way talks in the future, saying "the door remains open."
</P>
<P>
Ross sought the talks in an effort to break the new
stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. Israel froze
the implementation of the Wye agreement last December, charging
the Palestinians of various violations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, however, said they have carried out all
their obligations and criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of delaying the agreement for electoral purposes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, on a Middle East
tour without visiting Israel, took Israel to task Wednesday,
saying the Palestinians are fulfilling their commitments under the
Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Cairo following talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Albright said
"it's very important for both parties to fulfill their
obligations."
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials countered her statement, accusing the
Palestinians of continuing to incite against Israel, refusing
security cooperation and failing to collect illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee against incitement, which has held six
rounds of meetings, met again Thursday morning in Jerusalem with
journalists from both sides discussing how to prevent incitement
against each other in the media.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani held
talks Wednesday with senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in
Jerusalem. Both sides described the atmosphere of the talks as
"good."
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the two sides agreed to set up a joint
review panel to recommend on the release of Palestinian prisoners
from Israeli jails as part of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel released the first group of Palestinian prisoners last
November, but most of the 250 released were common criminals
instead of political prisoners as Palestinians demanded.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, France to Continue Talks on Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Thursday that President Hosni Mubarak's planned visit
to France next Monday comes as part of the continued consultations
on regional issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World
Economic Forum, Moussa told reporters that Mubarak will discuss
with his French counterpart Jacques Chirac issues including the
Iraqi crisis and the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who will travel to France after his participation in
the Davos forum opening Thursday, will also explore ways of
enhancing bilateral relations with Chirac, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is currently in a standoff with the United Nations after
it halted cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission charged
with destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction following the
December 16-19 air strikes on Iraq by the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian-Israeli talks was stalled after
Israel in December suspended the implementation of the Wye peace
accord signed last October.
</P>
<P>
France, which desires to play a key role in the Mideast
affairs, holds constant coordination with Egypt, the first Arab
country to sign a peace treaty with Israel and a key mediator in
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa is to address the Davos economic forum, touching upon
issues including the peace march and developments the Middle East,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian businessmen attending the forum will review the
country's economic reforms and seek foreign investment, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started economic reforms in 1991, loosening control over
and privatizing state-run enterprises.

<HEADLINE> GITIC Bankruptcy Will Not Influence Investment in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The bankruptcy of the
Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp. (GITIC) will
not affect the confidence of overseas investors in Shenzhen,
according to Mayor Li Zibin.
</P>
<P>
Li made this remark at a press conference held by the
Information Office of the State Council here today, adding that
there are domestic and international examples of businesses going
bankrupt because of haphazard management.
</P>
<P>
The GITIC, the second largest investment corporation in China,
filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In the long-run, he said, the closing of GITIC will show that
the Chinese government has attached great importance to warding
off financial risks, and will be positive for the development of
China's banking system.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that enterprises in Guangdong Province will be
affected in the short-term, saying that some of the province's
businesses in Hong Kong already have met difficulties in
attempting to obtain loans from local banks. But he said he
believes they will overcome these difficulties soon.
</P>
<P>
Custom statistics show that the actual use of overseas
investment in Shenzhen rose 0.7 percent from the 1997 figure to
reach 2.55 billion U.S. dollars last year, and newly signed
contracts and the amount of money involved increased 7.2 percent
and 55.2 percent, respectively.
