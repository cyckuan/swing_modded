<HEADLINE> WFP Dissatisfied With Mozambique's Taxation On Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maputo, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
today expressed dissatisfaction at Mozambique's decision to
impose levy on its food aid to millions of the country's needy.
</P>
<P>
Philip Clarck, the WFP representative in Maputo, said he
could not understand why the Mozambican government made the
decision in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The WFP had enjoyed exemption from taxation since it started
emergency food aid operations in Mozambique in 1992, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of tax exemption is also imposed on other
United Nations aid agencies as well as non-governmental
organizations, which are working for the survival of famine
victims in the southern African nation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican Customs Office recently held 4,000 tons of
maize imported by WFP from South Africa, ordering a tax payment
at 300 U.S. dollars for each ton, Clarck revealed, adding the
impounded maize was intended for 350,000 refugees in southern
Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Urges Turkish Cypriots to Join Efforts for a Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has urged the Turkish Cypriots to join efforts for a
solution to the Cyprus problem before the island's accession to
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Turkish Cypriot daily Kibris published
today, the President said, "The prospect of joining the EU offers
a great opportunity to all the people of Cyprus and it is an
opportunity that both Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots should
not miss."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots should hurry up so that a solution to the
Cyprus problem is reached before talks for the island's accession
to the EU start six months after the conclusion of the 1996 EU
Intergovernmental Conference, the President said.
</P>
<P>
"We will then be able to negotiate together our accession to
the EU," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his proposal on an "acceptable" security in a
future federated Cyprus for both sides, the President proposed
new guarantors to be added in the list of the old ones, namely
Greece, Turkey and Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Thus the independence, territorial integrity and
constitutional order of the Republic will be guaranteed by a
greater number of guarantors," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
"An international force made up from contingents of the
guarantors will be stationed in a demilitarized Cyprus," he
added.
</P>
<P>
This force, according to the President, will ensure that no
paramilitary organization is created in Cyprus and intervene
after a guarantors' decision taken by majority in specific cases.
</P>
<P>
The President stressed that "since we wish to join the EU the
guarantors should be from the EU and other countries."
</P>
<P>
On the territorial aspect, the President said it should be
solved in such a way that it would allow at least two thirds of
the refugees to go back to their homes under Greek Cypriot
administration.
</P>
<P>
"The remaining refugees who may decide to go back under
Turkish Cypriot administration will not affect the substantial
Turkish Cypriot majority in the area. Greek and Turkish Cypriots
who will choose not to return will have the option to sell,
exchange or retain their properties," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of sovereignty, Clerides said that a federal
Cyprus Republic should have "a single, indivisible, international,
legal personality and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"However, all powers and functions of the federal state and of
the two federated cantons will be derived and will flow from the
constitution of the federal Republic.
</P>
<P>
"The powers for the federated cantons, which will have a
maximum degree of autonomy in internal administration, will be
agreed upon," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the question of political equality, the President
said the status of both communities has been defined by
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his report of 30
April, 1992, paragraph II, which refers to "not equal numerical
participation but effective participation of both communities in
the federal government." "This definition is acceptable to our
side," Clerides added.
</P>
<P>
The President proposed that all political leaders, including
himself and Rauf Denktash, "should make a joint declaration that
never again our communities shall raise arms against each other."
</P>
<P>
He maintained that a Cyprus settlement could be reached "very
rapidly" provided there is political will to solve the problem
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot north and
Greek Cypriot south since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island following a short-lived
coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Continue All-Russian Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Over 230,000 teachers today
continue their nationwide strike, demanding their unpaid wages,
according to media reports here.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which began on Tuesday, led to closure of more than
4,000 schools in more than two-thirds of Russian regions.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Tribune daily cited a spokeswoman for the All-Russia
Union of Science and Education workers as saying that more than 50
regions were planning to take part in the strike protest action.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin has responded to the strike by blaming
"lack of organization in the relevant structures and bureaucrats"
for the salary delays, the Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
He promised to set up a special reserve fund in March to
prevent future delays in paying out wages in state enterprises and
public services.
</P>
<P>
The strike comes amidst growing malaise in Russia's labor
force, with a massive coal miners' strike going on in the country.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass reported that about 87 percent of the country's coal
mining enterprises have been paralyzed after 500,000 miners staged
a nationwide strike to protest months of unpaid slaries.

<HEADLINE> New York Officials Sued on Foster Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal prosecutors
accused New York City and state officials Wednesday of defrauding
the federal government out of tens of millions of dollars by
falsely reporting that services were delivered to thousands of
children in foster care, the New York Time reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the
government said that from 1990 to 1994, the city's Child Welfare
Administration intentionally misled federal officials to obtain
millions of dollars in federal funds by stating that children had
received attention from case-workers when they often had not, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for federal funds, city officials are required to
monitor the care of children in foster homes and file reports on
each case once every six months.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency's staff members were not always conducting
the reviews of foster care cases. Instead, the employees were
ordered by their superiors to file false data saying that they had
conducted the reviews. And the head of the agency and other agency
officials in charge of foster care knew that, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also accused New York State of receiving 37.4
million dollars in federal foster care funds between 1990 and
1994.
</P>
<P>
The federal government is seeking at least 112 million dollars
in damages from the city and the state as it accused the city and
state of depriving "needy foster children and their families" of
foster services.
</P>
<P>
"The children of this city who are the most vulnerable and in
need of attention have been deprived of critical, federally
mandated foster care services," United States Attorney Mary Jo
White said in announcing the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit comes as the agency is being scrutinized for how it
handled the case of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo who died recently
from a severe beating by her mother and other reports of neglects
of child care in the city.

<HEADLINE> Tajik President Says Situation Remains Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmanov said today that the situation in his country remained
"complex but not out of control," according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament of Tajikistan, a former Soviet
Republic in the Central Asia, Rakhmonov stressed that "we shall
not let the conflict and provocations grow up."
</P>
<P>
He said that a parliamentary commission set up to handle the
crisis was holding negotiations with two groups of rebels in
Kurgan-Tyube and Tursun-Zade, both cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
One rebel leader, former Tursun-Zade Mayor, and his armed
supporters attacked the city on January 26, demanding the
dismissal of some administration officials and power ministers.
</P>
<P>
Another rebel leader, commander of the 1st rifle brigade
deployed outside Kurgan-Tyube, led his soldiers in attacking the
city one day later, demanding the resignation of the central
government and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov told the lawmakers that talks with the rebels should
be held "in the framework of the constitution and existing
legislation".
</P>
<P>
In another development, the fighting between the government
troops and the opposition units continued today in the Tavil-Dara
region, some 300 kilometers east of Dushanbe
</P>
<P>
Some 300 opposition militants are involved in the on-going
fierce battle in the region bordering on Afghanistan, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Rakhmonov blamed "foreign political forces" for
the current destabilization in the republic," accusing them of
attempts "to wipe the republic off the world map."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Uzbek and Russian Presidents Islam Karimov and
Boris Yeltsin had a telephone talk and decided that "it was
necessary to settle the conflict in Tajikistan by joint efforts."
The situation in Tajikistan evoked "serious concern" of the
Russian President, his spokesman Sergei Medvedev told reporters
here today.
</P>
<P>
Karimov's adviser Bakhtiyer Gulyamov arrived in Dushanbe this
morning. Yuri Baturi, national security adviser to Yeltsin,
arrived there at about the same time. According to the Itar-Tass
news agency, Baturin, accompanied by a group of Russian military
experts, has gone to Kurgan-Tyube to meet rebel leader
Khudoberdiyev, apparently to seek a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Rakhmonov also briefed Yeltsin on the latest
developments in his country in a telephone conversation. The
Russian President reaffirmed his "firm support for President
Rakhmonov's efforts" to stabilize the socio-political situation in
Tajikistan, Rakhmonov's spokesman Zafar Saidov said in Dushanbe.

JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
today promised further cooperation with SADC countries by
encouraging more Chinese companies to set up wholy-owned or joint

</P>
<P>
China will continue to provide assistance to member states of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) through
bilateral channels in the spirit of equality, mutual benefit and

Peiding at the on-going 1996 SADC consultative conference on
trade and investment held in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Ji noted as a developing country itself, China has always

"We always attach importance to south-south cooperation, and
sympathize with and support African countries in their efforts to
strengthen regional economic cooperation and common development

For many years, Ji said, China has maintained friendly
cooperation with the majority of SADC member states in the
economic, technological, trade and other fields, which has
produced noticeable results.
</P>
<P>
He said to date, China has provided development aid worth of
billions of U.S. dollars to SADC member states, most of which is
in the form of interest-free loans or grant.
</P>
<P>
China has helped build in the recipient countries railways,
highways, bridges, hospitals, stadiums and other infrastructure
facilities, and assisted them in developing industrial and
agricultural projects such as textile mills, garment factories,
coal mines, agricultural farms and irrigation systems, Ji added.
</P>
<P>
According to Ji, trade between China and SADC countries has
also made huge headway. Two-way trade in 1994 reached 1.138
billion U.S. dollars, 509 million dollars of which is China's
exports to the SADC region and the 629 million China's imports.
The figure jumped drastically in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that as the Chinese economy grows stronger,
trade and economic cooperation between China and SADC, including
the SADC countries, hold out a brighter future," Ji stressed.
</P>
<P>
SADC is a 12-member sub-regional group comprising Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South
Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Ji praised SADC's role in the past 14 years in promoting
regional economic cooperation, development and integration.
</P>
<P>
He said in recent years, with the historical changes taking
place in southern Africa, SADC membership has increased and
strength enhanced, thus playing a more vigorous role in promoting
regional peace and development and becoming the most dynamic and
best-known sub-regional organization in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people admire the achievements
scored by SADC, and wish its member countries greater
accomplishments in their drive for closer cooperation and
economic prosperity," Ji said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria To Erect More Plazas On Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian federal government
is to erect more toll plazas on highways in the country to
generate more revenue for the maintenance of roads.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Works and Housing Minister Abdulkarim
Adisa while talking to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) today in
Bauchi, northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
NAN quoted Adisa as saying that the plazas would be erected on
roads leading to tourists centers, citing the Yankari Games
Reserve in Bauchi and the Obudu Ranch in cross river.
</P>
<P>
He said that the federal government's decision to privatize
the 28 toll gates in the country was to generate more revenue.
</P>
<P>
He explained that up to 75 percent of the money collected at
the toll gates were not paid to the government, because officials
of the ministry that collected the tolls were more interested in
enriching themselves than paying money collected into the
government purse.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue to allow this unpatriotic act to continue
so we decided to hand over toll collection to private persons,"
he noted.

<HEADLINE> IBM to Buy Software Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) agreed to pay 743 million U.S. dollars or
47.50 U.S. dollars a share to buy software developer Tivoli
Systems.
</P>
<P>
This will become IBM's second big acquisition in eight months.
Last June, IBM paid a hefty 3.5 billion U.S. dollars to buy Lotus
Development and its flagship Notes software. These two moves are
regarded as an ambition: expand IBM's presence in computer
networking.
</P>
<P>
Lotus's Notes Version 4 is designed to make data publishing and
collecting on Internet much more convenient.
</P>
<P>
Tivoli makes software that helps companies switch from
mainframes to networks of smaller computers.
</P>
<P>
"As more and more customers exploit powerful computer networks
for competitive advantage, the need for systems management
products to operate and maintain those networks becomes critical,"
IBM Chief Executive Louis Gerstner said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Local press here reported that Frank Moss, Tivoli's chief
executive officer, will continue to run the company as an
autonomous unit of IBM. He also will oversee IBM's existing
system-management software, a business that brings in more than 1
billion U.S. dollars a year for the company.
</P>
<P>
The "Wall Street Journal" reported that IBM can well afford
takeovers. Its cash holding stood at 7.7 billion at the end of
1995.

KHARTOUM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Sudan today expressed its
regret over a U.S. decision to withdraw its diplomats from
Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry
said the U.S. decision was taken at a time when the two sides
embarked on a serious dialogue to tackle issues tampering with
bilateral relations. It described the decision as lacking
realistic and positive reasons.
</P>
<P>
The statement called upon the U.S. government to reconsider its
decision for the best interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration had officially notified Sudan of its
decision Wednesday evening, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here maintain that the United States will
open a representative office in a neighboring state adjacent to
Sudan in order to maintain contacts between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> UN Short of Funds, to Reduce Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Worsening Financial crisis has
compelled the United Nations to cut back over 1,000 staff in 1996
in order to achieve the planned 10 percent reduction in expenses.
</P>
<P>
The move, released recently at press briefings both at New York
and Geneva, came as result of some countries in arrears with their
contributions to U.N.
</P>
<P>
By mid-January 1996, unpaid dues to UN totalled 3.3 billion
U.S. dollars, of which around 1.6 billion for the UN regular
budget, 1.7 billion for peace-keeping missions and 4.9 million for
the International Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The overdue amounts included 1.2 billion dollars that should
have been contributed by the United States before 1996, which was
followed by Russia, with more than 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. share of the UN regular budget should amount to 25
percent, down to 12 percent in effect last year. It should account
for 31 percent of the peacekeeping dues, but paid off only 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
Judging from its current budgetary problems, Washington appears
not intended to pay the debt it owed to U.N.
</P>
<P>
UN press official in Geneva said that it still remains unknown
if the U.N. budget goals for the year 1996-1997 will be fulfilled.
The budget, approved at the U.N. General Assembly last December,
is the first ever aiming at achieving "zero nominal growth" with
real cost reductions of over 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1996 assessments, some 1.1 billion dollars will be
assessed for the regular budget, with some 275.3 million assessed
this week for eight peace-keeping operations, including
assessments for mandate periods in 1995.
</P>
<P>
By January 23, 12 member states had paid up their 1996 regular
budget dues and 13 others had made a partial payment. U.N. had
received some 93.6 million dollars for the regular budget, 42.5
million for peacekeeping missions and more than 297,000 dollars
for the International Tribunals.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Petrovsky, Director-General of the United Nations
Office at Geneva, said Monday, "Nevertheless, we are faced with
the stark realities of dwindling resources. As a result, we are
unfortunately left with no choice but to take immediate action,
which will include cutting some facilities and services in Geneva
for all our partners."
</P>
<P>
In UN Geneva office, some 250 staff are expected to be reduced
in the year.

HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean current President
Robert Mugabe and two opposition leaders will contend for the
next presidency of Zimbabwe in the race scheduled for March 16 and
17, this year.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition candidates are leader of the opposition
ZANU (Ndonga) Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Bishop Abel
Muzorewa of the united parties.
</P>
<P>
The three candidates qualified for the presidential poll at
the close of the nomination court in Harare today.
</P>
<P>
Two other relatively unknown opposition presidential
aspirants, businessman and politician Egypt Dzinemunenzva and
Harare economist Clive Samvura limped off before the race began.
</P>
<P>
Presiding officer, Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede said
Dzinemunenzva and Samvura had failed to score the required number
of a minimum of 10 nominators from each of the country's 10
political provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, the Forum Party of Zimbabwe, the Front
for Popular Democracy and the Front for Democratic Reform are
boycotting the elections citing flaws in the constitution and
electoral act which they say favor the ruling ZANU (PF).

KUWAIT CITY, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,900 U.S. troops
today began maneuvers focusing on weapons and air coordination
support in the Kuwaiti desert.
</P>
<P>
The troops, including marines, sailors and support personnel,
took part in the exercises intended to demonstrate the commitment

Gulf, according to a statement released by the U.S. embassy here.

The exercises are seen as a deterrent to Iraq, which invaded

U.S. signed a 10-year defense agreement after the coalition forces
headed by the U.S. drove Iraqi troops out of the emirate in
February 1991.

<HEADLINE> US Begins to Withdraw Diplomats From Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
began to evacuate all its diplomats and government personnel from
Sudan because they are vulnerable to terrorist attack in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
About 30 U.S. Embassy staff members and their families will
leave Sudan by commercial airlines over the next few days, State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns announced here last night.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 2,100 U.S. citizens who live in Sudan are
being urged to leave that country.
</P>
<P>
"We regret this decision, but it was necessary for the safety
of United States citizens," Burns said, adding that the United
States has repeatedly sought assurance from the government of
Sudan that it would protect Americans but has not received them.
</P>
<P>
Burns noted that the withdrawal is not a break in diplomatic
relations and the United States will establish an office in the
region to maintain its liaison with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the United States and Sudan have been tense
since General Omar al-Bashir seized power in a 1989 coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has put Sudan on its list of those
states which are accused of sponsoring international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The United States made the decision to withdraw all its
diplomats from Sudan out of security fears triggered by a U.N.
Security Council demand yesterday that Sudan surrender three men
suspected of trying to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak last June.

<HEADLINE> Britain Plans to Make Insider Trading Civil Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Steps to make insider dealing a
civil wrong rather than a criminal offense are under active
consideration by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the
chief City regulator in London.
</P>
<P>
The move, which could trigger a sharp increase in the rate of
successful legal actions, is detailed in the SIB's management plan
for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Barely 200 cases have been referred to the prosecuting
authorities by the Stock Exchange since 1980, when insider dealing
became an offense in Britain. Cases take up to four years to reach
the courts, and convictions are rare.
</P>
<P>
Civil remedies would ease successful legal actions by sharply
reducing the burden of proof. Under the present system, a
prosecutor needs to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that an
offense has been committed.

<HEADLINE> Cote D'Ivoire Offers Venue Of Possible S.Leonean Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Cote d'Ivoire has offered
Yamassoukro as a venue for any peace talks between the Sierra
Leonean military government and the rebel RUF, Sierra Leonean
Head of State Brigadier Julius Maada Bio said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bio said, "there has not been any contact" with the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) so far but disclosed he was
informed by the International Committee of the Red Cross on
Thursday that RUF leader Corporal Foday Sankoh had indicated that
"he would like to talk to Bio directly".
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean new leader was addressing his first press
conference since he came to power in a January 16 coup and made
an offer of dialogue to the RUF the following day.
</P>
<P>
He gave no further details but re-emphasized that he would
"pursue peace at any price for Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
Diplomats are of the view that Cote d'Ivoire is one of the
countries "crucial to the peace process" in Sierra Leone as it
has repeatedly been accused of siding with the RUF, a claim which
it denies.
</P>
<P>
Later last month, the RUF indicated that it was prepared to
hold talks with the government, their first unconditional offer
of negotiations since the beginning of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Reporting on his rounds of visits to sub-regional countries in
recent days, Bio said for Sierra Leone "to achieve a sustainable
peace, it needs the support of Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria had also "offered to host any mediation
efforts" to bring a halt to the five-year-old rebel war, which
had wrecked Sierra Leone's mining-based economy and driven more
than one-third of the country's four million people from their
home.
</P>
<P>
On the possible postponement of the planned February 26
elections, Bio said that the date had been set by a consultative
delegates conference last August and that "if there should be any
change, it will be up to that meeting to decide the issue".
</P>
<P>
The RUF has said it wanted the elections to be postponed "so
that we can have time to restore peace in the country".
</P>
<P>
The elections had been pledged to end the civil war by Former
Head of State Valentine Strasser, who was ousted by Bio in the
January 16 coup.

HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
adopted a major tax policy to want parastatals and commercialized
state-owned companies to pay corporate tax and remit half of
their net earnings to treasury.
</P>
<P>
It was announced today by Senior Secretary for Finance Chakles
Kuwaza. He said that his ministry had been directed by the
cabinet to devise a dividend policy, as well amend the income tax
act to remove corporate tax exemptions for all public
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said today that the government could earn as much as
22 million US dollars from dividends from those state enterprises
making profits, although the figure could be substantially higher
when corporate tax was included.
</P>
<P>
President of Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Danny Meyer
immediately welcomed the government move, but said that the
government should speed-up its privatization program because
''the government is there to govern and not run businesses''.

WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices rose only
2.5 percent in U.S. last year, the smallest increase since a 1.1
percent rise in 1986, according to a report by the U.S. Labour
Department today.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the prices increase was below 3
percent in the past four years running.
</P>
<P>
Both in 1994 and 93, consumer prices increased 2.7 percent
respectively, and 2.9 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The labour Department also said that consumer prices were up a
modest 0.2 percent in December with moderation in most categories
helping to offset a big increase of energy prices.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the docile inflation report would give the
Federal Reserve more leeway to reduce interests rate in the future
to spur a flagging U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Reserve, citing the low inflation pressure as a
main reason, cut the federal fund rate and discount rate both by a
quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was immediately followed by the announcement of major banks
that they were cutting their prime lending rate, the benchmark for
consumer and business loan, from 8.5 percent to 8.25 percent.

<HEADLINE> China, Hong Kong Continue Winning Streak in Asian Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China is one more step closer
to the top spot of Group Two as it scored another win at the Asian
Cup soccer qualifying tournament here this evening, beating the
Philippines 7-0.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese led 1-0 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
In the other second-round action this evening, hosts Hong Kong
beat Macao 4-1, after leading 1-0 at the break.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese national side won over an unfancied Macao team 7-1
in the tournament's opening round Tuesday although its performance
was far from being up to its usual caliber.
</P>
<P>
But the team displayed a much better teamwork this evening
which helped them run over their Filipino opponents.
</P>
<P>
With an 8-0 clean victory over the Philippines in the first
round, Hong Kong had been expected by local fans to score another
big-margin win, this time over its neighbors Macao.
</P>
<P>
But the Hong Kong team was probably steamed up too late, in the
later stage of the second half, when it scored three consecutive
goals within the span of five minutes.  Disappointed fans blamed
the team for their less active play at the game's early stage.
</P>
<P>
China and Hong Kong, with two straight wins after two rounds of
competition, are level with six points each on the team standing
table. But the Chinese scored 14 goals against one lost while
Hong Kong put in 12 goals also against one lost.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, the top favorites with superior personal skills
and experience for the three-day event, are generally expected to
be able to win over Hong Kong on the tournament's final day
Sunday. With the win, China will qualify for the Asian Cup finals
slated for December this year in the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> World Food Summit To Be Held In Mid-February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) announced today that a world food
summit will be held in Rome, Italy, from February 13 to 17.
</P>
<P>
In a statement simultaneously issued here, FAO
Director-General Jacques Diouf said the summit, expected to be
the biggest ever get-together of heads of state and government,
will seek commitment to a policy statement and a plan of action
to eradicate hunger the world over.
</P>
<P>
The world food production will have to increase by more than
75 percent over the next 30 years to keep pace with population
growth, Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
"We must prepare now to feed about nine billion people who
will inhabit the world by 2030 from 5.8 billion people today," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit will marshal at the highest political level
a global consensus and commitment needed to implement policies,
programs and strategies that will lead to the virtual eradication
of hunger in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to FAO, some 800 million people are chronically
undernourished in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Every day, one out of five people in the developing countries
cannot get enough food to meet their daily needs.

XI'AN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Ice has caused havoc on a stretch
of the Yellow River in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Since January 26 ice has blocked the river's course in Dali
County, pushing up the water level, breaking the embankments in
several places and causing widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
The local government is making every effort to minimize the
problems. Already thousands of endangered people have been
evacuated to safe places, and the Qingtongxia Reservoir on the
upper reaches of the Yellow River has closed its gates so that no
more water will flow to the disaster-stricken area.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou Military Area Command has sent engineers and air

HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- International tourism to
Zimbabwe has more than trebled over the past five years, Zimbabwe
Council for Tourism Chairman David Chapman said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that tourism earnings between 1990 and 1995 in
constant price terms increased from 428.8 million Zimbabwe
dollars (47.6 million US dollars) to 799.7 million Zimbabwe
dollars (88.9 million US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He added that the overall picture indicated that travel and
tourism accounted for approximately 11 percent of all economic
activities throughout the world, making it the world's largest
industry.
</P>
<P>
He also said investment in tourism, because the industry
tended to be labor-intensive, usually produced more jobs than
investments in other activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun said here Wednesday that forceful measures will be taken
to absolutely ease unreasonable burdens on farmers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), made the remark Wednesday
after listening to reports from a team of officials who had been
sent by the State Council to five provinces January 16 to 27 to
look into whether local governments levy extra charges on farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the practice of levying extra charges on farmers
has "bounced back" in some areas and it is very serious in a
number of places.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, an alternate member of the Political bureau of the
CPC Central Committee and a member of the Secretariat of the CPC
Central Committee, also attended the report meeting.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the actual burden levied on farmers in some
places is against the relevant rules and regulations of the State
Council and does not conform to the local economic development and
the actual capacity of farmers to bear it.
</P>
<P>
They called upon all local governments to forcefully implement
the relevant policies, laws and regulations of the Central Party
Committee and the State Council on the lightening of farmers'
burden, check the "bounce-back" trend and get rid of all
irrational burden off farmers.
</P>
<P>
They said that all those who violate the laws and regulations
by increasing farmers' burdens will be severely dealt
with.

<HEADLINE> US Initiative on Cyprus Issue Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. initiative aimed to
break the deadlock in the stalled Cyprus peace process will be
postponed, U.S. ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher indicated
here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. has not relinquished its commitment to
promote its initiative for a Cyprus settlement in 1996, the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Boucher outlined the position during a meeting with Cyprus
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides, who has asked to be formally
informed about the U.S. intention after the Aegean crisis broke
out between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke announced
Wednesday that in view of this week's Greek-Turkish crisis, he
will embark on a trouble-shooting mission to the region in
February to defuse the tension in the Aegean Sea, instead of
launching the previously planned initiative on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said the American initiative, originally
planned to be launched in 1996, will not start with Holbrooke's
forthcoming visit to Cyprus, scheduled to take place in
mid-February, when Holbrooke visits Athens and Ankara to bridge
differences between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said this development does not mean the Cyprus issue
and efforts to settle it will not be raised during Holbrooke's
visit to the three countries.
</P>
<P>
"But we are not going to see repeated and pain-staking
efforts in shuttle diplomacy in the three capitals, a move
initially planned," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said Holbrooke is "welcomed in Cyprus irrespective
of his contribution" and said the American initiative is
postponed until after Holbrooke's departure from the diplomatic
service. Holbrooke, who brokered the Bosnian peace accord, was
said to be leaving the government by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that the key to a solution to the
Cyprus problem is in Ankara, noting that a steady government
in Turkey was needed to deal with the problem.

<HEADLINE> Macao Papers Praise Premier Li's Speech on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Macao newspapers have published a
 series of commentaries, praising Chinese Premier Li Peng's speech
</P>
<P>
on Taiwan as a blow to separatism in Taiwan and as an emphasis
on "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Macao Daily News said in a commentary that Premier Li's speech
pointed out the fundamental difference between the Chinese people
and the Taiwan authorities lies in the fact that the Chinese
people insist on "one China" while the Taiwan authorities want to
split Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that the Taiwan authorities are playing a
double game. On the one hand, they intend to grab some
"international space" by making "two Chinas"; on the other hand,
they claim that they want to improve relations across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
It noted that all these activities can not cover the true
intention of splitting China.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li's speech has seen through these tactics and stressed
 that relations across the Taiwan Straits can not be improved
unless the Taiwan authorities give up making "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" in deed rather than in word.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the struggle against the splitting of China and
the "independence of Taiwan" will never end as long as the Taiwan
authorities are doing something to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that Li's speech was a major blow to the
Taiwan authorities as it pointed out that, in whatever ways the
leadership of Taiwan is chosen, the fact that the leaders in
Taiwan will be leaders of a locality in China and that Taiwan is
part of China will never change.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese-language newspaper Correio
Sino-Macaense said that Li's speech has stressed "the urgency of
solving the problem of Taiwan" after China resumes exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Li's speech has revealed that the prerequisite
and basis of the reunification of China is the principle of "one
China" policy.

LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres today said he would not call early elections in his
country out of concern for on-going peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
In a BBC television interview today, Peres said he preferred to
hold elections as scheduled on October 29 so as not to disrupt
peace talks between Israel and Syria currently underway in
Maryland, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Describing the week-long Israeli-Syrian meetings as "a success"
which had produced serious progress, he said he was optimistic
about the talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prime Minister also said he was pleased at the
smooth conduct of the Palestinian elections, which he said would
serve as the basis of "an evolutionary approach."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after meeting with his British counterpart
John Major, who said Peres "deserved every congratulation" for the
successful holding of the Palestinian elections last month.

JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Imad Falouji, Former leader
of the Islamic resistance Movement or Hamas, has been elected to
the 88-strong Palestinian legislative council in fresh ballot in
the North Gaza District, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in east Jerusalem today.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Sharafi, an activist of the Popular Front for
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) running as an independent
candidate, was also elected in the revote, which took place
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad Akasheh and Khader Abu El-Nada, both independent
candidates, were dropped from the provisional winning list.
</P>
<P>
CEC official Riad Khodari explained that the revote at two
polling stations in the Jabalya refugee camp was conducted
because the Central Election Commission (CEC) found evidence of
cheating during the January 20 general elections. The new
vote at polling station No. 76 was ordered as no observers
were present during the original vote count, while at station
No. 39, a scuffle between supporters of rival candidates had
obstructed the process.
</P>
<P>
During the revote Wednesday, some 300 policemen guarded the
two schools where the polling stations were located. Most of
the 2,320 registered voters were reported to have cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
Complaints about irregularities and rigging in several voting
districts have held up announcement of the final election
results. Khodrai said that final results would only be
announced after vote counts have been reviewed in all 16 election
districts and all complaints have been investigated.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Commemorates Jiang Zemin's Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- An official from the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) said
here today that ARATS will continue to take President Jiang
Zemin's eight propositions as the guideline and contribute to the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made to mark the first anniversary of Jiang
Zemin's speech entitled "Continue to Promote the Reunification of
the Motherland".
</P>
<P>
The official noted that Jiang's speech was a significant event
in developing relations between the two sides of the straits.
</P>
<P>
After the delivery of the speech, he said, ARATS made great
efforts to prepare for the second round of the "Wang Daohan-Koo
Chenfu talks", adding that it had to be put off due to Lee
Teng-hui's separatist activities.
</P>
<P>
In order to safeguard state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, people on both sides of the straits have launched a
struggle against splittism and attempts for "Taiwan independence",
he said, adding that the move will surely have a positive impact
on the relations across the straits.
</P>
<P>
On the negotiations between the ARATS and the Straits Exchange
Foundation, the official pointed out that the Taiwan authorities'
preach for resuming the negotiations is only to disguise their
attempt to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Taiwan authorities are moving fast to work for
"dual recognition" in the world while purchasing arms and inciting
hostility among the people in Taiwan against the mainland, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that ARATS will consistently adhere to the "one China"
policy and push forward the relations across the straits.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Tunisian
soccer team threatened to withdraw from their African Nations Cup
final against South Africa after they found no room at their
Johannesburg hotel on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we will go back to Tunisia and not play in the final,"
team chief Nasir ben Hassen told reporters after the team were
kept waiting for more than five hours in the hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
"We can't play like this, it's ridiculous." he said. "We've had
to cancel our practice this afternoon. Look how they are treating
us."
</P>
<P>
South African officials were trying to find alternative
accommodation for the team on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what we are going to do if they don't do
something soon," ben Hassen said.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisians, who moved to Johannesburg from Durban, where
they played their semi-final against Zambia on Wednesday, were
left stranded when the hotel said it had no room because of
renovations.

HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China beat the Philippines
7-0 and Hong Kong downed Macao 4-1 in the second-round matches at
the 11th Asian Cup Group Two soccer qualifying tournament here
this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have scored a total of 14 goals while lost one in
the two games so far played. Hong Kong scored 12 goals against
one lost.
</P>
<P>
Unless Hong Kong whips off a surprise in its final showdown
with China in the tournament's final day Sunday, China is most
likely to come out as the group winner and thus qualify for the

<HEADLINE> British Soccer Player Faces Ban for Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Arsenal club's player
Roger Stanislaus will confront the Football Association (FA) later
on Thursday and could face an unprecedented two or three-year ban
for drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old tested positive for cocaine after a game last
November.
</P>
<P>
Stanislaus is expected to defend the misconduct charge by
insisting that it was used socially, with no intention of boosting
his performance.
</P>
<P>
The traces showed up after he was selected for random testing
following Leyton Orient's game at Barnet in the division three
match on November 25.
</P>
<P>
He has been suspended by his club since the test result was
announced last month.
</P>
<P>
The FA will call medical advisors to insist that the strength
of the positive test suggests he could have taken it as late as
the morning of the Saturday game.
</P>
<P>
They will also present the hearing with evidence which proves
that cocaine can act as a performance-enhancer.
</P>
<P>
Tranmere club's trainee Jamie Hughes, the first to be charged
with using a performance-enhancer, was caught in a training ground
test.
</P>
<P>
Though he claimed someone else had put the drug in his drink in
a nightclub, he was banned from competition for two years in last
July.

<HEADLINE> Southwestern Supply Route to Kabul Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The highway linking the
Afghan capital of Kabul with the country's southern and
southwestern provinces has been reopened to traffic, bringing some
relief to the Kabul residents, a report from Kabul said today.
</P>
<P>
Land mines and unexploded shells on the supply route were
cleared last week, the report quoted military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 buses and trucks loaded with wheat flour, cooking
oil, firewood, sugar, rice and charcoal have entered the city
through the route since its reopening.
</P>
<P>
The highway was closed in October last year due to fighting
between the Taliban Islamic student militia and the forces of
President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Committee for Red Cross (ICRC) is
planning to airlift relief supplies to Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Flights to Kabul would start Saturday and at least three cargo
planes would carry relief supplies from Peshawar every day,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Red Crescent said that one thousand tons of
flour and ghee would be supplied to Kabul this month.

<HEADLINE> Three Nepali Cities Classified as Submetropolises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government today
classified three cities as submetropolitan municipalities in
accordance with the Municipality Act.
</P>
<P>
The three cities, Lalitpur in the Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara of
Western Nepal and Biratnagar of Southern Nepal, would achieve
greater success in meeting the challenges of urban development and
providing services, the Local Development Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1992 Municipality Act, Nepali cities with a
population of at least 100,000, an annual income of 20 million
rupees (about 40,000 US dollars) and urban facilities like
electricity, roads, drinking water and communications, can be
classified as submetropolis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government has declared Kathmandu, capital of the
country, a metropolitan city.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government's move to classify metropolitan and
submetropolitan cities is believed to be part of its
decentralization policy to give more authority to local
governments.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila to Open More Avenues for Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
pressing legislators to approve three key changes in the foreign
investments act (FIA) in a bid to attract more foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalino Navarro said today that
the proposed measures, endorsed in a bill filed by Senator Gloria
Arroyo, are aiming to open up more avenues for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
First, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) proposed to
lower the paid-in capital requirement for foreign-owned domestic
enterprises from 500,000 US dollars to 150,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The present requirement of half a million dollars has served as
a deterrent to the entry of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Small enterprises would still be amply protected despite the
reduced minimum equity requirement, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Second, the DTI suggested the scrapping of the three-year
requirement before a domestic enterprise can change its status to
an export enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the moment a domestic market enterprise
exports at least 60 percent of its yearly output, it should be
considered an export enterprise," Navarro explained.
</P>
<P>
Third, in line with the government's deregulation policy, the
DTI recommended that FIA's negative list C be deleted permanently.
</P>
<P>
The list prohibits any foreign investments in the ownership and
operation of cockpits and limits foreign equity to 40 percent in
some service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Among them are travel agencies, tourist lodging services,
pension houses and tourist inns, convention and conference
organizers and life and non-life insurance agencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senator Ramon Magsaysay Jr., chairman of the Senate
Committee on Economic Affairs, said that legislators favor the
changes proposed by the government.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we hope to follow DTI's proposals and decide which
areas to open up and shut up."
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "as much as possible, we do not want to hurt
small- and medium-sized enterprises."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
execute death convicts with lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
The Senate today approved on second reading a bill prescribing
lethal injection as the means of executing death convicts.
</P>
<P>
The bill will amend the measure restoring the death penalty and
 replace the method of carrying out the capital punishment by
electric chair or gas poisoning.
</P>
<P>
At least 120 convicts have already been sentenced to death in
the lower courts and are awaiting the decision of the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
However, since the country has no electric chair and the
construction of a gas chamber is too costly, the Senate and the
House decided to simply employ lethal injection as the means of
execution.

<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The AsiaSat-2 communications
satellite has gone into operation after being positioned in the
right orbital slot and undergoing a number of in-orbit tests.
</P>
<P>
This was learned at a reception held here today marking the
successful launching and commencement of service of the satellite.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was launched into orbit by a China-made Long
March 2E carrier rocket on November 28 last year.
</P>
<P>
At the reception the Hong Kong-based Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Co. Ltd, the owner of AsiaSat-2, presented
500,000 US dollars as a bonus to China's Commission for Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense and the China
Aerospace Corporation, which were in charge of the launching.
</P>
<P>
This is China's second time to co-operate with Asia Satellite
Telecommunications. In 1990 the country launched an AsiaSat-1
telecommunications satellite using a Long March-3E carrier
rocket. This was the first time for China to launch a commercial
satellite for international purposes.
</P>
<P>
It was also learned that Asia Satellite Telecommunications
plans to launch another satellite, named AsiaSat-3, in late
1997. The satellite, made by Hughes Company of the United States
and with 16 KU-band and 28 C-band transponders, will cover China,
Japan, India and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Rural Economy in All-Round Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China will concentrate on the
development of grain, cotton and vegetables as well as rural
industry this year to steadily increase the supply of farm
products and farmers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an ongoing national working conference on
agriculture here today, Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang said the
crop focus should be placed on grain, of which the cultivated
areas must remain at 110 million ha this year. It is necessary to
rely on science to raise the output of grain and cotton, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the country will rearrange vegetable
production bases and improve the market mechanism with the
wholesale market in the main position, while encouraging farmers
to sell their products themselves or in form of co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are also encouraged to raise livestock consuming more
grass and less grain, and make full use of barren water surfaces
and low-lying areas to cultivate aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Liu called on rural industrial enterprises to continue their
reform of property rights in the form of share-holding and
co-operation, upgrade their enterprises with science, strengthen
their management and expand the export economy so as to make
greater contributions to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural departments are urged to popularize science and
education, to speed up the process of formation of the seeding
sector, make better use of funds for agriculture, improve the
legal system in rural areas, increase farmers' incomes and
relieve them of financial burdens, and mobilize and protect their
enthusiasm for farming.

BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kodak Company of the United
States intends to sell a complete line of advanced photo system
(APS) products under the new "Kodak Advantix" brand in China
during the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Victor Chan, Kodak's chief representative
in China, at a news conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
The full line of APS products includes nine types of cameras,
three types of film and high-speed photofinishing equipment, all
of which are designed to make photography easier and increase
people's enjoyment in taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Kodak and other world-renowned photography
product makers show that about 150 million US dollars-worth of
film is wasting annually worldwide.
</P>
<P>
APS products, a joint effort between Kodak and Japan's Canon,
Fuji, Minolta and Nikon companies, have eliminated the problems of
exposure mistakes.
</P>
<P>
APS combines innovative film, camera and photofinishing
technologies to provide many benefits requested by customers.
</P>
<P>
Having first sold photography products in China in 1927, Kodak
has set up six liaison offices as well as more than 800 service
centers in the country.

HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
said today that the formula for Hong Kong to succeed will not be
changed by 1997 and Hong Kong will continue to prosper and grow.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an investors' forum, Secretary for Financial
Services Rafael Hui said this would be possible as long as
businessmen continued to play their part and held fast to those
values, beliefs and rules of the game that had made Hong Kong so
successful and had enabled their businesses to flourish.
</P>
<P>
"It has been said that Hong Kong is about business, as it was
in the beginning, is now and ever shall be," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong has an ideal environment for doing
business. Taxes are low, simple and clear; the rule of law is
staunchly upheld; there is freedom of movement of people, money,
goods and services, and the playing-field is fair and level.
</P>
<P>
All those result in a highly prosperous Hong Kong with an
economy which had outperformed so many others, Hui added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China understood and had always understood
the Hong Kong way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that business, commerce and trade have been
integral parts of Hong Kong's success, and China would like to see
Hong Kong continue to be successful," he said.

</P>
<P>
The press release was issued at the conclusion of Sri Lankan
Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar's four-day visit to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
It said the two sides expressed great satisfaction at the

which has opened a new chapter in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan foreign minister, accompanied by officials and
some 22 businessmen, arrived here Monday.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Breakthrough in Fertilizer Production Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese fertilizer
manufacturers have finally found a new way to produce fertilizer
using ordinary raw coal rather than the more expensive anthracite
and coke.
</P>
<P>
With the new technique, the "manufacturing of synthetic ammonia
with liquid coal through pressured gasification and gas
purification", the domestic fertilizer manufacturers can use a
wide variety of coal, which will help lower their production costs.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 Chinese fertilizer factories rely on coke and
quality anthracite as raw materials. Quality anthracite, which is
concentrated in a comparatively few places and has to be
transported over long distances to fertilizer factories, has, to a
great extent, increased the production costs of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The new technology, however, enables fertilizer manufacturers
to use raw coal produced locally or in neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century China plans to turn out 170 million
tons of fertilizer, which will meet over 90 percent of the
domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) China will
start construction of fertilizer projects with a total production
capacity of 40 million tons, 30 million tons of which will be
completed in the meantime.

<HEADLINE> Top Clubs and UEFA to Discuss Bosman Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 European clubs and
UEFA will discuss the future of the sport after the recent Bosman
ruling next week.
</P>
<P>
Three clubs from each of the top 12 leagues will also debate
the creation of a European "super league' -- an idea backed by
the bigger sides.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said on Thursday the meeting would also look at the
televised broadcasting of European club matches and better
coordination of the international fixture list.
</P>
<P>
The December ruling by the European Court has divided the
sport and left UEFA on a collision course with Brussels. After a
five-year legal battle by Belgian player Jean-Marc Bosman, the
court ruled that UEFA transfer regulations and foreign player
limits violated EU laws on worker freedoms.
</P>
<P>
The ruling has been welcomed by some major clubs, however, who
are keen to exploit new sources of cut-rate talent.
</P>
<P>
National associations who had qualified at least three times
for the finals of any of UEFA's three club competitions were
eligible to send representatives from at least three teams to the
meeting although Austria, Portugal and Sweden are only sending two.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting will be followed by two days of
"workshops" between UEFA and teams who have qualified for this
seasons' UEFA and Cup Winners' Cup quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Teams attending Wednesday's meeting:
</P>
<P>
Austria - Casino Salzburg, Rapid Vienna
</P>
<P>
Belgium - Anderlecht, Club Brugge, Standard Liege
</P>
<P>
England - Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United
</P>
<P>
France - Paris St-Germain, Auxerre, Monaco
</P>
<P>
Germany - Werder Bremen, Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich

<HEADLINE> Sexual Hygiene Shop to Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- China's first sex shop, the
Beijing-based Adam &AMP; Eve Health Center, dealing in contraceptives
and products relating to sexual hygiene, is about to shut down as
a result of rampant fake products.
</P>
<P>
The center, established three years ago, has won a good
reputation among consumers.
</P>
<P>
Its sales volume has kept rising, topping three million
yuan-worth in 1995, manager Qiao Yue said.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has 517 special shops of this kind and 3,778
counters marketing sexual hygiene products in other shops.
</P>
<P>
The gross sales of such products stood at 1.1 billion yuan last
year.
</P>
<P>
The center is the second-largest sex shop in China in terms of
sales volume, next to the "Garden of Eden", its competitor in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
But fake products constitute a big threat to their development,
Qiao said, adding that the market for sex products is "in chaos".
</P>
<P>
The shop would take the way of "suicide" in order to draw the
public's attention to the ill-managed market for sexual hygiene
products, Qiao warned.
</P>
<P>
But, observers here still have doubts about it.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the government has drawn up rules for the
better management of this sector, and they will come into effect
this year.

<P>
BRUSSELS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Interim Trade Agreement
between the European Union (EU) and Ukraine took effect today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for reciprocal most favoured nation
treatment whereby the EU and Ukraine will lower tariffs on each
other's products.
</P>
<P>
Non-discrimination against foreign products and liberalization
of capital transfers will be guaranteed under the agreement, which
was signed in Brussels in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also abolishes quantitative restrictions on some
products, except for Ukrainian textiles and steel. But higher
quotas will allow Ukraine to export more textiles and steel to the
EU in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Ukraine's main trading partner outside the
Commonwealth of Independent States, with two-way trade volume
amounting to nearly 3 billion European Currency Units (about 3.8
billion U.S. dollars) in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai No.2 Orphanage Treats Children Well (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Referring to the reports in some of the Western media that
about 40 orphans had been brought here from the Shanghai
Children's Welfare Institute, Municipal Civil Affairs
Administration Director Shi Derong said that it was normal to
transfer some old folks and orphans from one place to another,
depending on maintenance conditions.
</P>
<P>
When orphans reach the age of 16 at the Shanghai Children's
Welfare Institute some will take jobs, but unemployable mentally
retarded children will be sent to the No.2 Children's Welfare
Institute and three other institutes, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether seriously sick children had been sent to the No.2
Institute, where they would be "got rid of", Shi answered,
"Definitely not!"
</P>
<P>
He pointed out: "There is definitely no necessity to transfer
very sick children here."
</P>
<P>
The institute has never tied orphans up, as reported by some
Western media, according to Li Yanlin, an official with the
Municipal Civil Affairs Administration. Li used to be president of
the Shanghai No.1 Psychiatric Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The institute has to take measures to restrain children with
serious mental disorders so that they do not hurt others or
themselves, Li said. "This is done in strict accordance with
conventional medical practice. And they are never tied up," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the pictures contained in the report issued by
Human Rights Watch/Asia, Shi Derong said that they were fabricated
by Zhang Shuyun by tricking some orphans.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, Zhang went to work at the Shanghai
Children's Welfare Institute in 1988, and was criticized by her
superiors and colleagues for negligence. In revenge, she later
made up lies against Han Weicheng, the institute's president at
that time, accusing Han of maltreating orphans.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a widely-publicised picture of a child purportedly
tied to a bed in the Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute,
Shi said, "It is absolutely impossible that the picture was taken
in July 1992, when an investigation team was there checking
Zhang's allegations."
</P>
<P>
City officials concluded that Zhang's report was entirely
groundless, and allowed Han to resume work. "I went to the
Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute to make the announcement on
the resumption of Han's job, and the staff there supported the
resumption with warm applause," Shi said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Party For All-Party  Constitutional Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Forum party of
Zimbabwe has called for an all-party constitutional conference to
work out a new constitution and electoral act ahead of the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Wednesday, the party's secretary for
publicity and information James Dzvova said that if such a
conference was not held, the presidential elections would be ''a
mere farce''.
</P>
<P>
He said under the present constitution, the elections would be
rigged because the constitution was undemocratic and created
uneven ground. If his party participated in the presidential
elections, it would give the ruling ZANU (PF) false credibility,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Electoral Supervisory Commission to
resign. He described the commissioners headed by David Zamchiya
as ''ZANU (PF) sycophants''.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary and presidential elections should be held at the
same time to cut costs, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
The presidential elections will be held on March 16 and 17,
this year.

In a physical rehabilitation house nurses were helping
handicapped children do rehabilitation exercises. The children
seemed to be happy to see the foreign visitors and waved at them
cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
In a classroom for special education on the third floor a young
nurse was holding up some cards to teach mentally retarded
children to recognize the numbers from one to ten. "I teach them
two class hours a day," she told the visitors.
</P>
<P>
People both at home and abroad have shown concern and support
for the institute's work, Shen said. Many foreigners working in
Shanghai have visited the institute and offered donations, such as
air-conditioners and clothes.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats had a discussion with the staff after touring the
institute for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
The institute has more than 500 beds, accommodating some 40
childless old people, nearly 400 mentally retarded children above
the age of 14, and more than 100 handicapped children between the
ages of six and 14. In addition, there are over 200 staff members,
including 141 medical and nursing personnel, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The old people and orphans in the institute enjoy good food,
clothes and medical care, he said. "We have specialists in dietary
matters here, and ensure that the inmates are properly fed at all
times," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there are 23 medical workers in the
institute, who are able to handle commonplace diseases. Whenever a
serious illness occurs, however, the patient will be sent to a
nearby hospital. Handicapped orphans receive rehabilitation
training and special education to improve their everyday competence
and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The government has been increasing the amount of funds for the
institute over the past few years, the president said. Last year
the figure stood at four million yuan (about 481,000 US dollars),
quite a sum in terms of the present incomes of most Chinese. There
are also special allowances for repairing buildings and buying
furnishings and equipment.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia's Agriculture Records High Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region in northwest China has maintained an annual grain output of
not less than two billion kg for five consecutive years, in spite
of exceptionally bad weather and frequent natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The region registered a year-on-year growth rate of 3.67 per
cent in the agricultural sector, and the output of oil-bearing
crops, sugar-bearing crops and aquatic products increased
respectively by 14 percent, 27.1 percent and 115.7 percent over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Shengxian, vice-chairman of the regional government, said
that the production capacity of Ningxia's agricultural sector has
reached a new high, thanks to improvement of production materials
and planting conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the country's Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995) the
region upgraded more than 100,000 ha of low- and medium-yielding
farmland, and increased its irrigation area by 100,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it improved more than 134,000 ha of dry farmland, and
reclaimed an arable area totalling 8,757 sq km from soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
With regionwide promotion of machinery technology, the total
power of agricultural machines hit 2.14 million kw. Meanwhile,
more than 700 agro-technology achievements were introduced to the
rural area of Ningxia, which has contributed much to the rapid
growth of agriculture, Zhou said.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Orphans living in the Shanghai
No.2 Children's Welfare Institute are leading happy lives, and it
is a sheer fabrication to claim that orphans are transferred there
from other places to be maltreated, the institute's president Shen
Anbang said.
</P>
<P>
Shen made the remark after showing a group of Western diplomats
around his institute. He refuted the report by Human Rights
Watch/Asia that the institute mistreats orphans who have been
transferred from the Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute.
</P>
<P>
"The report was entirely based on a groundless fabrication by a
woman named Zhang Shuyun," the president said.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago the No.2 Children's Welfare Institute was
visited by 14 diplomats, including a first secretary of the
Embassy of Ireland to China, and the Shanghai-based consulate
officials from Britain, the United States, France, the
Netherlands, Italy, Austria, Germany, Australia, Japan and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The No.2 institute, covering about 3.3 ha, is located on
Chongming Island at the mouth of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
In the children's dormitories the diplomats saw clean bedding
tidily laid out. In the recreation hall some mentally retarded and
handicapped children in neat clothes were watching TV or listening
to music on the radio.
</P>
<P>
"We keep them using their hands and brains, which is good for
developing their intelligence," a nurse said. The hall was
warmed with a coal stove.
</P>
<P>
On the walls of the nearby corridor were detailed rules and
regulations for nurses, which include tidying up bedding, emptying
chamber pots and taking care of sick children.
</P>
<P>
"Nurses who violate the rules are fined and they are absolutely
not allowed to beat or humiliate mentally retarded or handicapped
children," Shen said.

<HEADLINE> China to Monitor Possible Three Gorges Environmental Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish an
ecology and environment monitoring network to keep an eye on the
changes that might be brought about by the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The government has approved the allocation of 90 million yuan
(about 11 million US dollars) for the setting up of the network,
Xinhua learned from a conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project, the world's largest water-control
endeavor, is expected to effectively control floods on the Yangtze
River, provide a huge supply of electricity, improve navigation
conditions on the Yangtze and bring about other benefits.
</P>
<P>
It will also, however, change the river's hydrology, bring
about environmental and ecological changes to the project's
reservoir area, and to the river's middle and lower reaches and
its estuary.
</P>
<P>
So the government feels it is imperative to establish a
network, including several centers and laboratories, to monitor
the changes that might take place in the process of the
construction of the gigantic project.
</P>
<P>
The project will take 17 years to complete, and is expected to
submerge 600 sq km of land, affecting 21 counties and 840,000
people. By the year 2008 more than one million people will have
been resettled.
</P>
<P>
The network will be established with the joint efforts of the
Three Gorges Project Construction Committee of the State Council,
State Bureau of Environmental Protection, China Academy of
Sciences, ministries of water conservancy, forestry and public
health, State Meteorological Administration, and the China Yangtze
River Project Development Corporation, as well as Hubei and

<HEADLINE> Direct Air Service across Taiwan Straits Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chen Guangyi, director of the
Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), said here today
that China's mainland is getting everything ready to open a direct
air service across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here today in the commemoration of the
first anniversary of Chinese President Jiang Zemin issuing a
speech on the reunification of the motherland, Chen said that in
the past year the civil aviation circles on the both sides of the
Taiwan Straits conducted exchanges and co-operation covering a
wide range of aspects.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the China Civil Aviation Association composed
of experts and scholars led by Li Zhao exchanged views with its
Taiwan counterparts in Taiwan on six topics concerning the direct
air service, he said, adding that the association also sponsored a
seminar in Beijing on the air transportation on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits. The two sides discussed in a pragmatic way the
relevant technology and business of the direct air service and air
cooperation and widened the consensus in these areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Chen said, several Taiwan aviation
companies have sent staff members to the mainland and explored the
possibilities of investment in civil aviation areas and
cooperation on the joint transportation.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chen said, "we established the Macao Aviation
Company with the mainland as its major share-holder, the first of
its kind abroad, thus opening the airline linking the two sides of
the Taiwan straits via Macao."
</P>
<P>
He said civil aviation is important for the national economy
and it can make positive contributions to the realization of
postal, air and shipping services on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Since China's reform and opening up started, he said, CAAC's
passenger flow has kept an average annual increase rate of over 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that this year the total turnover volume is expected
to amount to 8.2 billion ton/km, the passenger transportation
capacity to 60 million people and mail freight volume to 1.18
million, representing respective increases of 14.9 percent, 17.4
percent and 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said, great progress has also been made in
infrastructure facilities, air management, airplane repairing,
scientific and research education, personnel training and making
good use of foreign investment, thus laying a better foundation
for the direct air service across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the Taiwan authorities to comply with the historical
trend of the times and positively respond to Jiang Zemin's
proposals on opening postal, air and shipping services, and take
specific steps to speed up the process of opening direct air
service.

<HEADLINE> 1,150 Vietnamese Boat People in Malaysia To Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 1 (Xinhua) -- About 1,150 Vietnamese
boat people, including 84 people identified as rabble-rousers of
last month's riot at Sungai Besi Transit Camp in Kuala Lumpur,
have volunteered for repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The camp's commandant Lim Boon Boo told the press here today
that these troublemakers had had enough of fighting against
repatriation and had given up hope of being resettled in third
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the commandant, some boat people were already fed
up with the troublemakers and asked the authorities to isolate
them.
</P>
<P>
An outbreak occurred on January 18 at the Sungai Besi Transit
Camp when some Vietnamese boat people threw stones at the police.
The incident saw seven policemen and 17 Vietnamese injured. One of
the Vietnamese died in Kuala Lumpur Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The rioters burned down two blocks of residential buildings and
eleven Vietnamese were arrested by the police.
</P>
<P>
"I was told by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) representative here that more and more inmates
were coming forward to register for voluntary repatriation after
the riot," Lim said.
</P>
<P>
"After the rabble-rousers were segregated, I counseled them
until they realized that there is no point in persisting with
their actions," Lim told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The camp currently houses 4,410 Vietnamese boat people and 151
are expected to leave for home on February 6.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson 12-match Ban Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Everton striker Duncan Ferguson
won his legal battle on Thursday to overturn a 12-match ban.
</P>
<P>
Scottish judge Lord Macfadyean ruled that the Scottish
Football Association's (SFA) disciplinary committee had acted
beyond their powers in imposing the ban.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was suspended for 12 matches by the SFA for a
head-butting incident involving Raith defender John McStay in
April 1994 when he was playing for Rangers. He was also sentenced
to three months in prison for assault and spent 44 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
His lawyers had claimed that the SFA disciplinary committee
acted beyond its powers by imposing the ban for an offence which
was only acted on after a report by the match supervisor.
</P>
<P>
Lord Macfadyean confirmed in a written judgement that his
appeal to have the ban overturned at a judicial review at the
Edinburgh Court of Session on January 19 had been successful.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, who has already missed five matches, will now be
available for Everton's premier league clash with Southampton on
Saturday and is free to play in this year's European
championship.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Experts of the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) reached consensus today in their sixth
round of talks on the preparation of Hong Kong's budget for the
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after the three-day meeting was closed
today, Chen Zuo'er, Chinese JLG representative, said, "I'm very
pleased that the British side has basically accepted the Chinese
team's three-point suggestion concerning Hong Kong's financial
budget for the 1997-98 fiscal year."
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the first point of the suggestion stresses
the guidelines stipulated in Articles 107 and 108 of the Basic law
in the draft of the budget.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the Chinese side will continue to follow the
prudent principle for financial management and effective
management of the financial system.
</P>
<P>
Second, he said, the Chinese side will draft a budget which
will cover 12 months, from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is a complete financial budget which will take
into account the interests of all parties involved.
</P>
<P>
The third point of the suggestion from the Chinese side
stresses cooperation between the two sides so as to engage in the
budget drafting in a smooth manner.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that it is a historical task for the Chinese and
British sides to jointly draft the 1997-98 budget which is a
particular one in Hong Kong's transitional period.
</P>
<P>
He said that the joint drafting of the budget is in line with
Hong Kong's smooth transition as well as the smooth handover of
the political power.

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Israeli Peace Talks End Without Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Syria announced here today
that the Syrian-Israeli peace talks ended Wednesday night in the
American state of Maryland achieved no substantial results despite
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's participation.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources here, Syria accused Israel of
having failed to do something to serve the peace process based on
the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
They said that there are some Israeli currents seeking to
achieve regional ambitions and dreams of hegemony under the guise
of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Christopher's upcoming Middle East tour --
which is to start next Tuesday -- would focus on security
arrangements including early-warning stations and demilitarized
zones.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations that Christopher will offer some ideas
and proposals to serve as compromises for the attitudes of the two
negotiating parties.
</P>
<P>
The sources expect no breakthrough, but they said Christopher's
Middle East tour may result in intensifying the forthcoming rounds
of Syrian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the two countries have been stalled for
more than four years, maily over the security arrangements in the
Golan Heights and peace terms after an eventual Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Christopher's planned five-day visit will be his 17th
negotiating trip to the region.

<HEADLINE> Mandela On Economy In Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa was on
the verge of an economic breakthrough, South African President
Nelson Mandela said here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a Southern African Development Community (SADC)
consultative conference, Mandela said regional cooperation would
allow southern African governments to raise living standards.
</P>
<P>
"Southern Africa has most of the characteristics of a winning
region," said Mandela, adding that SADC needed to capitalize
on the mutually beneficial possibilities and harmonize strategies
on matters of common interest.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela pointed out that the SADC region, being
characterized by political stability, democracy and far-reaching
programs of reconstruction within a framework of financial
discipline, had become an ideal destination for investment.
</P>
<P>
Having realized the SADC region's potential as a viable
investment prospect, the World Economic Forum and the other
investment conferences during 1995 had provided potential
investors with the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the
regional investment environment and to set up a platform for
joint ventures with regional investors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a proposed SADC trade protocol, to be completed
soon, will simplify trade relations within the community and
present the region as one entity to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Mandela stressed that the SADC region would
benefit by earning more foreign exchange, creating sustainable
jobs through intra-regional and inter-regional trade, improving
credit worthiness and increasing economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
Growth and development were indeed better tackled in a
collective manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also reaffirmed that South Africa was fully committed
to working as a full and equal partner towards the realization of
a better region for all, saying South Africa's success was linked
to that of the region.

In a statement issued here, she said, "the LTTE has once again
resorted to mass destruction of life and property within the city

terrorism must be firmly dealt with," she said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Chun's Request for Delayed Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court today
rejected former South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan's request to
have his graft trial postponed, saying that it will start on
February 5 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who is currently receiving medical treatment at the
National Police Hospital here, submitted a reqeust to the court
for a delay in the trial through his lawyer Suk Jin-kang on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that he could hardly attend the trial session because
he was suffering from nausea and dizziness, apparent side effects
from his three-week-long fast in prison.
</P>
<P>
"If and when Chun's health deteriorates during his trial, we'll
then judge whether or not to put it off," a Seoul District Court
judge said.
</P>
<P>
Chun has been indicted for raising a huge slush fund during his
1980-1988 presidency, including 270 million U.S. dollars worth of
bribes received from businessmen in return for granting them
contracts on state projects.
</P>
<P>
He has also been indicted for insurrection and treason along
with former President Roh Tae-woo for their roles in the 1979
military mutiny and the 1980 military suppression of the
pro-democracy movement in Kwangju.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the Army strong man after the 1979
military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the
nation until February 1988, when he was succeeded by Roh Tae-woo.

HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) today lowered its benchmark rates by 25 basis
points, following the US decision to cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
HKMA reduced the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) rates by
0.25 percent, at which short-time borrowing and lending are
conducted between commercial banks and the authority, which acts
as a central bank.

The LAF bid rate shed to 4 percent from 4.25, and the offer
rate from 6.25 to 6 percent, both with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Sources from HKMA said that the cut is in line with the 25
basis point decrease in the US discount rate, announced by the
Federal Open Market Committee at four o'clock (Hong Kong time)
this morning.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the action taken by HKMA, it is up to the
individual banks to decide the primary lending rate and interest
rates on deposits with maturities of seven days and beyond. The
Hong Kong Association of Banks will call the shots in setting
interest rates on retail deposits that mature in less than seven
days.

<HEADLINE> Accord With IMF Vital, British Minister Tells Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain will resume balance
of payments support to Tanzania after the country reaches an agreement
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
This pre-condition was stated here on Wednesday by Ms. Baroness
Lynda Chalker, British Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs responsible for Overseas Development, at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"I have said that we will release half of our outstanding 8.5
million Sterling Pounds when the government (of Tanzania) reaches
agreement with the IMF on the shadow program," she said.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving such an assurance, Britain will consider releasing
the second 4.25 million Sterling Pounds, even before the end of the
current financial year.
</P>
<P>
"That leaves an outstanding pledge of 15 millionn Sterling Pounds.
A formal agreement with IMF and the World Bank will be a
pre-condition for the release of this further pledge," she noted.
</P>
<P>
The British minister observed that the government still had a
hard road ahead on the economy, but it was important for it to get
the economy under control.
</P>
<P>
She repeated her initial statement that she had been
encouraged by the statements from the new Tanzanian
administration and its early actions such as the mini-budget.
</P>
<P>
"I had useful discussions with the minister of agriculture and
health which will remain key areas for British suport,"she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed, "We wish to assure you that, provided the government
demonstrates commitment to the reform program, the United Kingdom,
as a close friend, will give you moral encouragement, technical
co-operation and financial support."
</P>
<P>
The British minister left here later Wednesday for Swaziland
before going to South Africa for an official visit.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Australia's Trade With Vietnam Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia has expanded its
trade relations with Vietnam since Australian trade minister
visited that country last year.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Trade Bob McMullan said in a news release today
that Australia had confirmed 150 million Australian dollar (112.5
million US dollar) worth of business with Vietnam since he led a
trade delegation to Hanoi in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that Australian companies are negotiating another 170
million Australian dollar (127.5 million US dollar) worth of
business with the Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
He led a mission of 18 Australian companies to the fourth
meeting of the Australia-Vietnam Joint Trade and Economic
Cooperation Committee (JTECC) held in Hanoi last September.
</P>
<P>
These companies represented a variety of sectors of the
Australian industry, including energy, mining, communications and
information technology, construction and building products and
food processing.
</P>
<P>
Most of the mission members secured business ranging between
one million to 30 million Australian dollars (0.75 million to 22.5
million US dollars) during the visit.
</P>
<P>
"The deals that were done on the spot in Vietnam show the level
of enthusiasm there for Australian products and services,"
McMullan said.
</P>
<P>
"We set out to strengthen trade relations between Australia and
Vietnam and try to remove any barriers to bilateral trade and
investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mission members also followed up the visit by using the
government-run Austrade offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to
gain more business.
</P>
<P>
The mission also helped Australian companies identify possible
expansion into the Vietnamese domestic sector and services sector,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian-Vietnamese trade totaled 450 million Australian
dollars (337.5 million US dollars) last year. Australia is now the
seventh largest overseas investor in Vietnam, with a total value
of approved projects in Vietnam standing at one billion Australian
dollars (745 million US dollars).

<P>
Spirlea, 21, double-faulted at the end of the ninth game of
the first to give Seles a decisive break and the Yugoslav-born
American then coasted to victory.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
soon allow private oil refineries to distribute and sell their
products on the domestic market but will continue to control the
fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
The government is now making assessment on a new bill to revise
law No. 8/1971 which grants the state-owned oil company Pertamina
a monopoly in processing, distribution and marketing oil on the
domestic market, according to sources from the Ministry of Mines
and Energy here today.
</P>
<P>
The government has licensed 12 private firms to operate
refineries with total investments of 21.1 billion US dollars in
the country. The owners of the 12 firms are still waiting for the
new bill before they decide whether to go ahead with their
projects.
</P>
<P>
The government will still be able to control the fuel prices
because the state-run oil company Pertamina will remain the market
leader.
</P>
<P>
Pertamina, which has nine refineries with a combined processing
capacity of 895,000 barrels per day, will be able to act as price
setter.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A British minister
adviced here yesterday that Tanzanian leaders look for a
constructive way to resolving the post-election conflict in

</P>

<HEADLINE> British Hockey Boss Denies Match-Fixing Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- British hockey team manager
David Whittle denied claims Wednesday that he was approached to
fix a match during the Olympic qualifying tournament that finished
in Barcelona on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Canada, who failed to qualify, have lodged an official
complaint with the International Hockey Federation over the match
between India and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The unfancied Malaysians played out a scoreless draw, earning
the point they needed to win them a place in the Atlanta Olympics
at the expense of close rivals Canada.
</P>
<P>
Canadian official Donald Patterson, who has demanded an
official inquiry, claimed the Malaysians had earlier attempted to
persuade the British team to offer a contrived result.
</P>
<P>
But Whittle said: "Absolute nonsense. As the teams went onto
the pitch, one Malaysian official jokingly said it would suit both
teams if there was a draw. I told him that, after drawing four
games out of five in Barcelona, my boys would be going flat out
for a win.
</P>
<P>
"I am not aware that anyone other than our captain, Jason
Laslett, exchanged words with the Malaysians and he has told me
that no offers or suggestions were made regarding the result. We
went on to win the match 3-2.
</P>
<P>
"I am very upset that we have been dragged into all this
nonsense. It takes the guilt off the gingerbread as far as we are
concerned. We went to Barcelona to qualify for the Olympics, we
did so and we did it without any suggestions from other teams that
we helped them to get favourable results.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see the match between India and Malaysia, about which
there has been a lot of comment, so I can't pass any judgement on
the way either side played, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China's Regional Cooperation Helping Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Regional cooperation is now
working a miracle in four inland provinces in central and
southwestern China, which has been described by some overseas
investors as "an economically-isolated island."
</P>
<P>
The region includes 40 counties that bordering Hunan, Hubei,
Sichuan and Guizhou provinces with a combined population of 14
million, about half of which are members of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Though the region is endowed with rich natural resources and
the advantage of being a geographical link between north and
south, it remained underdeveloped for long and was listed by the
central government as one of China's eight poorest areas because
of its inaccessibility to shipping and transportation.
</P>
<P>
To overcome its poverty and backwardness, provinces in the
region set up an inter-provincial economic and technological
cooperation association in 1985 with the aim of making a joint
effort to exploit natural resources, benefit each other, and enjoy
a common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The four partners have rid themselves of the former bugbear of
local protectionism and the planned economy's form of management,
and have opened their markets to each other, stimulating the
growth of a market-oriented economy that responds to changing
dictates of the market.
</P>
<P>
The past decade saw the establishment of 81 wholesale markets
for industrial goods, farm produce, timber, and livestock and the
emergence of 29,200 industrial and commercial businesses from 78
counties and cities in elsewhere in China.
</P>
<P>
The region's volume of retail sales of consumer goods has grown
from 600 million yuan in 1985 to the present 6.9 billion yuan,
representing a 10.5-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
Jishou, a small border town in the Tujia-Miao Autonomous
Prefecture in western Hunan Province, has been turned into a
communications hub in central and southwestern China. People
engaged in private businesses there now account for 7.8 percent of
its total population, higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Three counties on the border of Guizhou and Hunan provinces
possess one-third of China's manganese reserves. In 1990, they
combined efforts to build eight electrolytic manganese plants with
a gross production capacity of 15,000 tons annually. Some of the
products have been exported to Japan, the Unite States, Britain,
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the national development of a market-oriented
economy, local enterprises formed 62 inter-provincial economic and
trade groups which had 1.1 billion yuan worth of trade and added
output value of 460 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The six largest enterprise groups were dealing with tea, Tung
oil, Chinese chestnuts, industrial and mineral production, and
pillar industries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its vigorous economic growth, the average per capita
annual income of farmers in this poor region last year was double
1985's figure.
</P>
<P>
The region's successful experiment suggests, according to local
economists, that regional cooperation has not only opened new
means of economic growth for poor people and ethnic minorities of
border areas, but can also help promote the unity among the
diverse nationalities in the country.

<HEADLINE> hke020143--Family Planning Covers 24 Million Couples in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government's
family planning program recorded 24.6 million fertile couples as
regular users of contraceptives in 1995.
</P>
<P>
These active family planning participants represent some 71
percent of the total number of fertile couples in the country,
according to a report by the National Family Planning Board.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, only 66 percent of child-bearing-age couples were
using contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
Family planning for many young Indonesian couples has now
become commonplace, making the government's job of campaigning
easier.
</P>
<P>
More and more married couples under 30 are also joining the
family planning program.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, there is a growing tendency toward the
use of long-term contraceptives such as injections, implants and
intra-uterine devices.
</P>
<P>
Pills and condoms have become "less fashionable", although the
government has plentiful supplies of both.

<HEADLINE> Corruption Causes Huge Losses in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government audit
agency disclosed that it has to deal with thousands of cases
involving more than 2 trillion rupiah (873.36 million US dollars)
in corruption-related losses at government offices and state-owned
firms.
</P>
<P>
Soedarjono, head of the agency, said in a recent hearing before
the Budgetary Commission of the House of Representatives that the
figure reflected losses incurred up until last September,
according to a report of "Economic Bulletin" here today.
</P>
<P>
Citing an example, Soedarjono said in just the second quarter
(July-September) of the current fiscal year (1995-1996), his
office found 6,549 instances of financial irregularities and
corruption at government institutions and state firms, causing
losses of 186.29 billion rupiah (80.9 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the cases detected, 5,729 involving losses of 161.67 billion
rupiah (70.29 million us dollars) have not been followed up, he
said.
</P>
<P>
House members originally discovered the information upon their
visit to the agency's Jakarta branch.
</P>
<P>
Soedarjono explained that there is currently no system in place
to check up on the activities of government offices and if they
are being handled cost-efficiently.
</P>
<P>
He called on every ministry to improve its supervision
mechanisms in the future.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Reopen Embassy in Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is not considering
reopening its embassy in Kabul even after the Afghan government
apologizes for the attack on the embassy, said a Pakistani Foreign
Office spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly briefing, the spokesman said the security
situation, the damaged embassy building and some other reasons
prevented Pakistan from reopening its embassy in the Afghan
capital.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the Afghan government had contacted the
Pakistani government, expressing "deep regret" and willingness to
pay 15.3 million US dollars for compensation.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan demanded the Afghan government to apologize and fully
compensate for the attack on its embassy on September 6 last year
when one embassy employee was killed and all diplomats, including
the ambassador, were injured.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has set these demands as conditions for reopening its
embassy in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said the apology and compensation and
the reopening of the embassy needed examining separately.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan never broke its diplomatic ties with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Yet the physical condition in the Afghan capital was not
suitable for Pakistan to reopen its embassy there, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kabul has been besieged by the Taliban student militia since
last October.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, in a bid to topple the government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, has kept bombing the capital, which is
gripped by severe cold and food shortage.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Carry Out Peat Land Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
been urged to ensure that its plan to convert one million hectares
of peat land into rice fields in central Kalimantan would be a
success.
</P>
<P>
Bambang Setiadi, chairman of Indonesian Peat Society,
acknowledged that by opening up the peat land, Indonesia could
reduce its imports of several important commodities, such as
soybeans, corn, peanuts and rice, according to a report by the
society received here today.
</P>
<P>
The import expense for these commodities, which total some 4
trillion rupiah (1.74 billion US dollars) per annum, can actually
be used to cultivate those crops on peat land, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to carry out the giant project as one of
its efforts to maintain the country's self-sufficiency in rice.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia used to be the biggest rice importer in the world but
became self-sufficient in 1984. Rice exports exceeded imports
until 1993, but the country had to start importing rice again in
1994 due to bad weather which caused drop in rice production.
</P>
<P>
The society said that a special authority for the project is
needed, considering the size of the project.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the importance of improving land fertility
after it is exposed.
</P>
<P>
It pointed that the project needs sound and careful management.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Cautioned not to Go Farther in Splitting Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China is in firm opposition to
the activities conducted by Taiwan authorities internationally to
create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" under the pretext
of making stopovers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Jian made this remark
at a routine press conference here today when asked to comment on
the US government's decision to allow Taiwan "Vice-President" Li
Yuan-zu to make another brief stopover in the country within one
month.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to caution Taiwan authorities not to go farther down
on the road of splitting the motherland," Chen noted, "and we made
solemn representations with the US government."
</P>
<P>
China demanded the US government to honor its serious
commitments made in the three joint communiques between the two
countries and to strictly keep its relations with Taiwan within a
non-official scope, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the US not to create conditions for the Taiwan
authorities to conduct such activities that are aimed to split the
country, so as not to bring new harms to the Sino-US relations.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on China's IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Chinese
Foreign Ministry said here today that it is "groundless" to
criticize China for inadequacy in combating piracy.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Chen Jian, made the statement at a weekly press
conference when he was asked to comment on the US threat of trade
sanctions against China for "inadequacy in combating piracy."
</P>
<P>
"To protect intellectual property rights is one of China's
basic state policies," Chen said. "Since the adoption of the
reform and opening-up program, China has made tremendous efforts
in legislation, jurisdiction and law-enforcement to protect
intellectual property rights and has instituted a legal system for
IPR protection, a system which is up to the world standards."
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States have also signed with each other
an agreement on the protection of IPR," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, he said, China has taken a series of steps to
intensify its law-enforcement, such as cracking down on piracy,
and the country has achieved marked results in checking upon and
regulating the audio-visual and publishing markets and in
investigating and handling, according to law, cases concerning
those IPR-violating factories and people.
</P>
<P>
"It is groundless to criticize China for inadequacy in
combating piracy," the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
"It should be pointed out that IPR violation is an
international phenomenon which exists in many countries, including
the US.," he said, adding that China, on its part, is willing to
exchange experience and enhance cooperation with other countries
including the United States in IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "to frequently make sanctions threat will
harm not only the bilateral cooperation in IPR protection but also
the overall Sino-US economic and trade ties. We are opposed to
such a practice."

<HEADLINE> Intellectual Property Rights Protection in China Effective (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the patent department of the US's General Electric
has said that China's current legal system and intellectual
property rights mechanism is "complete and rigorous," and that he
would not worry about his company's exporting its technology to
China.
</P>
<P>
To increase its role on curbing intellectual property rights
crimes, the Supreme People's Court has plans to establish a
special courtroom that provides training for local courts and
supervision for them, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Seven provincial higher courts and 12 intermediate courts have
special courtrooms for such cases. China's Patent Office and other
departments are now preparing to set up intellectual property
rights colleges, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two judges said that "China still has a lot to do" to
protect intellectual property rights from infringement. Cases have
often been tampered with by departments and local governments, so
the independent trial mechanism should be improved, Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang suggested that greater efforts be made to adjust the role
of courts and administrative bodies to speed up the process and
mete out proper punishment for those found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Both men said they believe that along with improvements in the
country's democratic legal framework, will come an increase in
protection of intellectual property rights, which will in turn
contribute to the nation's reforms and opening up to the outside
world.

KUNMING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province, which abounds with phosphorus resources, is striving to
develop itself into China's largest industrial base of phosphorus
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, Yunnan will turn out 10 million tons of

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Plans Military Operation to Free Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- There is the possibility for
the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) to apply a limited military
operation, should the Free Papua Movement (OPM) kidnappers move
the hostages out of Mapndum Village hideout in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
ABRI chief of general staff lt. gen. Suyono revealed this in
Irian Jaya Wednesday, saying that the military operation to be
used in efforts to release the remaining 13 hostages held by OPM
does not mean a combat operation, according to reports reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
The ABRI headquarters has fully authorized the military
regional command of Trikora which covers Irian Jaya and Maluku to
use territorial and intelligence operations to release the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The OPM on January 8 abducted 26 people including seven
foreigners who were conducting research in the remote Irian Jaya
village of Mapnduma. Later, 13 hostages including one foreigner
were released.
</P>
<P>
The OPM demanded the authorities for a Jakarta-recognition of a
separate west Papua state in Irian Jaya. However, the Indonesian
government has flatly turned down the demand, saying that the
majority of Irianese have chosen the area to be part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On the release of the hostages, the ABRI and OPM have resumed
contact through radio.

<HEADLINE> Intellectual Property Rights Protection in China Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Taiwanese businessman
expected to take advantage of China's audio-video market to make a
large profit and had a large number of copies of Polygram, Warner,
and 21 other companies' CDs made on the mainland without
authorization, and sold them in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
To his surprise, a Shanghai court, which handled a suit filed
by the 23 companies, ordered him to pay 6.67 million HK dollars in
compensation, 1.2 million yuan in fines, and 46,000 yuan in court
costs.
</P>
<P>
The case was only one of nearly 400 piracy cases handled by
Chinese courts nationwide last year. The number of cases involving
intellectual property rights has seen an annual increase of over
35 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, China has set up a complete and effective judicial
apparatus to protect intellectual property rights," two senior
Chinese judges said here today, adding that the Chinese courts
have been "offering fair, effective protection of these rights,
both domestic and foreign."
</P>
<P>
Since the first law on intellectual property rights was passed
in 1983, "China has been quick to establish a high-level mechanism
to protect them," said Yang Jinqi and Jiang Zhipei with the
intellectual property rights office of the Supreme People's Court
in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism is consistent with the code of practices
commonly accepted in the international community," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese laws point out that the judicial system is the
final and most authoritative protector of intellectual property
rights, he explained, meaning, if administrative measures are not
effective enough, the aggrieved party can resort to the courts for
a higher decision.
</P>
<P>
The scope, time limits, investigative procedures, proof, and
legal definition of intellectual property rights as described in
the Chinese laws are consistent with international laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
In areas that are still in dispute in different parts of the
world, such the definition of rightful owner and the public
sphere, as well as other items, China uses the one that suits the
conditions best or seeks a compromise, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
To see that the laws and regulations are correctly interpreted
and thoroughly applied, China has devoted a great deal of effort
for several years in training its judges.
</P>
<P>
Most of the judges handling intellectual property rights cases
are specialists trained in several fields or in various areas,
such as science and technology, or foreign languages.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Mayor Stresses Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- This largest industrial
center of China will strengthen environmental protection so that
"its sky and rivers will become cleaner" in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"Economy can never be developed at the cost of environment and
ecology," Xu Kuangdi, Shanghai's mayor, told the city's leading
officials at a recent meeting.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the faster economy develops, the firmer people
should become in protecting environment.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), Shanghai
will improve the pattern of energy consumption by reducing coal
burning, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to move some factories which tend to discharge
lots of waste liquid, waste gas or waste dregs out of the city's
inner ring, or upgrade them technologically or even order some to
shut down.
</P>
<P>
The mayor suggested that small machine tool factories be moved
into the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant which is located in an
outlying district covering two sq km.
</P>
<P>
Xu also called for more input into environmental protection in
order to launch a number of major environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with the relationship between economic development
and environmental protection, the mayor said environmental
protection should co-ordinate with economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We must be responsible for our future generations and cannot
develop economy while ignoring environmental protection," the
mayor added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador: Peace Impossible without Full Golan Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Israel
Martin Indyk has indicated that it is impossible for Israel to
reach a peace agreement with Syria without a full withdrawal from
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"We don't take the responsibility on what the line of
withdrawal should be, but it is up to the parties to negotiate,"
Indyk told Israel Television Wednesday night. "We will do our best
to facilitate the negotiations. We will not take our position or
impose our position."
</P>
<P>
"I think it is our judgement that it will not be possible to
achieve peace with Syria without a full withdrawal, but what
exactly that full withdrawal mean is up to the two parties to
define," he added.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that a U.S. official made such a
public statement concerning a full Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a statement issued Wednesday night by the United
States, Israel and Syria said that this week's talks at Maryland
laid solid bases for next week's shuttle diplomacy between Israel
and Syria by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the talks significantly advances
discussion on key issues in a future peace treaty, adding there
is also difference of substance.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Uri Savir said that he believes there
will be another round of negotiations in Maryland following
Christopher's shuttle visit.
</P>
<P>
Savir told Israel Radio that this week, the Israeli and Syrian
delegations focused on security issues, but also discussed
normalization of relations and economic issues. The gaps between
the two sides were narrowed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. has announced that it will play a more
central role in helping resolve the disputed issue of water
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Another senior Israeli negotiator, Israel's Ambassador in
Washington Itamar Rabinovich said Wednesday night that peace with
Syria this year is a realistic possibility. However, he said that
deep gap remains on security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicolas Burns said Wednesday
night that the U.S. will press its bid for an agreement between
Israel and Syria even if Israel calls for early elections.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in Washington that it is in the interests of
the United States that the two sides reach a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
So regardless of whether there will be early elections in
Israel, there will be no reduction in the intensity of
Washington's involvement in the peace talks, said Burns.

<HEADLINE> Largest Number of Chinese Rock Paintings in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, February 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 rock paintings
have been found in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
over the past two decades, the largest number in the country,
according to Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
The paintings are mainly found in Alxa, Mount Yinshan, Ulanqab,
and Chifeng.
</P>
<P>
The work of tribal artists of the Xiongnu, Eastern Hu, and
Khitan, the rock paintings depict farming, grazing, hunting,
fighting, dancing, sacrificial rites, and reproduction.
</P>
<P>
Most of the work is the result of petroglyphs, with only a
small number painted with reddish brown paint.
</P>
<P>
Paintings of animals can be traced back some 10,000 years, and
those of hunting scenes to some 6,000-4,000 years ago, and
grazing, some 4,000-3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say that some of the work at Mount Yinshan bears
similarities of style to bronzeware of the ancient Xiongnu people,
with the former being more developed in modelling, such as in a
design of a tiger swallowing an ox, which is found on both.
</P>
<P>
What is more unusual is that human figures on Chifeng rock
paintings look similar to those found in Lianyungang city in east
China's Jiangsu Province which is more than 1,500 km to the
southeast of Chifeng.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say that exchanges involving rock painting art,
between the northern and southern parts of China, started in the
late stone age, thousands of years ago.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 1 (Xinhua)-- Zambia National Oil Company has
increased prices of petroleum products by 10 percent with
immediate effect, Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a statement of the company as saying that the
hikes followed a five percent levy on crude oil products announced in
this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
The other reason is the depreciation of the local currency kwacha,
which has affected the oil company's financial position for its crude
oil imports, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Price for per litre of premium fuel has risen to 0.63 US dollar
from the previous 0.57 dollar and that for diesel to 0.59 dollar from
0.54 dollar, according to the new price list. enditem

<HEADLINE> Arafat Sets April 12 For PNC Meeting In Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has disclosed that he selected April 12 to convene a
Palestine National Council (PNC) to begin discussions on annulling
sections of its covenant calling for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is both PLO Chairman and the Palestinian Authority
President-elected, made the disclosure at a meeting in Stockholm,
Sweden, Wednesday night with Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Eli
Dayan, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli leaders have repeatedly warned that should the
Palestinian Authority fail to hold the PNC meeting to wipe out the
relevant clauses in the covenant within two months following the
Palestinian elections, the peace process would stop.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's adviser Ahmed Tibi said Tuesday that the articles in
question will be changed before Israel's elections, even if they
are moved up.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a group of senior officials at the Israeli army's
National Defense College, Tibi said that, on the one hand, the
dates for changing the covenant are "not holy," and on the other
hand, the commitment of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat under Oslo 2
requires them to be abrogated.
</P>
<P>
"But you shouldn't stand there holding a stopwatch," said
Tibi, adding it is likely the abrogation of the covenant will take
place slightly after the agreed date.
</P>
<P>
Tibi noted that the abrogation of the covenant before the
elections would deprive the Likud of ammunition it was expecting
to use to attack the Labor-led government and the Oslo
agreements.

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Grad School Entrance Exams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 240,000 people have
applied to take this year's graduate school entrance exams, the
highest number since China re-opened its grad schools in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide exam is scheduled for February 3 to 5. Some 30
percent more people are expected to take the exam this year than
last.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission said here today that 418
colleges and universities, 319 research institutes, the Party
School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and some local party schools and military colleges will
enroll a total of 46,000 people in master degree programs this
year.
</P>
<P>
The sources there said that south China's Hainan Province had
the greatest increase in the number of people, 65 percent more

applications, nearly 60 percent more this year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Shanghai had 57 and 37 percent more respectively,

<P>
Nearly 120,000 working people applied, accounting for 58.4
percent of the total, and 31,000 more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The commission says that because the government began to push
prosperity through scientific and educational development last
May, society has raised requirement for professional people.
</P>
<P>
Those working hope to increase their knowledge, and many large
and mid-sized enterprise restructuring projects need more
upper-level people than before.
</P>
<P>
College teachers showed a great deal of interest in the exam,
with nearly 16,000 of them applying, 37 percent more than last

<P>
TOKYO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Top favorite Monica Seles nipped
Irina Spirlea on Thursday to book her quarter-final berth in the
Toray Pan Pacific Open tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Seles of the United States, who strained her left shoulder in
the Australian Open, scored her 6-4, 6-2 win over the Romanian.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, neither could break the other's game till a
4-all tie after deuces in the first five games.
</P>
<P>
Serving her ninth game, the 23rd-ranked Romanian committed a
double fault at 30-40, before Seles rushed to seal the first set
by keeping her own game intact.
</P>
<P>
Although Spirlea kept her two games first for 2-1 in the second
set, top seed Seles who co-ranked first in the world with Steffi
Graf, unleashed her powers to win the coming five games in a row.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Seles will play her quarter-final on Friday
against Iva Majoli of Croatia who beat Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of
the Netherlands 7-6 (8/6), 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain walked further even without
serving her game as Nicole Bradtke of Australia withdrew after she
strained her right foot in a doubles match Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Also winning their quarter-final spots were eighth-seed
American Lindsay Davenport and 15-year-old Swiss Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
Davenport smashed fellow American Lisa Raymond 6-1, 6-3 while
Hingis stunned Japanese Ai Sugiyama 6-0, 6-3.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The death tolls on Uganda's
roads rose 10 percent last year, reported the local daily the
Vision today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 1,416 people died in 1995, compared
to 1,289 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the number of traffic accidents also increased
from 8,903 in 1994 to 12,058 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the increase to taxi commuters who are
after money and do not care about people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for the increase are careless and incompetent
driving.
</P>
<P>
However, the statistics revealed that the number of vehicles
involved in accidents in l995 were less than in l994.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Urbanites Decorating Their Bathrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Qing and her husband just
moved into a newly-refurbished two-room apartment last month,
after having paid nearly 30,000 yuan (about 3,164 US dollars) for
the decorating.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who is a 28-year-old editor with a publishing house in
Shanghai, had the 3-sq-m bathroom refurbished using an American
Standard toilet, a Chinese Shenhua gas water heater, and pink tile
on the floor and walls, and notes, "It cost me more than 6,000
yuan for these things."
</P>
<P>
However, Zhou is just one of thousands of urbanites in Shanghai
who have spent their hard-earned savings on decorations for their
apartments, especially the bathroom, in response to the improved
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over the past three years some 380,000
local families have moved into new apartments with a total floor
space of over 20 million sq m.
</P>
<P>
The refurbishing of these apartments cost on average 20,000
yuan last year, three times a workers' average annual salary.
</P>
<P>
"The reason we spent so much on decorating the bathroom is that
we think it is as important as the kitchen for our daily lives,"
Zhou explained.
</P>
<P>
"A well-decorated kitchen serves as a major index of the
improved standard of living of the residents," a man named Huang
added.
</P>
<P>
Expensive bathroom fixtures have become a priority for local
residents in their plans for redoing their apartments, and
statistics show that a total floor space of nine million sq m of
housing will be completed annually over the next few years. As a
result, per-capita living space will increase from seven sq m to
10.

WELLINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Two New Zealand rugby squads
have decided to abandon their tours later this month to Sri Lanka,
local radio reports said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rugby squads of Otago and Auckland made the decision for

Originally, both teams were to play two demonstration games in
Sri Lanka as a warm-up for the four-nation Super 12 competition

</P>
<P>
Otago Rugby Union chairman John Spicer said it was not fair for
the players to take the risk.
</P>
<P>
"If they (the players) had been asked to go they would probably
have gone, but they preferred not to go," the radio quoted Otago
rugby union chairman John Spicer as saying.

"Players' welfare has to be given first and foremost

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Trade Thriving in Border Town (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bank of China has already opened a branch in Moscow and an
office in Khabarovsk, to help transactions that require a letter
of credit and to help keep people from breaking their contracts.
</P>
<P>
The overhaul of companies involved in large-scale border
trading is one of the measures local authorities are using to
improve border trade. More than 1,120 companies that lacked the
proper qualifications for one reason or another were shut down,
said a local official in charge of trade.
</P>
<P>
Those with a sound business practices, on the other hand, have
established direct trade ties with Russian companies, and 90
percent of their contracts are honored.
</P>
<P>
Suifenhe has built a 5,700-sq-m joint inspection building,
where inspectors, commodities inspection personnel, and customs
officers check the flow of travelers and goods through the
Suifenhe port of entry.
</P>
<P>
Computers have been installed in the inspection room, where it
takes traders just a few seconds to get through entry and exit
formalities. The border inspection officers have simplified 32
procedures to facilitate border trade.
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Qin, the town has invested over 900 million
yuan in its transport and telecommunications infrastructure in
recent years to help the border trade.
</P>
<P>
A law office opened recently in the town to deal exclusively
with problems involving foreigners. The office is in contact with
a Russian law office in Vladivostok and can mediate Sino-Russian
trade conflicts with them.
</P>
<P>
The Suifenhe branch of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade has also established contacts with
counterparts in Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
It is through the efforts of local authorities and
organizations such as these that Suifenhe can handle one million
tons of cargo and 500,000 persons each year.
</P>
<P>
"With the improvement of basic facilities and the
standardization of Sino-Russian border trade, I believe we traders
will have better business opportunities in the future," said Li
Fu, a Chinese businessman who has been involved in Sino-Russian
border trade for a long time and who now resides in Russia.

<P>
HARBIN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Although the border town of
Suifenhe is struggling through the sub-zero temperatures of
northeast China's winter, Chinese and Russian traders find it
fairly easy to work up a sweat just by making deals.
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon to see Russians lugging parcels and bundles
to the check-in counter for international trains, carrying Chinese
garments and light industrial products back to Russia, where they
are in great demand.
</P>
<P>
Forty-two-year-old Ludmila has been doing business this way for
years. She's impressed with the changes she's seen at the border,
and recalls when the border trade craze first hit the area in
1991, and quality of goods began to be a problem for consumers and
quality control officers both.
</P>
<P>
"Now, everything I wear, from underwear to overcoat to shoes,
is made in China, and all are of good quality," the Russian
businesswoman explained.
</P>
<P>
Credit for this should be given to the local government. Qin
Yude, mayor of the border town, told the press that a special
commission that cracked down on fake or low-quality products was
established in 1992, and local authorities have not received a
single complaint about quality since the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the commodities inspection bureau downtown, staff members
are busy checking goods carried through by tourists. Some of the
Russians seem a bit reluctant to have their bags opened and
rummaged through.
</P>
<P>
"It'll do you no good," says one agent."We must check on the
quality of goods before we let them through."
</P>
<P>
The majority of fake or low-quality goods used to be allowed to
slip across the border by means of this "tourist" trade.
</P>
<P>
Today, both the local officials and run-of-the-mill traders are
well aware of the importance of gearing even border to the
international market to encourage healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
In a savings bank near the town's biggest border trade market,
a Russian woman is exchanging money. The Vladivostok woman
explained, "Since this bank opened, I come here to exchange money
whenever I need to. Exchange rates here are the same as those on
the international market, which makes me feel secure."

"Capital Economic Information Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure on household items increased 324.36 yuan, an
increase of 12.1 percent over 1994. The steady rise is attributed
to the growth in the number of household items such as colour TVs,
refrigerators, and washing machines.
</P>

Although video cameras and personnel computers are becoming
more widespread, they are not entirely popular because of high
prices and limited use.
</P>

Air conditioners, electrical cooking items and household
electrical gadgets have become consumers' favorites.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, every 100 Beijing households
bought five air conditioners, an increase of 92.3 percent over
1994, and 8.4 electrical cooking items, a 1.5-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
There are 100.4 washing machines, 104.4 refrigerators, 113.6

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
U.N. Security Council summoned Rwanda's U.N. ambassador today to
protest the beating of three investigators gathering information
for a U.N. tribunal on genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
British Ambassador Sir John Weston, the current Council
president, said members felt the incident was "a shocking attack
which should not have occurred."
</P>
<P>
Weston said he was relaying the Council's sentiments to
Rwanda's ambassador, Manzi Bakuramutsa.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda on Wednesday said it arrested three soldiers, including
an officer, for beating the investigators, one of them a woman,
when they were stopped at a roadblock on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda war crimes tribunal, based in Arusha, Tanzania, in
December issued indictments against the first eight suspects in
the genocide of a million people -- mainly Tutsis and minority
Hutus -- in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Shaharyar Khan, the U.N. special representative in Rwanda who
is currently in New York, told reporters that he was particularly
concerned that the Rwandan army, which was expected to provide
protection for U.N. staff members, was involved in the outrages.
</P>
<P>
U.N. peacekeepers are slowly pulling out of Rwanda and will be
left by March at the request of the Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
Khan said members had to consult with the Rwandan government as
soon as possible about whether civilian political officers should
remain after the troops leave to oversee aid operations and help
repair the judicial system.

legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Before the Labor Law was adopted, fewer than 5 percent of
Fujian's joint ventures and 17 percent of the employees had labor
contracts. To make matters worse, some contracts were clear
infringements on the rights and interests of workers.
</P>
<P>
To date, 4,794 joint ventures and 530,000 employees in the
province have labor contracts, or 90 and 88 percent of the total
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Labor Law became effective, many foreign-funded
ventures in the province have taken their own steps to improve
labor saftey and the welfare of workers, adding greatly to the
cohesiveness of the enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Council of Europe Steps up Anti-Corruption Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Europe
Wednesday approved a program aimed at preventing and curbing the
trend of widespread corruption in the European Union and its
member states in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The program was approved following the arrest on January 5 in
Belgium of two former high-ranking council officials for
embezzling large sums of money.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, cases involving fraud and embezzlement
have increased rapidly in the EU, with 4,168 cases of malpractice
discovered in 1994. The number of cases involving 1.34 billion
U.S. dollars, or 1.2 percent of the EU's total 1994 budget,
represented a 64 percent increase over 1993.
</P>
<P>
Thus, anti-corruption has become one of the major tasks for the
council and the EU member states to protect the financial
interests of the European organization.
</P>
<P>
Imperfect supervision systems, the lack of coordination in laws
among the member states and the economic integration of the EU
are reportedly blamed for the rise of malpractices.
</P>
<P>
The council of Europe plans to further perfect the legal
systems of the member states and strengthen supervision over the
problem.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the EU plans to computerize by the year 1998 all
customs supervising the transportation of cargoes and strengthen
management over the import and export of cigarettes, textile and
oil-bearing products and beef.
</P>
<P>
The council also called for closer cooperation between the
European Union and its member states and for better judicial
cooperation so as to deal blows at criminal activities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expels Record Number of Criminal Aliens Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States expelled a
record 31,500 criminal aliens during 1995 compared with 30,000 in
1994, Attorney General Janet Reno said here today.
</P>
<P>
The number could be even higher because December's data is
incomplete due to the partial shutdowns of the federal government
caused by Republican and Democrat dispute over a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
Reno said last year 87 million U.S. dollars were allocated to
prisons in 44 states and the District of Columbia to help pay the
prison costs of aliens in prison.
</P>
<P>
California claimed its state alone spent 400 million dollars a
year imprisoning alien criminals and called for more federal
financial aid. Justice Department figures show that California has
more than 18,000 of the estimated 37,000 imprisoned aliens.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has requested 300 million dollars
in federal aid for the program's second year, but the Justice
Department budget has been caught up in the dispute between
President Clinton and Congress over budget cutting.

<HEADLINE> Blueprint Heralds Economic Growth for Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has
blueprinted its ambitious economic growth to turn itself into a
more prosperous region on the western side of the Taiwan Straits
in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Overall economic strength of the coastal province will be close
to that of moderately developed countries when the program takes
effect.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2020, Fujian's GDP is expected to reach 2.4
trillion yuan, accounting for seven percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Per capita GDP will come to 56,000 yuan, and the ratio of
urbanized area is to be enlarged to 65 percent. An estimated 60
billion U.S. dollars are to be used in building key projects and
the total export value will climb to 130 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The plans also paint a rosy picture for local residents as per
capita annual income of urban dwellers soars to 39,000 yuan, while
farmers' real income jumps to 18,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
This is an astronomical figure compared with the annual net
income of 4,300 yuan for local urbanites and farmer's 2,000 yuan
at present.
</P>
<P>
A local economist cites many reasons for the possibility of
this ambitious program, among which are the fact that the province
has completed an initial stage of industrialization and its rapid
economic growth has placed it out in front both in overall growth
and per capita share of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The next 25 years will be a period of vigorous development and
a timetable has been set for a three-stage development.
</P>
<P>
The first phase, which begins this year and ends in the year
2000, will lay a solid foundation for an economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, provincial GDP will climb to 261.6 billion yuan with
an annual growth rate of 14 percent. Pillar industries will grow
rapidly, industrial structure will be improved, obstacles to
market operations are to be removed and a more thorough legal
system for the free flow of cargo, technical personnel, funds and
technology will be in place.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, from 2000 to 2010, will be a period of
high-speed development. In the end, its GDP will be 3.2 times the
figure in 2000, standing at 849.4 billion yuan. More modern
infrastructure will be built, six inter-provincial railways will
be operating, and regional financial, commercial, trade,
scientific, and cultural centers will be formed. The economy and
trade growth of Fujian and Taiwan will be closely integrated.
</P>
<P>
The third phase, from 2010 to 2020, is a crucial period. Fujian
will become the first developed area in China to have a GDP going
up to 2.4 trillion yuan. It will develop into a leading
manufacturing, commercial, trade, and financial center in the
Asia-Pacific region. A Taiwan Straits Economic Development Zone
will be formed to complement the integrated economic and trade
development between Fujian and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Treaty with India Result of National  Consensus: Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The recent treaty on a border
river development between Nepal and India came out as a result of
national consensus among all major political parties in Nepal, the
Nepali government said.
</P>
<P>
An agreement reached between national political parties last
week on water resources became the foundation for the treaty,
which was initialed earlier this week during Indian Minister for
External Affairs Pranab Mukerjee's visit to Nepal, the Ministry of
Water Resources said in a press release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal-India treaty on the integrated development of
Mahakali river, Nepal's western border river with India, resolved
the controversial Tanakpur issue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the Mahakali treaty, Nepal could receive a supply of
1,000 cusecs of irrigation water in the wet season and 300 cusecs
in the dry season from India's Tanakpur hydropower and irrigation
project as well as 70 million kilowatt-hours of power every year
freely.
</P>
<P>
The new treaty would replace the 1991 Tanakpur treaty between
Nepal and India, which was not ratified by the Nepalese parliament
because opposition parties believed it did not provide enough
benefits for Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 treaty, signed by the then prime minister Girija
Prasad Koirala while visiting India, allowed India to use a small
lot of Nepalese territory to build a barrage for its Tanakpur
project, which has began generating electricity in July, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The new Nepal-India treaty would also serve as a guiding
principle to implement future projects on the Mahakali river, on
which the Tanakpur project was located.
</P>
<P>
It also provided for the constitution of a joint Mahakali river
commission between the two countries which will inspect,
coordinate, monitor and seek solutions to problems regarding
implementation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, expected to be signed formally during Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's visit to India later this month,
will be valid for 75 years.
</P>
<P>
Last week parliament speaker Ram Chandra Poudel called an
all-party meeting where political party leaders reached consensus
on the Tanakpur project.

<HEADLINE> First Child Worker School Set Up in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The first school for child
workers has opened in Dhaka to provide non-formal education to
children who, until recently, worked in garment factories in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration ceremony of the school was held Wednesday
under a memorandum of understanding signed last July 4 by
Bangladeshi garment manufacturers and the International Labor
Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) with
an aim to eliminate child labor in the country.
</P>
<P>
The school, to be run by the Bangladesh Rural Advancement
Committee (BRAC), represents the first of about 500 educational
centers to be set up in urban areas to absorb the entire
population of child workers in the country's garment industry.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by international agencies,
there were 10,547 underaged workers in some 891 garment factories
in Dhaka, Narayanganj, Chittagong and Khulna. But the number of
child workers in the garment sector may be much more than that
because the total number of enlisted factories are 2,152 in the
country.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Launch Economic Packages to Boost Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany simultaneously
unveiled a broad range of economic stimulus measures on Tuesday to
reverse the economic slowdown and rising unemployment in their
countries.
</P>
<P>
Bonn proposed a broad 50-point "action program for investment
and jobs," including tax breaks and other business incentives,
plus cuts in social welfare spending to encourage enterprise,
boost growth and cut unemployment by half.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for aid for setting up new businesses, cuts in
corporate taxes, abolition of wealth and capital gains taxes, and
lower spending on early-retirement pensions, unemployment benefit
and care for the sick.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the tax system between 1997 and 2000 is designed to
help create two million new jobs, halving the current unemployment
figure of four million.
</P>
<P>
Germany's unemployment rate is set to hit 10 per cent this
year, the highest level since the end of World War II. Growth,
which slowed dramatically to 1.9 per cent in 1995, is expected to
slump further to 1.5 per cent this year.
</P>
<P>
France, which is also facing a slowdown in economic growth this
year to under 2 per cent, sought to boost consumption and
investment through narrow tax measures and cutting the interest
rate on the widely popular tax-free "Livret A" savings accounts by
a full percentage point, to 3.5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Other measures to boost spending included tax cuts for people
buying big-ticket items like cars and incentives to buy rental
properties.
</P>
<P>
French Economics Minister Jean Arthuis said there had been
"consultation" between the two nations on developing their
respective plans, but "each side decided on the measures
corresponding to its specific situation."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Germany had decided on steps "for the medium
term", whereas France was taking "support measures" designed to
have an immediate effect on consumption and the housing sector.
</P>
<P>
"The plans are very different," said German Finance Minister
Theo Waigel, who spoke of "close cooperation" over the timing of
the announcements.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's packages were widely applauded by both nations'
business circles but trade union reaction was mainly negative,
seeing the measures as largely weighted in favor of employers.
</P>
<P>
The stimulus measures came amid continuing concern over whether
the European Union, of which France and Germany form the powerful
axis, will be ready for economic and monetary union (EMU) by the
1999 deadline set by the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, budget deficits of countries joining the
single currency must not be more than 3 per cent of GDP by
1997. But France's deficit is likely to be 4.5 per cent this year
and Germany's 3.5 per cent.
</P>
<P>
However, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French Prime
Minister Alain Juppe have insisted that they will meet the
treaty's criteria for joining a single currency, by 1997.

"All participants in this session agreed that it had

</P>
<P>
However, the statement said that there were still some
differences of substance or perspective on security arrangements
to follow a proposed Israeli withdrawal on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"During the course of the discussions, ideas for dealing with
some of the differences were presented by both sides and will be
referred to leaderships in Israel and Syria for consideration,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, the third round since Syria and Israel resumed
their negotiations in December 1995, began on Wednesday last week.

PYONGYANG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's

military exercises in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the
Fatherland released a statement to denounce the war game plan as a

</P>
<P>
The statement pointed to the fact that South Korea and the
United States have planned 30 percent more joint and separate
military drills than last year's total.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the United States held a joint military
exercise at sea earlier this year while the two countries have

"Freedom Banner," "Ulji Focus Lens" and "Foal Eagle."
</P>
<P>
South Korea plans to stage this year two separate drills
codenamed as "Hoguk" and "Hwarang."
</P>
<P>
The reunification committee said that South Korea is resorting
to its theory of "Threats From the North" to justify its military
drills and to shift the responsibility for the tense situation on
the Korean peninsula onto the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Congress Discusses Investigation Into President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's House of
Representatives today discussed whether it will re-open
congressional investigation into charges that President Ernesto
Samper got drug money for his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The local press said a congressional commission in charge of the
inquiry will decide on whether to re-open its probe on the
basis of new evidence the prosecutor general's office will submit.
</P>
<P>
The commission suspended its investigation last December 14.
</P>
<P>
But the prosecutor general's office said it has received new
declarations in addition to those presented last year by former
campaign treasurer Santiago Medinas and Fernando Botero, who
helped Samper win presidential elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the commission will ask Prosecutor General
Alfonso Valdivieso to send the new evidence as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Botero, who is also a former defense minister, claimed that he
has proof that President Samper, contrary to what he says, had
detailed knowledge that the Cali cartel drug barons were involved
in his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives is expected to re-open the case on
the basis of a report from the commission. Then it will decide
whether it will bring charges against President Samper before the
Senate further decides whether impeachment proceedings will be
initiated against him.
</P>
<P>
In the event that the evidence proves the president has committed
crimes, the Senate will request the Supreme Court of Justice to
put him on trial.

<HEADLINE> Poland's GDP Up Seven Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Poland's economy grew seven
percent in 1995, bringing the country's gross domestic product
back up to its 1989 level after six years of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production rose 10 per cent while agricultural
production jumped 20 per cent, with a harvest of 25.6 million tons
of grain, the Polish Central Statistics Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
Poland's economy went through a difficult period after the
government introduced radical economic reforms in 1989. Inflation
and unemployment soared, but wages failed to keep up with price
rises. Since 1989, food prices have gone up 29 times while the
price of basic goods has risen 79 times.
</P>
<P>
However, as the economy has recovered since 1993, economic
growth has led to an improvement in people's living standards and
in the health of the national budget. Inflation has fallen from 37
per cent in 1993 but was still 27.8 per cent last year and
unemployment was 14.9 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The government has set a target of 17 per cent inflation this
year, with a slow-down in GDP growth from 1995's 7 per cent to 5.5
per cent.

amendment to some relevant laws, Deuba said, adding that new bills
would be introduced in the next parliament session for creating a
better investment climate.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government has
promulgated a law recently to protect domestic consumers'
interests.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, counterfeit and shoddy goods are not allowed to
be imported and sold in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Violators will be fined and sued and those who seriously
violate the law will be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years'

As soon as the law came out, it won warm welcome from the
consumers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Islami Cani, head of the Albanian Consumers' Association, told

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Renault Automobile Company
has succeeded in developing a new type of battery-gasoline
powered vehicle that will reduce gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
A sample of this type named NEXT was put on show here recently.
</P>
<P>
NEXT has a small gasoline engine installed in the front of its
body and two storage batteries on the axle of rear wheels.
</P>
<P>
The new type vehicle, driven by battery power at a speed under
40 kilometers an hour (k/h), will help eliminate gas pollution in
urban districts.
</P>
<P>
When the speed goes beyond 40 k/h, the gasoline engine will
supply the automobile with power while storage batteries will be
charged.
</P>
<P>
This new type of vehicle meets the criteria of low pollution
and high speed. Driven by both kinds of engines, its maximum speed
will exceed 167 kilometers per hour.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Money World Asia -- Hong Kong
'96, jointly organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(TDC), and Money World Asia (HK) Ltd, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Frederick Lam, deputy executive
director of TDC, said that Hong Kong is the ideal location for a
new international trade fair focusing on money, investment and
financial services.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong ranks as the world's 11th largest
exporter of commercial services and is widely recognized as a
strategic center for banking and financial services.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, about 80 of the almost 200 financial
institutions incorporated in Hong Kong are among the world's top
100 banks.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is also home to Asia's second largest stock exchange,
and the world's fifth largest foreign exchange market,
third-largest gold bullion market and seventh largest foreign
currency holding.
</P>
<P>
As the first of its kind held in Hong Kong, the four-day fair
features a comprehensive range of financial services and
money-related products, including consumer and corporate banking,
equity investment, fund management, commodities and forex trading,
and money collectibles, presented by over 150 exhibitors from
across the region.
</P>
<P>
Lam said that strong presence from the stock exchanges of
Shanghai, Shenzhen, Singapore and Thailand together with their
member companies, regulatory authorities and financial
institutions, including a large delegation led by the People's
Bank of China, represented a resounding vote of confidence in this
inaugural event.
</P>
<P>
During the fair, there is an investors' forum with a series of
seminars and presentations to update institutional investors on
latest investment environment and opportunities across the region.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Monk Sentenced to Death for Killing Tourist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A former monk has been
sentenced to death by a Thai local court for murdering a female
British tourist last December in a temple in Kanchanaburi
province, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was handed down by the Kanchanaburi provincial
court on Wednesday, one day after Yodchat Suaphu, 21, confessed
that he had killed Briton Johanne Masheder, 23, when she resisted
a robbery attempt.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today said that Yodchat was also charged with
attempted rape, robbery and trying to conceal and destroy the
victim's body.
</P>
<P>
The court also ruled that Yodchat's death sentence cannot be
commuted to life as his case has shocked the public, damaged
Buddhism and tarnished the country's reputation.
</P>
<P>
The court said that Yodchat had been in jail before, but he did
not correct his behavior and repeatedly committed serious crimes
even while in the Monkhood.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence for him is necessary to set an example, the
court added.
</P>
<P>
Yodchat was defrocked after he was arrested on January 14 when
the decomposed and partly burnt body of the British tourist was
found in a cave in Khao Poon temple and her belongings, including
her passport, were found in his room.
</P>
<P>
Yodchat will soon be taken to Bang Kwang prison in Nonthaburi
province where convicts sentenced to die are put on death row.

BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Prospects are improving for
Thai exports to Israel now as Israel has established a Thai import
promotion program, according to state-run Krung Thai Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has set up an export guarantee fund that

Thailand still has a trade deficit with Israel. Last year,
Israel's exports to Thailand totaled 6.25 billion baht (250
million US dollars), while its import from Thailand amounted to
3.75 billion baht (150 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Major items Israel imported from Thailand included gems and
jewelry, rice, processed seafood, computers and accessories,
canned fruit, rubber-based products, footwear and parts, and

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand superannuitants
renting houses were hit harder by inflation in the quarter ending
last December than those living in their own houses, showed
figures released by Statistics New Zealand today.
</P>
<P>
Home rents went up higher for superannuitants than for other
consumers, according to the December quarter Superannuitants Price
Index (SPI).
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand said rents rose 0.9 percent on average
for all New Zealand households in the quarter, but 1.2 percent for
superannuitant households.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the inflation index for superannuitant households
living in rented accommodation rose 0.8 percent in the quarter
following a one percent hike in the September quarter. This left
the annual increase rate at 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest increase was driven mainly by higher house and flat
rentals, while higher prices for newspapers and some fruit and
vegetables also contributed.

SHANGHAI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
sino-foreign business disputes have emerged in Shanghai, China's
largest metropolis, and departments are speeding up efforts to
resolve them in a shorter period of time.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases resolved last year was 225, a rise of 23.6
percent over 1994, with 13 cases involving intellectual property
rights and 27 about foreign trade contracts.
</P>
<P>
International economic criminal activities and some countries'
protection policies are partly to blame for the rise in the number
of lawsuits, which can be divided into four categories: common
economic disputes, anti-dumping disputes, administrative disputes,
and international trade.
</P>
<P>
More than ten cases of international trade fraud, involving
tens of thousands of US dollars, have emerged in recent years.
</P>
<P>
As many as 93 suits about regional economic regulations have
been worked out since 1990, and are having an important impact on
sino-foreign economic disputes.

SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Colombian
Vice-President Humberto de la Calle Lomban, who was sent to Spain
as ambassador after public outrage over accusations of accepting
drug money, said today he was concerned about the political crisis
in his country.
</P>
<P>
He voice his concerns today in Madrid, Spain, said a report

</P>
<P>
De la Calle Lomban has been at the center of the political
debate since the country's opposition parties demanded president
Ernesto Samper Pizano step down later last month following charges
that he accepted drug money during his 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion is divided on whether he should assume the
presidency if Samper resigns. Opponents accuse the vice-president
of laundering money and have demanded his arrest. They also claim
that the drug money Samper received is the same that brought De la
Calle to office.

PANAMA CITY, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian assembly has

local producers by opening the market to big powers.

Assembly leader Carlos Alvarado declared that the bill will

The anti-monopoly bill was approved Tuesday by a vote of 38-8
with three abstentions. The opposition insisted that the bill
would leave local producers unprotected because it will open the
market to big powers.
</P>
<P>
The bill foresees the creation of several courts: two municipal
and three circuit courts and one superior court that will regulate
the juridical part with measures to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
The law also stipulates that toxic medications and foods that
can cause harm to people must be labeled in Spanish.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NZ Effort to Repay Debt Rewarded  (by Chen Jinjun) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's commitment to
repay its foreign debt has been rewarded by the international
credit rating agency Standard and Poor's which upgraded NZ's
rating by a notch Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based agency announced last night that it had
upgraded the New Zealand government's long-term foreign debt
rating from AA to AA-plus, the highest ranking enjoyed by the
country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Standard and Poor's said the upgrade reflects NZ's prudent
budget and monetary policies which have led to improved balance of
payments flexibility and a sharp fall in the government's net
debt burden.
</P>
<P>
This is the second upgrade for the country from the agency in
13 months. The last one came in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government recorded an operating surplus in the
1993/94 fiscal year, the first in 17 years. Since then, the
financial situation has been continuing to improve, with the
surplus increasing to 2.6 billion NZ dollars (1.7 billion US
dollars) in the first five months of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the better government finance, the government has
repeatedly made it clear that the surplus will be first used to
repay its debt, primarily the foreign currency debt to avoid the
losses caused by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The government's total debt stood at 47.6 billion dollars in
March 1994, among which 20 billion were held in foreign
currencies. Thanks to debt repayment efforts in the past year and
more, it fell to 30.8 billion dollars at the start of the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bill Birch announced last June that the
government's intention is to cut the current debt level which
accounts for 33.6 percent of the GDP to 18.9 billion dollars or
18.7 percent of the GDP in 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
As for the foreign currency debt, economists have predicted
that they will be reduced to zero this calendar year.
</P>
<P>
With AA-plus rating, NZ is now only one level below the top AAA
grade enjoyed by some countries like the United States, Germany
and Japan, and has leapt above its Tasman neighbor Australia.
</P>
<P>
A country's credit rating affects the interest rate paid for
its overseas borrowings and an one notch up will cut about
one-fifth percentage point in the interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation of a higher rating will also have overseas
investors demanding a smaller risk premium for investing in NZ.
</P>
<P>
However, Standard and Poor's said that NZ will remain stable
despite this year's general elections. It believes that "the key
elements -- fiscal discipline, the Reserve Bank's commitment to
price stability, and the structural reforms creating a more
internationally competitive economy -- will be pursued with few
substantive changes regardless of the outcome of the elections."

<P>
MANAGUA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan riot police
detained early this morning all the university students who
occupied the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday, a Foreign Ministry
communique said today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 107 students, including 13 females, were taken into
custody by police and they will be tried in courts, said Nicaraguan
Deputy Interior Minister Frank Cesar, who described the occupation
as "criminal."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the police rescued from the building about
100 hostages, including Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal.
</P>
<P>
The students occupied the ministry to press their demand for
more funds for state universities. They also held hostage some 200
people working there and ambassadors of the Philippines, Pakistan,
Bolivia and Canada, who were there to present their credentials,
</P>
<P>
But they released the 100 or so female employees and the two
Asian ambassadors after hours of dialogue with Foreign
Minister Leal.
</P>
<P>
The police met with resistance during the rescue operation, the
communique said. However, it did not say whether there were any
casualties in the operation, which began at 03:30 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The police seized 27 mortar launchers and about 500 homemade
mortars from the students, who stormed into the Foreign Ministry
on Tuesday, demanding an emergency session of the National
Assembly (the parliament) to reopen budget talks on increasing
funding for universities.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Water projects across Shaanxi
Province in northwest China during the Eighth-Five Year Plan
(1991-1995) provided drinking water for 2.64 million people and
410,000 head of livestock.
</P>
<P>
The province's per capita water resources amount to only half
the country's standard level, meaning that it is difficult to
supply drinking water to the 32 million rural residents, more than
40 percent of whom live in areas where water is scarce.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the local government has stuck to a policy of
raising funds from as many sources as possible to solve the
problem, and has used 284 million yuan (34.2 million US dollars)
for the projects in the past five years, with more than 60
million yuan of that raised by the people themselves.
</P>
<P>
It has also sought assistance abroad. From 1992 to the end of
last year, it received funds from the UN Children's Fund totalling
870,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
It used the funds for water supply and environmental health
projects in five counties, providing relief to 210,000 people.
</P>
<P>
At present, as many as 9.77 million people and 1.6 million head
of livestock have been provided with sufficient drinking
water.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia and four other CIS
nations have urged the opposing factions in Tajikistan to solve
the country's internal crisis peacefully by political means.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique, the countries hoped that the current
peace talks between the Tajik government and the opposition would
make a breakthrough and called on both parties to honour the
September 1994 Teheran cease-fire agreement, the Itar-Tass News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said the CIS peacekeeping unit will extend
its mission until June 30 this year, as agreed at the recent CIS
summit in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The current peace talks are part of the fifth round of a
U.N. peace process to end a three-year conflict in the central
Asian state.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan, a mountain state of 5.7 million people bordering
Afghanistan, has been plagued by unrest since 1992 after a bloody
civil war in which Islamic forces were driven out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Tensions heightened following the murder of the country's
highest Muslim leader 10 days ago and the flare-up of armed
conflicts in southern and western Tajikistan which threatened to
disrupt the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Patient Suffering from Radiation Sickness Survives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese worker who touched a
radioactive metal chain was hospitalized with serious radiation
sickness, but was said to be in stable condition, "Beijing Youth
Daily" reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that this is the first case of a person being
injured by long-term exposure to radiation and doctors are still
not certain about possible effects in the future, such as leukemia.
</P>
<P>
The worker, Song Xuewen, 20, found a 15-cm metal chain at a
construction site in northeast China's Jilin Province on the
morning of January 5.
</P>
<P>
He looked the beautiful object over and pocketed it. What he
did not know, until he started vomiting repeatedly and his left
hand and right leg started aching and he had to see a doctor in
the afternoon, was that the chain was actually made of iridium
192, brought in a week ago by air to be used in detecting metal
flaws.
</P>
<P>
The paper did not say why the radioactive object was left at
the site or why local authorities did not warn people about it.
</P>
<P>
"Song's condition was more serious than we imagined, but it is
stable now," said Wang Guilin, head of the surgeons who had to
perform an amputation at Beijing's No. 307 Military Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Wang said it will depend on the patient's physical condition
whether he will be able to avoid radiation-related illnesses, such
as leukemia, cataracts, and sterility.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican congress today
condemned U.S. senators who they accused of trying to disqualify
Mexico from receiving financial aid.
</P>
<P>
All parties criticized plans by U.S. senators Dianne Feinstein
and Alfonse D'Amato to link financial aid to Mexico's fight
against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
During a session of congress, lawmakers for the National Action
Party (PAN), the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) and the Labor Party (PT)
criticized their threat to deny certification of Mexico's war
against drugs. A denial would imply Mexico was not doing enough and
would mean a stop to financial aid.
</P>
<P>
Democrat senator Feinstein and Republican D'Amato also want to
stop bilateral agreements with Mexico unless the country meets 10
requirements linked mainly to the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Mexican legislators said that the
U.S. senators based their argument on a supposed lack of action to
combat drug trafficking. They added that the attitude of
U.S. legislators will harm the relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
They said it is unacceptable that Mexico is being used in an
internal electoral battle in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican congress accepts that "we have problems but solving
them is the exclusive responsibility of Mexicans and of the
political forces that, with their pluralistic outlook, their
ideological diversity, and their electoral battle, are searching
for programs that will come up with better solutions."

BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Five key areas for scientific
research were today approved by the Commission of the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that aviation and aerospace, educational
multi-media software, pollution-safe vehicles, multi-mean
transport systems and environmental protection techniques were
all vital for the EU's future strength.
</P>
<P>
The body wants the 700 million ECU (569 million U.S. dollars)
reserve fund of the EU's 12.3 billion ECU (10 billion dollars)
fourth scientific research program to be used mainly for these
sectors to allow research projects to move ahead more quickly.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is to be submitted to the Council of Europe and
the EU's Council of Ministers for further approval.
</P>
<P>
There is strong market potential in the EU for the five key
areas and member countries are more likely to coordinate
policy-making in these areas, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Development will also help create jobs and benefit a number of
economic sectors and regions, the commission added.
</P>

It estimates that in the aviation and aerospace industries
alone, some 7,000 businesses employ around 400,000 people.

<P>
Experts at the test also said that the success of the train
shows that China had solved key technological problems of
stability of magnetic suspension, which provides a basis for
further research.
</P>
<P>
The magnetic-suspension train has many advantages over
traditional trains such as pollution-free, energy-saving operation.
</P>
<P>
China began research on magnetic suspension technology in the
1980s and made the first train at Southwest China Jiaotong
University in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
China is one of only a few countries - Germany, Japan, France,
Russia, and Britain - that have this technology and have applied
it.

MOSCOW, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today ruled out the possibility that Russian troops will take part
in military operations in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Tension has risen recently in the region of Kurgan-Tyube of
Tajikistan where anti-government forces were active and there were
rumors that Russian peacekeepers were involved in the latest
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin rejected the rumors. Russian peacekeepers "will not
take part in military operations in Tajikistan since this does not
conform to their mandate," Yeltsin was quoted as saying in a
Kremlin statement today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Xie Jun Draws with Polgar in Second Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAEN, Spain, January 31 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Women's world champion
Xie Jun of China drew with Hungarian challenger Zsuzsa Polgar to
take the lead in the world chess championship here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Xie, who played the whites, suggested the draws after her 17th
move and was promptly agreed by Polgar, bringing her score to 1.5
points against Polgar's 0.5.
</P>
<P>
Xie initiated the 97-minute game with the e2-e4 move for her
familiar Ruy Lopez opening.
</P>
<P>
After Polgar's 13th move (rook f8-e8), Xie deliberately put
ahead her bishop (f1-b5) in an attempt to complicate the situation
and force her opponent to consume more time in consideration.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that Xie's move did shock Polgar a little bit, who
spent nearly one hour more than Xie in Tuesday's opening game.
</P>
<P>
After three further moves, Xie proposed a draw and Polgar,
whose spirit appeared to be dented after Tuesday's loss, agreed
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The two will have a day's rest on Thursday before resuming
competition on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the 16-game championship, Xie needs only eight points to
keep her crown, while challenger Polgar has to score 8.5 points to
wrest the title.
</P>
<P>
Xie dethroned Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia to take the world
title in 1991 and beat another Georgian Nana Ioseliani to retain
her crown in 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China has become the world's
largest cultivator of marine products with the world's largest
output, according to "China Ocean News".
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a statistical report by the International
Association for Regional Marine Fishing as saying that China's sea
farming output topped three million tons in 1994 and is estimated
to be over 3.3 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the great increase in China is mainly due
to breakthroughs in three major fields: kelp cultivation, prawn
factory-scale breeding and cultivation, and scallop cultivation,
with technology developed for mass production.
</P>
<P>
According to another report by the World Fishing Association,
total output in the world topped 101 million tons between November
1994 and October last year, with fresh water cultivation
developing more quickly than sea water cultivation. In Europe,
the U.S. and Mexican bays, the cultivation of rare and valuable
species of fish is developing more quickly, while in Asia and the
Pacific ring, the raising of traditional species is developing
more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The volume of marine fishing has at the same time declined,
showing that protection of fish resources in maritime areas has
come to be effective.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian President Critical of His Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Zheliu Zhelev
today criticized the ruling Socialist Party as incompetent and
inefficient, urging a snap election to overhaul the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He told a press briefing that the Socialist Party-led
government poses a menace to the country's security, interest and
future.
</P>
<P>
Zhelev, chairman of the Cooperative Committee of the Union of
the Democratic Forces of Bulgaria, read out a 30-minute speech
fully critical of the year-long reign of Prime Minister Zhan
Videnov, who is the leader of the Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
The president cited decreasing overseas investment as the
severest failure of the Videnov cabinet. He said that in 1995
foreign investment was less than one-tenth of the total promised
by Videnov before he took office and 1.5 times less than the 1994
level.
</P>
<P>
Zhelev accused the Videnov government of failing to run state
affairs in a professional and responsible way.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believed that Zhelev's public denunciation of
the cabinet indicates that the relations between the president and
prime minister are irreparable and that Zhelev is striving
desperately for reelection.

XI'AN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 27.75 million yuan (3.24
million US dollars) has been spent on conservation and protection
of cultural relics in northwest China's Shaanxi Province over the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
The investment is 3.3 times that of the previous five years,

220) and Tang dynasties. It has 37 historical sites that are under
state protection, the largest number of any province.
</P>

WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Stadium worth of
169 million U.S. dollars, requested structure reinforcement in its
steel segments, said the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games
(ACOG).
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Wednesday, ACOG said the recommendation was
made by Weidlinger Associates Inc, a structural engineering firm
hired by the Atlanta Stadium Design Team.
</P>
<P>
"Modifications include stiffening and reinforcement of
structural steel members and to the structural steel connections
as necessary," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, the modifications would not affect the schedule for
completing the 85,000-seat stadium, ACOG said.
</P>
<P>
Last March, one construction worker was killed and two injured
when a cantilever collapsed from a 45-meter tower.
</P>

The Stadium will eventually become the home for the baseball

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Early Solution of Black Sea Fleet Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, Ukraine, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov today appealed to his Ukrainian
counterpart for an early solution of the Black Sea Fleet issue.
</P>
<P>
He told a joint press conference held with Ukrainian Foreign
Minister Gennady Udovenko that his country still hopes to solve
the fleet issue prior to Boris Yeltsin's visit to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian foreign minister said at the press conference
that it should be a parallel process to prepare Yeltsin's visit
and to deal with the fleet issue.
</P>
<P>
"The fleet issue should not become an obstacle to Yeltsin's
visit," Udovenko stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Russia reached an agreement in principle last June
on the division of the Black Sea Fleet of the former Soviet Union,
under which Ukraine allowed the Russian Navy to be based in
Sevastopol, the headquarters of the Ukrainian Navy.
</P>
<P>
When asked if there will be any modification to the
Russian-Ukrainian treaty of friendship, cooperation and
partnership initialed last year, Udovenko said Ukraine is prepared
to sign the document without any change.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister, however, said the two countries
had only reached agreement on the treaty but did not initial it.
</P>
<P>
On February 8 last year, Evgeni Marchuk and Oleg Soskovets,
first deputy prime ministers of Ukraine and Russia, reportedly
initialed the treaty in Kiev.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was designed to enter into force when Russian
President Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma signed it
during Yeltsin's visit.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin's scheduled visit to Ukraine was postponed by his
heart problem.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian foreign minister also said his country shares a
similar view with Russia regarding the eastward enlargement by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the NATO should take into consideration the national
security of Ukraine while expanding eastward.

JOHANNESBURG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- John Mosheou scored twice
to pace the hosts South Africa for a 3-0 semi-final victory over
Ghana on Wednesday at the African Nations Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
With the two netted, Mosheou ranked second in the scorers' list
on four, next to Kalusha Bwalya of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Moshoeu opened the scoring in the 22nd minute with a kick from
Doctor Khumalo's corner, and netted his second two minutes before
the whistle blew.
</P>
<P>
The other goal was slammed home by Sean Bartlett one minute
after the break from a long pass off Lucas Radebe.
</P>
<P>
The hosts had dominated the green pitch for the most part of
the game with tight defense and ground-breaking attacks from the
mid-field, forcing their opponents to resort to counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, South Africa will vie for the title on
February 3 against Tunisia that eliminated Zambia 4-2 in the other
semifinal.

<HEADLINE> Murdoch Plans To Launch Global News Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian-born media
tycoon Rupert Murdoch unveiled a plan to launch a satellite
television channel that beams news to most parts of the world in
two years.
</P>
<P>
Murdoch's News Corp will establish a world-wide channel that
carries the news programs of its US-based Fox television station.
</P>
<P>
He said that the global 24-hour news channel would cost less
than 100 million US dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The News Corp has already got full coverage of Asia through its
Hong Kong subsidiary Star TV. It has also been beaming news to
Europe through Sky TV, an European satellite TV station owned by
Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its operation in North America, the News Corp
has gained access to the South America satellite TV market by
extending its coverage all over the continent within this year.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be covering a great deal more than two-thirds of the
world where we'll be able to put or serve news as well as other
channels," today's Australian Financial Review quoted Murdoch as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Murdoch has put Roger Ailes in charge of the proposed news
channel. Ailes shifted to Murdoch's ranks last week from the
presidency of CNBC, the business news network under the US
television giant NBC.
</P>
<P>
The News Corp will also provide news on the Internet. But
Murdoch declined to reveal who would be the partner in the group's
on-line service.

</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Government gained welcome relief on the economic
front Wednesday, with news of an unexpectedly low current account
deficit and a significant boost to exports offsetting its
self-imposed predicament on tax.
</P>
<P>
Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- After four years of stalled growth due to drought,
Australia's cotton industry is poised to produce a record crop

costing 100 million US dollars annually, will beam into Australia
and the rest of the world before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald

<HEADLINE> Australian Cotton Output To Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia's cotton crop for
the year 1996-97 is expected to reach a new record due to good
rains in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Cherry, general manager of Cotton Trading Corporation,
said that the 1996-97 harvest could equal or exceed the previous
record of 2.2 million bales in 1992-93, the Australian Financial
Review reported today.
</P>
<P>
It will be 50 percent higher than the recent crop, which is due
to be harvested in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
The recent harvest was affected by lack of irrigation water at
time of planting and damages by heavy rains recently.
</P>
<P>
But Cherry said that recent down pours had filled many
near-empty public dams and guaranteed abundant supply of
irrigation water for the crop to be sowed next spring.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was confident to lock in good prices for the
crops for 1997 and 1998, because the United States' cotton
production has been affected by natural disasters this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian crop for 1995-96 is estimated at 1.565 million
bales.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Greater Recognition of Black Women's  Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
in his annual black history month proclamation Wednesday, urged
greater recognition for the achievements of black women.
</P>
<P>
He said black women "have fought extraordinary battles for
social, economic and political empowerment."
</P>
<P>
"The voices of African-American women have called attention to
the twin burdens of racism and sexism and have invited listeners
to discover the richness of traditions kept alive in back kitchens
and workrooms," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has repeatedly addressed the wide gulf between blacks'
and whites' perceptions of American society over the months.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "identified this for himself as a task of leadership
that he wanted to meet, because a president can address those
divisions in our society that keep people apart," White House
Spokesman Mike McCurry said. "He will continue to do that."
</P>
<P>
Clinton most recently spoke about race in Houston, McCurry
said, during the funeral of Barbara Jordan, the first black woman
elected to Congress from a Southern state.
</P>
<P>
Clinton again recalled Jordan's legacy in Wednesday's
proclamation, noting her observation that blacks were not counted
as citizens when the Constitution was written in 1787, yet they
persevered and ultimately gained full rights.
</P>
<P>
Clinton encouraged teachers to craft lessons around the works
of black women.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said, the Clinton administration continues working on a
formal strategy for addressing racial concerns through policies
and practices "that provide opportunity for people of color and
that reward those efforts to bring people together to find common
ground, that bridges some of the gaps that do exist."

<HEADLINE> UN Council Urges Sudan to Extradite Terrorist Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday urged Sudan to extradite to Ethiopia for
prosecution of three suspects involved in an assassination attempt
against Egyptian President Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time the Security Council has made such an
appeal to Sudan. Earlier this month, the council issued a
presidential statement to this effect.
</P>
<P>
The assassination attempt on the life of President Mubarak
happened on June 26,1995, when the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) convened a summit meeting in Ethipia's capitol Addis Ababa.
Mubarak was shot at by terrorists on his way to hotel from the
airport.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia later arrested several suspects and found out that
three suspects are hiding out in Sudan. It demanded through OAU
that Sudan surrender the three suspects.
</P>
<P>
A resolution, which was adopted by the council unanimously,
called upon Sudan to comply with the requests of OAU without
further delay.
</P>
<P>
Firstly it must undertake immediate action to extradite to
Ethiopia for prosecution the three suspects.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, it must desist from engaging in activities of
assisting, supporting and facilitating terrorist activities and
from giving shelter to terrorist elements.
</P>
<P>
The council also urged the international community to encourage
Sudan to respond fully and effectively to the OAU requests.
</P>
<P>
In an explanation speech to the council before it adopted the
resolution, Sudan's permanent representative to the United
Nations, denied the charges that Sudan was sheltering terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Ali Yassin said his country condemned in the
strongest terms the assassination attempt against the Egyptian
President.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Sudan was always ready to cooperate fully with
with the secretary general of the OAU in accordance with the OAU
and United Nations Charters and the norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun said the Chinese government has always strongly opposed and
condemned acts of terrorism in all its forms, for they not only
endanger innocent lives and social stability, but also pose a
threat to international security.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that the OAU, with the support of the
Security Council, will continue to play its due important role in
bringing about a poor solution to this incident," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that in addressing this act of terrorism as in
other international disputes, the council should be careful,
serious and prudent when taking any actions.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we have reservation on elements in (b) of
operative paragraph 4 of the text calling upon Sudan to desist
from engaging in activities of assisting, supporting and
conniving at terrorist activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Listen to all sides and you will be enlightened; otherwise
you will be benighted," he said, hoping the council to fully
listen to the views of the parties concerned and the OAU and
give play to their role as much as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
urged all Americans in Saudi Arabia to exercise caution and warned
of possible new attacks against American interests there.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Embassy has received new and disturbing reports that
additional attacks may be planned against institutions identified
with the United States and its interests in Saudi Arabia," the
State Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"While these attacks could occur anywhere in the kingdom and
include official as well as unofficial targets, the U.S. Embassy
believes that potential targets in Riyadh are especially at risk
at the present time," the statement added.

On November 13, 1995 in Riyadh, a car bombing killed five
Americans at a building being used by U.S. military personnel to
train the Saudi National Guard.

<P>
The statement urged all Americans in that country to exercise
caution, keep a low profile, reduce travel within Saudi Arabia and

<HEADLINE> UN Extends Mission for Referendum in W. Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council decided today to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO)
until May 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously today, the council
expressed deep concern about the stalemate which has been
hindering the identification process and the consequent lack of
progress towards completion of the Settlement Plan.
</P>
<P>
It called upon both the government of Morocco and the Polisario
Front of Western Sahara to cooperate with Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali and MINURSO in resuming the identification
process, overcoming obstacles hindering completion of that
process, and implementing all other aspects of the Settlement
Plan.
</P>
<P>
Western Sahara in Northwest Africa was taken under Spanish
protection in 1884 and became a Spanish province in 1958. Its
neighbouring countries Morocco and Mauritania pressured Spain to
relinquish the area in the early 1960s and the Polisario Front
fought for independence from 1973. After Spanish withdrew in 1976
and Mauritania signed a treaty with Polisario renouncing its
claims in 1979, Morocco announced annexation of the entire area.
</P>
<P>
With help of U.N. secretary-general and the the Organization of
African Unity, Morocco and Polisario Front signed a document
referred to as the settlement proposals in 1988. According to the
document, the people of Western Sahara would choose between
independence and integration with Morocco in the exercise of their
right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council established MINURSO in 1991 to verify the
case-fire and cessation of hostilities, identify and register
qualified voters; and organize and ensure a free referendum.
</P>
<P>
According to the settlement plan, the referendum in Western
Sahara should have taken place in January 1992. However, the
referendum has been postponed again and and again because of their
differences on voter eligibility, release of political prisoners
and other issues.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Unveils Land Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The South African
department of land affairs today released a comprehensive package
of land reform proposals aimed at wiping out the legacy of
apartheid and creating security of tenure for citizens in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, which include a grant of up to 15000 rand
(about 4100 US dollars) per household to help disadvantaged
groups buy land, were contained in a green paper, or discussion
document.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the document in Cape Town, Land Affairs Minister
Derek Hanekom said he hoped to have a white paper, or final
policy document after a further round of consultations with
provincial ministers of land affairs.
</P>
<P>
"A central concern in making these proposals has been to
translate a broad commitment to social justice and alleviation of
poverty, into a set of concrete programmes, legislation and
procedures," said Hanekom.
</P>
<P>
Major issues facing the department after the release of the
document would include rationalizing the chaotic land
administration of the former homelands, where day-to-day
administration and record keeping had broken down, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
However, the document said the government would not give
priority to people or groups who participated in land invasions,
nor would threats of land invasions be rewarded by special
treatment.

<HEADLINE> Radiation in Dimitrovgrad Normal, Moscow Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1(Xinhua) -- The Russian Atomic Energy
Ministry today described as normal the radiation level in the city
of Dimitrovgrad, about 750 kilometers southeast of Moscow, where
an accident occurred on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the radiation level on the territory of a sanitary
zone of a research institute of nuclear reactors in the city does
not exceed the permissible level and measures 10-20 micro Roentgen
per hour.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry admitted, in the contaminated area of
approximately 200 square meters the radiation level exceeds the
norm by 10-20 times, reaching 250 micro Roentgen per hour.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 11:15 Moscow time (08:15 GMT) on
Wednesday, when a safety precaution valve was activated, reducing
pressure in the reactor which was stopped, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported, adding that a steam-like mixture was discharged
into the atmosphere measuring 100 millicurie, which contaminated
part of the territory of the research complex.
</P>
<P>
Managers of the research complex said that none of the
personnel had been hurt and that there was no immediate threat to
their health. The accident as preliminary assessed as level "one"
on a seven-point international scale of accidents at nuclear power
stations.
</P>
<P>
The after-effects of the accident are being eliminated by the
staff of the research institute responsible for clean-up in
incidents of radioactive contamination, Itar-Tass said. At
present, operations to bury the contaminated snow are being
completed, and the reactor was expected to be put into operation
in a few hours, the news agency noted tonight.

globalization has become an irreversible fact and is very often
made the scapegoat for many social problems".

Shimon Peres, prime ministers of Bosnia, Croatia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, and presidents from Argentina, Mexico and
Peru are among the political leaders attending the Forum.
</P>

Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund are
also present at this year's Forum.
