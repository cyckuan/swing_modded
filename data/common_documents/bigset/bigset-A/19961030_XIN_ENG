<P>
ATHENS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serbs are not
prepared to hand over Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and
former military chief Ratko Mladic to the international court to
be tried as war criminals, Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic
declared today.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic, who is currently visiting northern Greek town of
Salonika at the invitation of a local mayor, said that under
Bosnian Serb law no Bosnian Serb could be extradited for trial.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to corner us but we will overcome these
pressures just like we did earlier," she said.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said that the Dayton accord, "if it is applied to the
letter", was "a good medium-term solution which satisfies many
of the national interests and dreams of the Bosnian Serbs".
</P>
<P>
On the economic reconstruction of the "Serbian Republic of
Bosnia", Plavsic said the war had left a "tragic situation but
that the doors are open to investors from all nations".

<HEADLINE> Sudan Holds Talks with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's Finance Ministry held
talks here today with an International Monetary Fund (IMF)
mission.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the talks focused on assessing
Sudan's economic performance in the coming period in the light of
Sudan's membership of the IMF, as well as the points on which the
two sides failed to come to an agreement in the former rounds of
talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the arrears owed by Sudan to the
IMF and ways of tackling Sudan's budget deficit and freeing the
Sudanese pound exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The IMF annual meeting held early this month with the
participation of Sudan had not resulted in a mechanism for
tackling Sudan's relationship with the fund. However, it
recommended sending a mission to Sudan for more talks with
Sudanese officials.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's talks with the IMF have had a satisfactory
outcome. The IMF has revoked its 1994 resolution imposed on Sudan
demanding a compulsory withdrawal from the fund. The two side
have also agreed to reschedule the debts owed by Sudan to the
IMF, which are estimated at 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Warns of Disease Among Refugees in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) today warned of potential
outbreaks of epidemics in a huge refugee camp near the city of
Goma on the eastern Zaire border, where the Zairean army has been
fighting ethnic Tutsi militias and Rwandan troops.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Panos Moumtzis, UNHCR
spokesman in Goma, as saying that diarrhoea, dysentery and cholera
could break out among the 400,000 refugees in the camp in
Mugumga with the imminent arrival of the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
He said a new camp must be built very quickly before the rainy
season starts.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 refugees, who fled a camp at Kibumba last weekend
after being attacked with artillery by the Rwandan army, have
joined the 200,000 refugees already living in the Mugumga camp,
turning the refugee camp into the largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
About 800,000 Hutu refugees have been living in eastern Zaire
since the summer of 1994, following a genocide committed by the
Hutu army against Tutsis and moderate Hutus in neighboring Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government today appointed two army generals as
governors for the North Kivu and South Kivu provinces in
eastern Zaire bordering Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
But local media reported that the government has completely
lost control over the area, apart from Goma, whose air and land
links with the outside have been cut.
</P>
<P>
Zairean forces have been fighting Banyamulenge rebels, ethnic
Tutsis originally from Rwanda, for months. The Tutsi militia,
allegedly supported by Rwandan troops, have taken the town of
Uvira in North Kivu and are reportedly expected to take Bukavu,
the capital of South Kivu, which has already been abandoned by
both civilians and Zairean troops.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Member States Unhappy with WTO Setup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from some 10
developing countries attending the third forum of the group of 15
business and investment said here today the 21-month old World
Trade Organisation (WTO) has not benefited their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Senegal,
Mexico, Zimbabwe, Indonesia, India and Malaysia said the trade
agreements had failed to achieve fair global trade as they were
too many and too complex for their communities.
</P>
<P>
The forum was discussing the challenges and opportunities of
multilateral trading systems under the world trade agreement in
view of the WTO ministerial meeting scheduled for Singapore in
December.
</P>
<P>
Delegates at the forum expressed concern that many developing
countries had not benefited from the new trends in global trade.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian delegation said developing countries were
confronted with extreme difficulties in undertaking their
commitments to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
''We have to negotiate the future of the WTO very carefully in
view of the fact there are still some aspects of the agreements
which are in favour of the developed countries,'' the Egytian
delegation said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian delegation said while developing countries could
not change the agreements that had already been signed, their
situations would be worse off if more agreements were introduced.
</P>
<P>
The forum precedes the G-15 heads of state summit to be held
from November 3 to 5 in Harare. enditem

<HEADLINE> Discontent Prevails in France over Juppe's Policy: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Discontent over the economic and
social policy of Prime Minister Alain Juppe prevails among French
people, with half of them saying that they support a big movement
of social protest now, according to a poll published today.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three percent of the people polled said that they think
it is possible for France to be governed by a totally different
economic and social policy than the present one of the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Half of the people polled said that if there was a big movement
of social protest today, they would give their support to it,
while 74 percent of them said that they are worried about the
present social and economic climate.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted on October 24-26 on 990 people by the BVA
polling institution, also showed that 42 percent of French people
feel threatened by unemployment, as is compared with 38 percent in
September 1993.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven percent of the French people don't believe that the
country's economy will grow in 1997, while 89 percent said that
their primary concern is their economic situation, according to
the poll, which will appear in the Paris Match weekly on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-four percent of the people polled said that the risk
now for France to have a large-scale social movement comparable to
that in late 1995 is big or very big, and 18 percent of them said
that they would actively participate in such a movement.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Russia Aims to Strengthen Its Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's current Mideast tour is aimed at activating
the peace process and strengthening the Russian role as
co-sponsor of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Monday evening, Primakov held a round of talks with his Syrian
counterpart Farouq al-Shara on international and regional
developments, and the future of the Middle East peace process in
the light of the Israeli government's intransigent stances.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here believed that the Russian minister,
seeking Russia's bigger role in the peace process, will stress
positions which are rather close to those of the Arabs and the
European Union on the basis of the Madrid conference decisions
and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Primakov will also seek to join hands with Europe in the
search for a role in the peace-making process on the grounds that
Russia has old relations with the Arab world, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister will offer several ideas for the
resumption of the peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks, with the participation of the U.S., Europe and Russia in
an effort to rescue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister has emphasized the necessity of
Israel's commitment to agreements signed by the previous Labor
government, and to international legitimacy resolutions. He has
also asserted Russia's concern about ensuring stability and
security in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, political observers are of the view that while
Primakov's tour will be favorably welcomed by the Arab states, it
will not find similar appreciation in Israel on account of
Israel's rejection of European and Russian roles which, in fact,
will create equity and balance with the U.S. role.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Russian role together with the
European one will constitute a factor of pressure on Israel, the
observers said.

<HEADLINE> India Proposes to Set Up G-15 Confederation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- India has proposed that the
group of 15 developing countries establishes a confederation of
industry and business organisations to promote south-south trade,
investment and technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, read at the third meeting of the G-15 business
and investment forum (BIF) today in Harare, said the
confederation would provide input into existing G-15 trade
promotion bodies such as the Committee on Investment, Trade and
Technology (CITT) and the BIF.
</P>
<P>
''The activities of the confederation would also result in
closer direct interaction and cooperation among business
representatives in the G-15 countries,'' the proposal said.
</P>
<P>
Indian delegates said the establishment of the confederation
would improve networking among businesses from member countries
and also the current poor communication between business
communities in member countries.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the meeting, who is the chief executive of the
Zimbabwean national trade promotion body, Morrison Sifelani said
some countries had expressed reservations, saying the
confederation would be duplication of activities already done by
the CITT, which was formed last year.
</P>
<P>
Many delegates said they needed more time to consider the
proposal before making recommendations. enditem

JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland has signed a
tri-lateral memorandum of understanding with South Africa and
Mozambique, committing itself as a partner in the
multi-billion-Dollar Maputo Corridor Project, said reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Swaziland's Capital Mbabane, Swazi

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Deputy Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan today urged the Japanese government to make
further efforts to resolve the problems which have strained
bilateral relations recently.
</P>
<P>
Tang was speaking during a meeting with Japanese Foreign
Minister Yukihiko Ikeda on the sidelines of the annual round of
Sino-Japanese deputy foreign ministerial talks.
</P>
<P>
Tang said strains in bilateral ties were caused by Japan and he
called on the Japanese government to take a reasonable attitude in
accordance with the Sino-Japanese joint statement signed in 1972 and
the 1978 Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said at the meeting that Japan will make further efforts
to resolve the dispute over a chain of islands in the East China
Sea, although there are still differences between China and Japan
over the ownership of the Diaoyu islands.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said the Japanese rightists' actions on the islands ran
counter to the Japanese government's stand on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda added that Japan is willing to continue its commitment to
promoting friendship between Japan and China in accordance with
their joint statement and the treaty of peace and friendship.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Japanese government and the ruling coalition
will follow the historical stand adopted by the cabinet of former
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama -- to recognize, self-examine and
apologize for Japan's military aggression during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
On China's Taiwan issue, the Japanese foreign minister said it
should be settled through consultation between the Chinese people
on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, adding that foreign countries
have no right to interfere.
</P>
<P>
Tang was attending the annual deputy foreign ministerial level
talks with Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Shunji Yanai and other
officials. Japan and China last held deputy foreign ministerial
consultations in Beijing in March 1995.

<HEADLINE> Unions Protest Privatization of Thomson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Several French national trade
unions protested today against the government's plan to privatize
state-owned electronics giant Thomson.
</P>
<P>
The unions lobbied the annual executive board meeting of the
company to protest at what they called the sellout of the company
to Matra Defense Espace group and South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.
</P>
<P>
Union officials said a nationwide protest will be staged on
November 20 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The unions, including the main CGT, CFDT, CFTC and FO
organizations, complained that the government is selling Thomson
without any consultation with the staff of the state-owned group.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the executive board, the CFDT accused
the government of selling out Thomson as "a gift to their buddies
who are close to the government," referring to the Jean-Luc
Lagardere group which is buying all the shares in Thomson.
</P>
<P>
Lagardere will carve Thomson up into a defense corporation,
which will join up with Matra Defense Espace, and a civilian
electronics group to be bought by Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
The CGT said that although it does not oppose privatization in
principle, it opposes the sale of French companies to an Asian
company such as Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
The union said the purchase of Thomson Multimedia, the civilian
part of Thomson, will provide Daewoo with a vehicle to penetrate
the European and United States markets.

Rwandan and Burundi refugees in eastern Zaire due to intensified
ethnic fighting there, and described their situation as
"desperate".
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the government army and ethnic Tutsi rebels
has spread northwards to Bukavu from Uvira. There are reports of
widespread looting there, and of burning of refugee camps, Ruth
Marshall, a spokeswoman of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR staff heard machine gunfire continuing in Bukavu across
from the Rwandan border area of Cyangugu. Marshall also said that
UNHCR is talking with Zairian authorities in Kinshasa to get
security guarantee for delivery of relief to refugees and
displaced Zairians.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has currently only access to the two camps of Lac Vert
and Mugunga, north to Goma. The two camps now host up to 400,000
people, including all the 200,000 refugees from nearby Kibymba
camp who arrived after an attack on Friday night, as well as
10,000 displaced Zairians.
</P>
<P>
According to Marshall, relief agencies are distributing food
stocks to refugees in the camps. The warehouse of the UN World
Food Program (WFP) in Kibymba was looted during the Friday attack,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was also reported in Katale and Kahindo camp, north to
Kibymba, she added, which however did not seem to have caused
movements of refugees there, 315,000 in all.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also expressed concern about the fate of nearly
500,000 refugees and displaced Zairians over the border area, who
fled the fighting in Uvira and Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has no idea where exactly these people are and how they
are, she said.
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, about 3,000 Zairians have crossed into Rwanda
seeking refuge, who are housed in university buildings. Marshall
said just over 1,000 Rwandan refugees have arrived in Rwanda,
staying now in transit camp.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman urged the governments in the region to move to
tackle the crisis in eastern Zaire before situation coming out of
control. UNHCR is acutely worried about the situation there, she
said.
</P>
<P>
It is the rainy season in Zaire. Refugees and displaced people
are cut off without food, hundreds of thousands of them are on the
road fleeing violent fightings, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The over 1 million refugees housed in 40 UN camps along border
in eastern Zaire are mainly Hutu, in particular Rwandan Hutu. Over
last three years, hundreds of thousands of people had been killed
in fightings between Hutu and Tutsi in neighbouring Rwanda and
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
From the refugee camps in Zaire, militant Hutu have launched
attacks on the Tutsi-led governments in Burundi and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Violent armed conflict broke out last month in eastern Zaire
after Banyamulenge, the ethnic Tutsi who have been living there
for over 200 years, began to fight against attacks from Zairian
government army.
</P>
<P>
UN spokeswoman in Geneva Tuesday said that UN Secretary-General
Boutros-Boutros Ghali has decided to send a mediator to try to
resolve the crisis in eastern Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Labor Costs in U.S. Rose Moderately in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. employment costs grew
by a moderate 2.8 percent in the 12 months ended in September,
slightly less than for the year ended in June, the U.S. Labor
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The index is regarded as the best measure of labor costs, which
represent two-thirds of the price of a product in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said that the 2.8 percent cost increase
during the 12 months ended in September was down from 2.9 percent
during the year ended in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Wages and salaries were up by 3.2 percent, the same as during
the 12-month period ended in June and the highest since an
identical gain in March 1992. Benefit cost increases remained
unchanged at 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the third quarter, total compensation rose 0.6 percent,
compared with 0.8 percent in the second and the smallest gain
since a 0.6 percent increase in the third quarter of 1995. Wages
and salaries also rose 0.6 percent, unchanged from the previous
quarter and the lowest since a 0.4 percent increase in the third
quarter of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Costs had advanced 2.8 percent in the period ended in March and
2.7 percent in the 12 months ended in both September and December
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
While pay represents about three-fourths of total compensation
in the U.S., many analysts contend the index provides a better
gauge of inflation than a monthly report on average hourly
earnings because the index also includes benefit increases.
</P>
<P>
There has been anecdotal evidence in recent months of growing
tightness in the labor markets, particularly for skilled workers,
that some fear could lead to increased demand for higher pay and
expanded benefits.
</P>
<P>
Consumer inflation was rising at a 3.2 percent annual rate
during the first nine months of the year. The Consumer Price Index
rose 2.5 percent in 1995, the smallest since inching up 1.1
percent in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Hungary's Socialist Lawmakers to Disclose Property Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Socialist lawmakers
must disclose their own and family members' property and any jobs
they hold in companies or their linkages to any foundations before
November 30, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nyers Rezso, chairmen of the ruling Socialist Party's Central
Disciplinary Committee, said the regulation will help Socialist
congressmen and women remain clean and honest and make it
impossible for them to seek personal benefit by abusing their
power.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party was caught in a scandal after the State
Property Privatization and Management Company was accused in
September of having illegally shifted 800 million forints (about
5.2 million U.S. dollars) into the bank account of a lawyer named
Tocsik Marta.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have demanded the resignation of the
Hungarian government over the scandal, described by the nation's
media as the biggest in the privatization process in eastern
European countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said here today that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu was "very possibly to resort to military aggression
against Lebanon and Syria."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was "in the worst situation" since he came to office
last June, and was seeking the way to go out of this situation,
the foreign minister said during an interview with Milhem Karam,
President of the Lebanese Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu is now in the worst situation of an Israeli prime
minister," Boueiz was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister was "seeking an outlet, which even
Netanyahu himself does not know, and it may be an aggression on
Syria or an aggression on Lebanon," the foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz underlined the importance of European participation in
the Middle East peace process, saying that the role of the United
States in the peace process would not be hurt because of Europe's
presence in it.

<HEADLINE> World Seaborne Trade Reached New Record in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Continuing a ten-year growth
trend, world seaborne trade increased by 3.7 percent in 1995,
reaching a new record volume of 4.65 billion tons, the UN
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Review of Maritime Transport released
by UNCTAD on Tuesday, the growth in seaborne trade volume in 1995
was primarily generated by a strong demand for dry bulk cargoes,
in particular grain, iron ore and coal, and to a lesser extent on
growing volumes of general cargoes, mainly manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
Growth in oil cargoes was more modest than in dry bulk cargoes
with an increase of only 2.3 percent in the crude oil sector and
1.8 percent in the products trade.
</P>
<P>
The share of developing countries of cargo loaded remained
virtually unchanged at 50.6 percent while their share of cargo
unloaded was stable at 26.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Review also showed that the world merchant fleet continued
to expand, to 734.9 million deadweight tons (dwt) by the end of
1995. Developing countries expanded their fleet to 137.5 million
dwt, representing 18.7 percent of the world fleet, as compared to
18.5 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD shipping analysts commended that some of the chronic
structural problems and qualitative deficiencies that have long
plagued developing countries' shipping could be partly remedied
through investment in container tonnage.
</P>
<P>
Qualitative improvements have been observed particularly in the
liner sector, bringing the share of developing countries' shipping
in efficient container tonnage to 17.2 percent, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
However, they also pointed out that regional structures remain
problematic and unbalanced. Container tonnage is concentrated in
Asian developing countries who own 13.5 percent of world tonnage,
while African developing countries own virtually no container
tonnage at all.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Hopes for Closer Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister Goran
Persson said today his country wants to establish closer ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, speaking to Scandinavian-based Chinese
journalists ahead of his visit to China next week, said he was
looking forward to the visit, because China's role in
international affairs is becoming increasingly important and its
economy is developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in China from November 2 to 7, Persson will
hold talks on political issues with the Chinese leaders and seek
to promote trade relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
It is important for Sweden, which has always been in favor of
free trade, to set up contacts with China's growing economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Many Swedish companies are actively involved in the Chinese
market and a large number of business executives will be with him
during the visit.
</P>
<P>
"We need contact and dialogue, we need discussion and
exchange of views. They are important to us," said the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Most European leaders have visited China and developing
relations with China has become a growing trend in Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore it is natural for me to visit China."
</P>
<P>
Persson said he will also discuss international issues with
Chinese leaders, such as the reform of the United Nations,
Sino-Russian relations and Swedish-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has been elected a non-permanent member of the
U.N. Security Council and will thus become more active in
international affairs. Therefore, it needs dialogue with China as
well as with the United States and Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister proposed spurring science and technology
cooperation with China by increasing Swedish investment in China
and expanding exchanges between scientific institutions of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Persson said he is satisfied with the current state of
Sino-Swedish relations and is optimistic about their future
development.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Blames US for Deliberately Delaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi official source said
here today that the U.S. government is still creating obstacles
in the way of implementing the oil-for-food memorandum of
understanding signed by Iraq and the U.N. in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted the unidentified source as
saying that Nicholas Burns, spokesman of the U.S. state
department, does not have the courage to say the truth concerning
the Iraqi issues.
</P>
<P>
According to the INA, Burns said in a statement Monday that
the U.S. government is concerned with the suffering of the Iraqi
people under more than six years of U.N. embargo imposed on the
country for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The statement is but a
defensive and misleading stance of the U.S., the source said. '
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.N. Secretariat General and all members of
the Security Council except America have made great efforts for
facilitating the implementation of the oil memorandum. But the
U.S. government is deliberately delaying it by creating various
obstacles among which comes the pretext that it needs much time
to study measures of implementation and mechanism of oil
pricing, it added.
</P>
<P>
It said that more than five months have passed since the
memorandum was signed and the U.S. administration is still
studying means of implementation and mechanism of pricing without
showing a clear-cut opinion to the U.N. sanctions committee, a
thing that means that the U.S. is adopting a policy aiming to
harm the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Under the May 20 Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food pact, Iraq is allowed
to sell oil worth 2 billion U.S. dollars in a six-month period in
exchange for desperately needed food, medicine and other
essential humanitarian items for its sanctions-hit population.

BEIRUT,October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who arrived in Beirut from Damascus this afternoon on
the second leg of his Middle East tour, stressed his country's
support for U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport, the
Russian foreign minister noted that "Lebanon has participated in
the Middle East peace process, and Russia will provide (help) for
the implementation of Resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon, which has been occupied by the Jewish state
since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was met at the airport by Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz, and the two foreign ministers drove together to the
Lebanese Foreign Ministry where they started official talks.
</P>
<P>
"The problem in south Lebanon should be solved by peaceful
means and through the Israeli withdrawal and the provision of
security for all the countries," the Russian foreign minister
noted.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that his country would help Lebanon for its
independence, sovereignty and a peace of its land.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Russian-Lebanese relations as "very good," he
expected that he would have a lot of talks with his Lebanese
counterpart, as well as Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and House
Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Lebanese foreign minister noted that Russia
has followed for years "a position supporting the rights of the
Arab peoples and the Arab causes."
</P>
<P>
"In this way we look at Russia, and in this way we hope for a
return of Russia's role to this region to correct the balance and
to correct the defect which recently took place in this region,"
Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia has a "basical role," and "we believe that
this role should come back in order to contribute to finding a
just and comprehensive settlement."
</P>
<P>
After talks in the Foreign Ministry, Primakov is due to hold
meetings this evening with the Lebanese president and house
speaker and he will leave this country Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
After Lebanon, Primakov will also visit Egypt, Jordan, Israel
and the Palestinian self-rule areas.

MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chairman of the Federation
Council (the upper house of Russian parliament), Yegor Stroyev,
and visiting Moldovan parliament speaker Pyor Luchinsky signed
here today an agreement on cooperation between the two countries'
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
The document provides for "smoother and better organized
development of good relations, the parliaments' striving for
timely ratification of joint documents, and rapprochement of
Russian and Moldovan legislation, especially economic laws without
which economies won't work," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan parliament chief will also sign the agreement later
with Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of the State Duma, the lower
house of Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
Luchinsky, who arrived here earlier today for an official
visit, also met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on bilateral relations between the two former Soviet
republics, Stroyev said "mutual interests of Russia and Moldova
are great, they were outlined by our ancestors back in the Peter
the Great times or even before that."
</P>
<P>
These mutual interests include the southern borders and the
common economic space "for which several generations have spilled
so much blood," he added.
</P>
<P>
Luchinsky said, in his part, that "we will return to many good
deeds, but on a new basis." "We are an independent country, but
people's interests and strivings do not change and politicians
must help their fulfillment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign policy concept, which has been approved by the
(Moldovan) parliament, says relations with Russia are a priority
of the Moldovan foreign policy," the Moldovan speaker stated.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Hopes for "Crucial Starting Point" in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said here this evening that he hoped the next stage
would constitute a "crucial starting-point" to resume the Mideast
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped Israel would not launch aggression against Syria
and Lebanon, believing progresses should be achieved in the
Middle East peace process on all its tracks.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the end of his meeting with
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz, Primakov said he hoped
that there would not be "an Israeli aggression against Syria on
the Syrian or Lebanese lands, or an aggression against Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
After the talks in the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, Primakov
went to the Presidential Palace and is holding a meeting with
President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister declined to disclose contents of
the suggestions which he brought to Lebanon on how to re-start
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the suggestions should not be revealed because he
wanted "to reach a result."
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted that since the 1991 Madrid conference on the
Middle East peace, "there is not anything big achieved and it is
important to continue the peace negotiations, and it is undoubted
that a stalemate has taken place in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Primakov expressed a surprise on an allegation that his
country wanted to adopt a role in the region against that of the
United States, and denied that he had heard of an European
intention to take the place of Russia in sponsoring the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States co-sponsored the Arab-Israeli
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz, on the other hand, stressed his country's commitment
to a continuity of the peace process in the region, underlining
that this process "should be on the basis agreed upon in the
Madrid peace conference."
</P>
<P>
He urged Russia to play an "effective role" in the peace
process, and praised Russia's position supporting Lebanon in the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official announced that during the talks, he and
Primakov discussed the situation in the Middle East, especially
the peace process "which is currently deadlocked." He said that
Primakov informed him about Russia's readiness to "play a full
role in the region."
</P>
<P>
He added that the two sides also discussed issues pertaining
to the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
They signed a protocol of cooperation between the two
countries, "which constitutes a starting-point to organize the
economic ties between Lebanon and Russia," Boueiz told the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister arrived in Beirut form Damascus
this afternoon, on the second leg of his tour in the region.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport, the
Russian foreign minister noted that "Russia will provide (help)
for the implementation of Resolution 425" which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The problem in south Lebanon should be solved by peaceful
means and through the Israeli withdrawal and the provision of
security for all the countries," the Russian foreign minister
noted.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that his country would help Lebanon for its
independence, sovereignty and a peace of its land.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is due to leave this country Wednesday morning for
Cairo to continue his tour of the region, which will also take
him to Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Coordinated UN Efforts Called for Solving Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government favors
coordinated efforts by the U.N. Security Council's five
permanent member states toward a Cyprus solution, government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the five (member-states) to coordinate their
actions and brief each other on efforts for a Cyprus settlement,
if joint action is not an option for them," the spokesman said at
his daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides was commenting on statements made earlier today
by Russian Ambassador to Cyprus Boris Zenkov that the Cyprus
problem is diverted away from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides, Zenkov said
current initiatives are not coordinated and stressed that the
U.N. Security Council should be the only body to coordinate such
initiatives for a resolution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that efforts on Cyprus abroad are at an
early stage. Since the U.S. initiative has not yet been
launched, "we expect this coordination to be more evident once
these efforts are intensified", he added.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides also noted that "excellent" relations exist
between Cyprus and Russia and the Cyprus government expects from
the U.N. Security Council's five permanent states "a just and
correct" treatment in their efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has been divided into two
parts with the Turkish Cypriots in the north and the Greek
Cypriots in the south since 1974 when Turkey troops intervened in
northern Cyprus, following a short-lived coup seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Monitor Malta's EU Accession Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has adopted a
wait-and-see policy following the change of government in Malta
and pre-election pledges by the Labor Party that the country's
application for membership of the European Union (EU) might be
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus' accession course for EU membership will continue
irrespective of developments in Malta," President Glafcos
Clerides said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that "one must not rush into any
conclusions, despite Labor Party's pre-election position which
raised serious doubts about Malta's accession course."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Malta applied for EU membership in 1990. The EU
decided on March 6, 1995 to start membership talks with both
countries six months after the EU Inter-governmental conference.
</P>
<P>
In his comments on the issue, government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said the government would be monitoring developments
in Malta's accession course.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in Malta as a Mediterranean country and a
candidate for EU accession," said Cassoulides at his daily press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
However, he said "our application for accession to the EU has
no relation with any other application by a prospective candidate
country."

<HEADLINE> Intergrated Sign Language Education Proposed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- African countries have
been urged to establish an intergrated sign language education
policy to better serve the deaf in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The Chairperson of the Tanzania Association for the Deaf, Lupi
Maswanya, made the call today at a five-day regional conference
held in Arusha, northern Tanzania, for deaf women in east and
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper on obstacles to deaf women's development in
Africa, Maswanya suggested that "the intergrated education policy
that will combine the deaf and non-deaf children will be a
solution to the problem."
</P>
<P>
She said that the education level provided to the deaf in
Africa is very low compared with the service for other disabled
people.
</P>
<P>
"We also face problems in securing employment as most
employers have negative attitude towards the deaf, hence no
willing to employ us," she explained.
</P>
<P>
The conference, officially opened yesterday, was attended by
70 delegates from Botswana, Kenya, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Sweden, Swaziland,
Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the host Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Hopes for Signing of Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Newly named European
Union's special envoy to the Middle East Miguel Angel Morations
said here today he hoped an Israel-Palestine agreement on the
Hebron issue will be signed soon.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Israel Radio, Morations, current
Spanish Ambassador to Israel, expressed his hope that the
agreement would be signed when Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat returns from his European tour Friday.
</P>
<P>
Morations paid tribute to the Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators, as well as U.S. special Middle East coordinator
Dennis Ross, who had worked hard to reach an agreement over the
past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
On the EU role in the peace process, the ambassador said he
would try to establish close contact with all parties to the
process, so as to make sure that the EU could contribute in a
"much positive way."
</P>
<P>
"I will first get contact with them in a positive and
constructive manner," he said, adding he would not want to
interfere in the ongoing negotiations on the Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would explain to Israel, which, together
with the U.S., rejected a bigger EU role in the peace process,
that the EU wants to work with all parties in achieving peace and
security in the region.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the EU named Morations to be its special envoy to
the region at a meeting of the foreign ministers of the
15-nation bloc held in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers gave Morations a mandate to observe the
peace process, establish relations with Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators and to report on possible EU actions.
</P>
<P>
EU officials said Morations, who is currently also director
of Spain's Institute for Cooperation with Africa and the Middle
East, was a very knowledgeable diplomat with years of experience
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Abel Matutes said that by
sending a special envoy, the EU did not intend "to be against
somebody, but to be there just for peace, in a complementary role
of the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed to appoint an envoy at their special summit
in Dublin, capital of Ireland, on October 5, in an effort to seek
to play a greater role in the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Lacks Skilled Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Lack of skilled laborers is the
greatest challenge facing Zambia, a Zambian official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Mark O'donnel, chairman of Zambia Association of
Manufacturers, said that most of the labor force of Zambia is
unproductive.
</P>
<P>
At a one-day workshop to discuss the reintroduction of the
apprenticeship scheme in the country, O'donnel said the only
labor that Zambia can boast about is unskilled labor which is
already adversely affecting the productivity of the manufacturing
industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
This has made business in Zambia very difficult as levels of
productivity are no longer comparable to those of the trading
partners, he said.
</P>
<P>
The flooding of imported products on the Zambian markets could
only be corrected by equiping people with the right skills in
various sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
O'donnel argued the problem could be solved through the
reintroduction of the apprenticeship scheme which was scrapped in
the mid 1970's.

<HEADLINE> Israel Working on Formula to Resume Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said today Israel is working on a formula for
resuming peace talks with Syria, which he warned against taking
any military actions.
</P>
<P>
Levy also talked about the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and
Israeli-U.S. relations in a speech to the Knesset (Parliament)
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
The minister criticized some members of the government for
making statements on the war possibility with Syria. Israeli
officials recently claimed that Syria might have changed its
strategy toward Israel by planning a limited military attack.
</P>
<P>
"If I was outside of the government, I would be terrified,"
Levy said.
</P>
<P>
Saying it would be impossible to achieve full peace in the
Middle East without making peace with Syria, Levy stressed that
his government intended to pursue peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
He added Israel was working on a formula to resume
negotiations with Damascus, but did not elaborate. He called on
his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara to hold talks with him at
any time in any place.
</P>
<P>
Repeating the warnings issued by other senior Israeli
officials, Levy said that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad should
understand Syria would lose if it resorted to a limited military
option in order to get the stalled peace process going.
</P>
<P>
He said that Assad had reasons to be disappointed with Israel
even during the rule under the previous Labor government, which
reportedly made verbal commitments to fully withdraw troops from
the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau Israeli captured from
Syria during the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Levy indicated the current government would not be bound by
the Labor government's verbal commitments, despite that the
U.S. seemed to encourage that impression.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Levy pointed out that
no matter how reluctant, the government had to pursue the Oslo
process by implementing the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the government halted the Oslo process, the
results would be "very dangerous" for its standing: "a collapse
of expectations along with disappointment and great tension in
the region and Israel's international relations."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that to keep the campaign promises, the
government would not abandon the Jewish settlers in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government is in distress, and that's the whole
truth. It's walking on the path it did not want.... Taking a
middle road between our heart desire and the difficult objective
situation will not satisfy either side," he said.
</P>
<P>
Levy criticized Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for creating
"an international drama" even during the days of the previous
government. He predicted that Israel would face a tough task
ahead to settle the dispute over the status of Jerusalem, over
which the Israeli government has vowed never to compromise its
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Levy also acknowledged the dispute between Israel and the
U.S., saying he expected more in the future. However, he added
that his government would work to preserve the important ties
with Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of
the State Duma (the lower house of Russian parliament), today
stressed the need to revise Russia's entire system of economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference of local lawmakers, Seleznyov said:
"Government head Viktor Chernomyrdin has agreed to the arguments
of the Duma deputies and is ready to take appropriate steps."
</P>
<P>
"We must revise the entire system of economic policy and help
the enterprises whose products are competitive to rise first of
all," the Duma speaker said.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, "it is necessary to break down all enterprises
into categories, including agricultural, and help the most
promising enterprises to pull out of the crisis as soon as
possible and draw up specific plans for their growth in the next
three or four years."
</P>
<P>
The conference held in the Voronezh city was discussing a bill
concerning the general principles of organization of state power
in the component parts of the Russian Federation, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Pavel Bunich, chairman of the Duma Committee fo Property,
Privatization and Economy, said today in Moscow that his committee
had drawn up a new bill on the privatization of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 55 percent of the state-owned property, in
terms of its cost, were privatized so far.This figure will grow to
70 percent within the next three years, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, privatization will this time cover all the
enterprises that are willing to undergo this process, except those
whose privatization is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
"This privatization will be done for money," Bunich stressed,
adding that "anybody who has money will be able to buy the shares
of such enterprises."
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility of bankrupt enterprises
being reprivatized.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Government to Buy More Land for Landless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Land Reform
Commission of the Namibian government today decided to buy more
land for the resettlement of thousands of landless people.
</P>
<P>
Radio Namibia reported 29 farms have already been evaluated,
ready for possible buying by the government for its resettlement
program.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Land, Resettlement
and Rehabilitation, Joseph Itha, told the radio that negotiations
are taking place with farm owners on selling prices.
</P>
<P>
The Land Reform Commission met today in Windhoek, he said,
adding 12 farms have been bought during the 1995/96 financial
year, with a combined area of 53,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 landless and displaced Namibians have been given
land under the government's resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
The program was launched by the government soon after
independence in 1990 to restore land to black Namibians forced
out of their homeland by the colonial system of apartheid South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa illegally occupied Namibia until its national
independence six years ago following the United Nations

<HEADLINE> Public Opinion Favors Milosevic's Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic is the most trustworthy among Yugoslav politicians, a
public opinion poll conducted recently in Yugoslavia has said.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five percent of the 1,520 polled people in Yugoslavia
said they would vote for the candidates of the joint coalition
consisting of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) headed by
Milosevic, Yugoslav United Left (JUL) and the New Democracy (ND),
the Social Sciences Institute of Belgrade University said on
Tuesday after conducting the poll ahead of the November 3
elections for Federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
JUL, which rallies left-wing parties, and ND, current SPS
coalition partner in the republican parliament, will take part in
the upcoming elections together with the ruling SPS.
</P>
<P>
During the poll, 30 percent opted for the opposition coalition
Zajedno (Together), Director of the institute Dragomir Pantic said
at a press conference in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Zajedno coalition, which will also run for the
parliament elections, is made up of the Serbian Renewal Movement
(SPO), the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), the Democratic Party
and the Civic Alliance of Serbia (GSS).
</P>
<P>
Pantic said the creation of the two major coalitions has
simplified the political scene in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
He added that the left coalition has the advantage because it
"covers a widespread field of political orientations, ranging from
the center to the extreme left wing, which are the political
orientations of two-thirds of the electorate."
</P>
<P>
Pantic said that the left-wing coalition had achieved a
significant step forward in the structure of the electorate,
compared to the previous elections, as more young and educated
people are opting for it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prof. Zoran Slavujevic assessed the political
marketing of certain parties at the press conference, saying SPS
had achieved the biggest effect with its long-term campaign.
Second is JUL with attractive and easily communicable election
commercials, while the opposition parties are lagging far behind.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that in the period from October 5-15, 39
percent of the electorate of Serbia said they would abstain from
voting, and 61 percent said they would cast their votes,
Slavujevic said.

"Yugoslavia's IMF membership does not depend on the regulation
of relations between Yugoslavia and the United Nations, nor on the
succession talks," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.N.-imposed sanctions have been formally lifted
by a resolution of the U.N. Security Council recently, Yugoslavia
has not yet been admitted to the U.N. General Assembly nor to many
key international financial institutions, including the IMF and
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Trbojevic said he expected Yugoslavia's membership in the Paris
and London clubs to be resolved within the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ratko Banovic, another vice-governor of the National Bank, said
after the same session that the continuation of positive economic
trends and the expansion of production could be expected next
year.
</P>
<P>
"The country's financial system should be rationalized to
render it more flexible and efficient" so as to solve the banking
problems and make economic development faster, he said.
</P>
<P>
Banovic said that the instruments of the monetary regulation
should be more marketable, meaning that the National Bank of
Yugoslavia will intervene on the financial market and control
currency circulation."

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: Jerusalem Is Key to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29(Xinhua) -- Resolving the problem of
Jerusalem is the key to realize peace in the Middle East,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today.
</P>
<P>
No peace could be realized in the Middle East unless the
Palestinians set up their own state with Jerusalem as their
capital, Moussa told a symposium on Jerusalem in session at the
University of Assiut, southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read out on his behalf, Moussa said the Israeli
attempts to Judaize Jerusalem will never alter the world stance
and resolutions of the international legitimacy that view such
attempts null and void.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid, in an
address delivered on his behalf, said the Israeli intransigence
and inconsistence toward peace is eating into its gains from the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The benefits Israel has attained through the peace process
since the Madrid peace conference in 1991 constitute wider
international recognition, expanded volume of exports and larger
economic growth, Meguid said
</P>
<P>
But its recalcitrant stance toward peace has brought about
many economic difficulties, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Should Israel seek to realize regional cooperation it should
see that such cooperation is solidly linked to the solution of
the various political issues that remain pending in regard to the
Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium, under the title "Jerusalem: history
and future," organized by the Assuit University Center for Future
Studies, opened in the southern Egyptian city of Assuit.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Al Husseini, member of the PLO Executive Committee and
in charge of the Jerusalem file at the Palestinian Authority,
appealed for Arab financial assistance for Jerusalem so that it
may be able to combat the Judaization attempts, which he said run
counter to the city's residential reality.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Welcome Greater European Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein today
shared views with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on a greater
European role in the Middle East politics, complementary to that
of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
King Hussein said at a joint press conference with Mubarak
that Europe can play a role in view of its geological affinity
and historical links to the region, as well as its interest in
seeing peace prevail.
</P>
<P>
Europe is not seeking a role clashing with that of the U.S.,
but rather a complementary one envisaging the advancement of
peace, said Hussein, who arrived in the Egyptian Red Sea resort
of Sharm el-Sheikh for a lightning visit today.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak concurred the idea and added that Washington has
exerted much effort since the launch of peace negotiations and
has been playing a vital role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We both fear that the whole peace march could be blown up if
the present situation remains as this," Mubarak said at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king said the meeting provided a good chance to
exchange views with the president and to brief him on the outcome
of the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, conceding that a tense atmosphere hangs over the
region, appealed to all to proceed along the peace path. He
blamed the extremists for having sabotaged the peace process and
brought about the current conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government reportedly has decided to increase the
defense army budget by 1 billion U.S. dollars in anticipation of
a likely confrontation with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the upcoming economic conference for the Middle
East and North Africa, the monarch said he will not attend in
person but Jordanian businessmen will participate.
</P>
<P>
"We do this with a view to ensuring the success of future
economic conferences and regional integration, as well as
providing an opportunity for coming generations to enjoy a life
denied us till now," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that the conference will be an opportunity for
enhancing investment, creating new jobs and increasing production.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the two Arab countries that have forged
diplomatic ties with Israel, have been in constant consultations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Hussein had a phone call Monday evening and set a
summit today.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that military means can not solve the
problem in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with delegates attending the Regional Conference
on Afghanistan, he said, "Iran seeks no selfish interests to
host the regional conference."
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president stressed that Iran hopes warring
factions in Afghanistan will resolve their own problems through
peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
During the 10-minute meeting, Rafsanjani called for help from
regional countries and Europe for settlement of the Afghan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran was very distressed over the bloody
fighting in the neighboring country of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his thanks to the delegates from eight
countries and four international organizations for attending the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference opened here this morning in a bid to
explore ways of finding solution to the problem of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Russia, China, Turkey, India, Tajikistan,
Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Iran as well as envoys of the United
Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the
European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe are present at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is showing increasing alarm at the recent military
victories of the Taliban forces in Afghanistan, criticizing the
group as "puppets" of the United States and urging a coalition
government in Kabul that would include all Afghan factions.
</P>
<P>
Senior religious leaders have also questioned the Taliban's
Islamic credentials, saying the group's allegedly reactionary and
fossilized policies are giving Islam a bad name.

<HEADLINE> Date For Yeltsin's Heart Operation to be Set Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The date for Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's heart surgery is likely to be fixed at a meeting
of his doctors, including U.S. heart surgeon Michael DeBakey, next
week, a Kremlin spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from his office in Houston, Texas, DeBakey, who is
consulting with Kremlin doctors on preparations for Yeltsin's
multiple heart bypass operation, said on Tuesday that Yeltsin
might undergo surgery as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
His assessment was strengthened by Yury Korgonyuk, analyst at
INDEM, a Moscow-based think tank, who said on the same day that
according to information at his disposal, a team of doctors would
perform the triple or quadruple bypass operation between November
5 and 11.
</P>
<P>
These comments came amid growing signs that the Kremlin was
accelerating the pace of preparations for the surgery, which had
been tentatively scheduled for mid to late November.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky
announced that all of Yeltsin's appointments for next week would
be cancelled to allow the president to devote his time to getting
ready for the operation.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin on Tuesday released a bulletin on the president's
health saying that Yeltsin needed complete rest to enable his
doctors to bring him "to the highest possible peak of his
physical and psychological powers."
</P>
<P>
With Yeltsin out of the spotlight indefinitely, his chief of
staff, Anatoly Chubais, has moved to extend his hold on the reins
of power. On Tuesday, he told reporters here that the Kremlin
needed more power to deal with potentially rebellious regions.

<HEADLINE> Central and Eastern European Firms Having Tough Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two thirds of private
companies operating in the market economies of 11 Central and
Eastern European countries face major difficulties in surviving
and developing, a new survey showed today.
</P>
<P>
More than half the 3.4 million companies set up before
September last year, are having problems with production and 40
percent are having problems selling their goods, a survey by
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office reported.
</P>
<P>
The most common problems facing companies are tough
competition, lack of resources, lack of skilled labor or
technology, difficulty in getting credit facilities and delays and
defaults in customer payments.
</P>
<P>
These problems are making it difficult for businesses to
expand, the survey reported. Some 65 percent of companies said
they had not made any investment in 1995 and only 17 percent had
invested more than 10 percent of their turnover.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered 11 countries including Poland, the Czech
Republic, Bulgaria, Albania and Latvia and was based on a sample
of companies on national business registers.

<HEADLINE> Late French Defense Minister Accused of Spying for KGB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Former French defense minister
Charles Hernu was accused of spying for the Soviet Union and other
Eastern Bloc states in 1950s and 1960s, the weekly L'Express
revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Hernu, who died in 1990, served as defense minister under
Socialist President Francois Mitterrand from 1981 to 1985. The
weekly magazine said he was paid for at least 10 years by the
secret services of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Romania to
write reports about French politics.
</P>
<P>
However, former French counter-intelligence chief Jacques
Fournet and the Romanian secret service SRI, for which Hernu
allegedly once worked, have cast doubt on the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Fournet said on television that he himself doubted the truth
of the story which was told in 1992 by a former member of the
former Romanian secret service, the Securitate, out of which the
the SRI grew.
</P>
<P>
When informed of the affair in 1992, Mitterrand decided to
cover it up as a state secret, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand did not believe the story, saying that since Hernu
was already dead, he could not defend himself.
</P>
<P>
The SRI said today it knows nothing of the existence of such a
French agent who allegedly worked for it from 1961 to 1963, an
Agence France Presse report from Bucharest said.
</P>
<P>
Hernu's son Patrice said he would ask President Jacques Chirac
to investigate the matter. He said it was impossible to believe
that his father had been a Moscow puppet.
</P>
<P>
Hernu was a close friend of president Mitterrand and resigned
in disgrace in 1985 after French agents sank a Greenpeace ship in
Auckland Harbor as the vessel was preparing to protest against
French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today accused the U.S. of blocking Iran's
participation in the negotiations between Iraq's rival Kurdish
factions, which started today in Ankara .
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said at a press conference that it is
difficult for them to reach a concrete conclusion without "active
and positive" contribution of Iran.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source told Xinhua that Iran did not attend
the Ankara peace talks, because it was not invited and the
invitation was blocked by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations were attended by the Iran-backed Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the Baghdad-supported Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP), Turkey, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Local English language daily Tehran Times noted that the
Kurdish groups should realize that the U.S. and Britain are "not
their genuine friends and are only out to consolidate their
influence in the region."
</P>
<P>
The two Iraqi factions jointly ran a de facto independent
administration in northern Iraq from 1991 to 1994, when their
differences led to fighting. They have since fought each other
sporadically.

<HEADLINE> Syria Opposes Israeli Maneuver in Golan Heights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian newspaper voiced
today Syria's strong opposition to the Israeli military maneuver
currently conducted in the occupied Golan Heights, arguing that
such actions are intended to "tense the atmosphere and sabotage
the peace efforts."
</P>
<P>
The political moves made by the European Union (EU) in the
region have failed to bring the Israeli government closer to the
foundations of the Middle East peace process. Israel is seeking
to tense the atmosphere in the region through statements and
military maneuvers, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army started Tuesday a wide-scale military
maneuver, the fifth in the past six months, in the occupied
Syrian Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
While seeing off his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov at
Damascus airport Tuesday, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara
refuted recent statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu that Syria is tensing the atmosphere, massing troops
and preparing to launch an abrupt offensive.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister said that such allegations by the
Israeli government are "baseless" and are intended to enable it
to evade the peace process and its foundations.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan, a strategic plateau, from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East War. The returning of the Golan Heights to
Syria is the most important issue for realizing peace between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall In Beijing's Zhongshan Park to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall
in the center of Beijing will open to the general public for the
first time since the founding of new China in 1949, on November 8,
to mark Dr. Sun's 130th birth anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will have some 120 photos and calligraphy and
charts of Dr. Sun Yat-sen to show his political career from
November of 1924, when he came to Beijing, to April 1925 when he
passed away, when a public memorial service attracted thousands of
people.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference said today that
the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall is open to the public every Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The hall used to be the Hall of Worshipping the Altar of Land
and Grain that was built in 1425, or the first year under the rein
of Emperor Hongwu of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Imperial
emperors offered sacrifices to gods or ancestors in the hall,
which is one of the best preserved old structures in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The name of the hall was changed to Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall
in September 1925 to commemorate him. Since 1949, officials have
held ceremonies every year on his birthday and on the anniversary
of his death in the hall. The Beijing Municipal Committee of CPPCC
also often held meetings there.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sun Yat-sen played a leading role in organizing the
revolution that eventually overthrew the Qing Dynasty in 1911 and
ended the millennia-old monarchical system in China.

<HEADLINE> China Celebrates 50-Year-Long Yellow River Harnessing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A grand gathering was staged
here today to hail the Communist Party's 50-year-old effort to
harness the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng sent a letter of congratulation to the meeting
on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the
State Council, conveying greetings to those who have devoted their
wisdom and energy to the great undertaking.
</P>
<P>
Li said that thanks to the flood-control system built up over
the decades, the river has been kept within its banks over the
past 50 years, which represents a major accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Yellow River frequently overflowed its banks
in the past, inflicting great sufferings on people living on both
sides of the river. Now, it has become an important source of
water for cities and enterprises along its path.
</P>
<P>
The letter went on to say that important commercial grain bases
and hydro-electric power bases have been built along the river,
and that water and soil conservation in the region has made
remarkable progress.
</P>
<P>
The premier emphasized the importance of harnessing the river
with a scientific strategy in order to bring out the maximum
benefit. Towards that, Li calls for full understanding of the
long-term and complex nature of the work.
</P>
<P>
He called on those involved in the undertaking to carry on the
Party's tradition of hard work and plain living in striving for
even greater success.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun wrote a message for the gathering,
while State Councillor and Secretary General of the State Council
Luo Gan, entrusted by Premier Li Peng, addressed the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Luo's speech attached great importance to the development of
water conservation, which he said is the infrastructure and a
basic industry of the national economy, and has a direct bearing
on not only economic prosperity, but also social stability.
</P>
<P>
"We must be firm in carrying out the major strategic decision
of the Party Central Committee in placing water conservation on
the top of infrastructure construction," he noted, saying that the
harnessing and exploration of the Yellow River plays an important
role in the overall economic and social development of the country.
</P>
<P>
In general, he said, water conservation falls short of the pace
of national economic development, and floods remain a major threat
to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, direct economic returns arising from
harnessing of the river is estimated at 400 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was presided over by Li Changchun, secretary of
the Henan provincial Party Committee.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Allies to Meet in North Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Afghan President
Burhannudin Rabbani is to hold a meeting with his top military
commander Ahmad Shah Masood and Prime Minister Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would be held in Rabbani's northern stronghold of
Talokan, Masood's spokesman Merhabuddin Mastam was quoted as
saying at Masood's headquarters in Jabul Saraj, 77 kilometers
north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Mastam said the three would discuss the political ramifications
of an anti-Taliban alliance signed earlier this month with Uzbek
Militia leader Rashid Dostum and head of Hezb-i-Wahdat Karim
Khalili.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted some sources as saying the coalition's
strategy was to push right to the gates of Kabul while maintaining
their demand that the Taliban leave the capital.
</P>
<P>
The front in northwestern Afghanistan would allow them to keep
pressure on the Taliban and the opening of a third front in the
east was being considered, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Masood and Dostum's troops in the north have pushed to within
about 12 kilometers of Kabul, which the Taliban captured on
September 27, and have been trying for the last 10 days to capture
two strategic hills in the northeast commanding approaches to the
city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dostum's jets bombed the Taliban's positions north
of Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
"A Dostum jet dropped one bomb early this morning, but we
suffered no casualties," said Taliban soldiers on the New Road, a
part of the Kabul front-line.
</P>
<P>
The New Road, one of the two northbound highways exiting the
city, winds through an uninhabited desert area and over a small
mountain pass to reach the Bagram airbase 50 kilometers north of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Bagram is controlled by troops belonging to Masood and Dostum.
</P>
<P>
Both incoming and outgoing artillery fire on the New Road tends
to be sporadic -- from hour to hour it can vary from rapid salvoes
to none at all.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, at least four bombs dropped by Taliban jets
today hit Jabul Saraj. There were no immediate reports of
casualties.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ali
Khamenei's brother has said he is considering to run in the
presidential elections scheduled for August next year.
</P>
<P>
Seyyed Hadi Khamenei made public his intention to enter the
presidential race in a statement faxed to local press.
</P>
<P>
Hadi Khamenei's leftist daily Jahan-e Islam was banned in
February last year for carrying an interview with former interior
minister Ali Akbar Mohtashami, in which he strongly criticized
the policies of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Among other presidential hopefuls in the elections are
hardline Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and
Khamenei's representative in Hajj Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri was chosen by an absolute majority last week by
his rightist faction the Society of the Combatant Clergymen to
run in the elections.
</P>
<P>
His potential major rival Mir Hossein Mousavi, a favorite
candidate of Iran's leftist camp, announced Monday that he would
not run in the elections, ending speculations and calls for his
candidacy for next year's presidential race.

<HEADLINE> New Homes For Families In Tibetan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,500 families in Lhasa, the
capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, have moved
into new homes in the past three years, thanks to a housing
project of the Lhasa Real Estate Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Its goal is to renovate old housing in the old urban area,
according to local officials. Since 1994, the municipal government
has put 12 million yuan into the project, while the corporation
has collected 36 million yuan for the project.
</P>
<P>
Average floor space per household rose from 29.2 sq m to 38.76
sq m after the project was completed, said Zhaxi Gyncai, general
manager of the Lhasa Real Estate Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed that I could live in so spacious and cosy a
Tibetan-style house before I am buried," 68 year-old Gesang
said. "There is tap water and I no longer need to run about for a
toilet. It's a pity that the butter lamp I've used for several
dozen years will no longer be useful."
</P>
<P>
A total of 170,000 sq m of floor space in old dwellings was
renovated over the three years, said Losang Dundrub, vice-chairman
of the autonomous region.

<HEADLINE> Suspended Two-year Ban on HK's First Doping Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong sports
association handed down a suspended two-year ban Wednesday on
three of its athletes, the first ever in Hong Kong, for testing
positive of banned substance.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Bodybuilding Association announced that it has
decided to suspend for one year the two-year ban handed down on
three bodybuilders for doping offence. That means that if the
three strictly follow the regulations set by the Hong Kong
association by October 31, 1997, the ban would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The three, whom the HKBA declined to identify, were tested
positive of anabolic steroids, a substance banned by both the
International Olympic Committee and the International
Bodybuilding Federation, during the Hong Kong championships on
September 1.
</P>
<P>
The association said that the lenient punishment was based on
the consideration that the tests were the first ever carried out
within the association and that no Hong Kong athletes at the
Asian Championships later last month were found of doping
offence.
</P>
<P>
And the decision was not made until after consulting with the
Asian Federation, the HKBA said.
</P>
<P>
As bodybuilding becomes a demonstration event at the Sydney
Olympic Games in 2000, the Hong Kong association would continue
to punish any doping cheats in the future, so as to protect Hong
Kong's reputation in international sports arena.

<HEADLINE> ISO President Speaks Highly of China's Standardization Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Eberhard Mollmann, president of
the International Standardization Organization (ISO), said here
today that China is one of a few top countries which can seize the
opportunity to develop its standardization course.
</P>
<P>
Chinese standardization organizations "are very good and very
active organizations, with which the ISO has long established
contacts. Their efficient work has made China's standardization
progress move rapidly," Mollmann said during an interview.
</P>
<P>
The ISO now has 118 member nations, and each member holds that
China should be a member of the Council meeting, the major
decision-making body of the ISO, which has already revealed
China's importance, Mollmann said.
</P>
<P>
Now China is a member of the Council meeting, and plays an
important role in the organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has invited the ISO to host its 22nd general assembly in
China in 1999, a decision unanimously accepted by the
organization, he said, adding that the country is expected to play
a bigger role in the ISO with the development of its economy,
especially when the world enters the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Mollmann said he thinks China's product quality is making steady
improvement, which he attributed partly to the quality standards
introduced by the China's technological supervision department
into those production lines. The application of international
standards is also very important for China's products to enter
into the world market, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the ISO14000 standards, the president said their aim is
to "protect the world's environment from the management sector,
and provide principles and detailed rules for the environment
protection."
</P>
<P>
"We can't pay the price of environmental destruction in order to
develop our economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mollmann is making his first working visit to China as the
president of ISO, which was founded in 1947 and has released more
than 10,000 international standards. Nearly 40 percent of them
have been transferred for domestic use by China.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Kurdish Factions Start Talks in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) and its rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)
today started talks here to secure stability and peace in
northern Iraq under the chairmanship of U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Robert Pelletreau.
</P>
<P>
During the talks held in the Ankara State House, the
U.S. envoy said that he would spare no efforts to make the
cease-fire between the KDP and PUK permanent and to bring a
stable state beneficial to all the people in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-supported PUK delegation led by its Politburo
Member Muhammed and the pro-Saddam KDP delegation headed by its
deputy chief Sami Abdurrahman participated in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and British officials also attended the talks as
observers.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkish and U.S. officials have indicated that the
primary goal of the talks was to establish a lasting peace that
would allow the oil-for-food deal between the U.N. Security
Council and Iraq to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Pelletreau last week, KDP leader Massoud
Barzani and PUK chief Jalal Talabani agreed to order a cease-fire
which was declared to be holding.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted in the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq
once again when the KDP ousted the PUK from Irbil, the seat of
the now-defunct regional government, and took control of vast
swathes of northern Iraq in a Baghdad-backed operation at the end
of August.
</P>
<P>
Launching a surprise counter-attack earlier this month with
reported Iran's support, the PUK recaptured most of the lost
territory earlier, including its stronghold of Sulaimaniyah, one
of the biggest cities in northern Iraq, and Koy Sanjaq, and
approached as near as 25 kilometers to Irbil.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has kept the Iraqi government informed of the ongoing
efforts toward a truce.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the KDP
and the PUK began fighting in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Praises Visit by German Chancellor Kohl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here tonight that the current visit by German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl to his country has raised relations between the two
countries to "a higher plane."
</P>
<P>
"Your visit, Mr. Chancellor, has stamped the seal on a new era
in our relations -- when we can ride the historic tides of change
in the global economy to forge a lasting partnership for mutual
benefit," Ramos said at a dinner he hosted in honor of the German
leader.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippine-German partnership started with his
visit to Germany in 1994 which "aroused the interest of your
business community in the Philippines."
</P>
<P>
"Germany is our country's eight most important sources of
foreign investment, with 250 (German) companies registered in
metro Manila," he said.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the Philippine-German trade, despite its
current low level, indicates the bright prospects ahead, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the German Embassy in Manila, German investment in
the Philippines increased from 7 million U.S. dollars in 1994 to
24 million in 1995, and "will continue to grow in the coming years
because more German companies have decided to put up business
here."
</P>
<P>
Germany has been the Philippines' second largest donor next to
Japan. Its export to the Philippines last year totaled 930 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the banquet, Kohl said, "I want for my part to see relations
between Germany and Asia developing over a broad front, with the
Philippines as a major focus."
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he was pleased that Ramos continued to reap the
benefits of an economic policy geared to stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
Kohl arrived here Tuesday for a three-day state visit to the
Philippines, the second leg of his East Asia tour, which has
already taken him to Indonesia and will take him to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Business Brief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The European Union has decided to provide 38 million
European Currency Units (48 million dollars) to finance
Lebanon's plan on administrative reform, Beirut's An-Nahar daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision on the grant, which amounted to some 40 percent
of the administrative reform's cost, was announced at a meeting
in Beirut Tuesday between Anwar Al-Khalil, Lebanese minister of
state for administrative reform and an EU delegation.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Some 346 new companies and factories have been
registered in the Lebanese Ministry of Industry and Petroleum
since the beginning of this year and until the end of September,
Beirut's As-Safir daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
These companies and factories have employed 2,443 workers and
their capitals reached more than 45 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus ranks among the biggest per-capita spenders
on defense in the Middle East and North Africa, but lies at the
bottom of the list of countries as a percentage of Gross Domestic
Product, the Financial Mirror reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a latest report by the International
Institute for Strategic Studies as saying that the Middle East
and North Africa region remains the largest arms market in the
world, with arms sales into the area amounting to more than 9
billion U.S. dollars, or over 40 per cent of the global market
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Even though defense expenditure is estimated at 349.2 million
U.S. dollars for 1995, Cyprus still ranks among the highest
spenders in the region in terms of average expenditure per capita
at 1,092 U.S. dollars compared to the regional average of 412
dollars, while it spent only 4.3 per cent of its GDP on defense
as against the region's average of 6.4 per cent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Israel have planned to launch a new flight
route targeting Arab Israelis and increase flights between their
capitals of Amman and Tel Aviv, according to the English-language
daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which already launched five weekly flights
between the two capitals earlier this year, have decided to add an
extra flight on Tel Aviv-Amman route and begin two flights per
week between Haifa and Amman.
</P>
<P>
The new route between Amman and Haifa, an northern Israel
coastal city, proposed by Jordan, was aimed at wooing a large
number of Arab Israelis living in northern Israel around the
Haifa area who preferred to take the northern land route to the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that more than 100,000 tourists, mainly the Arab
Israelis, crossed the Jordanian-Israeli border to visit the world
famous rose-red city of Petra in Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 24 in Cairo Building Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the collapse
of a 12-storey apartment building in a Cairo suburb rose to 24 as
rescuers pulled out four more bodies from the heap of rubbles.
</P>
<P>
About 100 are still missing and feared dead following a
three-day intense rescue operation, which was launched 30 minutes
after the collapse of the apartment building in Heliopolis,
northeast of the Egyptian capital, on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
So far, 28 persons have been dug out from the mountain of
concrete and twisted steel, while 17 injured were sent to
hospital since the ill-fated building caved in like the folds of
an accordion on its residents.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers, working against the time day and night, at dawn
pulled out a 19-year-old Egyptian girl and her 17-year-old
American friend, both suffering abrasions.
</P>
<P>
Noha Mohammed Fawzi, now in hospital, said she and her friend
cited Koran and told themselves the story of a man found alive
after four days from under a collapsed building in the October
1992 earthquake in Cairo during their 35-hour ordeal in the dark.
</P>
<P>
At the site, an elderly Egyptian Red Crescent volunteer passed
out endless cups of water to policemen and relatives.
</P>
<P>
Earth movers gradually cleared away areas of the rubble that
had been searched while hundreds of rescuers moved on to pick
through pieces of brick, carpets and furniture with their hands
for signs of life.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances and a heavy crane were parked at the base of the
apartment block, transformed into a burial ground of personal
belongings like TV sets, books and handbags.
</P>
<P>
A rescue team from Japan will arrive here Thursday to join the
seven volunteers from the German Red Cross, whose mission is also
accompanied by five trained dogs.
</P>
<P>
The authorities here said the building had been illegally
heightened and the owner is being questioned, but some engineers
suspected that the tragedy was caused by amendments to the basic
columns of the building in recent renovation work.
</P>
<P>
This view is confirmed by the fact that the front part of the
building crumbled while only a corner of the 25-year-old building
remains standing.

BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China's computer-age generation
of young people now can learn about the country's glorious history
- through CD-Rom.
</P>
<P>
The world-famous "Long March", which finally helped the Chinese
Communist Party to power in China in 1949, has now been onto
CD-Rom and VCD to mark the march's 60th anniversary this year.
</P>

contains all the material and stories relating to the Red Army's
long march, which occurred between 1934 and 1935 and covered
12,500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The CD-Rom is mainly written material, together with pictures,
illustrations and music. All important Red Army groups, noted
figures, major events, battles and meetings, and some untold
stories, are included.
</P>
<P>
Three VCDs illustrate the fighting course of the long march in
photo and TV form.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli President to Visit Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman will visit Jordan next Wednesday in a bid to mend
bilateral ties that were soured by the deadlock in the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The president originally planned to conduct the visit two
weeks ago, when he asked for a delay because he thought then the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks were on the verge of reaching an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, the ceremonial head of the Jewish state, is expected
to hold talks with Jordan's King Hussein and other senior
officials to discuss the stalled Israeli-Arab peace process and
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries plunged currently to the
lowest point since the two former enemies made peace in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, a moderate Arab country with good ties with Israel,
joined the international chorus of condemnation of Israel for
sparking a bloody confrontation late September in which over 70
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which enjoys custodianship over Moslem shrines in
east Jerusalem, was angered by Israel's opening of a new exit to
the underground archaeological tunnel in east Jerusalem, which
triggered the recent bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in bilateral relations continued deteriorating this
month as Jordanian King of Hussein and his state-run media
escalated verbal attacks on the Israeli government and its
hardline policies which are stalling the peace process on all
tracks.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein made a surprise visit early this month to the
West Bank town of Jericho in a symbolic show of solidarity with
the Palestinians. He strongly urged Israel to implement the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is keen to maintain
close ties with Jordan. However, the signing of the peace accord in
1994 has so far failed to bring the desired benefits to the
Jordanians, thus fueling increasing anti-Israeli emotions in the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch, after holding talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak Tuesday, once again criticized the
Netanyahu government for not honoring its promise to continue
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's repeated assertions that it remained
committed to peace, the king said: "Commitment alone is not
enough and is also meaningless except when everything that has
been agreed upon is carried out."
</P>
<P>
Despite being only the ceremonial head of state, President
Weizman has been playing an active role in mending Israel's
widened fences with its Arab neighbors, especially since the
hardline Netanyahu government took office in June.

<HEADLINE> 21 People Killed in South Mogadishu Airstrip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 21 people were
killed and 50 others wounded in south Mogadishu today when the
forces of Osman Hassan Ali Atto unexpectedly attacked the 50 km
airstrip controlled by Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
At least eight technical vehicles were used in the attack by
Osman Atto's forces which have seized control of the airport. The
attack took place when the green narcotic leaves of khat,transported
from Kenya, were landing at the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
Two treatment centers in south Mogadishu were afloat with
wounded people this afternoon. The wounded were mainly khat
dealers, and the owners and clients of the tea shops surrounding
the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
The forces of Osman Atto have damaged at least one plane and
two armed wagons belonging to Hussein Aidid's men stationed at
the airstrip. Fate of the pilot and his Kenyan assistant remains
obscure. Unconfirmed reports said the pilot had been captured.
</P>
<P>
Situation in Mogadishu is tense with people running here and
there. Quite a number of people are running to look for blood for
their wounded relatives since no blood banks are available in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that forces of Osman Atto had immediately
deserted the airport, leaving the debris of tea shops still
ablaze. Foces loyal to Hussein Mohamed Aidid are now leaving
Mogadishu and Merca, 100 km south of the capital, to secure the
airport.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, More 17 people were killed and 20 others wounded
yesterday when unidentified gunmen indiscriminately opened fire
on civilians at Bar Ubah junction of south Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Business Climate Shows Downturn in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The general climate of business
in the country showed a downturn during the third quarter, due to
the impact of severe floods, high temperature and heavy rainfalls,
according to a survey conducted by the State Statistics Bureau
(SSB).
</P>
<P>
However, enterprises generally were confident about the
October-December season, said the quarterly business survey, which
was published here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey questioned 10,000 companies nationwide in August
about how they felt about business performance, trying to pinpoint
their problems and hopes.
</P>
<P>
The business climate indicator plunged to minus 0.07 in the
third quarter, from the previous 0.04, the biggest drop since
1994, when the bureau started conducting the surveys, in line with
international practice.
</P>
<P>
Industrial enterprises, especially medium and small-sized, and
those in some traditional trades, were the least optimistic about
their business climates during the third quarter, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the companies surveyed expressed optimism about
their future business climate, with only 17.4 percent of the
surveyed forecasting a worsening business climate.
</P>
<P>
Only 33 percent of the companies surveyed complained about the
high interest burden. The rate was 67 percent during the previous
quarter. The big change was brought about by the double lowering
of interest rates this year, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the State Statistics Bureau said that it is
important to deepen reforms of the industrial enterprises, so that
they can be better suited to market needs, and thus be more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that the central bank should make
structural adjustments in loan provision in favor of companies in
difficulties, while sticking to its tight monetary policy.

SHANGHAI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China's close neighbor
Malaysia, has launched a drive to encourage families from big
Chinese big cities to head to the Southeast Asian nation on
holiday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a potential market for Chinese tourists," officials from
Malaysia Tourism Ministry said in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
An official tourism-promotion mission from Malaysia is now
traveling in China, especially aimed at attracting tourists from
Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics provided by the officials, some 103,000
people from China went on vacation last year to Malaysia. In the
first four months of this year, the number of Chinese tourists
reached 44,000.
</P>
<P>
The officials estimated that beginning from the second half of
this year, the number of Chinese travelers to Malaysia will rise
remarkably, due to the upcoming return of Hong Kong to Chinese
Sovereignty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Air transportation between China and Malaysia has also become
increasingly more convenient, though, at present, there are only
air routes from Beijing and Guangzhou to Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
South China Airlines is expected to open direct flights between
Guangzhou and Kuala Lumpur, via Shanghai, by the end of October,
according to an official from Malaysian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia plans to open several tourism offices in China, with
the first to be located in Shanghai. Currently, Malaysia has set
up 18 tourism agencies the world over, including one in Hong
Kong.

COLOMBO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels are
extracting money from Tamil families living in America, Britain,
France and Switzerland, according to reports reaching here toady.
</P>
<P>
This information emerged at police inquiries into the recent

<HEADLINE> More Rare Monkeys Bred in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A baby boom is helping the
survival of one of the world's rarest long-tailed monkeys.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the 16 baby langur monkeys - known as presbytis
francdisis - have survived so far this year after being
artificially bred at a special breeding center in China.
</P>
<P>
The total number of presbytis francdisis, which enjoy state
first-grade protection, has now reached 93 at the center after a
five year artificial breeding program. The figure accounts for one
fourth of those raised domestically in the world in total.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months this year, 16 presbytis francdisis
were artificially bred and 12 survived in the center in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Presbytis Francdisi is from the langur family, with jet-black
fur and a tail is longer than its body and is slimly built, living
on a diet of tree leaves.
</P>
<P>
The species of rare monkey is native to southern China, and has
been listed in the international "red book" as an "e" grade
endangered primate.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists began artificial breeding of presbytis
francdisis in 1976 and a number of monkeys raised by the center
have been sent as "envoys of friendship" to zoos in Canada, Japan,
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi center is now China's biggest presbytis francdisis
breeding center.

<HEADLINE> Border City in Guangxi Takes on New Look  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese border city, Pingxiang
in Guangxi Province, has become a window for opening to the
outside world, helped by the normalization of relations with
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Pingxiang, in the southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, shares a border of almost 100 kilometers with Vietnam. The
well-known Friendship Pass on the Sino-Vietnamese border lies at
the foot of the Jinji Mountains in southern suburbs of Pingxiang.
</P>
<P>
The city has a population of 100,000, 85 percent of whom are
minority Zhuang and Yao ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
With State Council's approval, Pingxiang became a border city,
open to the outside world in June 1992.
</P>
<P>
Since then great changes have taken place in the city which
spans a total area of 650 square kilometers. Its gross domestic
product -- the value of goods and services produced -- has
increased by 415 percent since 1990, its industrial and
agricultural output value, is 270 percent higher, and local
financial revenues, up 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pingxiang's per capita GDP reached 5,620 yuan (about 700 US
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Pingxiang handles imports and exports totaling two billion
yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang Yuxiang, secretary of the Pingxiang City
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, seven or eight years
ago, Pingxiang began to trade with Vietnam on a small scale.
</P>
<P>
Since the second half of 1992, the city government has spent
700 million yuan building 15 infrastructure projects, including
telecommunications offices, transportation facilities, power
stations and hotels.

telephones, and international direct dialing is available.
</P>
<P>
Every day two or three hundred fully-loaded trucks run on the
mountain roads between Pingxiang and the border markets.
</P>
<P>
Passenger and cargo train transport services between China and
Vietnam resumed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Liang Yuxiang said that since 1993, Pingxiang has held several
trade fairs in China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, Chinese companies from
other parts of the country have set up 1,000 enterprises, and foreign
companies have established 20 joint ventures in Pingxiang.
</P>
<P>
Pingxiang has been expanding border foreign trade over the past
few years, which has become the pillar of Pingxiang's economy.
</P>
<P>
Liang said that Pingxiang's border trade soared from 20 million
yuan in 1988 to 930 million in 1995. Pingxiang's foreign trade
came to 1.25 billion in the first seven months of this year, up 20
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of foreign trade has also helped expand
the service sector, including such industries as transportation
and tourism. In 1995 more than one third of the city's urban work
force was engaged in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
Now Pingxiang has more than 4,000 self-employed people, and 800
trade companies set up by enterprises from other parts of the
country. These business people handle goods from inland areas in
China, Russia, and Mongolia and southeast Asian countries. They
export manufactured goods and import farm and sideline produce.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Picture of Buddhist World Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scholar has
discovered the world's oldest picture of the Buddhist vision of
the world. It was among documents found in a cave in the
world-renowned Mogao Grottos in Dunhuang in Gansu Province a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
The original of the picture, taken to France early this century
and now kept in the Paris-based National Library, had not been
recognized until recently, when Hu Tongqing, a research fellow
from the Institute of Dunhuang, studied a micro film shot of it.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, the 30 cm-by-80 cm picture, made some 1,000
years ago in the early Song Dynasty (960-1279), depicts a Buddhist
world, with such things as empty space, hell, nine mountains, eight
seas, and four continents.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 Chinese characters can be found in the picture.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the picture, made according to a famous Buddhist
classic, reflects the Buddhist view of the originating of the
universe, changing of stars and seasons, and that humans and the
universe are in harmony.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang documents, Buddhist classics, silk paintings, and rare
books, found in the caves in the Mogao Grottos, were mostly taken
overseas by foreign explorers early this century.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Little Affected by Lower Global Demand for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The drop in the demand for
electronics products in the world market did not have any obvious
negative effect on the electronics industry in Malaysia, Human
Resources Minister Lim Ah Lek said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study by the Labor Department on all
electronics factories in the country, only 31, or 3.2 percent, of
the 964 factories surveyed made personnel retrenchment while only
4,874, or 1.2 percent, of the 407,650 workers in the sector were
laid off.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good sign for Malaysia and the workers in the
country need not worry about the situation facing the electronics
industry at the international level," said Lim.
</P>
<P>
He said he would submit a note to the cabinet on the overall
situation of the local electronics sector.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that 90.2 percent of the workers in the
electronics sector were locals.
</P>
<P>
About 93 percent of the laid-off workers were locals and all of
them found other jobs, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 31 factories that adopted the policy of retrenchment, 21
were wholly owned by foreigners, eight by locals and the rest
joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The study said half of these factories were closing down
because of lower demand for their products in the market.
</P>
<P>
Lim said the 31 factories had settled 16.5 million ringgit
(about 6.6 million U.S. dollars) of 17.2 million ringgit (about
6.88 million dollars) in salaries and other statutory benefits due
to the affected workers.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department is making efforts to make the employers
pay up the balance, he said.

said today that China is ready to carry out more multi-lateral
co-operation in the sectors of oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Zou was meeting John Imle, president of the Unocal of the US;
Jacques Maire, chief executive officer of the Gaz de France and
Rolf Magne Larsen, vice-president of the Statoil of Norway, at the
Diaoyutai State Guest House in Beijing this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
China's co-operation with foreign countries in the field of oil
and natural gas has been developing constantly since introducing
the reform and open policy, Zou noted.
</P>
<P>
He told the guests that the Chinese government encourages
enterprises to carry out co-operation with foreign partners, since
this will benefit not only economic co-operation and trade, but
also bilateral ties in general, with other nations.
</P>
<P>
Imle said that all of the three companies share strong interest
in and confidence about their co-operation with China. They are
willing to reinforce co-operation in the development and
utilization of natural gas resources.

<P>
The guests are in China at the invitation of the China National
Offshore Oil Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Australian Current Account Deficit Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- An unexpected slump in rural
exports caused Australia's current account deficit to swell to
almost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.36 billion US dollars)
last month to its highest level since May, Treasurer Peter
Costello said today.
</P>
<P>
Costello told parliament that the blow-out showed there was a
permanent deficit caused by foreign debt repayments which would
take "numbers of years" to fix.
</P>
<P>
Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed the current
account deficit widened by 15 percent in September to a seasonally
adjusted 1.7 billion Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Costello said while there had been some improvement since last
year when Australia had the worst current account deficit in the
industrialized world, today's result showed there was no room for
complacency.
</P>
<P>
He said the current account deficit was a long-term development
of the last 13 years.

CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov met with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa upon
his arrival here from Lebanon before noon today on the third leg
of his Mideast tour designed to further peace process.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak later.
</P>
<P>
The top diplomat of Russia, the co-sponsor of the Middle East
peace process, is reportedly carrying Russian ideas on ways to
reactivate the peace march on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also tackle Russian-Egyptian relations and
address trade imbalance after Egyptian exports to Russia reduced
to 37.3 million U.S. dollars in 1995 from 70 million dollars in
1990 in a sharp contrast to 393.6 million dollars of the
Russian exports to the Arab country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Primakov's talks here are designed to promote trade
and economic cooperation in light of the November 12-14 Middle
East and North Africa Economic Conference in Cairo in which Russia
will participate.
</P>
<P>
The senior Russian official graduated from the Moscow-based
Oriental Studies Institute and speaks good Arabic.

<HEADLINE> Suspended Two-year Ban on HK's First Doping Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong sports
association handed down a suspended two-year ban Wednesday on
three of its athletes, the first ever in Hong Kong, for testing
positive of banned substance.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Bodybuilding Association announced that it has
decided to suspend for one year the two-year ban handed down on
three bodybuilders for doping offence. That means that if the
three strictly follow the regulations set by the Hong Kong
association by October 31, 1997, the ban would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The three, whom the HKBA declined to identify, were tested
positive of anabolic steroids, a substance banned by both the
International Olympic Committee and the International
Bodybuilding Federation, during the Hong Kong championships on
September 1.
</P>
<P>
The association said that the lenient punishment was based on
the consideration that the tests were the first ever carried out
within the association and that no Hong Kong athletes at the
Asian Championships later last month were found of doping
offence.
</P>
<P>
And the decision was not made until after consulting with the
International Federation, the HKBA said.
</P>
<P>
As bodybuilding becomes a demonstration event at the Sydney
Olympic Games in 2000, the Hong Kong association would continue
to punish any doping cheats in the future, so as to protect Hong
Kong's reputation in international sports arena.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Destroys France Telecom Building in Corsica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A powerful bomb explosion early
today completely destroyed the inside of a building used by French
state-owned telecoms operator France Telecom in Corsica, but
nobody appears to have been killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the explosion in
downtown Ajaccio, but it is believed to be the work of Corsican
nationalists, who have recently stepped up their campaign of
violence on the Mediterranean island in their bid for independence
from France.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off soon after midnight local time on Tuesday,
shattering the windows of nearby buildings and vehicles, a police
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Police this morning questioned four men suspected of
involvement in other attacks on post offices, according to Agence
France Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The building, built in 1992, will have to be demolished and a
new one built, Jean Garcia, head of France Telecom's
communications department, said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials and union leaders condemned the bomb attack,
and several accused the government of failing to provide adequate
security to protect public buildings in Corsica.
</P>
<P>
"We know that a real war has now begun and we don't understand
why all public buildings, especially post offices which are often
targeted by attacks, are not guarded,'' said Pierre Pifferini,
regional secretary of the union Confederation Generale du Travail.
</P>
<P>
Corsican nationalists have escalated their war against the
French government since the beginning of this month when they
bombed the city hall in Bordeaux, where Prime Minister Alain Juppe
is mayor.

<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua
today invited more foreign investment to participate in the
development of China's energy industry, saying the country is
willing to co-operate with both foreign or international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Beijing with Robert Priddle, executive director
of the International Energy Agency(IEA), Zou noted that although
China's total energy production stands high, the per capita figure
remains low.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the energy industry represents a major task and a
basis for sustained economic development, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
With rapid economic development, China needs an ever-increasing
amount of energy, Zou said. While primarily depending on its own,
he added, China is willing to enhance co-operation with foreign or
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Priddle said that the IEA is willing to carry out co-operation
with China in different sectors of the energy industry, on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit.

Priddle is in China as guest as the State Planning
Commission.

MACAO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Macao International Airport,
which received its millionth passenger this month, is to expand
its parking apron by 20 percent in 300 days starting November 9.

AMMAN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Israel have planned
to launch a new flight route targeting Arab Israelis and increase
flights between their capitals of Amman and Tel Aviv, according to
the English-language daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which already launched five weekly flights

extra flight on Tel Aviv-Amman route and begin two flights per
week between Haifa and Amman.
</P>

The new route between Amman and Haifa, an northern Israel
coastal city, proposed by Jordan, was aimed at wooing a large
number of Arab Israelis living in northern Israel around the
Haifa area who preferred to take the northern land route to the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that more than 100,000 tourists, mainly the Arab
Israelis, crossed the Jordanian-Israeli border to visit the world
famous rose-red city of Petra in Jordan.
</P>

An unidentified official, who works at the Amman Marka Airport
from where the Royal Wings starts its half-an-hour flight to Tel
Aviv, told Xinhua that the flight to Israel enjoys a high
occupancy.

<HEADLINE> S. African Schools Bill Adopted by Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The controversial South
African Schools Bill was passed by the National Assembly on
Tuesday by 232 votes to 71, a local daily "The Citizen" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC), Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP), Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the Democratic Party
(DP) supported the Bill, which was opposed by the National Party
(NP), Freedom Front (FF) and African Christian Democratic Party,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Blade Nzimande (ANC), Parliament's Education Committee
Chairman, said the Bill abolishes "all the abominable pieces of
apartheid legislation" which has allowed for racially segregated
schools and different qualities of education according to skin
color.
</P>
<P>
The IFP's Kisten Rajoo proclaimed his party's support for the
Bill, saying it introduced equitable funding and attempted to
redress past inequalities.
</P>
<P>
While DP education spokesman Mike Ellis described the Bill as
"an important step in the transformation of schools" which
created the opportunity for all schools to become "centers of
excellence".
</P>
<P>
However, NP education spokesman Renier Schoeman said his party
wanted a better Bill for all South African children in line with
the constitutional principles of equality and non-racialism.
</P>
<P>
Schoeman said NP's opposition to the Bill was not based on
wanting to maintain past privileges, but a genuine attempt at
wanting to see school education truly transformed and improved.
</P>
<P>
FF's Willie Botha said the scrapping of admission tests
administered by governing bodies would enforce integration and
make religion a taboo. Education should be controlled not by the
government but by the schools themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Bill was expected to be voted in the Senate on Wednesday.

LUSAKA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Zambia's biggest
opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) Kenneth
Kaunda went to south africa to explain to President Nelson
Mandela why his party would boycott forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper today quoted Kaunda's aide Rabson
Chongo as saying that as much as the Zambian government has been
explaining its position on the electoral process in Zambia, the UNIP
has also taken the initiative to do the same.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is the current Chairman of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), which discussed earlier this year the
elections of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP and several other opposition parties have decided to
boycott the elections to be held next month in protest against the
government insistence that the elections be held under the new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The constitution in fact bars Kaunda, who had been president
of the country since independence, from contesting the presidency
because his parents are foreign immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five UNIP members have defied the boycott decision and
have instead stood as independents to seek parliamentary seats.

<P>
Statistics show that Wenzhou now has nearly 40,000 private
enterprises, which produce more than 90 percent of the city's
overall industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the private enterprises used to
engage themselves in producing simple and small commodities, like
clothes, shoes, lamps, lighters, and valves.
</P>
<P>
"There are now more and more private enterprises doing business
with high science contents, and making products with high added
values," said Zhang Zuowei, director of the private economy
management office, under the Wenzhou industrial and commercial
administration.
</P>
<P>
He cited the example of Wenzhou Darong Electric Appliances
Manufacturing Company. Though founded only three years ago, the
company ranks among the top ten private enterprises in Wenzhou,
and has been designated as a key manufacturer of electric products
by the state.
</P>
<P>
"Our target for the year 2000 is to have an output value of 500
million yuan, and have our high-tech products accepted by the
global market," said Zhu Minghuan, chairman of the company.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, many Wenzhou private entrepreneurs now
attach much importance to the study of modern technologies and
management, which they realize are indispensable to the
achievement of their ambitions.
</P>
<P>
"In the past two years, at least 2,000 private business people
in Wenzhou have acquired university diplomas or professional
titles by way of self-teaching," he noted.

<HEADLINE> China's Own Jurassic Park Found By Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists say that a
world-renowned scenery spot in east China was once a thriving
Jurassic Park.
</P>
<P>
Mount Huangshan was a major habitat of many kinds of dinosaurs
for 40 million years, they have reported. Few places on earth can
boast such a variety of the creatures that once stalked the globe.
</P>
<P>
The mountain area in Anhui Province, which has been inscribed
on the World Heritage List, has provided experts with a great
number of dinosaur fossils, and fossilized dinosaur eggs,
footprints and tail prints.
</P>
<P>
After close study of the relics, the scientists found out that
they belonged to different kinds of dinosaurs, dating from the
early to the late Cretaceous Period, a time span of 40 million
years.
</P>
<P>
Some dinosaur fossils and footprints were from a family with
animal-like feet, some footprints belonged to those with bird's
claws and a large head, while others were those with bird's paws
and duck's bills.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that so many kinds of dinosaurs, surviving over
such a long time span in Mount Huangshan area, has been rarely
seen in other places of the world.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Call for Attention to Peasant Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WUHAN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The study of peasant wars in China
urgently needs to be deepened and expanded, Chinese scholars said
at the Ninth Seminar of the China Society for Study of Peasant
Warfare.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which closed recently in Tongshan of central
China's Hubei Province, attracted some 30 researchers in the field
from around the country.
</P>
<P>
China is a large farming country and experienced numerous
peasant uprisings during its 2,000-year-long feudal history,
experts said, and the study of the fighting is of significance.
</P>
<P>
However, such study was misdirected for a long time because of
the interference of leftist guidelines, they explained, adding
that work currently is not progressing well.
</P>
<P>
Research in the field should be expanded to include not only the
peasant wars but also the comprehensive study of their production,
lifestyles and thinking, according to Tian Changwu, a professor of
Shandong University and chairman of the society.

<P>
XI'AN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-German group will fund
repairs for a deteriorating 24-m-high sculpture of Buddha located
in grottos dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this is the world's first attempt to fortify a
large stone sculpture which is connected with cliff.
</P>
<P>
The Buddha sculpture, one of some 1,000 statues built in the Big
Buddha grottos in Binxian county in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, has been seriously damaged by harsh weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-German experts group has developed special poles, nails
and plates to support the grottos and repair a crack on the
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
The group also replaced the base under the pass in the grottos.
</P>
<P>
Conservation of the grottos, including the big Buddha sculpture,
cost 1.6 million Deutch Marks from the German side and 1.5 million
yuan from Chinese cultural relics departments.
</P>
<P>
In the middle 1980s, the province invested hundreds of thousands
of yuan to reroute a highway in front of the grottos to a distance
500 m away. These grottos were built in the Tang Dynasty and are
now under state protection.

<HEADLINE> Declaration on Afghan Crisis Issued in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A declaration on the Afghan
crisis was issued today at the end of the two-day regional
conference, which calls for peaceful settlement rather than
military solution for the escalating war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Declaration sends a strong message to the warring
factions in Afghanistan, urging them to refrain from resorting to
force and to settle their differences by peaceful means through
inter-Afghan negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was endorsed by nine countries. They are
China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan,
Turkey and Turkmenistan. Four international organizations also
dispatched representatives to the conference.
</P>
<P>
The document calls for national reconciliation and
establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It calls for cessation of foreign interference in the internal
affairs of Afghanistan, but it did not specify the names of
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Conference underlined the imperative of respect for
sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national
unity of Afghanistan," it says.
</P>
<P>
The declaration did not mention the demilitarization of the
Afghan capital of Kabul or the dispatch of peace-keeping forces
as some countries had suggested before.
</P>
<P>
The participating countries voiced their support for the
decision of U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to
convene an international conference of states with interest and
influence in Afghanistan, which will be aimed at a concerted and
joint search for a political settlement in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The conference expressed its readiness to hold another
regional meeting to review the latest developments in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Leaves Beirut for Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov left here this morning for Cairo, winding up a
17-hour visit to Lebanon, where he held meetings with Lebanese
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz, President Elias Hrawi and Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Primakov arrived in Beirut Tuesday afternoon on the second leg
of his tour in the region after having visited Damascus.
</P>
<P>
After Egypt, he will also visit Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his 30-minute meeting with Hariri, the Russian
foreign minister announced that he delivered to the Lebanese
prime minister an invitation to visit Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said that they discussed "a lot of problems," including the
Middle East peace process and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was followed by another meeting between the Russian
senior official and the Lebanese president, at the end of which he
stressed his country's support for the progress which had already
been made in the peace negotiations between the Israeli and Arab
parties.
</P>
<P>
Primakov denied any link between his current diplomacy in the
Middle East and a recent trip by French President Jacques Chirac
in the region, during which the French head of state visited Syria,
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan, Lebanon and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Primakov clarified that his trip had been decided "three
months before or more."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on Russia's role in the peace process, the
foreign minister said that his country has played the role of a
sponsor since the 1991 Madrid conference on peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia has activated its policies in the region
for five months when "we felt that the Middle East peace
process fell in a dilemma after a certain political force came to
power in a certain country in the region," a clear reference to
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stressed the necessity to continue the peace process
without a "long pause because this pause will lead to the retreat
of a certain party from the agreements which have been reached."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the end of his meeting with the
Lebanese foreign minister, Primakov expressed his hope that there
would not be an Israeli aggression against Syria, or against the
35,000-strong Syrian forces on the Lebanese territory, or against
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the 1991 Madrid conference, "there is not
(has not been) anything big achieved and it is undoubted that a
stalemate has taken place in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the next stage should be a "crucial
starting-point" to resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During the lightning visit by Primakov, a cooperation protocol
between the two countries was signed and a Russian-Lebanese
economic cooperation agreement was concluded as well.

<HEADLINE> Private Businessmen No Longer Fear Name of "Capitalists" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- When Zhang Chenming, a private
entrepreneur from Wenzhou, the booming coastal city in east China's
Zhejiang Province, opened a valve factory ten years ago, he
registered it as a "collectively-owned" enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Now that the factory has become one of the leading businesses
in his town, Zhang is seeking local government permission to
re-register it as a private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"This factory has belonged to me, ever since the day it was
founded," said the 56-year-old entrepreneur, admitting, "I used
the term 'collectively-owned' as a cover, which is no longer
needed."
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, almost all private businessmen in Wenzhou
described their enterprises as "collective", which indicated that
they 'belonged' to local governments or to a state
enterprise. They also won the tacit consent of the local
government for the 'white lie'.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, we were unsure of the central government's
policy, and feared getting the name of 'capitalists' for owning
private factories," Zhang recalled.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, however, such worries have no longer haunted either
the local government or private business circles, while confidence
in the Party's economic policy continued to grow, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his famous tour of south China in early 1992, Deng Xiaoping
urged the whole country to give up arguing whether something was
socialist or capitalist, and focus on economic development.
</P>
<P>
"I am just following suit of many other private businessmen in
re-registering my factory," Zhang said, adding that many Wenzhou
entrepreneurs have taken money out of the bank to enlarge their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
He is planning to form a private enterprise group for valve
production on the basis of his prosperous factory.

HOHHOT, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 800 scholars in China are
engaged in the study of nationalities -- 500 more than a decade
ago -- and have contributed to the publication of a brief history

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Says He Understands Anti-Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today said in Parliament that it was natural for
Australians in industries suffering large job losses to feel angry
about continuing immigration.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the prime minister definitely linked the
immigration issue with unemployment after the debate was sparked
by Independent MP Pauline Hanson a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
"You can not isolate the sense of insecurity and anxiety that
people, at a time of relatively high unemployment, feel from
considerations of levels of immigration," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is natural that people, particularly those who feel
themselves at the sharp end of challenge and anxiety in industries
that have seen extensive job losses, should feel anxious about
immigration levels," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is the obligation of all of us to understand that,
it is an obligation to point out, where it is appropriate, the
error in their understanding of the causation between immigration
and job security."
</P>
<P>
Howard said politicians could never afford to believe that
immigration was too hard a subject for the general populace to
handle, "it's also our responsibility to involve them in the
debate."
</P>
<P>
The current difficulties and resentments about immigration were
partly the result of many Australians believing that a political
elite from both sides had frozen them out of the issue.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the above remarks during the debate on
a motion reaffirming a non-discriminatory immigration policy.

<HEADLINE> S. African Gold Industry Fighting Costs, Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Earnings of the gold
mining industry of South Africa fell by 11 percent to 135.5
million U.S. Dollars from 152.2 million Dollars in September
mainly due to declining output and rising cost.
</P>
<P>
A latest analysis issued today by the Fedsure Asset Management
shows that gold production in September decreased to 117,943
kilograms from 119,375 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The GFSA, a major gold producer, was instrumental in this with
its production down by nine percent to 21,399 kilograms from
23,402 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Gold costs in September rose by seven percent to 305 U.S.
Dollars per ounce from 286 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The analysis noted that the gold profit margin was 19.6
percent compared to 15.5 percent a year ago when the industry was
in more trouble.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's gold production has declined steadily since
September last year when it was 129,148 kilograms and production
decreased by around 48 tons in the year to September this year.
</P>
<P>
This means an income loss to the industry of about 600 million
U.S. Dollars in the year.

<HEADLINE> China's Only Journal on Sustainability Marks Fifth Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A "think tank" journal is
celebrating its fifth birthday.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1991, and inscribed by Deng Xiaoping, China
Population, Resources and Environment, is the only journal on
theory and practice of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The journal is directed by the State Science and Technology
Mission.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior staff member at the journal, "the
relationship between economic development and the combination of
population, resources and environment is the core issue for a
sustainable growth pattern".
</P>
<P>
"This is why we gave such a name to our journal", he said.
</P>
<P>
"Considering each of the three factors separately will bring no
good, for they interconnect with each other".
</P>
<P>
According to the senior staffer, many ideas that were first
published in the journal have been adopted by such state
departments as the State Planning Commission, and have created
significant social and economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 when the UN Environment and Development Conference was
held in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro, the English version of the
journal was distributed to representatives from all over the
world, and attracted much world attention.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to make the journal an open window for
China's research and practice of sustainability", said the
journal's senior staffer.

<HEADLINE> NKK to Post 10 Billion Yen Pretax Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Major Japanese steelmaker NKK
Corp. will post 10 billion yen in unconsolidated pretax profit in
the first half of fiscal 1996 (April-September), up 66 percent
from a year earlier, a business daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The profit increase is due to the better profits in the heavy
industry section and improvement in its financial account balance,
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
For the whole of fiscal 1996 ending March 31, it is estimated
that pretax profit will be 40 billion yen, up from 30.3 billion
yen a year before, sweeping away its accumulated losses.
</P>
<P>
The steelmaker is expected to resume its dividend payments of 3
yen per share for the first time in four years, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal first half, NKK's sales rose 8 percent from a
year before to 580 billion yen, supported by increased sales in
the heavy industry division. Domestic steel prices and export
prices during the period were low, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Net profit in the first half appears to have reached 7 billion
yen while it was 33.6 billion yen in the same period last year.

</P>
<P>

July, 1991, and later promoted to Minister of State for Education
when the post of deputy was abolished in November, 1994.
</P>
<P>
He was however dropped from the cabinet in July, 1996 when he

<HEADLINE> Huayuankou's Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Wang Huaibao, a 90-year-old
farmer who lives at Huayuankou, a ferry on the Yellow River, has a
habit of walking along the dyke to see the muddy water.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the river reminds me of the bitter old days when
the dyke was broken and people suffered. It is a great contrast to
this scene of prosperity," the old man said.
</P>
<P>
Huayuankou is located at the first section of the lower reaches
of the Yellow River, where the course is wide and water flows
slowly. It is easy to deposit sand and silt there.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the Yellow River dam at
Huayuankou burst several times in the past, killing many people in
the lower reaches and causing great economic loss.
</P>
<P>
But, the only man-made disaster took place in 1938, when Chiang
Kai-shek ordered that the dyke be broken in an attempt to block
the advance of the Japanese aggressor troops.
</P>
<P>
"I was threshing grain in my courtyard when I heard the shouts
that the Yellow River had been blown up," the old man recalled.
</P>
<P>
As the whole family and other villagers rushed to the dyke to
stop up the hole, they were stopped by the rush of roaring water
approaching. When they managed to climb up to the dyke, all of
their houses were inundated.
</P>
<P>
"I could never forget the tragic scene when the whole village
was submerged in the flood and people were on the rooftops, and in
the tree branches and woods crying desperately for help," the old
man said with tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that the man-made flood had swallowed 5,400
square kilometers of land in Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces,
killing 890,000 people, and leaving 12 million homeless.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Wang and his family returned to his former dwelling
place, which has rows of buildings surrounded by fruit trees,
paddy fields and fish ponds.
</P>
<P>
Wang's family became well-off in the early 1980s when his
grandson went into the transportation business.
</P>
<P>
"We used to fear the Yellow River. Now we like it, and can
hardly separate from it," the old man said with feeling.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1950s, the government has sent agro-technicians
to help local people divert water from the Yellow River to
transform the sandy and saline-alkali soil, and turn the barren
fields into fertile farmland.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are able to eat rice we have grown ourselves with the
water from the Yellow River," the old man said happily. "That is
why I like to walk along the dyke."

<HEADLINE> Nepal-China Nongovernmental Cooperation Forum Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A Nepal-China nongovernmental
cooperation forum started today as leading private industrialists
and businessmen of both countries gathered here to seek ways to
enhance trade and economic ties between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the Nepal-China Forum, initiated last
April during Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's visit to
China, opened here today with a one-day seminar on "Nepal-China
trade and investment" attended by about 100 businessmen,
government officials, scholars and economists from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Separate meetings between Nepali and Chinese businessmen will
be held Thursday following the seminar, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the two-day forum meeting, Nepali Foreign Minister
Prakash Chandra Lohani said the Nepali government considers the
establishment of the forum a significant breakthrough in the
relations between Nepal and China and hopes it would produce new
opportunities for expanding the bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The forum "would pave the way for a new era of cooperation
between the two countries," he observed.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nepal has adopted liberal and transparent
policies on foreign investment since 1990 which provide vast and
immense potentialities for Chinese private investors to do
business in Nepal in fields like hydro-power, tourism, agro-based
industries and construction.
</P>
<P>
The growing trend of economic cooperation between members of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),
which groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka, has opened a big market for Nepalese
products, Lohani said.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is considerable scope for Chinese investors
to set up a large number of joint ventures in Nepal because of
the geographical proximity of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A 14-member Chinese delegation led by Zhang Xuwu, executive
vice-chairman of the All China Federation of Industry and
Commerce, is attending the forum meeting hosted by the Federation
of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Business delegation comprises government officials
and seven leading private industrialists from across the country.
Deputy leader of the delegation is Liu Yonghao, president of Hope
Group in China's southwestern province of Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Hope Group, rated as the No.1 private enterprise in China, has
over 70 subsidiary companies in the sectors of animal feed, food
processing, finance and real estate with an annual turnover of 420
million US dollars, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the Nepal-China nongovernmental forum will
be held in Beijing in 1997, organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Book on Ethnic Groups in Inner Mongolia Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic groups in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have gradually mixed together
with the Han over the past thousands of years, according to a
newly-published book.
</P>
<P>
"A History of Unity of Ethnic Groups in Inner Mongolia" tells
about the ethnic groups that lived in the region during the time
from the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) to the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911), and also about their relationship with the Han in the
central part of China.
</P>
<P>
The 360,000-word book points out that despite sporadic fighting
between the Han and other ethnic groups, the relationship between
the two sides tended to blend rather than separate.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia is the country's first region to experiment with
regional autonomy of ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Chief Judge On Wang Dan (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To achieve the goal of scraping together his followers, Wang
Dan proposed and created in January, 1995, the "Mutual-Help
Donation", to aid those "friends who have been affected because of
involvement in the 1989 democratic movement".
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the donators, Wang stated, the donation's
"significance is not how much money it provides, but a way of
connection and communication it offers."
</P>
<P>
Additionally, in order to "prepare talented people", Wang
voluntarily held the post of liaison man in the "Self-Study
Program" in China, which was launched by overseas hostile
organizations to encourage and support those who wish to step up
the so called Chinese democratization, after they were punished
for participating in the 1989 counter-revolutionary riot and other
anti-government activities.
</P>
<P>
To obtain economic strength, Wang applied to overseas hostile
organizations for activity funds, and received support and aids in
different names from them.
</P>
<P>
Cai Yue said that the court verdict that Wang Dan has committed
the crime of conspiring to subvert the government is backed by a
large amount of evidence, including the written materials seized
in Wang's residence, testimony by witnesses, duplication of the
recording material of Wang's talks with Wei Jingsheng, and
criminal technical appraisal, which were displayed at the court.
</P>
<P>
Wang admitted his activities as stated in the verdict, she
added.
</P>
<P>
When hearing the case, the collegial panel showed 20 written
materials and read 30 other documents as evidence, and identified
the evidence at the court.
</P>
<P>
Cai emphasized that the court has found out Wang had engaged in
a series of activities to topple the government, overthrow the
regime of proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system. What
he had done has endangered the legitimate government of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
According to China's criminal law, Wang has committed the crime
of conspiring to subvert the government. The court's verdict based
on the conclusion is completely correct, she said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Premier Not to Resign Over Election Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Jean
Videnov said today that he will not resign despite the candidate
of his ruling Socialist Party being defeated by the opposition in
the first round of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Videnov appealed to voters for their support in the run-off
between Peter Stoyanov, head of the Union of Democratic Forces
(UDF), and Ivan Malzov, candidate of the Bulgarian Socialist Party
(BSP). It is scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the election on October 27, Stoyanov had
a clear lead over Malzov with 44.07 percent of the vote against
27.01 percent. But Stoyanov failed to win an absolute majority,
the electoral commission said.
</P>
<P>
The local media reported today that some members of the
Socialist Party called for Videnov's resignation on Monday at a
party meeting. But Videnov said he had "not heard of it."
</P>
<P>
However, he said a special party congress might be held after
Sunday's run-off ballot to fully analyze the election.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists suffered the worst defeat in their history in
the polls, losing a million votes from an electorate weary of
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Prices are rising while the unit of currency, the lev, is
falling in value. The central interest rate is 240 percent and
foreign exchange reserves have plunged to about 505 million U.S.
dollars from 1.5 billion dollars a year ago.

<HEADLINE> India's Former PM Rao Appears Before Trial Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- India's former prime minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao today for the first time appeared personally
before the trial court set up at the maximum-security
International Meeting Center in the St. Kitts forgery case.
</P>
<P>
the trial court, presided over by Chief Metropolitan Magistrate
Prem Kumar, started functioning at 10:00 hours local time (04:30
GMT).
</P>
<P>
Kumar had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against Rao
after taking cognizance of the chargesheet filed by the Central
Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on September 26.
</P>
<P>
The CBI alleged that Rao, in conspiracy with others, attested
forged documents to support framed charges that Ajeya Singh, son
of former prime minister V.P. Singh, maintained a secret account
in St. Kitts Islands in West Indies and deposited 21 million US
dollars in it during 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
Rao is the first former prime minister to appear before a court
on charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating. The brief reprieve
granted to him by the Supreme Court will come to an end Wednesday
once Rao appears before the trial court.
</P>
<P>
Rao's counsel today will argue on two applications -- one
seeking bail and another seeking exemption from personal
appearance pending the trial in the forgery case dating to 1989.
</P>
<P>
Rao, however, can not be taken into custody even if the bail is
refused to him in view to the Supreme Court's order. He will
continue to enjoy the anticipatory bail granted by the High Court
until he files an appeal in the Appellate Court.
</P>
<P>
The trial venue, where the two-day meeting of World
Infrastructure Forum is being held, is turned virtually into a
fortress with the deployment of four companies of Delhi police
personnel in addition to 50-odd Special Protection Group personnel
aided by Delhi police commandos.

<HEADLINE> Gold Crown Found in 2,000-year-old City-state Ruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A team of archaeologists from
China and Japan believe they may have found the final resting
place of the king of a lost kingdom.
</P>
<P>
They have unearthed a gold crown and a large number of rare
relics in the tomb in the 2,000-year-old ruins of a buried city
named Jiaohe in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Japanese team which excavated the ruins say that
crown, in the style of western Asia, suggests that the tomb's
occupant may be a king of the state. But no written relics or
evidence have been found in the tomb to support the view.
</P>
<P>
A great number of painted pottery, coins, gold and shell
ornaments and bronze mirrors have been found buried with the crown.
</P>
<P>
The experts say that the shell ornaments from Korea, and gold
ornaments from west Asia, again prove that the site was an
important stop along the ancient Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, dating back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), is
one of 2,000 tombs found at the ruins, including 1,500 from Jin
(265-420) to Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
Grave stones, bearing Chinese characters and potteries have
been found in many of Tang tombs, suggesting that the tomb
occupants were mostly Han nationality, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
The ruins in Turpan Basin is the world's oldest and
best-preserved city ruins. The whole city was dug from the earth,
with the upper part of walls of buildings made of rammed clay.
</P>
<P>
Historical records have shown that the site, capital of Jushi
state before the Han Dynasty and an important town of the Gaochang
State, subdued to the Tang Dynasty and became derelict in the 15th
Century.
</P>
<P>
In 1961, the site was listed under state protection to ensure
its preservation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Japanese sides have been making a joint effort
since 1992 to save the ruins from weather damage, with support of
10 million U.S. dollars from the Japanese government.

<HEADLINE> Striking Doctors, Nurses Given Ultimatum in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Striking junior doctors and
nurses who do not report for work this morning will be
''permanently'' fired, the government warned.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Acting Minister
Nathan Shamuyarira last night called on retired and unemployed
nurses seeking employment to report to the Ministry of Health and
Child Welfare Offices today.
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira said the government is prepared to employ
expatriates to replace junior doctors who defied its order to
resume work on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the junior doctors and nurses who have been on
strike for seven days have ignored the call by the government to
return to work while negotiations are taking place.''
</P>
<P>
''We are now giving a final warning. Those who do not return
to work tomorrow will be dismissed -- and permanently. The
ministry is going to recruit new staff and replace all those who
will be dismissed,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to give the strikers an ultimatum at a
meeting attended by a sub-committee set up at Tuesday's cabinet
meeting to discuss the ongoing strike.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the government has dismissed
striking junior doctors and nurses in less than two months. In
August the bulk of Zimbabwe's 161,000 civil servants were
dismissed after a nationwide strike but the decision was never
carried out.

HOHHOT, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Early in 1985, there were only a
dozen small book stores in Hohhot, the capital of north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, but the number has now shot up

part of their lives, a radical change from the past when their
ancestors, mostly Mongolians, were well-known for their excellent
riding skills and archery," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang, former curator of the city's library, attributes the
phenomenon to the fact that the fiercer-than-ever competition in
this modern society has made knowledge more important, prompting
the nationality to get off their horses, sit down and read.

lack of experience in practical management, so it is all the more

In October, 1994, in a letter to Han Yanming, an employee of
the Leshan Petroleum Company in Beihai city, Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, Wang Dan said: "I now propose a rule, on which
I hope an understanding will be reached. The rule is that we
should move forward or backward unanimously. I think that the
democratic force will be qualified for a voice only when it shows
its strength as a group. If one individual has trouble today and
other one gets trouble tomorrow, the unavoidable result is to be
defeated by the authorities one by one." Meanwhile, Wang Dan also
disseminated articles of the same contents to many people.
</P>
<P>
To solicit his followers, "show its strength as a group" and
"be qualified for a voice", defendant Wang Dan contacted with
dozens of people to sign their names on the article "Appeal"
written by himself, and on the "Learn a Lesson From Blood, Pushing
Forward the Progress of Democracy and Rule By Law---An Appeal for
the Sixth Anniversary of 'June 4'" co-written by Wang Dan, Bao

prison terms or exempt from criminal punishment for committing
counter-revolutionary crimes, and they also published these

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of millionaires in
Singapore increased to 386 in 1994 from 143 in 1991, as the
country's economic growth created more wealth, local newspapers
reported today, citing statistics from the Inland Revenue
Authority of Singapore (Iras).
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that the millionaires each earned an
average two million Singapore dollars (about 1.43 million US
dollars at current exchange rate) a year, going by their 775.5
million Singapore dollars (about 553.93 million US dollars) total
taxable income.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the 386 millionaire taxpayers who made
one million Singapore dollars or more comprised only 0.09 percent
of Singapore's 417,517 taxpayers, but they forked out 8.3 percent
of personal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
In total, the taxpayers of Singapore, which has a population of
almost three million, contributed 2.6 billion Singapore dollars
(about 1.86 billion US dollars) in gross income taxes.
</P>
<P>
The Iras did not reveal the identities of the millionaires. But
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said in July this year that the top
earners of Singapore included remisiers, directors of stockbroking
firms and bankers.

<P>
After the time for opening the court session was set, in

<P>
She said that the collegiate bench opened a court session
today, and conducted court investigation on the charges against
Wang Dan brought by the branch of the Beijing Municipal People's
Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
Relevant evidence materials were shown or read on the court,
while the collegiate bench listened to the public prosecutor's
statement in support of the prosecution, defending opinions of the
defendant and the defender, and final statement by the defendant.
</P>
<P>
After the court session, the collegiate bench examined the case
in accordance with facts and laws, and then announced the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dan was informed that if he does not accept the first
ruling, he has the right to lodge an appeal to the Beijing
Municipal Higher People's Court, within ten days after receiving
the formal text of the written judgement.
</P>
<P>
The chief judge pointed out that the court has full legal basis
and sufficient evidence to pronounce Wang Dan guilty of plotting
to subvert the government.
</P>
<P>
She listed a number of facts of Wang Dan's criminal activities
as follows:
</P>
<P>
I. Wang Dan has the intention to subvert the legal national
government and the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1989, Wang Dan clearly voiced his opinion of
subverting the legal government and changing the nature of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he was released on parole in February 1993, he
published a number of articles on several overseas newspapers and
magazines, openly claiming: "My political belief did not change in
the past, has not changed now, and will not change in the future."
</P>
<P>
In other published articles, he repeatedly demonstrated his
political opinion of being hostile to the legal government.
</P>
<P>
II. Wang Dan, in fact, carried out activities that aimed at
subverting the government and endangering state security.
</P>
<P>
1. Since he was released on parole, Wang Dan wrote a large
number of articles, such as "China in the post-Deng era and the
democratic movement on the mainland", with the purpose of
instigating riots and subverting the government.

<HEADLINE> Chief Judge on Trial of Wang Dan (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his articles, Wang Dan attacked the Four Cardinal
Principles, which are written in the Constitution of the People's
Republic of China, and spread slanders and libels against the
people's government.
</P>
<P>
There are many seditious sentences in his articles, such as
"today's China is like being on the top of a volcano", and "it's
time for us to turn our words into actions".
</P>
<P>
In an essay entitled "China in the post-Deng era and the
democratic movement on the mainland", Wang Dan went so far as to
say that in the post-Deng era "China will certainly get into
turmoil", and suggested that "the major task for the democratic
movement on the mainland now should be making long-term and
meticulous preparations for the arrival of the post-Deng era".
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the preparatory work should cover three
aspects: first, to reach ideological consensus and turn the
democratic movement into a well-coordinated entirety; secondly, to
discover new talents in order to improve the quality of the
movement; and finally, to gain economic strength, which can add
momentum to the movement.
</P>
<P>
The chief judge pointed out that the articles written and
published by Wang Dan clearly showed that his aim of writing these
articles were not merely to express his political views, or "voice
opinions to the government" as he alleged. On the contrary, they
completely served to mould public opinion for overthrowing the
legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
2. He actively developed contact with organizations and
individuals in and out of China, in an attempt to integrate
various illegal organizations.
</P>
<P>
In October 1994, Wang Dan ganged up with Wang Juntao, who was
also sentenced into prison for plotting to subvert the government
and later released on parole for medical treatment, and served as
a member of council in a "China Research Institute", founded by
Wang Juntao in the United States for the purpose of subverting
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
In Wang Juntao's words, the institute aims at "setting up a
force of opposition for the post-Deng era, which shall take
national responsibilities and try to enter China's political arena
as an independent political force".
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that the institute will collaborate with the
"democratic force" on the mainland to prepare for China's
democratization in the post-Deng era, and mobilize people of
various groups to accomplish the work of research, organization,
propaganda, coordination, and diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Continue Strong Export Growth in 1997: EDC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Canadian exports will increase
8.0 percent next year and grow an average of 8.1 percent annually
until 2001, said an annual export forecast released today by the
country's Export Development Corporation (EDC).
</P>
<P>
"Asia continues to be the best performing export market for
Canada," EDC said. It estimates that the country's export sales to
Asia are expected to grow by about 15 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, "a 10-percent increase can be expected,
primarily on the basis of improving market prospects in Mexico,"
the corporation said.
</P>
<P>
The mission of EDC is to help Canadian exporters compete in
world markets by providing a wide range of financial and risk
management services.
</P>
<P>
In Eastern Europe, growth should be about 8.0 percent as
Canadian exporters continue to exploit niche markets, while in
Africa and the Middle East, growth is expected to come in around
9.0 percent, EDC said.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Canada's third largest export market, where a 9.0
percent growth in Canadian export sales is expected.
</P>
<P>
In Canada's second largest commercial market of Western Europe,
EDC forecasts an increase of about 10 percent for Canadian exports
as the economy there continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Canada's largest trading partner -- the United
States -- are expected to repeat the 7.0-percent growth estimated
for this year, according to EDC.
</P>
<P>
Canada's prosperity depends on exports, which account for more
than a third of its gross domestic product. Over the past three
years, its exports have grown by nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The top five Canadian export sectors are automotive, forestry,
capital goods, mineral products and energy.

<HEADLINE> Wang Dan Sentenced to 11 Years' imprisonment for Plotting to Subvert the Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing No.1 Intermediate
People's Court today opened a session and held a public hearing of
Wang Dan's case. In its first ruling, the court sentenced Wang to
11 years' imprisonment and deprived him of political rights for
two years, for committing the crime of conspiring to subvert the
government.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 27, was convicted of violating the criminal law for
instigating to subvert the government in 1991, and sentenced to
four years imprisonment and deprived of political rights for one
year by the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court. He was
released on parole on February 17, 1993.
</P>
<P>
When and after Wang was on parole and his political rights were
deprived, Wang was suspected to have violated the law for his
colluding secretly with overseas hostile organizations and carried
out activities to endanger the state security.
</P>
<P>
At the approval of the branch of the Beijing Municipal People's
Procuratorate, the Public Security Bureau of Beijing arrested Wang
according to the law on October 3, 1996. The Beijing People's
Procuratorate instituted legal proceedings against Wang to the
No.1 Intermediate People's Court of Beijing for the crime of
conspiring to subvert the government.
</P>
<P>
The court's hearing found out that since Wang was released on
parole, he has written articles and published them in overseas
newspapers and magazines and distributed them in China to mould
public opinion to subvert the government. Wang attacked and
slandered the Chinese government in his articles. He instigated
people by saying that "it is time we turn our words into actions".
</P>
<P>
Wang took the position of a member of the executive council of
the "China Research Institute", which was created in the United
States and aimed at plotting to subvert the Chinese government. He
had colluded secretly with Wei Jingsheng, who was sentenced to
imprisonment for conspiring to subvert the government, and Hu
Ping, the former president of the "China Democracy League". They
plotted to "set up an opposition force" in China by uniting
illegal organizations.
</P>
<P>
Wang put forward the strategy of "advancing together and
withdrawing together" to avoid "being defeated by the authorities
one by one".
</P>
<P>
To scrape together his followers, he proposed and created the
"Donation of Helping Each Other", which serves to provide aids to
the criminals who were sentenced for committing the crimes of
conspiring to subvert the government.
</P>
<P>
He himself had received funds from overseas hostile forces and
recommended former members of illegal organizations to receive the
funds.
</P>
<P>
To raise funds for his activities, he even demanded overseas
organizations to provide money.
</P>
<P>
The above facts were backed by evidence shown by the
procuratorate, testimony by Liu Xiaobo and criminal technical
appraisal. Wang candidly confessed his activities.
</P>
<P>
The court verdicted that Wang had engaged in a series of
activities, plotting to subvert the Chinese government so as to
overthrow the state power and socialist system. Wang had committed
the crime of conspiring to subvert the government. His criminal
fact is clear, and the evidence is conclusive.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 Intermediate People's Court of Beijing convicted Wang
Dan according to the Article 90, Article 92, Article 52, Article
62 and Article 60 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
The defender of Wang pleaded for the accused during the
hearing. Dozens of people including journalists and Wang's
relatives were present at the court session.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Consumer Confidence Drops Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumer confidence dropped
slightly in the third quarter as a result of worsening job prospects
and slow income growth, the Conference Board of Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The board's index of consumer attitudes was down slightly from
101.4 in the second quarter to 100.8 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
"Canadians just don't see the job market improving, and they remain
nervous about their own financial positions since few households have
seen their income improve," said Paul Darby, director of the board's
economic services group.
</P>
<P>
"Almost 27 percent of respondents felt their financial position had
worsened over the last six months -- which further emphasizes the
financial insecurity of Canadians," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, more Canadians said that a string of interest cuts in
the past one and half years help them feel more in control of
their finances.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates are also contributing to the feeling that now is
a good time for Canadians to make a major purchase. "This is a good
sign and a first since late 1994," Darby said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the board's index of business confidence has
leveled off to 148.3, down 0.8 index points from the last survey.
</P>
<P>
The only weak link is the sentiment that firms were not
operating at or above optimal capacity, the board found.
</P>
<P>
The board is a nonprofit economic research and analysis
institution, whose consumer attitudes surveys and economic outlook
are widely quoted in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Calls for Halt To Harboring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 30 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has urged Western countries to initiate action to
stop providing safe havens for Sri Lankan Tamil rebels in their
countries, according to a press release here today.
</P>
<P>
The President said this on Tuesday at the inaugural session of
the 36th Consultative Committee Meeting of the Colombo Plan held
here from October 29 to 31.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Tamil rebels make use of genuine humanitarian
sentiments to infiltrate so called refugees. They collect funds
and engage in drug trafficking for the purchase of arms and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
They even meddle in the political activities in some countries
and go to the extent of murdering their leaders.
</P>
<P>
All this is done in the name of national liberation. But to
tolerate terrorism in the name of national liberation is something
that no responsible government could agree to.
</P>
<P>
She observed that the menace of terrorism is raising its ugly
head all over the globe.
</P>
<P>
She added "We in Sri Lanka are faced with a serious terrorist
problem which is taxing our resources in terms of human life and
economic resources. This is in spite of genuine efforts by the
government to resolve grievances that any particular community
might have".

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Busy with Inquiries on Gulf War Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said today that
it has received more than 3,000 calls in the past week over
possible the exposure of U.S. troops to Iraqi chemical weapons
shortly after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced last week that it was trying to contact
20,000 people who were serving in Iraq where nerve gas fallout
could have occurred after the demolition of a Iraqi chemical
weapons dump in March 1991.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Pentagon said it would try to contact 5,000
U.S. soldiers who were in the area when American troops destroyed
a bunker near Kamisiyah, Iraq, later found to contain chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The days following the expanded notification announcement have
been the busiest in the history of the Defense Manpower Data
Center hot line service for Persian Gulf incidents," Michael
Doubleday, Defense Department spokesman, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, the hot line has received 3,334 calls, and 100
calls a day on average since being instituted in the summer of
1995, Doubleday said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has set up two hot lines for Gulf War
veterans. One is for servicemen and women to call with information
relating to their Gulf experiences, and the other for those who
may have been exposed to chemical weapons and want to sign up for
medical examinations.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is sending 20,000 letters to Americans who may
have been near Kamisiyah during the demolitions, hoping to get
more information about the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has said the ensuing cloud of nerve gas could have
spread over an area where at least 15,000 U.S. troops were
situated.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. soldiers destroyed two parts of a massive munitions
dump containing chemical weapons on March 4 and March 10,
1991.
</P>
<P>
But the Pentagon said it did not know at the time of the
demolitions that chemical weapons were being stored there and did
not learn of their existence in the bunker until May and June of
this year, when a 1991 report of the Central Information Agency on
the incident surfaced.

<HEADLINE> Tremors Caused by Volcano Increase in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Surface tremors increased
Tuesday on Java's towering mountain Merapi, which is on a
high-level warning status, local press today quoted the head of
the Merapi Volcano Observatory as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Quakes have increased sharply this morning, we had 163
quakes," Mas Atje Purbawinata said from the town of Jogyakarta, 30
kilometers south of Merapi.
</P>
<P>
There had been 257 quakes in the previous 24 hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had put Merapi on "preparedness" alert, following
signs of increasing volcanic activity on October 24.
</P>
<P>
Purbawinata said lava had reached 2,000 meters from the volcano
crater to the nearby Krasak river.
</P>
<P>
Merapi, which dominates the flat plain of southern Java, last
erupted in 1994, killing more than 60 people, mainly from burns
from heat clouds, and forcing more than 6,000 people to evacuate
to safer grounds.
</P>
<P>
The 2,900-meter mountain Merapi, one of the most active
volcanoes in the world, is located at the center of one of
Indonesia's most populous regions and less than 30 kilometers from
Jogyakarta, home to one million Javanese.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM Urges Myanmar to Speed up Democratization </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Thai caretaker deputy prime
minister Amnuay Virawan has reaffirmed Thailand's stand that
Myanmar would need some time to prepare itself before becoming a
full member of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay, who is also foreign minister, said that the Myanmar
military government would be more welcome in the international
community after it had completed the constitution-drafting process
and held a general election.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government should complete drafting a constitution
and bring democracy to the country before becoming a full member
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Bangkok
Post today quotes him as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar used to explain and assure ASEAN that it is going to
have a new constitution, therefore we (Thailand) want to push for
it," Amnuay said.
</P>
<P>
He added that when democratization occurred the problem of
accusations against Myanmar on human rights would diminish and a
constitution would help internal peace and order, as well as
resolve conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Report: German Economy Continues to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- German economy will continue to
grow in 1997 since recovery signs appeared in the second term of
this year in spite of fiscal problems, an autumn report said today.
</P>
<P>
The report, unveiled by the country's six well-known economic
institutes scattered in Berlin, Hamburg, Halle, Munich, Essen and
Westfaelen, showed that the growth rate of German economy will
actually reach 1.5 percent this year, which doubles the figure
forecast in spring, and 2.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
It said that the gross domestic product (GDP) in western
Germany will increase 1.5 percent, because factory orders from
overseas increased and foreign investments have become
increasingly sound in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, in the eastern part of the country, the rate of GDP
will be diminishing, due to the blunt edge of industrial
competitiveness and the gloomy situation in the construction
industry.
</P>
<P>
The country's consumption rate from 1996 to 1997 will rise 1.5
percent by real term, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Equipment investment nationwide, which dropped 2.0 percent in
1996 in real term, will estimatedly surge by 1.0 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Germany's export in 1996 and 1997 will respectively climb by
4.5 percent and 6.0 percent, and import by 2.5 percent and 4.0
percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The average growth rate of prices in the whole country in the
two years will stand at 1.5 percent as it is now.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio in 1997
will be up to 3.5 percent, 0.5 percent lower than that in 1996,
but still higher than the 3.0-percent criteria set by the
Maastricht Treaty, though it will estimatedly fall from 144
billion marks (about 95 billion U.S. dollars) to 126.5 billion (84
billion dollars) in spite of austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment will remain the trend of hike in the country
during the two years, said the report. The number of the jobless
will rise from 3.95 million to 4 million, with the unemployment
rate jumping from one digit to 10.4 percent. It will be much
higher in eastern Germany with the rate going up from 15.5 percent
in 1996 to 16 percent in 1997.

</P>
<P>

Ossawa Tanner remind us that talent has the power to transcend
prejudice. We are proud to add this painting to the permanent

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls for Vigorous Diplomatic Effort in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today called for vigorous diplomatic effort to prevent the
situation in Zaire and the whole Great Lakes region in Africa from
worsening.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the remark after having dinner with President of
Cameroon Paul Biya and President of Gabon Omar Bongo, who were on
private visits to France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that worsening of the situation in the Great Lakes
region must be stopped, adding that all the heads of state in this
region were concerned about it, and that they were all prepared to
promote peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that France, Cameroon and Gabon, and most other African
countries, proposed that an international conference be convened
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) or the United Nations,
or both.
</P>
<P>
Biya, also the chairman of OAU, said that President Chirac held
talks with him and President Omar Bongo before dinner, and they
discussed the Zairean issue.
</P>
<P>
"We think we must soon take action to prevent the situation
there from worsening," said Biya, adding that he would take action
within several days or support actions being taken.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 500,000 refugees have fled the camps in
eastern Zaire since fightings erupted on Tuesday between the
rebels and Zairean government troops along the border with Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the French government said they hoped that the
U.N. secretary-general would appoint a special envoy as soon as
possible to go to Zaire to deal with the crisis. It also
disclosed that no military intervention had been considered.

<HEADLINE> China's First Man to Offer Private Psychological Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chen Zhongsun, a professor of
medicine living in Tianjin, was the first man in China to offer
private psychological counseling when he started his practice in
1986.
</P>
<P>
"Amazing development in this area has taken place in China, as
only ten years ago, few Chinese knew what psychological
consultation meant," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Most of his first consultations involved marriage and sex, the
latter of which is a "forbidden area" of discussion for Chinese,
especially outside the home, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen made his home telephone number public that year, and began
his new career as soon as he retired from the Tianjin Medical
College.
</P>
<P>
"My fellow countrymen need my help," he said. "And statistics
show that among every 1,000 Chinese, 12 to 15 have psychological
problems."
</P>
<P>
But Chen's early days on the job were not smooth: he was
plagued by gossip, as at that time his work seemed strange to
ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
However, his work did usher in revolutionary changes in the
field in China, and was immediately hailed by the press. Since
then, various psychological consultation agencies have mushroomed
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Chen's daily routine now consists of replying to patients'
letters, working periodically in several hospitals, and writing
special columns for a dozen periodicals throughout China.
</P>
<P>
"The psychology hotline is the most important thing to me,"
Chen said, "as this is a major channel through which I am linked
with society."
</P>
<P>
The professor believes that there are broad prospects for
psychological counseling in China, because the country is
experiencing tremendous changes.
</P>
<P>
There is increasing psychological pressure from a range of
sources such as unemployment and marriage, which are embarrassing
subjects for many Chinese, providing a vast area of discussion for
psychologists and their clients, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China's psychological counseling services
are far from being mature, partly due to the lack of professional
psychologists and the fact that they consistently drop out of the
field.
</P>
<P>
The professor's reputation has become so well known that most
of the letters he receives now come from outside Tianjin, the
largest port in north China.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that in certain instances, he is capable of easing
his patients' distress from within three to 15 days.

JAKARTA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The poor in Indonesia at

Haryono also said a total of six million children (seven to 15
years old) in the country have not enjoyed elementary and
secondary school education due to limited financial capacity of
their parents.

The minister called on the business community and
philanthropists to help ensure that the future young generation

school education.

<HEADLINE> Petrochemical Industry Gives Vigor to Development of Meizhou Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The petrochemical industry is
invigorating the development of Meizhou Bay, known for its deep
water and lengthy stretch of coastline, in southeast China's
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian Oil Refinery, the province's first and largest, is
situated on the southern part of the bay, which has 280 kilometers
of coastal line. To meet increasing needs brought on by the surge
of development in the area, the refinery's annual processing
capacity of crude oil will rise from the present 2.5 million tons
to 12 million tons in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the refinery has spurred local industrial
growth: the country has invested more than 600 million yuan (about
72 million US dollars) in the construction of water and power
supplies system, highways, ports and telecommunications system.
</P>
<P>
An oil wharf for 100,000-dwt ships has been built in the
southern part. In the near future, China plans to build a
50,000-dwt container wharf, a 100,000-dwt coal wharf, a
100,000-dwt grain wharf, and expand the oil wharf to the class of
250,000 dwt.
</P>
<P>
So far, 40 overseas-funded projects have been approved in the
southern part of the bay, bringing a total investment of 3.2
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Development of the northern bay area has also focused on
energy, and the petrochemical and chemical industries. In
cooperation with the southern region, the northern part of the bay
will be developed into bases for processing and transiting
chemical fibers, plastics and rubber goods.

<HEADLINE> Run-off to Elect Bulgaria's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Candidates in Bulgaria's
opposition, the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), and the ruling
Socialist Party will compete for the presidency in a run-off for
the presidential election to be held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the election, the UDF leader Peter
Stoyanov had a clear lead over Ivan Malzov, candidate of the
Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). But Stoyanov failed to win an
absolute majority, the electoral commission said today.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov beat Malzov with 44.07 percent of the vote against
27.01 percent, and George Ganchev, head of the Bulgarian Business
Bloc, came third with 21.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists suffered the worst defeat in their history in
the polls, losing a million votes from an electorate weary of
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Prices are rising, the unit of currency, the lev, is falling in
value. The central interest rate is 240 percent and foreign
exchange reserves have plunged to about 505 million U.S. dollars
from 1.5 billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
This result was a vote of no confidence in the Bulgarian
government, said Stoyanov, a 44-year-old lawyer.
</P>
<P>
He has expressed confidence in victory in the second round of
polls, and the Socialists said they would talk with Ganchev in a
effort to win some votes from the bloc.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Maintain Same Immigration Levels in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government
announced today that it will maintain the same immigration levels
next year as in this year.
</P>
<P>
Citizenship and Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard, while
presenting the 1997 Immigration Plan in the House of Commons, said
Canada aimed to accept 195,000 to 220,000 people next year.
</P>
<P>
Robillard said: "Immigration is necessary for Canada's
growth. At the same time, we must be sensitive to the need to
balance our demographics and economic needs with our capacity to
settle and absorb immigrants."
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, 199,000 to 205,000 people will have
landed in Canada, according to government estimates.
</P>
<P>
Under the immigration plan, Canada will also absorb 26,000 to
32,300 refugees as part of its international responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Robillard noted the "importance of promoting immigration as an
instrument of positive social and economic development," and
dismissed the perception as "myth" that immigrants take jobs away
from Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence suggests the contrary. Immigrants create at least as
many jobs as they take," she said, adding that immigrant investors
injected some 450 million U.S. dollars in investment capital into
Canada last year.
</P>
<P>
Immigrants also enhance Canada's ability to expand into global
markets and to build trade links throughout the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
While embracing economic immigrants, Canada "remains committed to
family reunification and the realization of Canada's humanitarian
mission," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Government figures show that for the past three years, Hong
Kong has been the largest source of immigrants, followed by India
and the Philippines. The People's Republic of China ranked 5th in
1993 and 4th in 1994 and 1995.

<HEADLINE> Walesa Accused of Illegally Keeping Secret Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Poland's National Defense Bureau
has accused ex-president Lech Walesa of illegally keeping secret
documents, a crime which could incur three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Walesa, who stepped down last year, denied the accusation
immediately, calling it a "provocation."
</P>
<P>
The bureau said, in a report Tuesday, Walesa borrowed, when he
was in office, these classified materials from the Bureau and the
Interior Ministry but did not return them after his term finished.
</P>
<P>
Poland's criminal code says that anyone who hides or removes a
document which he does not have the right to hold infringes
regulations and risks three years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Walesa lost elections last year to ex-communist Aleksander
Kwasniewski and ended his five years as president in December.

<HEADLINE> WFP Continues Food Distribution Despite Ethnic Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
decided to continue its humanitarian aid in Zaire after violent
fighting broke out Tuesday in the African country.
</P>
<P>
A WFP press release received here today said that the UN
institution intends to distribute life-sustaining food rations,
security permitting, in Katale camps north of Goma and Mugunga.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic fightings reportedly killed several people and wounded
many others Tuesday in Klbumba, also north of Goma.
</P>
<P>
Refugee camps around Goma are estimated to have been holding
727,000 refugees, mostly Rwandan and Burundian Hutus fleeing the
war between Tutsi rebels and troops in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Though WFP staff reported Tuesday a heavy exchange of mortar
fire across a river at the Zaire and Rwanda border at Cyangugu,
WFP food supplies kept arriving in Kigali from Uganda.
</P>
<P>
More food are expected to arrive within the next 24 hours from
neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is continuing to build up food stocks in Kampala and
Isaka close to the Rwandan border to meet the needs of an
additional 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 refugees in eastern Zaire's Uvira and Bukavu
region are on the road fleeing fighting between Zairean troops
and ethnic Tutsi rebels.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Banana Workers on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 Panamanian
workers from banana plantations across the country went on strike
today, demanding better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the workers' union of the Chiriqui Land
Company (SITRACHILCO) said the strike will continue until the
company satisfies their demands and reinstates the 60 workers
fired earlier.
</P>
<P>
Mario Smith, secretary general of SITRACHILCO, said the strike
was called after seven days of talks between representatives of
the company, workers and the government produced no results.
</P>
<P>
Banana companies have repeatedly asked the workers to end their
strike, which could cause millions of dollars of loss a day.
</P>
<P>
Euclides Diaz, director of the Banana Council in the Commerce
and Industries Ministry, warned about a possible loss of the
international market should the strike continue.
</P>
<P>
The director said: "50,000 boxes of bananas will be left
unexported every day once all the packers join the strike and each
day of strike will mean a loss of 300,000 U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
The strike also affected many sectors that take part in the
process, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the root of the problem lies in the low
productivity in the Atlantic region.

<HEADLINE> Hungary's Socialist Lawmakers to Disclose Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Socialist lawmakers in Hungary
must disclose their own and family members' property and any jobs
they hold in companies or foundations before November 30, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nyers Rezso, chairmen of the ruling Socialist Party's Central
Disciplinary Committee, said the regulation will help Socialist
congressmen and women remain clean and honest and make it
impossible for them to seek personal benefit by abusing their
power.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party was caught in a scandal after the State
Property Privatization and Management Company was accused in
September of having illegally shifted 800 million forints (about
5.2 million U.S. dollars) into the bank account of a lawyer named
Tocsik Marta.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have demanded the resignation of the
Hungarian government over the scandal, described by the nation's

European countries.

Central American country to be a beneficiary of its special food
guarantee program.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of this program will begin in May 1997 and the

<HEADLINE> EU Middle East Envoy Would Assist U.S. Peace Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes said today that the plan to send a European Union envoy to
the Middle East is not a countermeasure to the United States, but
rather a complement to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Middle East was of key interest to
the union, which had to bear the brunt should the ongoing peace
process go awry.
</P>
<P>
Matutes said the decision on an EU Middle East envoy
demonstrated the sense of responsibility and commitment the
15-nation bloc had toward the region.
</P>
<P>
The fallout from a derailed peace process would include
terrorist activities and price hikes of petroleum, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers, on Monday, named Spain's ambassador
to Israel, Miguel Angel Moratinos, to represent them in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
On the mission of the envoy, Matutes said Moratinos was to talk
with all parties in the region and bring into line the stance of
EU member states as well as assist the U.S. Middle East envoy in
his peace effort.
</P>
<P>
Matutes described the U.S. role in the Middle East as a
political one and that of the European Union as an economic one.
The U.S. and EU should supplement each other, he said.

<HEADLINE> European Ministers Call to Revitalize Cinema Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Budapest, October 29 (Xinhua) -- European Cultural Ministers
have advocated new measures to revitalize Europe's cinema industry
at a two-day meeting that ended today.
</P>
<P>
To be competitive, European production should take account of
the need to make films with high commercial potential while at the
same time expressing Europe's distinctive cultural values and
their diversity, the ministers said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the importance of public funding, saying the
strengthening of the audiovisual sector was essential in both
economic and social terms.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also supported the development of networks of
cinemas specializing in showing European films in order to
distribute it continent-wide and beyond.
</P>
<P>
They asked the Council of Europe to conclude the drafting of a
European Convention on the protection of the audiovisual heritage.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Convention is to ensure that past and
present images are passed on to future generations and it should
also promote conservation of those produced through television and
the new technologies, they said.
</P>
<P>
American films' market share in Europe has seen a 20 percent
increase from 1989 to 1994, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Continent-wide distribution of significant films would enable
young people to get to know the history of the cinema and to learn
to select quality works, the ministers said.
</P>
<P>
The Budapest meeting, held on October 28-29, brought together
representatives of the 39 Council of Europe member states and the
State Parties to the European Cultural Convention. Canada, Israel
and the United States also attended as observers.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A Colombian court has
imprisoned two men believed to be members of the broken-up
Medellin drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today that Freddy Hernan Gonzalez
Franco, nicknamed "Mystery" or "Otto", was sentenced to 20 years
imprisonment for larceny and terrorism, and Otoniel de Jesus was
given eight years imprisonment for heading a gang of assassins who
worked for former Medellin head Pablo Escobar Gaviria.

He was also tried for kidnapping a minor who led him to a
residence where the money was kept.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he had been sentenced to eight years in prison for a
previous felony, and another four years for escaping from prison.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Export More Products From Eastern Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Germany is to boost the export
from its eastern part through one exhibition in Britain later in
the year and another one in France next year.
</P>
<P>
The export-oriented exhibitions are part of the maneuver by the
federal government to help the economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The federal government already exerted two earlier efforts
through purchasing from and offering technical assistance to
manufacturers in the eastern part of the country, where
productivity is weaker compared with that in western Germany.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50 billion Deutsche mark worth of products were
purchased last year to help eastern manufacturers better enter the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
But the export of products manufactured in eastern Germany has
been decreasing in the past few years to account for 2 to 3
percent of the German export total now.
</P>
<P>
The German Ministry of Economics, therefore, has proposed what
it called an export campaign to economic development.

<HEADLINE> New Program Encourages Farmers to Have Less Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A new national program
combining poverty relief and family planning is expected to bring
better living standard to China's rural households.
</P>
<P>
Rural households with one child or two female children will
enjoy priority in the allocation of poverty-relief funds and
materials, so their household personal income should be higher
than the local average by the year 2000, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The program will help to "break the vicious cycle of 'the
poorer, the more babies and the more babies, the even poorer'",
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The policy was adopted because some families who escaped
poverty with the government's help decided to have many children
and ultimately slid back into poverty," State Councillor Peng
Peiyun was quoted as telling a national conference on family
planning and poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some families willing to follow the state
family-planning policy have not received economic and technical
aid from the government or society, impeding the implementation of
family planning in their area, she said.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the national drive is to ensure that the country's
population is under 1.3 billion by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But people in poor regions, mainly located at vast rural
areas, tend to marry and have children earlier and prefer to have
more children compared with families in more economically
developed regions.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid population growth in these districts has led to a
deterioration in living conditions and lack of development," the
paper blamed.
</P>
<P>
A national poll taken last year suggested that 20 percent of
people surveyed - who were older than 15 and who lived in poor
areas - were illiterate or less educated, which is eight
percentage points higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The maternal and infant mortality rates are higher in these
areas and the number of people with birth defects is 2.75
percentage points higher than the national average.

CANBERRA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government is mounting a comprehensive exercise
in damage control to counter perceptions in Southeast Asia of a
rising tide of racism in Australia. The diplomatic offensive
reflects concern that the attacks on Asian immigration are
threatening Australia's interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard lashed Asian newspapers yesterday
for "deliberately misrepresenting" his views on race, but told his
colleagues he had no intention of bowing to growing calls to
tackle Queensland Independent MP Pauline Hanson more directly over
her views about restriction of Asian immigration.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Immigrant doctors arriving in Australia after January 1,
1997 will be banned from practicing as general practitioners under
a 10-year federal government moratorium designed to tackle what it
says is a chronic oversupply of doctors, Health Minister Michael
Wooldridge said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Some of Australia's biggest companies, including Boral Ltd.,
BP Australia and AWA, are threatening legal action after being
denied tax concessions under the federal government's
controversial research and development incentive scheme.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China today called for
an international effort in improving the dwelling standards for
the people across the world.
</P>
<P>
The Second Committee (economic and financial) of the U.N.
General Assembly held a meeting today to discuss the
implementation of the United Nations Conference on Human
Settlements (Habitat II).
</P>
<P>
Yu Qingtai, a representative from the Chinese Mission to the
United Nations, said at the meeting that the international world
needs "enhanced awareness of sustainable human settlements
development." "The issue of habitat is one that encompasses the
greater overall environment of human settlements," he said, adding
that it requires effective international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative said there can be no uniform
standard or model for the solution of human settlement problems,
since the countries people live in differ in terms of their
conditions of habitat, level of development, geographic
characteristics and cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
Yu also said that implementation of the Habitat Agenda needs
to be ensured by effective U.N. follow-up mechanisms and actions.
</P>
<P>
He also introduced the achievements obtained by the Chinese
government and difficulties with the country in the aspect of
urban development and housing.
</P>
<P>
China is still faced with enormous challenges in its efforts
to improve the quality of urban environment, check excessive
growth of urban population, upgrade living conditions and
increase employment opportunities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Campaigns in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Winding up a seven-state
campaign tour before beginning a non-stop dash to the November 5
election day, U.S. President Bill Clinton campaigned today in Ohio
and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
In Columbus, a dozen or more protesters kept shouting from
choice seats above the stage in Ohio State University's basketball
arena. They waved signs, chanted "Dole-Kemp" and shouted, "Stop
lying to the American public," according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The president lashed back by attacking spending reductions
proposed in Republican budgets that he vetoed.
</P>
<P>
"I would be screaming, too, if I were in a country that took
Head Start and Big Bird away from five-year-olds, school lunches
away from 10-year-olds, summer jobs away from 15-year-olds and
college loans away from 20-year-olds. I might be screaming too,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
No Republican has ever captured the presidency without winning
Ohio, and the president's aides promised he will fight hard to
maintain his lead in the state.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to head out from Washington again
Wednesday and won't return until after it's over. After an
overnight stay Sunday in the Republican bastion of Manchester, New
Hampshire, Clinton will return to Ohio for an election-eve rally
in Cleveland and then fly cross-country for a curtain-closing
appearance in Los Angeles. Then he will go to his home state of
Arkansas to await the returns.
</P>
<P>
With millions of dollars more to spend than Republican
challenger Bob Dole, Clinton's campaign was throwing big money
into an advertising blitz.
</P>
<P>
With Republicans questioning contributions to Clinton's
campaign, the president is expected to speak out on campaign
finance reform in a speech Thursday or Friday somewhere in the
West.
</P>
<P>
Today, Clinton offered another proposal aimed at building
support among middle class voters, urging states to issue
"school-by-school report cards" -- published on the Internet -- to
help parents evaluate their children's education.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also recommended the establishment of 3,000 charter
schools, which operate without many of the constraints imposed by
local public school districts. A charter outlines what students
are expected to learn.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US: No Cause for Concern for Syrian-Israeli Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it did not believe Israeli-Syrian relations have been
intensified to the degree of what the press said might lead to a
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"I know nothing in our own eyes, here... that would lead us to
any kind of cause of undue concern," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
the press recently said there has been a lot of Syrian troop
movement and Israel announced its intention to raise its defense
budget by quite a large amount in case the restrained relationship
evolves into a crisis.
</P>
<P>
Israel has just ended a huge military exercise at the Golan
Heights amid the reported tension with Syria, following the Syrian
troop movement.
</P>
<P>
But Burns said the United States believes that both the
governments of Syria and Israel "understand the catastrophic
consequences of any kind of conflict along the border."
</P>
<P>
"They're responsible leaderships in both governments,
experienced leaderships in both governments, so we don't believe
that somehow we're on the verge of any kind of crisis like that,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, Croatia Accelerate Normalization of Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Milan Milutinovic and his Croatian counterpart, Mate Granic,
agreed today to speed up normalization of relations, especially
bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At their talks in the Croatian capital of Zagreb, the two
ministers agreed on the holding of a number of meetings of experts
and the signing of several accords to bolster the relations that
were established last August, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit to Croatia, Milutinovic had two rounds
of talks with Granic, and was received by Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that the work of a joint commission for
ensuring the free and safe return of refugees and displaced
persons would start on November 15. Experts would also begin to
work on accords on compensations for destroyed, damaged or
disappeared property, they said.
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 Serbs fled Croatia to Yugoslavia last year
when the Croatian government troops overran the Serb-held land of
Krajina in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that governmental bodies would be set up to
instigate normalization, the development of economic cooperation
and the signing of various accords on internal affairs, Tanjug
said.
</P>
<P>
Before winding up his visit, Milutinovic told reporters in
Zagreb that his talks with Croatian officials had been substantive
and frank, and that their significance lay in having defined a
precise calendar of obligations for both sides until the end of
1996.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of interior ministers is due to be held in Belgrade
by November 11. An accord abolishing visas for diplomats and
officials has already been reached.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav foreign minister said the two sides had agreed to
start work very soon on bilateral accords to regulate all forms of
economic cooperation, transport, cooperation in the power
industry, trade and finances, so as to enable a free flow of goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
He said special attention had been given to the implementation
of the provisions of last August's bilateral normalization accord
relating to a free and safe repatriation of refugees and the
protection of their property and other rights.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Irish Prime Minister Hold Talks in Dublin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
held talks with visiting Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in
Dublin today to exchange views on the Middle East peace process,
according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Bruton and Irish
Foreign Minister Dick Spring, Arafat said that he would not
renegotiate the 1993 Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement because
it was an international agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It is not in my authority to change this international
agreement," said Arafat, who arrived earlier today in Dublin for a
visit to Ireland, the current EU presidency state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian president made it clear that "there is no doubt
that the position of the EU is very important and can push forward
the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We need all the international pressure we can get to do that,
and I am sure we can do it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said that Irish Foreign Minister Spring, as head of a EU
fact-finding delegation, is planning to go to the Middle East in
the next 10 days and hold talks with the Palestinians at the
Orient House in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has repeatedly made it clear that Israel
views such visits to the Orient House as support for Palestinian
claims to Jerusalam as their capital.
</P>
<P>
Bruton also expressed the hope that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu would visit Ireland over the next two or three
weeks, but he refused to giver further details.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the planned EU visit to Jersulam, Spring said, "We
are at present working out arrangements in detail. But I can
assure Mr Arafat that we will have a EU troika visit to the Middle
East within the next 10 days."
</P>
<P>
President Arafat is due to pay a courtesy call on Irish
President Mary Robinson Wednesday before leaving for Spain.

<HEADLINE> European Single Currency to Cost UK Shops 3.5 Bln Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- If Britain Joins the European
single currency, it could cost the country's retailers as much as
3.5 billion pounds (5.6 billion U.S. dollars), the British Retail
Consortium (BRC) warned today.
</P>
<P>
The BRC pointed out that the switch to the single currency, the
Euro, would be more complicated than decimalization, which British
retailers introduced in 1971 and was considered a "nightmare"
despite extensive preparations.
</P>
<P>
The change to the Euro will involve dual-labeling old and new
prices, training staff and adjusting computers used at the
checkout and reordering.
</P>
<P>
Another 300 million pounds (480 million U.S. dollars) of
indirect costs could be added when taking into account the changes
to the pricing of products and the impact on trading patterns as
shoppers are expected to buy more before the change and less
immediately after.
</P>
<P>
The BRC recommended that to cut costs and ensure a minimum
impact on inflation, the single currency should be launched in a
quiet trading season, best in February, instead of January as it
is one of the busiest periods of the year for UK retailers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BRC said that retailers needed at least three
years advanced notice to make preparations for switching currency.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Bosnian Serb in Bihac Causes International Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- An international police force
spokesman for Bosnia's Sector West said today that there was great
concern about the trial in Bihac of unlawfully arrested Bosnian
Serb civilian Milorad Marceta.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Alun Roberts said that the International Police Task
Force (IPTF) in Bosnia and the U.N. Center for Monitoring Human
Rights Practices were greatly concerned about the way the trial
was being conducted, according to the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Roberts told a news conference in Banja Luka, the largest Serb
city in northwestern Bosnia, that Marceta, who had been arrested
in Prijedor, was brought to court in the Muslim city of Bihac, in
the western tip of Bosnia, Friday without first having been
allowed to meet with his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
The investigative judge had offered no evidence to support the
charge before the court ruled to remand Marceta in custody for a
further 30 days, Roberts added.
</P>
<P>
He said IPTF commissioner Peter Fitzgerald had filed a protest
with the Muslim-Croat Federation's Interior Ministry, requesting
evidence in support of the war crimes charge against Marceta.
</P>
<P>
However, no evidence has so far been submitted and Marceta is
not on the indictment list of the Hague-based War Crimes Tribunal
for Former Yugoslavia, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
The war crimes tribunal has listed 75 war criminals in the
former Yugoslavia, of whom 55 are Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Roberts also spoke about organized torching and dynamiting of
Serb houses in the Drvar area, stressing that nine Serb houses had
been torched in the village of Serbic on October 25, and about 30
others had been burnt down the day before.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Sarajevo said about 100 houses have been burned
down over the past few weeks along the inner-border between the
two entities in Bosnia -- Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat
Federation -- in an attempt to block the return of refugees to
their home of origins.

<HEADLINE> Owner of Collapsed Cairo Building to be Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Higher State Security
Court today upheld a verdict of ten years imprisonment with hard
labor against the owner of a building which collapsed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the building, Kamal Mohamed Ali Awad, her husband
and their partner, an architect, were sentenced to five years by
another state security court in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The owner's husband, who was a contractor, and their partner
were accused of cheating in building materials and of having
committed a violation by building extra stories.
</P>
<P>
They were held responsible for the collapse of the building
and the killing of tenants.
</P>
<P>
The accused filed an appeal early this year before the Court
of Cassation which ordered a retrial.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven persons were killed and eight were injured when
the building collapsed following the October 1992 earthquake in
Heliopolis, where a similar tragedy took place again two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The death toll in the ill-fated 12-story apartment has climbed
to 12 since it collapsed in the northeastern Cairo suburb on
Sunday evening. About 100 persons are still buried under the
rubble.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Interior Ministry said prosecutors were
questioning the owner of the 12-story building Raouf Wissa
Ibrahim for illegally adding five stories after getting
permission to build just one more floor.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets all
finished in negative territories, with London slipping below the
key 4,000 level, undermined by new worries over interest rates and
a weak dollar.
</P>
<P>
British shares fell sharply, closing at 3,993.5, 31.8 points
lower on the FTSE 100 index as the market was kept in a downbeat
mood by stronger-than-expected UK money supply figures today and
by Wall Street's weak performance.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that Wednesday's monetary meeting between
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Governor of the Bank of England
Eddie George could spark profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
On the Frankfurt market, German shares reversed Monday's gains
and ended weaker in response to losses sustained on Wall Street,
with the DAX-30 share index down 30.21 points at 2,673.62.
</P>
<P>
Market players also blamed a weaker dollar and the German
economic institutes' warning of a possible rate tightening.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse finished 24.65 points down at 2,125.74 on the
CAC-40 index as the market was under pressure throughout the day's

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Bodies Cut Aid to Refugees in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- International humanitarian
organizations have announced a reduction of refugee aid to
Yugoslavia in 1997, with relief sent only to the most needy.
</P>
<P>
Head of a delegation of the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies to Yugoslavia, Hannes Haukson,
said here today that the duration of the humanitarian crisis in
Yugoslavia had "fatigued" donor countries.
</P>
<P>
Haukson said the reduction of funds, which was begun this year,
would be extended to next year as well.
</P>
<P>
The federation has in the past few years, in cooperation with
the Yugoslav Red Cross, supplied a large quantity of medical
equipment, items for personal care, medicine, clothes and footwear
for 430,000 refugees, and soup kitchens for about 30,000 people,
and provided sociological and psychological programs.
</P>
<P>
The federation's plans for next year will depend on the speed
of repatriation of refugees to Bosnia and Croatia, and the
integration of refugees into local environments, said Haukson. The
refugee repatriation process has been going on slowly this year
and only a few hundred refugees in Yugoslavia have been sent back
to Bosnia and Croatia with the help of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
"A census has shown that more than 60 percent of the 650,000
registered refugees in Yugoslavia wish to remain in the host
country, so that we will adjust our programs depending on
solutions undertaken by your government," the Red Cross official
told local reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia had the most complex refugee problem in the
region and the international community had transferred its
attention to this region since the suspension of the anti-Yugoslav
sanctions and the end of the war in Bosnia late last year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Supports Agreements Already Reached in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov Stressed here this evening his country's
support for the achievements which have already been made in the
peace negotiations between Israel and Arab parties.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia was "not only with a continuity of the
peacemaking process in the Middle East, but also with the
outcomes and agreements which have already been reached."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the end of a meeting with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi, Primakov noted that the position was
"within our policy," and defied an allegation that there was
still a long way before the final settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in the Presidential Palace and was
attended by Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Primakov denied a link between his current diplomacy in the
Middle East and a recent trip of French President Jacques Chirac
to the region.
</P>
<P>
From October 19 to 25, Chirac visited Syria, Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt, the same
countries and areas which the Russian official is visiting in a
different order.
</P>
<P>
Primakov clarified that his trip had been decided "before
three months or more."
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of results of Chirac's tour of the region,
noting that the tour demonstrated the French president's "high
concern over a progress of the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on Russia's role in the peace process,
the foreign minister said that his country had played the role
of a sponsor since the 1991 Madrid conference on peace in the
Middle East, adding that it was not always on the same level of
activity.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States co-sponsored the Middle East
peace process, but Russia's role has shrunk considerably in the
recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia has activated its policies in the region
five months before when "we felt that the Middle East peace
proccss fell in a dilemma after a certain political force came
to power in a certain country in the region," a reference to
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stressed the necessity to continue the peace process
without a "long pause because this pause will lead to the
retreat of a certain party from the agreements which have been
reached."
</P>
<P>
After arriving in the Lebanese capital this afternoon, the
Russian foreign minister held a meeting with his Lebanese
counterpart Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the end of the meeting, Primakov
said that there would not be "an Israeli aggression against
Syria on the Syrian or Lebanese Lands, or an aggression against
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the 1991 Madrid conference, there is not
anything big achieved and there is no doubt that a stalemate has
taken place in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the next stage would constitute a "crucial
starting-point" to resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In response, Boueiz announced that he and Primakov discussed
the situation in the Middle East, especially the peace process,
and issues pertaining to the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides signed a protocol of cooperation
between the two countries "which constitute a starting-point to
organize the economic ties between Lebanon and Russia."
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister arrived in Beirut from Damascus
this afternoon, on the second leg of his tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is due to leave this country Wednesday morning for
Cairo to continue his tour of the region, which will also take
him to Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian self-ruled areas and
Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Declaration on Afghanistan Finalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from eight
countries and four international organizations tonight finalized
the Tehran Declaration at the Regional Conference on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The declaration calls upon conflicting Afghan parties to
refrain from resorting to force and to settle their differences
by peaceful means through inter-Afghan negotiations, a source
close to the meeting told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The document, which will be officially published, also calls
for national reconciliation and establishment of a broad-based
government in Afghanistan, the source said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the declaration condemns the Taliban group for
violation of human rights in Afghanistan, particularly the
rights of women, though it does not specify the Taliban by name
in the document.
</P>
<P>
Another important point of the declaration is the emphasis of
cessation of foreign interference in the internal affairs of
Afghanistan, including the involvement of foreign military
personnel and the arming of various factions.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the above statement is obviously
referring to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United States because
the three countries are accused of backing the Taliban in the
fight to topple the Rabbani's government.
</P>
<P>
The participants declared in the document that they support
the decision of U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to
convene an international conference of states with interest and
influence in Afghanistan aimed at a concerted and joint search
for a political settlement in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference opened here this morning in a bid to
explore ways of finding solution to the problem of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Russia, China, Turkey, India, Iran,
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan as well as envoys of the
United Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC), the European Union and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe are present in the conference.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani today called on
the international community to end its indifference to the human
plight in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret and concern over the worsening human
plight in Afghanistan and said Iran "believes that fighting is
not the solution for the Afghan crisis and that prolongation of
war would further escalate inter-Afghan hostility."
</P>
<P>
He said that conflict and unrest in Afghanistan is not only
harmful to the region but it could also jeopardize world peace
and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran appeals to friendly regional states and
world countries for humanitarian efforts to help end the
bloodshed and alleviate the sufferings of the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Afghanistan is in the throes of a human tragedy
and any indifference to the Afghan situation from conscientious
minds is unacceptable.
