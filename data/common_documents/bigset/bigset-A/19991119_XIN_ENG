<HEADLINE> The Netherlands Registers Lowest Unemployment Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands currently
recorded 290,000 unemployed in its labor market, the lowest figure
since 1981, Dutch Social Affairs Minister Klaas de Vries said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the task now is to tap "dormant reserves" of
the labor market: older people, women with problems re-entering
the labor market, the partially incapacitated and people from
ethnic communities, among whom enemployment remains high.
</P>
<P>
Vries said that he considered it "distressing that unemployment
is four times as high among ethnic compatriots as it is among the
indigenous community."
</P>
<P>
Now the government has set itself the target of having the gap
in unemployment between the indigenous and ethnic communities
during the present term of office, the minister said at a meeting
in Maastricht concerning the situation on the Dutch labor market.

<HEADLINE> Banned Cult Claims First Victims in Vancouver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Falun Gong, the banned cult in
China, is claiming first victims in Canada's Pacific city of
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Chen Xiaolin, a 29-year-old citizen, has been hospitalized
for schizophrenia, as a result of practicing Falun Gong, her
mother has told local television this week.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolin is just recovering after weeks of life-and-death
struggle, with the help of a local psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
She refused to see any doctors or took any medicine in the
first place, believing that cult leader Li Hongzhi would come and
save her life, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
She refused nearly everything, even refused to take any care of
her new-born baby, except for reading Li Hongzhi's book Falun
Dafa, according to her mother.
</P>
<P>
The result is disastrous. Unkempt, with her hair in disarray,
she began to practice Falun Gong in pyjamas without taking baths
or changing clothes until she ran a high fever and was taken to
hospital in June, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
She was falling so ill. She couldn't eat or even drink because
of her ulcerous oral cavity.
</P>
<P>
But for the rescue efforts by the local hospital, you can
hardly imagine what would become of Xiaolin eventually, the mother
sobbed her story, not understanding why Falun Gong does not allow
believers to see doctors or take any medicine.
</P>
<P>
She denied her daughter was lunatic or had any other serious
illnesses before practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
According to Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi, if there's anything
to a practicer, that is because she or he must have been lunatic
or have serious illness before joining the practice.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Chen's suffering is arousing widespread concern in the
city, where many people have contacted her family to express
sympathy and indignation.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is right in taking resolute steps to
crackdown Falun Gong, which is even more poisonous than opium,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs banned the Falun Gong
organization on July 22, accusing the organization's cult ideas of
killing more than 1,400 innocent people across the country and
injuring numerous others since it started without legal
registration in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The government has warned that Falun Gong bears strong
resemblance to heterodox groups like Branch Davidian in the United
States and Japanese Aum Doomsday Cult, which also killed and
injured innocent people.

<HEADLINE> Rate Fears As Retail Sales Surge In UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- British retail sales rose
faster than expected last month, sparking concern interest rates
will have to rise soon to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
Volume was 0.5 percent higher than in September -- more than
double the 0.2 percent rise expected by most analysts.
</P>
<P>
During the 12 months to October, sales volumes were up 4.7
percent, according to the figures released Thursday by the Office
for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the 4.7 percent year-on-year increase in October
retail sales represents the strongest growth rate since January
1998, although it warned that monthly figures could be erratic.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the strong domestic demand will cause
fresh concern in Britain's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC),
charged with setting interest rate to hit the government's 2.5
percent inflation target.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in sales will certainly catch the eye of the MPC...
and will keep the upward pressure on interest rates in place,"
said David Coleman at CIBC World Markets.

<HEADLINE> 4 Ugandan Parastatals Recommended to Be State-Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Parliament has
recommended that four big parastatals remain in the government's
hands because they are too important to the country.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made at a session of the parliamentary
committee on national finance and economy here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The state-run enterprises are Uganda Commercial Bank Limited,
Uganda Posts Limited, Uganda Development Bank and Uganda National
Housing and Construction Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The motion concerning this matter said that these enterprises
are too important to the country's economy, suggesting that the
privatization process should be carried out with extreme care.
</P>
<P>
The country launched the privatization process of state-run
enterprises in 1991 with the establishment of the Public
Enterprises Reform and Divestiture Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
So far, 94 state-run enterprises, more than 60 percent of
country's total, have been privatized.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov Refutes West's Attempt to Meddle in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Wednesday said that Moscow is in no mood to accept Western
countries' criticism over its counter-terrorism operation in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the U.S. NBC News on the eve of
his departure for Istanbul to attend the summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Ivanov warned
that if "someone... wants to play the Chechen card, then he will
have to bear the full responsibility for the development of events
in Istanbul."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in his office at Russia's Foreign Ministry, Ivanov
made it clear he was not interested in seeing the Istanbul summit
be turned into a disciplinary session for the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of Chechnya is Russia's internal problem. In
Istanbul, Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be
respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has incurred growing criticism from the West over its
military campaign against rebel fighters in Chechnya, and the
European Union has shown increasing concern about the effects of
the fighting on civilians. In the lead up to the summit, which was
scheduled over a year ago before the Russian military operation
began, Russia has been under heavy criticism from numerous Western
governments, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
Russia responds that it holds Chechen terrorists responsible
for armed incursions into the neighboring republic of Daghestan
and a wave of bombings that killed several hundred people in
Moscow and other two Russian cities earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
In his interview, Ivanov dismissed attempts by the West to
involve itself in a solution to the Chechnya conflict. "There
is... no fixed recipe for all conflicts. In some cases, the
problems should be regulated solely by the very country in which
the conflict is taking place," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's two-month crackdown on the militants in the breakaway
republic has gained Moscow control of over 50 percent of Chechen
territory, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, however, partially blamed the West for waging an
information campaign against Moscow's attempt to control the
Chechen terrorists. "Unfortunately, we cannot close our eyes to
the fact that in the West there are forces which would like to use
the events in the North Caucasus, the events in Chechnya, to
hinder the actions of Russia, to limit its international activity,
to isolate Russia from active politics in the Caucasus, and to
limit Russia's role in this strategically important region of
Russia."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov categorically rejected claims of a Chechen humanitarian
disaster, accusing the Western media of exaggerating the plight of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Claims to the effect that the operations target civilian
settlements and that there are victims, a large number of victims
among the civilian population, are completely unfounded. This
again is an outright lie," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cote d'Ivoire Accused of Providing Passports for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda received here on Thursday Cote d'Ivoire Ambassador to
Angola and criticized the country of continuing its support for
Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and his followers, official
sources said.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Cote d'Ivoire Ambassador declared sadly that
despite the respect and friendship with the press, he would not
make any declaration.
</P>
<P>
But an official source asking for anonymity said that during
the meeting, Joao Miranda has "seriously criticized" the diplomat
for the "dubious" comportment of the Cote d'Ivoire government on
the issue of providing Savimbi and his followers with passports.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations against
the Angolan rebels, prohibiting them to go abroad, the Cote
d'Ivoire government continued to permit the rebels to use the
passports issued by its official institution.
</P>
<P>
In early 1999, the Cote d'Ivoire government announced to
confiscate and declare invalid all Cote d'Ivoire passports held by
members of the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) and their families.
</P>
<P>
But the surrender of Araujo Sakaita, one of the 28 offsprings
of Savimvi, to the government, revealed a fact that the relatives
of Savimvi are still using the Cote d'Ivoire passports.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that the Angolan government has obtained
evidence proving that Isaias Samakuva, representative of UNITA in
France, also holds the Cote d'Ivoire passport.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Greek PMs Agree to Deepen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit and his Greek counterpart Costas Simitis met here Thursday
afternoon and pledged to deepen bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the on-going Summit of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which was
held in the largest city of Turkey on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ecevit said his
country and Greece should let the United Nations and the two
parties of Cyprus deal with the Cyprus problems, a standing source
of tension between Athens and Greek, and enhance ties between the
two long-time rival neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"There is not a problem between Greece and Turkey that is
difficult to resolve," he said. "But I believe we should not add
the Cyprus question to these issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that during the stay in Turkey he saw the wish of
the Turkish people to develop friendly ties with the Greek
people. "We need to take this into account and strive to establish
a lasting and stable peace in the area," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Greek aid to Turkey, which began after a killer
earthquake in northwestern Turkey on August 17, would continue,
and that Greece would send 150 prefabricated homes for thousands
of Turks made homeless by that quake and its after-shocks.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been locked for decades in disputes over
various problems including Cyprus, territorial disputes and ethnic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and took over the northern third of the island
after a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia, which was orchestrated
by the then Greek junta.
</P>
<P>
A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state was announced in 1983 and is
only recognized by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops on the
northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Besides Cyprus, the two countries also have territorial
disputes over air space and sea limits in the Aegean. They nearly
went into war three years ago after both claimed ownership of an
uninhabited tiny island in the sea.
</P>
<P>
However, relations between them appeared to be thawing recently
after both countries lent helping hands to each other when
earthquakes rocked both countries separately in the past three
months.

<HEADLINE> GA President Asks World Television for More Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Theo-Ben Gurirab,
president of the 54th General Assembly session, Thursday called
upon the world television to give more coverage to the ongoing
conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab, who is also Namibian foreign minister, made the appeal
in his speech to the two-day Fourth World Television Forum, which
opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world television response, which is very
powerful, is weaker in covering the African conflicts in a sharp
contrast to the Kosovo and East Timor conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"No need to exaggerate, but these bloody conflicts and
humanitarian crises are virtually forgotten because there are no
television news teams to record the carnage and anguish," he said.
"No way, therefore, to jolt the collective conscience of the
world, especially those who can make a difference."
</P>
<P>
He is referring to "the far too numerous bloodletting and human
suffering in some regions of Africa," such as the conflicts
between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the ongoing humanitarian crises
in Angola, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the world television to be more concerned at
poverty in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the world population lives in the poor, third
world --in the developing world where most of the planet's
population lives, he said. "If television could impact on their
lives, through education and training programming, its success
would be unprecedented in human history."
</P>
<P>
Following the first World Television Forum held in 1996, the
General Assembly designated November 21 as World Television Day.
Some 100 representatives from 80 countries attended the current
forum and will discuss "the role of television in peace and
development."

<HEADLINE> Russia Develops Super-Fast Underwater Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian scientific
production association Region has developed a fast sea-launched
missile called Shkval, reported the Interfax news agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The missile can reach a speed of up to 200 knots (about 100
m/sec) under water. The manner of its use is as follows: after
discovering a target, the crew of a submarine, ship or the coast
guard defines its parameters -- speed, distance and vector -- and
feeds the data to the missile's automatic pilot, then the missile
is fired from its optimum depth, said Yevgeny Shakhidzhanov,
Region general director.
</P>
<P>
The missile does not have a homing warhead and follows a
computer-generated program, and is therefore absolutely proof
against disturbances, the Interfax quoted Shakhidzhanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that because of few orders from the Russian Defense
Ministry, Region developed an export modification of the missile,
Shkval-E.
</P>
<P>
Shkval-E has been released for exportation, and many countries
have shown much interest in this 21st century weapon, said
Shakhidzhanov.

BRUSSELS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government is
considering to investigate whether it is possible to speed up the
liberalization of the electricity and gas markets.
</P>
<P>
A recent energy report presented by the Dutch Economic Ministry
said the government will promote the opening-up process for
customers to choose their own energy supplier no later than 2003.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage the demand for and supply of sustainable
energy, the ministry will also try to liberalize this market more
rapidly. If necessary, the provision of wind energy will be
regulated by law, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In a liberalized energy market, the government will still
remain responsible for the prudent management of natural gas found
in the Netherlands, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The government's involvement in the NV Netherlandse Gasunie
company could change if developments in the European gas market so
gave rise, it added.

<HEADLINE> Direct Talks Assured by U.S.: Cypriot President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides Thursday said he has had assurances from the U.S. that
there will be direct peace talks on the key aspects of the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly after his arrival in Istanbul to participate
in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe summit,
Clerides said the talks are set to last for quite some time,
according to a report by the Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks, which will start on December 3, will still
be on during the Helsinki European Union (EU) summit on December
10-12.
</P>
<P>
He added the U.S. also assured that President Bill Clinton will
remain engaged and intervene by supporting the efforts by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to bring together the two sides
on the divided small Mediterranean island for talks.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have agreed
to start "proximity talks" in New York in early December, at
Annan's invitation which was extended over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The indirect talks would eventually lead to face-to-face
negotiations between Clerides and Denktash. There have been no
direct talks since 1997 as the Turkish Cypriots demanded
recognition of their breakaway state in northern Cyprus before
resumption of the negotiation, a request rejected by the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said he regarded the New York talks as a means to
establish his status before any direct negotiations could start
and hoped an agreement for confederation would be reached at the
end of the proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said he got assurances from U.S. that, should
Denktash insist on his proposal for confederation and threaten to
leave the negotiating table, the U.S. and the U.N. would
apportion blame on him and call the Turkish side to pay the
political cost.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriots-controlled north
and Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey invaded
and occupied the northern part of the island following an abortive
pro-Athens coup.

UNITED NATIONS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has taken steps to
establish a sound banking system in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK head Bernard Kouchner has signed two regulations
establishing a banking and payments authority in Kosovo and a
regulatory regime for commercial banks.
</P>

A press statement, issued by the UNMIK in Kosovo Wednesday,

The BPK will have most of the powers of a central bank, its

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Charges Bribery In World Bank Dam Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho charged eight
international construction companies from Britain, Canada and
other countries with bribery over their alleged involvement in a
multi-billion dollar dam and tunnel project partially financed by
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The companies received summonses over the past week to appear
before the Maseru Magistrate's Court on November 29 on charges
they bribed a government official who oversaw one of the largest
civil engineering projects in Africa, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The companies and individuals charged, according to Leaba
Thetsane, acting director of public prosecutions with the Lesotho
government, are: the Swiss-Swedish conglomerate ABB; Impregilo SpA
of Italy; Dumez International, Sogreah, Spie Batignolles, Cegelec
and Coyne &AMP; Bellier of France; Lahmeyer International of Germany;
Sir Alexander Gibbs &AMP; Partners of England; Acres International of
Canada; Universal Development Corp. and Electro Power Corp. of
Panama; and Concor Ltd. and Group Five Holdings Ltd. of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The former chief executive of the Lesotho Highlands Development
 Authority, Masupha Sole, was convicted in a civil court last
month of taking bribes and must pay back between 1.25 to 1.80
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 8- billion- U.S dollar dam and tunnel project was financed
mainly by South African banks during apartheid. The World Bank
contributed 150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Work began in 1987 to dam Lesotho's abundant water resources
and tunnel them north to the industrial heartland around
Johannesburg. The first phase opened last year, with additional
work scheduled to be completed in 2017.
</P>
<P>
Pamela Cox, the World Bank's country director for South Africa
and Lesotho, said her organization is eager to provide financial
and technical assistance to the case.
</P>
<P>
Under President James Wolfensohn, the World Bank has worked to
overturn an image as a lender that turns a blind eye to financial
impropriety.
</P>
<P>
The bribery charges over the Lesotho project follow a string of
 investigations into other Third World dams financed by the World
Bank and other multilateral lenders. These include Turkwell Gorge
in Kenya, Chixoy in Guatemala, Tucurui in Brazil, Itaipu on the
Brazil-Paraguay border and Yacyreta, on the border between
Argentina and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
"We're very impressed that the Lesotho government is leading
this case," said Cox.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Elaborates on China's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAPE TWON, South Africa, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top
legislator Li Peng reiterated Thursday that China firmly opposes
hegemonism and power politics and will never seek hegemony.
</P>
<P>
"This is a solemn commitment of the Chinese government and
people to the world," said Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China.
</P>
<P>
Li, in an address at the special meeting of the South African
National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, said
China, as a staunch force for world peace and common development,
will always stand by developing countries and all the other
peace-loving nations and peoples.
</P>
<P>
"China has all along pursued an independent foreign policy of
peace and developed friendly relations and cooperation with all
countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of
peaceful coexistence," he said.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, conducts economic exchanges and cooperation
with the rest of the world on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
"To open up to the outside is one of China's basic state
policies," he said, adding that China, engaged in a large-scaled
modernization drive, needs to draw on and introduce advanced
technologies, equipment and managerial expertise of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to legislation on economic and
trade matters, and will continue to protect the legitimate rights
and interests of foreign-invested enterprises in strict accordance
with the law and create a good climate to develop foreign trade
and attract foreign investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
On China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Li said China has adopted a positive attitude on its accession to
the organization and has made unremitting efforts to this end for
13 years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy is closely inter-related with the world
economy, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement reached by China and the United States
three days ago on China's WTO membership was of great
significance.
</P>
<P>
This "will help speed up China's accession process, improve and
develop the relations between China and the U.S. and contribute to
global prosperity", he said.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here on Wednesday on a six-day visit to South
Africa, the second leg of his six-nation Afro-Asian tour that will
also take him to Kenya, Israel, Palestine and Oman. He has already
visited mauritius.

NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said here Thursday that Sino-Kenyan relations are "as good as
it should be".
</P>
<P>
"When we are really in need, China is coming to our aid," Moi
said when meeting a Chinese women delegation led by Peng Peiyun,
Vice-chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China.
</P>
<P>
China has assisted Kenya to build sports facilities, hospitals,
roads and those projects are very important to Kenyans, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Moi expressed his gratitude that China views Kenya as its major
 investment center in Africa.
</P>
<P>
China understands problems which developing countries face, Moi
noted.
</P>
<P>
Just like no foreigners can tell China what is best for the
Chinese, it is Africans' responsibility to decide how to solve
their economic problems,
</P>
<P>
Moi said.
</P>
<P>
However, as Kenyans work very hard to boost economic
development, they also need assistance from friends, Moi added.
</P>
<P>
Moi also said that in terms of solving economic problems China
has been doing the best among developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, also chairperson of the All China Women
Federation, arrived here Thursday for a three-day work visit to
the east African country.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- In an attempt to resume
weapons inspections in Iraq, the United States has begun to spread
allegations that Iraq had started rebuilding military
installations destroyed by U.S. and British air bombing last
December.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times Thursday quoted the Pentagon's senior
intelligence officer as saying that the United States believed the
repairing of the destroyed military installations had been
underway in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Vice Adm. Thomas Wilson also did not rule out the possibility
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had resumed building chemical
and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The director of the Defense Intelligence Agency told reporters
in an interview at the Pentagon that he could not say
"authoritatively there is no work going on."
</P>
<P>
He only emphasized that American intelligence officials
continued to monitor Iraq's program closely but that it was easy to
hide weapons production inside legitimate commercial factories.
</P>
<P>
U.S. weapons inspectors were expelled last December while the
United States and Britain engaged air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington is trying to re-enter Baghdad by lobbying in the
U.N. Security Council to reach agreement on resuming international
weapons inspections in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Annan Seeks Partnership With World Television in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday said that the United Nations would like to
forge new partnership ties with world television in promoting
world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is on a visit to Turkey, delivered the speech to
open the Fourth World Television Forum, held at the U.N.
headquarters in New York, through satellite networks.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and development are, of course, the main goals of the
United Nations," he said. "But they are no longer the exclusive
responsibility of governments or inter-governmental
organizations."
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has increased the influence of non-governmental
actors -- including the international media -- even while leaving
millions of people in developing countries almost untouched," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"So we at the United Nations must find new partners in our
unending struggle against war and property," he said. "You in the
media, especially television, are very high on our list."
</P>
<P>
He asked, "Can television be a weapon in the fight to win
freedom from want? Can it help make the difference between war and
peace? Can it transform the response to a crisis from one of
inattention to one of television?"
</P>
<P>
"By `intervention' I do not mean necessarily the use of force,"
he said. "That is the last resort, to be used only when the worst
is happening. Rather, I mean any form of action which may prevent
violence, poverty or suffering of any kind."
</P>
<P>
At this event a few years ago, Annan asked journalists to
reflect on the concept of "preventive journalism," he said. "That
was not meant to suggest that you should deviate from your first
priority of reporting the facts."
</P>
<P>
"Equally important, by drawing attention to abuses or potential
conflicts in good time, you could give the international community
the chance to do something about them before they explode in
all-out warfare," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 representatives from 80 countries attended the two-day
World Television Forum, which began here Thursday, during which
the participants are expected to discuss "the role of television
in peace and development."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Trade Deficit Down in 10 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's trade deficit
plummeted to 4.58 billion U.S. dollars in the first 10 months of
1999, a drop of 15 percent from the same period last year, a
customs authority report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Exports benefited from trade deals Lebanon signed with other
countries, mainly Syria, Egypt and Jordan, rising to a six-year
high of 563 million dollars, 4.9 percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports affected by the slow economy, slumped to 5.15 billion
dollars, a 12 percent fall from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall in imports, customs revenues remained on the
rise, contributing 1.5 billion dollars to the state's revenues,
compared to 990 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Around 80 percent of customs revenues amounting to 880 million
dollars were collected by the Beirut Port authorities.
</P>
<P>
Jewelry exports, worth 80 million dollars, maintained their
place atop the country's list of exports with a 15 percent share
of the total.
</P>
<P>
They were followed by machinery and mechanical appliances,
valued at 78 million dollars. A distant third were base metals at
60 million dollars for a 10.6 percent share.
</P>
<P>
Electrical and mechanical appliances valued at 700 million
dollars were the top import.

<HEADLINE> Angola, WFP Sign Accord on Humanitarian Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 18 (xinhua) -- Angola and the World Food
Program (WFP) signed here on Thursday an accord on a new program
of 158 million U.S dollar of humanitarian assistance to Angola in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
This program was approved by the Executive Council of WPF on
October 20 and will be effective during the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Minister of Assistance and Social Reintegration
(MINARS) Albino Malungo and WPF representative Francesco Strippoli
attended the signing ceremony and signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Malungo told the press after the
signing ceremony that his country need some 200 million dollars in
the coming year for helping at least 3 million refugees in need.
</P>
<P>
According to the new plan, WFP predicted that it will provide
the MINARS with 211,000 metric tons of basic alimentary goods for
1.13 million people affected by the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Strippoli said that with this project, WFP will have the
capacity to continue its work in Angola in 2000, and will
guarantee the sending of over 200,000 tons of corns, beans, powder
of soybean, oil and other products, the quantity of which can help
more than one million people, mainly under the age of five.

<HEADLINE> General Motors Positive About Chinese Market After WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The world's leading
automobile maker, General Motors, said it will continue its
cooperation with Chinese automobile producers after China joins
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
WTO entry will not at all affect our plan of business expansion
in China, and we are satisfied with the cooperative relationships
with motor producers in Shenyang and Shanghai, G. Richard Wagoner,
president and chief operating officer of GM, said today.
</P>
<P>
Wagoner, together with 12 other senior GM managers, today
visited the Jinbei General Co, one of GM's two joint ventures in
China set up in 1992 at a cost 130 million U.S. dollars. It will
produce Chevrolet jeeps and pickups in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Wagoner said that China has the greatest potential for the
automotive industry of any country in the world, and the entry
into the WTO will not just benefit China, but other countries as
well.
</P>
<P>
Further opening up to the outside world in the future will
bring stronger competition to China, but competition also means
more opportunities, he added.
</P>
<P>
GM will bring more high-tech products to China, improve its
service, and bring more convenience to its Chinese customers to
hold a larger market share, said Wagoner, who flew to Shenyang
last night from Shanghai, where GM has a joint venture with local
partners.

<HEADLINE> Ice Sheet of Arctic Melting Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The sheet of ice floating atop
the Arctic Sea has thinned out by 40 percent over the past four
decades, according to Canadian Arctic oceanographers.
</P>
<P>
They say that the ice has gone from a thickness of around three
meters to less than two in that time, and is now becoming 10
centimeters thinner every year.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa Citizen newspaper Thursday quoted a Canadian
researcher as warning of "a startling result" that might be linked
to global warming.
</P>
<P>
Richard Pawlowicz, an oceanographer at the University of
British Columbia, said scientists discovered in 1994 that the
temperature in the depths of the Arctic Sea had been warming.
</P>
<P>
Over the past century, the average surface temperature of the
Earth has risen by about half a degree Celsius; but in parts of
the Arctic, the rate of increase has been much faster, the
oceanographer indicated.
</P>
<P>
Pawlowicz said they know the current temperature, but have yet
to know how warm it was for "Old Arctic" for lack of data out
there.
</P>
<P>
"That's still the 64,000-Canadian dollar (about 43,520 U.S.
dollar) question," he added.
</P>
<P>
Although the oceanographers say global warming might trigger or
accelerate climate changes in the Arctic, they do not think their
study proves a direct correlation between global warming and the
melting of the Arctic ice.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by a group of American and Canadian
Arctic oceanographers, who compared data collected between 1958
and 1976 with those gathered from 1993 to 1997.

<HEADLINE> Africa Encouraged to Develop Organic Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Southern African
countries have been encouraged to venture into organic farming in
light of declining soil fertility and crop yields.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the two day regional seminar of
organic farmers and processors in Lusaka on Thursday, the Zambia
National Farmers Union (ZNFU) president Ajay Vashee said soil
fertility and crop yields were declining at an alarming rate,
evidenced by the structure of some landscapes in the region.
</P>
<P>
To save and regenerate the soil, increase yields and
profitability, both small-holders and commercial farmers needed to
find ways of reducing costs of their inputs, increase the value of
their outputs and practice sustainable methods of production.
Organic agriculture offered a viable opportunity to address these
issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international organic market was the fastest
expanding food and beverage sector across the western world, he
said, adding that the organic product market was expected to jump
from roughly one percent to 12 percent of the food sales in the
major markets in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Organic foods are grown with a commitment to respect biological
and ecological processes. Organic farming is based on improving
the soil's structure and fertility, and ensuring a balanced choice
of crops. Characteristics of organic farming include the use of
organic materials to maintain organic matter and nutrients in the
soil.
</P>
<P>
The major markets offer good prospects for organic products
which are typically imported, such as coffee, tea, cocoa, tropical
fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the seminar, over 100 countries

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Lauds African Role in Int'l </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAPE TWON, South Africa, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top
legislator Li Peng on Thursday lauded the "increasingly greater
role" by African countries in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress of China, was addressing a special meeting of the South
African National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has always been a positive factor to promote world
peace and development and has always been an important force to be
reckoned with on the international arena," Li said.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful, stable, prosperous and strong Africa "is vital to
global peace, stability and development and will have a profound
and far-reaching impact on mankind's progressive cause in the 21st
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many African countries have made positive progress in
exploring a political model and development path suited to their
national conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The regional cooperation is picking up speed and the process
of building up African countries' strength through unity is
gaining momentum," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, is very much gratified to see that African
nations, guided by the spirit of "self-respect, self-improvement
and self-reliance", are meeting various challenges through united
and collective effort.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China-Africa relations, Li said such relations
have been developing in both width and depth.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed China's five-point proposal on the establishment
and development of a 21st century-oriented relationship of
long-term stability and full cooperation with African countries.
The proposal was put forward by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
during his visit to Africa in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Li said Jiang's recent proposal for the convocation of a "Forum
on China- Africa Cooperation -- Ministerial Conference Beijing
2000" shows once again "the sincere desire on the part of the
Chinese government to further strengthen the friendly relations
between China and Africa and to promote unity and cooperation
among developing countries. "
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese and the African peoples have always treated each
other as equals and have supported, sympathized with and helped
each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here on Wednesday on a six-day visit to South
Africa, the second leg of his six-nation Afro-Asian tour that will
also take him to Kenya, Israel, Palestine and Oman. The first leg
is Mauritius.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Workers Risk Time Pressure, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of employees
consistently working under severe time pressure has increased to
1.95 million, or 33 percent of the active labor force of the
Netherlands, a recent survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by Statistics Netherlands on working
conditions said the transport industry and healthcare are among
the hard-hit sectors in this regard over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
More and more people are working at a monitor, while physically
taxing work by contrast is on the decline, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 550,000, or 9 percent of employees were exposed to
harmful noise, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government is seeking to improve the working
conditions in businesses by concluding health and safety at work
covenants between employees and employers and the public
authorities.

ATHENS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Thursday that next month's New York talks
between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash would have no impact on talks on Turkey's
candidacy at the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
After talks with his visiting Cypriot counterpart, Sokratis
Hasikos, Tsohatzopoulos said that the prospect of progress in the
talks on Cyprus was a separate issue both from Turkey's bid for EU
membership and Cyprus' course toward the EU.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Greece supported Turkey's accession to the
EU if the preconditions set by the EU were met.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the EU summit in Helsinki next month
was critical because it will discuss Turkey's EU candidate status
and ensure Cyprus' unhindered course to join the EU.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prepared to Offer Support for Congo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States is prepared
to offer material and financial support to end the 15-month
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is prepared to spend one million U.S. dollars
supporting the implementation of the Lusaka peace accord provided
the Congress approves, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
African Affairs Susan Rice said in a wide ranging interview on the
Congo issue with Zimbabwean journalists via the Worldnet satellite
dialog program.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. strongly supports the Lusaka peace accord. Congo is
a source of great concern to the U.S. and the entire southern
African region," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rice said her country strongly supported three main components
of the peace accord reached in Zambian capital Lusaka in July this
year: the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC,
withdrawal of foreign troops and the democratic transition of the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
She said the success of the accord depends strongly on the
commitment of the parties involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"There is no excuse for any parties to violate this agreement
as the accord has all the elements to achieve a sustainable
peace," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese civil war has sucked in half a dozen foreign
armies, with Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia all sending in troops to
fight on Kabila's side.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda support two rebel groups which are fighting
to topple Kabila's government.

<HEADLINE> Dubai Air Show Ends Without Big Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Dubai 2000 aerospace
exhibition closed on Thursday with deals worth only 713 million
U.S. dollars, much less than the 1.6 billion dollars mark set at
the last air show in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The volume of deals should have been much higher if the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States had signed their
long-delayed 7-billion-dollar-worth contract on 80 F-16 warplanes
during the five-day event.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Martin, manufacturer of the advanced planes, explained
at the show that negotiations were still going on and the deal
might be concluded later this year.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Dubai Crown Prince and UAE Defense Minister Sheikh
Muhammad Bin Rashid al Maktoum said that the two sides were
negotiating on the final price of the deal, and issues concerning
the weapons system had been solved.
</P>
<P>
The order was initially announced in May last year but has been
delayed mostly by the U.S. reluctance to hand over the so-called
source codes and master keys for weapons systems for the most
advanced F-16, known as Block 60s.
</P>
<P>
Although the volume of deal, mostly on business jets, was
slim, most exhibitors were satisfied with the event. As major
players in the aviation industry, a showing here is necessary,
because the market here has great potential, they indicated.
</P>
<P>
According to studies by Boeing and Airbus, Middle East and
North African carriers are expected to buy between 555 and 620
new planes over the next 20 years at a cost of 50 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 companies from 37 countries participated in the
biennial show held at the new Dubai Airport exhibition
center.

He said the university was committed to providing quality
international education to students in and outside the country
through an empowering academic, social and cultural experience.

<P>
The late Zimbabwean Vice-President Joshua Nkomo, represented by
his wife, was posthumously awarded a Doctor of Laws degree.

and every year it enrolls students from 20 other Commonwealth
countries.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's sub-national
campaign aimed at improving children's health in August and
September this year was a big success, an official said here

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges to Remove Ceiling on Iraqi Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia has urged the
United Nations to lift the ceiling on Iraqi oil export and double
the revenue Iraq can use to export spare parts and equipment for
its dilapidated oil industry, a U.N. diplomat said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, who asked not to be identified, said the proposal
was made as an amendment to a U.S. draft resolution circulated
Wednesday among the members of the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The current phase of the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq
will expire on November 20 and the Security Council is expected to
make a decision of whether to extend the deal or not.
</P>
<P>
The United States said Wednesday that it wants vote on the
draft resolution on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food program, which began to be
implemented in late 1996, is aimed to ease the worsening
humanitarian situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Spokesman Fred Eckhard said the Security Council is not in
session today. However, Council members are expected to hold
private discussions on the draft resolution submitted by the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Ramadan: Iraq Rejects Resolution Short of Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan reiterated on Thursday that his country rejects any
resolution by the United Nations Security Council which falls
short of total lifting of the nine-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency and Hong
Kong's Phoenix Satellite TV, Ramadan said "we will reject any
U.N. Security Council resolution short of total and comprehensive
lifting of the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
He added that any cooperation from Iraq with the Security
Council will be impossible if the council does not decide to lift
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed pessimism over the prospect of suspension
of sanction due to what he called "the U.S. domination of the
council."
</P>
<P>
He repeated Baghdad's rejection of a British-Dutch proposal to
the Security Council which recommends a conditional suspension of
the sanctions after Iraq agrees to allow U.N. weapons inspectors
to return and put its oil revenues under U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned the oil-for-food program as "a bad program,"
accusing it of contributing to the continuation of the sanctions
on Iraq which have been in place since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N.-Iraq program, now in its sixth phase, Iraq is
allowed to export limited amounts of oil every six month to
purchase humanitarian and infrastructural items for its 24 million
people.
</P>
<P>
He accused representatives of the United States at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding the endorsement of the Iraqi
contracts, which "aggravated the sufferings of the Iraqi people."

NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- East African leaders will meet

MAPUTO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth intends to
send 10 observers to monitor Mozambique's presidential and
parliamentary elections scheduled for December 3-4.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the Commonwealth

former foreign minister of Barbados.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Financial Sector Reform in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Thursday a loan of 506 million U.S. dollars to support financial
sector adjustment and reform in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The loan is part of a revised World Bank strategy for Colombia
that intensified lending through to 2001 to assist the country in
promoting peace, in easing the impact of the recession on the
poor, and in rebuilding after last January's earthquake. It is
also part of a 1.4-billion-dollar package announced in September
to help bolster Colombia's economy.
</P>
<P>
"This financial sector adjustment loan reflects the World
Bank's confidence in Colombia's wide-ranging refrom strategy,
which is critical to its effort to overcome the recession," said
Andres Solimano, director of the World Bank's program in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The loan approved Thursday supports a project to implement
recent reforms of financial sector legislation and regulations to
strengthen supervision of banks and deposit insurance.
</P>
<P>
It aims to minimize recourse to general budget revenues to
support financial sector refrom, thereby reducing the impact on
other sectors. It will also promote timely, fair and efficient
resolution of banks facing solvency problems, as well as provide
funds for bank restructuring and recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
The package complements an agreement reached in September
between the Colombian government and the International Monetary
Fund on a financing program totaling 2.7 billion dollars, as well
as support from the Inter-American Development Bank, the
Corporacion Andina de Fomento, and the Fondo Lationamericano de
Reservas.
</P>
<P>
The fixed-spread loan from the World Bank is denominated in
euros 482.3 million, with 17 years maturity, including a five-year
grace period, and an option for automatic rate fixing.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Demands an End to Embargo Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Vietnamese
Foreign Ministry Friday asked to immediately end embargo against
Cuba when he was answering a question on Vietnam's reaction
towards the recent ninth summit of Latin American countries, Spain
and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has always demanded an immediate end to the
unreasonable and inhumane four-decade embargo against Cuba, said
the Vietnamese spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The summit is a significant victory achieved by the Cuban
people in strengthening its friendship and cooperation with other
countries despite the U.S.-imposed tough embargo against Cuba, the
spokesman said, adding that this has shown Cuba's unceasingly
growing prestige, role and international status in the region and
the world.
</P>
<P>
The Havana Declaration, once again, manifests the international
community's common stance of protesting against the anti-Cuba
embargo, the spokesman asserted.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was made following the United Nations General
Assembly's eighth consecutive adoption, with an overwhelming
majority of votes for, of a resolution urging the United States to
put an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo
against Cuba.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Suffers Big Loses on Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is losing about 100 million U.S. dollars
every year because of routing telecommunications destined for
Africa through Europe, secretary general Erastus Mwencha has
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said to address the problem COMESA has initiated the
establishment of a private company (COMTEL) to build an
Asynchronous Transmission model (ATM) which would link national
systems together.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that the existing networks not adequate to
meet the needs of the users and the current practice of routing
regional telecoms traffic via countries outside the region makes
the implementation of competitive tariffs very difficult," he was
quoted by Friday's Times of Zambia newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said COMESA was optimistic that once the COMTEL project,
which estimated investment cost is 300 million dollars, comes to
full force it would benefit COMESA member states, adding that
serious investors were ready to in invest in the project.
</P>
<P>
He said the project which aims to see a reliable, efficient and
cost- effective regional telecommunications network would
facilitate economic integration in the region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese University Leaders To Get Help With Student Services (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Chinese
universities, long responsible for everything from arranging
students' room and board to fund-raising, will be getting help
with these duties so they can devote more time to education.
</P>
<P>
Some service-oriented companies are being hired at Chinese
universities to help manage the myriad details of campus life,
right down to planning menus.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhili, minister of education, said during a recent
national conference on higher education that most Chinese
universities will open their service departments to the market
within three to five years.
</P>
<P>
"The universities will not undertake all things, instead, they
will make use of outside resources as much as possible," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China has 1,021 universities with over three million students.
The Chinese government is trying to give education opportunities
to more youngsters and swell university enrollment in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
But the backward service sector and lack of dormitory space has
restricted the development of universities, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Chinese universities need to spend at
least 5.78 billion yuan (nearly 700 million US dollars) to build
dorm space of 5.78 million square meters to accommodate the
students.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said that students and
teachers cannot put their hearts into their work unless the
general services on campus are improved.

<TEXT>
<P>
Once the university enrollment rises, the market-oriented
service sector will help push forward the reform of universities,
some education experts say.
</P>
<P>
The idea for reform was initiated in the early 1980s when
students complained about the cost and taste of school cafeteria
food.
</P>
<P>
Now, some upgrades have been made and special services arranged.
For example, the food services department at prestigious Qinghua
University in Beijing has invested 24 million yuan over the past
six years to improve the dining hall.
</P>
<P>
The service company in Zhejiang University in east China runs a
supermarket with an annual income of 30 million yuan. Such
companies enjoy preferential policies on land use, taxation and
state-offered loans.
</P>
<P>
All of Shanghai's 37 universities will have their student
services open to the market by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Yang Deguang, president of Shanghai Normal University, said
that during the planned economy era, commodities were allocated by
the government, and universities had to manage their own services.
</P>
<P>
"Now the abundant market supply allows us to offload the burden,
" Yang said.

DHAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina said here Friday that Bangladesh "has played a very
important role" in the just-ended Commonwealth Summit.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on her return from the
nine-day visit from South Africa and Saudi Arabia, Hasina said
that during the four-day Durban Commonwealth Summit which ended on
November 15, she presented a four-point suggestion to cope with
the impact of the globalisation process.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions of the Bangladeshi leader included: the
developed countries should increase their Official Development
Assistance for the Least Developed Countries (LDC); the concerns
of the LDCs should be given due attention in the World Trade
Organization and other international forums; and foreign direct
investment to LDCs should be increased.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that during the summit, she had
exchanged views with leaders of many other countries and "achieved
great successes in promoting bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
As to her three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, Hasina said that
Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz assured that the Saudi
government would continue to strengthen its relations with
Bangladesh and provide fullest support to her government. " The
visit has further promoted the brotherly relations between
Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia," she said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Fails to Meet IMF Benchmarks: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has failed to meet most
of its International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility agreed benchmarks for the first half of the
year, Finance Minister Katele Kalumba said.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba, making a presentation on the stake of the economy at a
European Union-Zambia forum held in Lusaka on Thursday, admitted
that the country had been going through a very difficult time,
Zambian newspaper, The Post, reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The turbulence from last year has continued and we are still
going through a rough patch, for now largely driven by the delayed
sale of the mines and some decisions which were not taken early,"
the paper quoted Kalumba as saying.
</P>
<P>
The economic difficulties that spilled over from 1998 were
worsened by the failed Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines deal
between the government and Chilean mining parastatal, Codelco, he
stated.
</P>
<P>
He said an assessment by the IMF's experts in June this year
confirmed that Zambia was out of the program through its failure
to meet most of its benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister admitted Zambia will not achieve this
year's inflation target of 15 percent. "The more realistic goal
could be 20 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
He promised to release information on inflation reduction as
soon as the information is ready.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry had, through massive consultations with
the local IMF representatives, managed to address most of the
benchmarks not met.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba said he was, however, looking forward to the IMF
carrying out a further assessment to confirm that Zambia was back
on the IMF program targets.

<HEADLINE> Hingis, Venus Advance to Chase Championship Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- It will be round two in New
York for Martina Hingis of Switzerland and Venus Williams of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Both scored straight-set victories tonight at Madison Square
Garden in the quarterfinals of the Chase Championship to set up a
rematch of their September semifinal battle across the river at
the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the top seed in this tournament, prevailed in three
sets in that match only to lose in the final to Venus' younger
sister, Serena. Since then, Venus Williams has beaten Hingis twice
in as many meetings.
</P>
<P>
"It's fun playing her because she is one of the best players on
the tour," Hingis said of Williams. "It's always motivation and
challenging to go out there and try to beat her. It's another
semifinal. At the U.S. Open, I won (vs. Williams) the last two
times. I won here last year so I don't want to go out of here as a
loser."
</P>
<P>
Hingis needed only 58 minutes tonight to dispatch erratic Mary
Pierce of France, 6-1, 6-2. Hingis was in control throughout,
confidently hitting winners off both wings and venturing to the
net to knock off sharp-angle volleys against the fifth seed.
</P>
<P>
"I guess I feel pretty good. I think it was a pretty good match,
" said the Swiss teenager, who faced only three break points in
the match. "I always had a better answer to what she tried to do.
I just served very well."
</P>
<P>
Hingis leads the WTA Tour with seven titles in 1999 but has
come up short in the last two finals in which she has appeared.
She lost to Venus Williams in her homeland tournament in Zurich
last month and fell to Lindsay Davenport in Sunday's final of the
Advanta Championships in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Williams had a little more trouble,
dispatching Austria's Barbara Schett, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
</P>
<P>
Appearing in her first Chase Championships, Williams never lost
her serve as she dispatched the Austrian in a hard-fought 80
minutes. She broke Schett in the seventh game of the first set,
closing it out in the 10th game when Schett hit a service return
long.
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to play better than yesterday. As long as that
happened, that was OK," Williams said. "I didn't lose serves. I
didn't take opportunities from myself by losing a serve."
</P>
<P>
Williams lost only three points (34-of-37) when she got her
first serve in, and lost a total of 16 points on 66 serves overall.
</P>
<P>
The second set was a battle throughout as neither player lost
serve. Williams appeared sharper in the tie-breaker and showed her
confidence on the changeover after the sixth point by jumping over
the net instead of walking around it.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't jumped the net since I was so little," she said. "
See, I was going around. It seemed like such a long ways. She was
going to beat me around the net, so I was going to jump it."
</P>
<P>
Williams dispatched Schett on her first match point when the
Austrian was barely able to get her racket on a serve.
</P>
<P>
Williams, whose younger sister pulled out of the event on
Tuesday, fired nine aces as she consistently served between 110-
114 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Williams qualified for the exclusive 16-player
field last year but was forced to withdraw due to a knee injury.
She has reached 10 finals this season, taking the crown in
Oklahoma City, Key Biscayne, Hamburg, Rome, New Haven and Zurich.
However, she was somewhat overshadowed by Serena, who claimed the
family's first Grand Slam singles title at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Davenport, the second seed, will play Anke Huber of
Germany and No. 6 Nathalie Tauziat faces Dominique Van Roost of
Belgium in the other quarterfinal matches on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis defeated the then top-ranked Davenport in four sets in
last year's season finale.
</P>
<P>
This event, which gathers the top 16 players in the world,
offers a $500,000 first prize from a total purse of $2 million.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Istanbul Summit Ends, Major Documents Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
concluded here on Friday after participants completed addresses on
the issues of their concern and adopted several major documents.
</P>
<P>
The addresses by the heads of state and government or their
representatives from 54 OSCE member states centered on
organization's future role, arms control, regional conflict,
economic cooperation, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
Major documents including an Adaptation Agreement on the
Treaty on the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty),
the Charter for European Security and the Istanbul Summit
Declaration were adopted and signed at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
The adaptation agreement signed by the 30 parties to the
treaty on Thursday is aimed at further cutting the number of
warplanes, tanks and other heavy non-nuclear weapons and at
enhancing the weapons verification measures.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the group structure of the treaty,
originally set up to maintain a balance of forces between NATO
and Warsaw Pact, is replaced by a system of national ceilings on
major military weapons and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The CFE Treaty was signed in Paris on November 19, 1990, by
heads of state or government of the 22 members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the former Warsaw Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Following the reunification of Germany, the disintegration of
the Soviet Union, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the
separation of Czechoslovakia into the Czech and Slovak Republics
in the early 1990s, the total number of the parties to the treaty
rose to 30.
</P>
<P>
The charter, whose signing was postponed from Thursday to
Friday due to differences among member states, has been designed
to strengthen OSCE's role in early warning, conflict prevention
and post-war rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
In the charter, the OSCE member states agree to adopt the
Platform for Cooperative Security in order to enhance cooperation
between the organization and other international organizations and
 institutions.
</P>
<P>
They also commit themselves to developing the OSCE's role in
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
The member states also agree to expand their ability to carry
out police-related activities in order to assist in maintaining
the primacy of law, and to establish an operation center to plan
and deploy OSCE field operations.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul Summit Declaration highlighted the member states'
stand toward a wide range of regional issues including those in
Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, among others.
</P>
<P>
It says the Kosovo issue remains a major challenge for the
OSCE, adding the organization's mission in the area has more than
1,400 staff members and plays a vital role in the process of
rehabilitation in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the OSCE appeal all the leaders of Bosnia
and Herzegovina to take decisive steps to bring its two entities
closer together and to create a situation where persons, goods and
services can circulate freely within a single state to the benefit
of stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel was
appointed the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 2000. The outgoing
OSCE Chairman-in-Office is Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut
Vollebaek.
</P>
<P>
OSCE's next Ministerial Council will take place in Vienna in
November or December 2000, and will decide on the date and place
of the next summit.
</P>
<P>
A pan-Europe security organization currently with 55 member
states across continental Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia and
North America, the OSCE was established on January 1, 1995 on the
basis of the Convention on Security and Cooperation in Europe
(CSCE), which was only a forum.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's membership in OSCE has been suspended due to its
difference with the organization. In May this year, the U.S.-led
North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched air attacks against
Yugoslavia for its tackling of the situation in its province of
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Resume Food Aid Distribution in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) said that it will resume on Monday food aid
distribution in Burundian camps to help tens of thousands of
people there after a five-week halt.
</P>
<P>
In a press release received here Friday evening, WFP has
forged agreements with several non-governmental organizations to
receive and distribute food supplies to the regroupment camps
until a current U.N. suspension of activities is lifted.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of families living in these camps are suffering
tremendously,
</P>
<P>
and desperately need our help. These agreements will mean that
scores of people who have been surviving on very little up to now
will finally get food," Thomas Yanga, WFP's country
representative for Burundi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
 WFP and other U.N. agencies were forced to suspend most of
their activities in the small, land-locked African country
following the October 12 brutal killing of two senior U.N. staff
members while on the assessment mission in the southern part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is said to be awaiting sufficient assurances from
the Burundian government that all forces in the country would be
made to protect humanitarian workers before resuming full-scale
operations there.
</P>
<P>
Since September, authorities have regrouped more than 300,000
 Burundians into some 50 ad-hoc sites in the forested area of
Bujumbura Rural province, 10 km from the country's capital
Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Disease and malnutrition caused by the regroupment have been
taking their toll on the weakest camp residents.
</P>
<P>
During the U.N. suspension, WFP has still been providing
much-needed food stuff to feeding centers, hospitals, orphanages
catering to the country's most vulnerable. More than 60,000
people have continued to be fed as a result of these efforts.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Urged to Speak With One voice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has urged developing
countries to speak with one voice and vehemently oppose the
introduction of new areas of negotiation at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) conference to be held later this month in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an ISO9002 certificate awarding ceremony, J.A.
Abalaka, Director-General of the Standard Organization of Nigeria
, said the purpose of developed countries at this conference is to
expand their markets in developing countries, This Day newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries using their superior technology have made
accurate projection that the available market has become too small
to accommodate the products of their rapidly expanding technology
and therefore sought to expand the market globally, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many developing countries, he said, has found it increasingly
difficult to even sell their products within their local markets.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he added, the markets in most developing countries
has become a dumping ground for sub-standard and cheap products.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, has led to a situation where developing
countries are at the receiving end in all fields of the
globalization and liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Christie, Sotomayor Cases Go to Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The doping cases of British
sprinter Linford Christie and world high jump record holder Javier
Sotomayor of Cuba will go into arbitration by a panel of the
International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF).
</P>
<P>
The IAAF council decision announced on Friday means that
Christie and Sotomayor will have to serve a two-year ban if the
panel rules that their positive doping results were sufficient for
a disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
Christie tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone at
an indoor meeting in Germany last February but was cleared later
by the British governing body U.K Athletics.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Sotomayor tested positive for cocaine at the Pan-American
Games in Winnipeg, Canada, last July.
</P>
<P>
Other doping cases that the IAAF decided to refer to
arbitration are those of hurdler Gary Cadogan, world junior shot-
put silver medalist Carl Myerscough, and sprinter Doug Walker, all
Britons.
</P>
<P>
The council also referred the case of Israeli men's high jumper
Itai Margalit, yet another athlete to test positive for nandrolone,
to arbitration.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: CRC, Milestone in Improving Children's Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- East and West, the
world has been seeing the commemoration of a milestone -- the 10th
anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the
Child (CRC) over the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The 54th General Assembly (GA) session on November 11 marked
the adoption of the CRC on November 20, 1989, and hailed the
convention as the great legal and ethical instrument for promoting
and protecting the rights of all children.
</P>
<P>
The GA commemoration is but one of many events that have been
taking place worldwide to mark the 10th anniversary. The number
and diversity of these events is a testament to the remarkable
success of a treaty that has been ratified with unprecedented
speed by virtually the entire community of nations.
</P>
<P>
What is also remarkable is the broad range of actors who have
gathered, in this anniversary year, to reaffirm their commitment
to the cause of child rights -- including representatives of
governments, international groups, U.N. agencies and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), children and their
families, academics and professional groups -- indeed, the whole
diverse mosaic that is civic society.
</P>
<P>
The broad participation symbolizes something very special about
the convention, something that gives it unique importance and
authority, for the convention has entered into public
consciousness in a way that no other treaty ever has.
</P>
<P>
In reality, it became the centerpiece of a global movement, a
movement that reflects a growing awareness of the importance of
safeguarding human rights -- and child rights in particular. Its
effects can be seen everywhere.
</P>
<P>
"On Saturday, November 20 -- the 10th anniversary of the CRC --
we will celebrate three things," Carol Bellamy, executive director
of the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), said. "The global resolve
that brought the convention into existence; the positive changes
it has spurred; and, not the least, the enormous potential it
still holds for guiding us in fulfilling what we have universally
declared to be our children's fundamental rights."
</P>
<P>
The CRC came into force on September 2, 1990 after being
ratified by the necessary 20 states. It was by far the most
rapidly ratified human rights convention in history, and has since
approved by 191 nations, also a record.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the U.N. system has been attaching great importance to
the implementation of the CRC. The president of the 54th GA
session, Theo-Ben Gurirab, declared the fulfillment of child
rights must be a priority for the 188-member General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
On August 25, the U.N. Security Council, which has the primary
responsibility for maintaining world peace and development, has
adopted a groundbreaking resolution on children in armed conflict
-- a major step elevating the plight of tens of millions of
children victimized by war to the very center of the world's peace
and security agenda.
</P>
<P>
But there is more. New agreements now exist to ensure legal
safeguards in the process of inter-country adoption, to prevent
the worst forms of child labor, to fight impunity for war crimes
committed against children, and to combat the scourge of
landmines.
</P>
<P>
At present, U.N. peacekeeping missions include training in
child rights and child protection, as well as the designation of
specific personnel to focus on child protection within the broader
peacekeeping mandate.

<HEADLINE> PNA Concerned Over Lebanon's Accusations on Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has expressed concerns over recent accusations by
the Lebanese Information Ministry that the Palestinian leadership
was relinquishing Palestinian refugees and their right to return
home.
</P>
<P>
"We are stunned by the Lebanese Information Ministry's attitude
and unfounded accusations," the Arabic-language Al Ayam daily
Friday quoted Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Tayeb Abdel Rahim as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people are indivisible whether they lived in
camps or on national soil. It is ridiculous to claim that the
Palestinian Authority has relinquished the refugees or their right
to return home," said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the issue of refugees is one of the thorniest
issues to be addressed in the final-status talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He termed the move by the Lebanese side as a plot aimed at
evicting refugees rather than settling them. He added that the
siege imposed on the refugee camps, the tight means of living and
other measures are together aimed at evicting the Palestinians.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian depositors can now
take advantage of a gold deposit scheme to earn interest ranging
from three to four percent on maturity periods from three to seven

</P>
<P>
The minimum amount of gold acceptable under the scheme was kept
at 200 grams and the depositors could be individuals, trusts as
well as companies.
</P>
<P>
The gold deposit certificate issued under the scheme would be
transferable by endorsement and delivery and there was a
possibility of development of a secondary market also, SBI said.

DUBAI -- Global demand for gold in the third quarter of 1999
stood at 876.5 tons, up by 22 percent over the corresponding
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The demand for gold has increased in the third quarter by 8
percent over the second quarter, the Al Hayat newspaper Friday
quoted latest statistics from the World Gold Council as saying.

<P>
ALGIERS -- The Algerian Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery
has adopted a series of measures to promote agricultural
production which has been suffering from a drought.
</P>
<P>
This year's drought has brought the country's cereal production
down to 2 million tons, down by 30 percent from that of last year,
the Algerian News Agency reported.

The Ministry will offer loans to farmers to buy seeds as soon
as possible, provided that they promise to repay and sign a

</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)

"UAE entertains a free and flexible economy," which is
supported by huge potential in natural gas and petroleum, the Al
Hayat daily Friday quoted President of the Central Bank Mohamed

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Li Lanqing today
said that education of juveniles should be strengthened and the
healthy growth of young people be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
made the remarks Thursday evening when he went to an exhibition
arranged to call social attention to preventing juvenile
delinquency.
</P>

The vice premier said that prevention and reduction of juvenile
delinquency not only concerns young people and their families, but

He stressed that the key for preventing and reducing juvenile
delinquency is education, adding that proper education for

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan to Put Priority on Gas Pipeline Linking Pakistan: Vice PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Vice Prime Minister
and Defense Minister of Turkmenistan Batyr Sardjaev Friday said
his country will give priority to huge projects including a long
gas pipeline linking Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He was talking to newsmen soon after his arrival here this
afternoon on a week-long official visit to Pakistan. He is heading
a five-member delegation and will call on Pakistan's Chief
Executive General Pervez Musharraf on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Other gigantic projects linking the two countries include
laying electricity and railway line from Turkmenistan to Pakistan,
according to Sardjaev.
</P>
<P>
The vice prime minister said the "main thing of cooperation

<P>
MANILA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid is scheduled to meet with Chairman Hashim
Salamat of the Philippine largest Muslim rebel group in Mindanao
later this month, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Indonesian leader was confirmed in a letter to
Chairman Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM) by the Indonesian Ambassador to the Philippines dated
November 18, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Misuari is also the chairman of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Chairman of the Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD).
</P>
<P>
The MILF was a breakaway faction of the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
SPCPD Spokesman Charlie Apostol was quoted as saying that the
visit of the Indonesian president was the result of bilateral
talks held between Wahid and Philippine President Joseph Estrada
during the former's visit to Manila on November 9.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is set to be held in General Santos city, South
Codabato province on the southern tip of Mindanao, because the
airport in "that city is not far from Jakarta."
</P>
<P>
Apostol quoted Misuari as saying that the meeting is a "simple
brotherly visit of a Muslim brother concerned with his problem,"
obviously referring to the ongoing MILF and military conflict in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
However, no agenda was released for the meeting. Apostol said
details of the visit will be announced later.

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Opposes U.S House Joint Resolution on Falun Gong: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China is strongly opposed to a
joint resolution of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S.
Senate on the issue of Falun Gong, Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the joint resolution, which was passed by
the House Thursday, Sun said abundant evidence proves that Falun
Gong is neither a religious organization nor a group that merely
practices qigong, but a cult that harms the Chinese society and
people.
</P>
<P>
He said that it would not be difficult for any open-minded
people to understand the true nature of the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
However, a handful of members of the U.S. House of
Representatives manipulated the passing of the resolution bill
with only seven or eight members present for the vote before the
House adjourned, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the resolution, which makes groundless
accusations and viciously attacks the Chinese government's lawful
handling of the cult, has grossly infringed upon China's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
China strongly urges those House members to respect the facts,
refrain from employing double standards when it comes to cults,
and stop intervening in China's domestic affairs under the pretext
of the Falun Gong issue, Sun said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang said Friday China's imminent accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the decision to build the
Hong Kong Disneyland would significantly spur Hong Kong's economy
and the labor market.
</P>
<P>
"The further liberalization of China's market following its
accession to the WTO will create new business and employment
opportunities for Hong Kong," Tsang said after chairing the 16th
meeting of the Task Force on Employment.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong Disneyland will open up a new page in Hong Kong's
history as an international tourism destination. It will generate
many new jobs in the near to medium term," he added.
</P>
<P>
Phase I of the development will generate direct economic
benefits not only for the tourism industry, but also indirect spin-
off effects to the rest of the economy, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to produce an estimated 148-billion-HK
dollar (19 billion U.S. dollars) boost to the economy over a 40-
year period.
</P>
<P>
Around 16,000 man-years of construction employment will be
created arising from the land formation work, the construction of
infrastructure and other facilities for Phase I of the theme park,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Upon its opening in 2005, the theme park will generate a total
of 18,400 new jobs, and rising to 35,800 jobs when the theme park
matures.
</P>
<P>
"Around 80 percent of the 35,000-odd new jobs, or some 28,700
jobs, are at the elementary level which can be filled by young
school leavers as well as our low-skilled workers," Tsang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIZHOU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- After decades of work, China
has built up an all-but-complete system of wildlife and bio-
diversity protection.
</P>
<P>
The country has established 630 preservation zones of various
kinds, covering a total area of 61.5 million hectares, accounting
for 6.41 percent of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
Of the 94 nature reserves in China, 15 have been listed among

</P>
<P>
China has also built 230 wildlife breeding farms, 14 wildlife
protection centers and 18 offices to control the import and export

<HEADLINE> Adaptation Agreement on CFE Treaty Signed at OSCE Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, November 19 (Xinhua) -- An Adaptation Agreement on
the Treaty of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty),
which is mainly aiming at further weapons reduction, was adopted
here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Heads of states and governments or their representatives of 30
CFE Treaty members, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said the Adaptation Agreement is "the most comprehensive arms
control treaty in Europe" and is the result of almost three years
of hard negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Its adoption has been high on the agenda of the ongoing summit
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
which started Thursday morning and will conclude later Friday
focusing on arms control, regional conflicts, economic cooperation
and especially the organization's future role.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the treaty's group structure,
originally set up to maintain a balance of forces between NATO and
Warsaw Pact, would be replaced by a system of national ceilings on
major military weapons and equipment.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, its zone structure, originally established
to encourage the movement of troops and equipment from the
potential line of confrontation in central Europe, would be
replaced by a series of nationally based territorial ceilings.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the treaty members are expecting the lowing of the
total amount of Treaty-Limited Equipment (TLE) permitted in the
CFE area, and the opening of the treaty to states which may apply
to join.
</P>
<P>
The CFE Treaty was signed in Paris on November 19, 1990, by 22
NATO and Warsaw Treaty Organization members, which rose to 30
following the reunification of Germany, disintegration of the
Soviet Union, dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and separation of
Czechoslovakia into the Czech and Slovak Republics in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
It provisionally entered into force on July 17, 1992, and
formally entered into force on November 9, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Since then, it has registered the destruction and conversion
into other uses of more than 50,000 battle tanks, armored combat
vehicles, artillery pieces, combat aircraft and attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, its members have conducted and accepted thousands
of intrusive on-site weapons inspections. And in January 1997,
they started negotiations to update the treaty to Europe's changed
security environment.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Lawmaker Calls for Removing PLO From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli Arab lawmaker has
launched a campaign to urge Israel to remove the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) and other Palestinian factions from
its so-called terrorist list.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, who was elected to the Knesset (parliament) in the
May elections, told the Israel Radio Friday that he has drafted a
legislation bill to the Knesset, requesting it to pass the law to
force the government to drop the PLO and other Palestinian
factions or groups from its terrorist list.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is conducting peace talks with the PLO
and negotiating a peace treaty with it, and the whole world knows
that PLO is a major political faction of the Palestinians and not
a terrorist group, Tibi said.
</P>
<P>
Tibi said he would lobby the Knesset for passing his bill while
seeking support from the Supreme Court in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Tibi, an Israeli Arab from the Arab Balad party and one of the
ten Israeli Arab Knesset members, served as advisor to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat before Israel's May elections.
</P>
<P>
Tibi, a supporter to the Middle East peace process, also faces
a trial for allegedly "insulting and hitting" an Israeli border
police officer at a roadblock in 1998. The trial was suspended
when he was elected to the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The State Attorney's Office has requested the House Committee
to lift Tibi's parliamentary immunity to pave the way for the
trial.
</P>
<P>
Tibi on Wednesday asked the Committee to do so to enable him to
tell the truth in court on how he was badly treated by the Israeli
police.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), all Arafat's advisors, PNA cabinet ministers,
members of the Palestinian National Council and Palestinian
Legislative Council and other senior Palestinian officials, are
receiving VIP treatment while crossing all checkpoints between the
territories and Israel.

<P>
ZHUHAI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A group of distinguished guests
from the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) paid a visit
today to the barracks of the troops who will be deployed in Macao
after it returns to China on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The troops of the Macao SAR Garrison of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army are currently headquartered in Zhuhai, Guangdong
Province, which borders Macao.
</P>
<P>
The more than 300 visitors included members of the Macao SAR
Preparatory Committee and Selection Committee, Macao deputies to
the National People's Congress, and Macao members of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed a 115-member guard of honor and then watched as
soldiers presented martial exercises and art performances. Many of
the visitors marveled at the excellent skills of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
They also showed interest in the barracks buildings which are a
mixture of traditional Chinese style and modern architecture.
Hearing that the barracks compound was built in only 203 days, one
of the guests said, "The army has always been known for its
speediness and I believe the Macao Garrison troops will succeed in
any fast-response maneuvers."
</P>
<P>
Later, the guests visited the troops' auditorium and then the
canteen, which can accommodate 400 people at one meal. More than
100 kinds of dishes and snacks there drew the visitors' attention.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Garrison's officers and soldiers left a deep
impression on the guests during their stay there.
</P>
<P>
The visitors agreed that there are many gifted people among the
garrison troops. "All of them are polite, obedient and well-bred,"
one of them said. "What's more, they are well-informed on the laws,
history and life-style of Macao."
</P>
<P>
They all were of the opinion that the garrison troops will be
capable of taking up their duties and safeguarding the stability
and development of Macao.

MAPUTO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique gives priority to
transmit electric power to all its populations, said Minister of
Mineral Resources and Energy, John Kachamila.
</P>
<P>
Kachamila told a two-day meeting of Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and East African energy experts on
Thursday that less than 10 percent of the Mozambican people has
access to electrical power.
</P>
<P>
He added that Mozambique can become one of the main suppliers
of electrical power to SADC within the scope of the Southern
African Power Pool (SAPP), which is a project aimed at integrating
the SADC electricity sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that the liberalization of the Mozambican energy sector
through promulgation of the 1998 Electricity Law, the revision of
the Law on Petroleum products and the government's Energy Policy
could boost the development of the sector and would bring
dividends to the country.

<HEADLINE> Legal Service Hotline Opened in 90 Percent of China's Counties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The legal service hotline
number "148" is now opened in more than 90 percent of China's
counties, sources with the Ministry of Justice said here today.
</P>
<P>
This idea was first created in the Dongming County justice
bureau of Shandong Province in March this year. Dialing the number
"148," ordinary people can ask local justice authorities to
provide legal consultations, lawyers, notarization and other kinds
of free or paid services.
</P>
<P>
To coincide with the new policy of the rule of law, the
Ministry of Justice decided to make such a hotline available
nationwide to increase the government's role in serving the public.
</P>
<P>
Now, the "148" hotline is functioning in 2,773 counties, or 90.
9 percent of all counties in the country, and soon the entire
nation will be covered, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Shandong and Fujian provinces and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region even have hotlines in township justice bureaus and stations.
More than 20,000 people across the country are working in these
hotline operations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that the hotline
office workers provided legal consultations to 800,00 people and
received 200,000 visitors with legal problems in the first 10
months this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, justice bureaus across the country handled a
total of 170,000 legal cases transferred from the hotlines from
January to October, mediated in 60,000 disputes, and provided
legal assistance to more than 10,000 people who could not afford
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
More than 140,000 yuan of economic losses were avoided or
recovered for hotline users during the first 10 months this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice is formulating detailed rules for
hotline operations in an effort to institute a more efficient and
standardized mechanism for legal service and assistance.

HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam Nujoma
urged African leaders to give priority to education and training.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on Thursday at University of Zimbabwe
graduation ceremony where he received a degree of Doctor of Laws
for the role in the liberation of his country and Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said countries should invest substantially in the field of
science and technology education including information technology.
</P>
<P>
"It is increasingly being realized that information and
knowledge is power, hence the need to target the provision of
these to people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said national and regional peace and unity needed to be
promoted as they were catalysts for the continent's
competitiveness in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have begun the war of economic independence,
albeit against many odds imposed upon us by the industrialized
countries, especially with regard to price policies for many of
our export commodities."
</P>
<P>
"It is for that reason we are doing all we can to promote our
own economic regional groupings and regional trade alliance
through initiatives such as the Common Market for East and
Southern Africa, the Southern African Development Community and
the Organization of African Unity," Nujoma said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian House Welcomes Ouster of Senate President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's House of
Representatives welcomed the ouster of Senate President Evan
Enwerem Thursday, a local newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House Alhaji Na'Abba said Thursday that "I feel
 vindicated, very vindicated on the development," adding, "this
has reinforced the house resolution on Enwerem".
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to cooperate with the new Senate President Dr.
Chuba Okadigbo, the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper,
reported.
</P>
<P>
The house, or lower chamber of Nigeria's top legislature last
month passed a vote of no confidence in Enwerem and vowed to
boycott joint sessions of the national assembly if he was
presiding.
</P>
<P>
Enwerem was removed as President of the Senate after majority
of the senators voted Thursday to remove him for what they
described as " incompetence" at a House session which lasted just
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
The senate later voted in Chuba Okadigbo from the same
southeast zone of the country as the third most senior figure in
the country's constitutional hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
Okadigbo was, until his unanimous election, the chairman of the
senate committee on foreign affairs. He was also a special adviser
to President Shehu Shegari, who had reigned from 1979 to 1983 in
the Third Republic period.
</P>
<P>
House Representative Abdul Ningi said the development was a
good omen for the assembly and for the country in general, adding
whosoever had a skeleton in his cupboard should go.
</P>
<P>
Enwerem has been under pressure to resign since August when
Tell, a Lagos based newspaper, accused him of having a criminal
past and of lying about his age and qualification.
</P>
<P>
Representative Sule Gandi added: "Now we can work in harmonious
 relationship with our colleagues in the Senate."
</P>
<P>
Due to the boycott of the house, a planned address by visiting
Canadian Premier Jean Chretien to Nigeria's National Assembly was
canceled last week, causing the west African country great
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
"The former senate was becoming a very serious problem to the
smooth running of the senate", said Senator Mohammed Dansadau
Thursday, and " the best option left was to impeach him and bring
in another person who would carry the senators along".
</P>
<P>
Enwerem's removal should open the way for the presentation of
the 2000 budget by President Olusegun Obasanjo to a joint session
of parliament next Thursday, said experts. Both houses must
approve it before it becomes law.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor
Nam Hong and his Thai counterpart, Surin Pitsuwan, agreed in
principle here on Friday that the two countries will sign a civil
aviation agreement later this month in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will enable Thai airlines other than Bangkok
Airways to fly from Bangkok to Siem Reap, where the ancient
temples of Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom are located, according to a
Thai Foreign Ministry press release issued after a meeting between
the two ministers.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also strengthen their tourism
cooperation as about half of the tourists coming to Thailand want
to go on to Cambodia to visit the temples.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Hor Nam Hong thanked the Thai government
for its decision to return 122 ancient Khmer artifacts seized by
Thai police in January and for its serious suppression of antique
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the Cambodian government has
also decided to return cars stolen from Thailand by Cambodians to
the Thai owners.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to strengthen cooperation in
developing infrastructure in Cambodia. Cambodia wants to buy
electricity from Thailand for use in its western provinces and
wants to open a construction bid for a road from a Cambodian
border town to a Thai border town to benefit tourism cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hor Nam Hong will go back to Phnom Penh on Friday evening after
a two-day visit here.

a Small and Medium Enterprises Development Support Plan today.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at providing a comprehensive basis for better

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong ExCo Approves Disney Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Council (ExCo)
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has recently
approved the government's agreement with the Walt Disney Company
on building a Disney park in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"There are certain aspects of the agreement which need ExCo's
approval without which we cannot proceed any further with the
contracts," Mike Rowse, commissioner for tourism, said today.
</P>
<P>
The aspects which require ExCo's approval include a land grant
of 50 years plus the right to renew for another 50 years, an
option valid for 20 years to purchase the adjoining site, a Right
of First Refusal to purchase a third site adjoining the phase two
site, and entering into a Deed of Restrictive Covenant to restrict
the building height and land uses of developments in the vicinity
of the Hong Kong Disneyland (HKD).
</P>
<P>
"These approvals are important as they provide certainty and
allow for flexibility to cater for the future expansion of HKD as
well as to ensure a pleasant and complementary environment in the
vicinity of the theme park," said Rowse.
</P>
<P>
In addition, ExCo has also been given its in-principle
agreement to restricting flights above HKD and mooring of vessels
in the waters south of it.
</P>
<P>
These are essential to ensure that the operation of the theme
park will not be affected by possible unauthorized overflights and
to prevent the situation whereby large number of vessels may seek
to anchor off shore during the nightly fireworks displays which
would be hazardous.

Krirk-Krai Jirapaet, director-general of the ministry's Foreign
Trade Department, was quoted by Thailand News Agency as saying his
department has set an international standard for Thai fragrant
rice.

Thai rice exporters hail the government's move, saying it will
help boost not only exports of Thai fragrant rice, but also the

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Center Breeds 32 Giant Pandas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chengdu Giant Panda
Breeding Research Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province has
used artificial insemination to produce seven giant pandas this
year, bringing the total number to 54 over the past 20 years, with
32 surviving more than six months.
</P>
<P>
Li Guanghan, the center's director, attributed the success to a
simulated wild environment program at the center which has allowed
researchers to carry out a comprehensive study of breeding and
illness prevention of giant pandas and develop artificial
insemination technology.
</P>
<P>
Since China used artificial insemination to breed the first
panda cub in 1963, twelve zoos and one animal reserve in the world
have bred about 140 giant pandas, with about 50 surviving more
than six months.
</P>
<P>
The 30-hectare base in the northern suburb of Chengdu has been
developing breeding technology since it used frozen semen for
artificial insemination in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas only conceive one or two babies with each
pregnancy. Less than 10 percent of the center's males and 24
percent of the females are able to mate by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, two giant pandas from the center were sent to
Atlanta in the United States. They will stay there for ten years.
</P>
<P>
There are only about 1,000 surviving pandas in China found in
Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. Eighty percent of them come
from Sichuan.

LOS ANGELES, November 18 (Xinhua)-- By the end of 1999, about 1.
6 billion movie tickets will have been sold in the United States
and Canada, according to the National Association of Theater
Owners, a trade group representing movie theater companies.
</P>
<P>
The admission number will be the highest since 1959, when movie
theaters charged much less than now, with no video or Internet.
</P>
<P>
The association aims to boost annual movie attendance in North
America to 2 billion by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
"For decades prior to 1994, pundits insisted that the movie
theater industry was stagnant," said William F. Kartozian,
president of the association.
</P>
<P>
"Again and again, we would read that total admissions are flat,
stuck at about one billion annually. In five short years, these

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Preparatory Committee Finishes Jobs: Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Qian Qichen,
chairman of the Macao Special Administrative Region's Preparatory
Committee, has said that the committee has fulfilled all its tasks
during the last year and a half, thanks to the joint efforts of
its members.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark in an address to the committee's 11th
plenary session, which is also its last plenary session before the
return of Macao to China. Today's meeting was held in Zhuhai,
Guangdong Province, which neighbors Macao.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the successful work of the preparatory committee
to the great concept of "one country, two systems" put forward by
late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, the broad-ranged participation
and support by the people of Macao, and the wisdom and hard work
of the members of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming founding of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) will be the start of the overall implementation of
the principles of "one country, two systems," "Macao people
administrating Macao," and a high degree of autonomy, the vice
premier said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Macao members of the preparatory committee to support
and assist the work of the future Macao SAR government led by
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, and make new contributions to the development
of Macao, using their wisdom and power as well as experience
gained while working with the committee.
</P>
<P>
The job of forming the government of the Macao SAR has been
proceeding well under the leadership of Edmund Ho Hau Wah, Qian
said, adding that preparations for the resumption of sovereignty
over Macao by the Chinese government are also going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Macao SAR Garrison of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) has been formed, while the Office of the
Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry to the Macao SAR also
has passed the preparatory stage, according to the vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, all preparations have been accomplished for the
transfer of government in Macao, the inauguration of the Macao SAR
government, and celebrations, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
He called President Jiang Zemin's October visit to Portugal "a
complete success" and said it has pushed forward the friendly ties
between China and Portugal, and was helpful to efforts by the two
countries to strengthen cooperation on the issue of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the preparatory committee will finish along with
the end of its last plenary session and the upcoming founding of
the Macao SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said it is up to the National People's Congress Standing
Committee to decide on the end of the committee, and that the next
plenary session will be held early next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday urged world leaders
attending the European security summit in Istanbul to join forces
in fighting terrorism, saying it threatens peace in the Middle
East and across the globe.
</P>
<P>
Barak declared that terrorism is the arch-rival of peace, and
that it poses a strategic challenge not just to the Middle East
peace, but to security, stability and the way of life of the free
world.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has told Israel that it does not intend
to remove Syria from the list of states that support terrorism
"in the foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, in public statements the U.S. administration is
trying to present a more moderate line regarding Damascus. A
State Department coordinator for counter-terrorism said earlier
this month that Syria has not been directly implicated in
terrorist activity since its attempt to blow up an El Al plane in
London in 1969.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday denied that he had called
Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai "wicked" over dispute
on the government's social policy.
</P>
<P>
The episode began earlier this week when Barak ordered
Yishai's ministry to provide social services for the poor. Then
Yishai presented a budget proposal bigger than that of the Defense
Ministry. Yishai has accused Finance Minister Avraham Shochat of
misleading Barak over the budget.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is demanding 1 billion U.S. dollars of compensation
from Iraq for the damage it caused during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The demand would be put forward before a U.N. Security Council
committee in Geneva dealing with the damages from the Gulf
War. The funds are to be paid from Iraq's oil revenues.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Agriculture Hit by Worsening Water Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's agricultural sector
has been affected drastically by a worsening water crisis in the
country, said a report issued by the Agriculture Ministry Friday.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Sea of Galilee in the north of the
country has now dropped 19 centimeters below the red line of 213
meters below the sea level due to dry and hot weather, and water
experts believe that it is likely to fall further in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Sea of Galilee, also called Lake Kinneret, is the major
water resources for the whole country. Every year, it provides
millions of cubic meters of fresh water to Israel's industries,
farming communities and citizens.
</P>
<P>
More farming communities which exceeded their water quotas
will have their supplies cut because of the acute water shortage,
the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, all water resources are under the government's
control and proportional utilization of water by various sectors
has been decided by the Water Commissioner's Office.
</P>
<P>
During the last several months, the water allocation quota to
the agricultural sector has been cut by about 40 percent and the
government has allocated millions of U.S. dollars to cover the
losses of this sector.
</P>
<P>
Israeli farmers have warned that tons of fruits and other
corps are in danger of being destroyed unless there is rain in
the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The steering committee formed by the National Infrastructure
Ministry has already put forward its proposals for tackling the
water crisis, and the ministerial economic committee will discuss
the proposals next week.
</P>
<P>
Other water experts said it is essential to launch a nationwide
"saving" campaign to reduce consumption in the domestic and
industrial sectors, while increasing production of irrigation
water from purified sewage.

<HEADLINE> Asylum for Japanese Red Army Convicts in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Japanese lawers have asked
Lebanon's judicial authorities to grant political asylum to five
Japanese Red Army members imprisoned in Lebanon for illegal
residence, the Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three attorneys, who were accompanied by four journalists
from Japan, discussed the possibility of ignoring a request by
the Japanese government to extradite the five Palestinian
sympathizers once they finish serving their sentences in March,
according to Lebanese State Prosecutor Adnan Addoum.
</P>
<P>
The five Japanese are wanted in Japan on international
terrorism charges and face possible execution if found guilty.
</P>
<P>
"I clearly stated that the Lebanese judiciary hasn't received
a formal Japanese extradition request and will refuse to receive
one before the five finish serving their sentences," Addoum told
reporters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, kozo Okamoto, 51, Masao Adachi, 59, Kazuo Tohira,
46, Haro Wako, 50, and Mariko Yamamoto, 59, were each sentenced to
42 months in prison for forging documents, using false passports
and residing in Lebanon illegally.
</P>
<P>
Okamoto was the sole surviving perpetrator of the 1972 attack
on Lod Airport in Israel that left 26 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The attack was organized by the Japanese Red Army and the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Israel but was
freed along with 1,150 Palestinians in a swap for Israeli
soldiers in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which does not have an extradition agreement with
Lebanon, has informally sought the extradition of the five
since they were arrested in Lebanon on February 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
But, Beirut has turned down Tokyo's request because Lebanese
law stipulates that they must first serve their sentences
before any extradition demand can be examined.

<HEADLINE> HK Values ASEAN as Important Trading Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite the impact of the
Asian financial turmoil, Hong Kong's involvement in economic
development in Southeast Asia will not be affected in the long
run, a Hong Kong official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
But Clement Cheung, director of the Hong Kong Economic and
Trade Office in Singapore, also admitted that Hong Kong's
investment overseas, including those in Southeast Asia, would be
reduced in the short term because of the credit crunch faced by
the territory after the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Cheung made the remarks at a press conference held here Friday,
during which he briefed reporters on the 1999 policy address made
by Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and the agreement on
building a Disney theme park in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He attached importance to the economies of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), saying they contribute a lot to
Hong Kong's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian tourists account for about 12 percent of total
foreign tourist arrivals in Hong Kong while ASEAN has always been
an important trading partner to Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to cultivate the trading ties with
ASEAN countries in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong-Thailand trade has been developing healthily at an
average rate of 5.5 percent in the past five years despite the
financial crisis, Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, Hong Kong's total
exports to Thailand amounted to 8.69 billion Hong Kong dollars
(1.12 billion U.S. dollars) while imports were at 16.5 billion
Hong Kong dollars (2.12 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is also the third largest investor in Thailand
following Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
As for Hong Kong's relatively slow pace of recovery, Cheung
said it must be seen within the context of contraction.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong had not suffered as much as Thailand during the
economic downturn, he stressed. After only one year's contraction
in 1998, it renewed growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Hong Kong's economy contracted 5.1 percent while the
predicted growth rate for this year is 0.5 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economy contracted by as much as 10 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> New Int'l Container Wharf to Be Built in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- An international container
wharf with a designed annual handling capacity of one million TEUs
will be constructed in Ningbo port, one of China's largest in the
eastern coastal province of Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
The wharf will have four berths to accommodate large and super-
large container vessels, and their construction will cost 2.5
billion yuan, according to a source with the port administration.
</P>
<P>
The first berth will become operational in 2001, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo port handled 350,000 TEUs of containers last year, and
this figure increased to 500,000 TEUs during the first 10-plus
months this year.
</P>
<P>
At present, Ningbo's container shipping routes are linked to
Europe, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Southeast Asian
countries, in addition to domestic ports such as Guangzhou,
Tianjin and Dalian.
</P>
<P>
There are now as many as 182 container voyages to and from
Ningbo every month, nearly double the number in 1998.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Deposed Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif Friday denied charges against him of
attempted murder and hijacking, telling an anti-terrorist court
that he has been kept in illegal detention.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, facing possible death penalty in a case of attempted
murder, aircraft hijacking and criminal conspiracy, made his first
brief public appearance Friday amid unprecedented security.
</P>
<P>
He was presented before an anti-terrorist court in Karachi
where the proceedings continued for 40 minutes after the court
remanded him in police custody till November 22, according to
well-placed sources.
</P>
<P>
Sharif looked depressed, his ruddy face having beads of sweat
as he alighted from the armored vehicle before the court building,
according to television pictures.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister told the court that he was not told
about the charges in connection with which he had been held. He,
however, denied the charges, saying he has nothing to do with
them.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's government was dismissed in an army coup on October 12
after he tried to fire the army chief, General Pervaiz Musharraf,
now the chief executive of the country.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was accused of attempting to murder General Musharraf by
refusing the landing of a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)
plane in Karachi on October 12.
</P>
<P>
He had been kept in custody in Rawalpindi, the twin city of
Islamabad and home of the army's headquarters before he was
transferred to Karachi on early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The remand of the four other accused in the case -- former
adviser to the prime minister on Sindh affairs Syed Ghous Ali
Shah, former PIA Chairman Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former Sindh
Police Inspector General Rana Maqbool Ahmed and former Director
General of Civil Aviation Authority Ameenullah Chaudhry -- was
also extended till November 22.

</P>
<P>
Kenya's Minister for Tourism, Trade and Industry Nicholas

seasons that include devastating drought and torrential rains.
The movie is already showing in America.
</P>
<P>
Biwott praised the film crew for their hard work, which not
only helped raise funds for conservation through the box income,
but kept Kenya's name in conservation issues alive.
</P>
<P>
Biwott also said that the Kenyan government was determined to
restore the country as sub-Saharan Africa's leading tourist
destination.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia was lauded for
its outstanding management of social security and the
International Social Security Association (ISSA) said Malaysia can
be a good model to others, according to Bernama news agency
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's social security programs have good leaderships who
have brought in modern management practices, resulting in a very
measurable progress and advances, Bernama quoted ISSA
Secretary-General Dalmer D. Hoskins as saying.
</P>
<P>
Social security is an important part of the way a society
functions, the ISSA official who was here recently for an ISSA
meeting said.
</P>
<P>
He said the society that wants to participate in international
competition and globalization must have a good social safety net.
</P>
<P>
He said the more open a society is, the more its people need to
have a system to help them as the economy goes up and down.
</P>
<P>
Hoskins said the financial crisis that affected this region in
1997 and 1998 made everyone realize that no country was completely
sheltered from outside forces.
</P>
<P>
There would certainly be reforms (in social security) in
developing countries as they become more exposed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to provide social protection to
workers in the informal economic and rural sectors.
</P>
<P>
ISSA was founded in 1927 to protect, promote and develop social
security throughout the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Motorola's CEO Chris Galvin
pledged here today that Motorola will continue to stick to the
manufacturing sector and has no plans to enter the Chinese
telecommunications service sector along with China Telecom and
China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
Galvin said that Motorola will continue to build partnership
relations with China after the country's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He said China's entry in the WTO will benefit not only China
but also overseas investors like Motorola, and he pledged to work
with "other American executives who share my view to encourage
prompt action from our Congress."
</P>
<P>
Galvin believes that China's WTO commitments are complimentary
to China's own economic reform and development agenda, and will
boost investor confidence and global recognition. In addition, the
Chinese economy will integrate into the world track, and become
more open, freer, and stronger.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises will learn international business practices,
put more efforts into improving the quality of products, and
engage in research and development, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Motorola will continue to carry out its
localization strategy by expanding the use of local staff and
local content, now 80 percent of the management of the Motorola (
China) Electronics Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Galvin said Motorola will also enlarge the number of research
and development centers in China from the current 18 to 25 in the
near future. At the same time, the company will also strengthen
cooperation with Beijing University and several other top Chinese
universities.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Two South African companies are
scheduled to be listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on
Friday to enhance profile of the companies across the continent of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The companies to be listed in Nigeria are Electronic Media
Network Limited of South Africa (M-Net) and Supersport Limited,
according to a This Day report Friday.
</P>
<P>
The development is the first cross-border listing to be
recorded in the 38-year-old secondary market in the West African
country, which will give Nigerian investors the opportunity to
invest abroad through local stock market.
</P>
<P>
The shares of the two companies will be listed as
M-Net/Supersport in a separate subsector on the stock exchange and
are available at either in Lagos or other branches of the NSE in
Abuja, Ibadan, Kano, Kaduna, Port Harcourt and Onitsha.
</P>
<P>
The listing of the linked shares of the two companies is aimed
at enhancing corporate identity and profile of the companies
across the continent of Africa, the report quoted company's
directors as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been selected as a result of its geographical
location and its role and prominence in the West African
sub-region, M-Net's Chief Executive Polelo Lazarus Zim explained,

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to Arab League Over Fresh Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has lodged a protest to
the Arab League (AL) over a fresh Turkish military incursion of
northern Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf said in a letter to AL
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid that on October 27, the
Turkish troops launched a new aggression in northern Iraq, where a
20-tank-strong force penetrated deep into areas of Batoufa and
Kani Masi.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Turkey massed up an additional force on its
borders with Iraq in preparation to enter into the Iraqi
territories aimed at launching a wide-scale aggression, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish military engineering units in cooperation with
Turkish construction companies built a bridge inside our
territories in addition to the continuation of already existed
Turkish troops inside our territories to carry on military
operations in areas of Jabili Mateen and Kara," said Sahaf.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish troops were backed by helicopters, armored cars
and tanks and the military action has caused heavy casualties and
property damages on the Iraqi Kurdish citizens.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf described the Turkish move as a violation of Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity and air space, and flagrant
breach of the U.N. Charter and the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the Turkish claims of cracking down on elements
threatening Turkey's security, saying such pretexts could not
justify the aggression.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, the Iraqi government lost its control
over the northern Kurdish autonomous region, and Turkish
government troops often crossed the border into northern Iraq to
chase rebels of the outlawed Turkish Kurdish Workers' Party who
have sought shelter there.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf called on the Arab League to live up to its
responsibilities as a regional political organization, reject the
recurrent aggression and demand the Turkish government stop
such aggressive acts.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Cooperate With Asia-Pacific Nations in Space Applications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China Committed itself on
Friday to cooperation with Asia-Pacific countries in space
applications for sustainable development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 2nd Ministerial Conference on Space Applications
for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific, Hui
Yongzheng, China's vice-minister of science and technology, said
no country on earth can single-handedly meet the challenges of the
space age.
</P>
<P>
The exploration of resources of outer space calls for global
efforts and should be conducted for the benefit of the people all
over the world, Hui told the meeting which opened here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In their pursuit for sustained economic development, the
Chinese official said, Asia-Pacific countries, like other
countries all over the world, face the common challenges such as
environmental protection and resources management, security and
welfare, education and training.
</P>
<P>
It is China's consistent policy to actively promote space
science, technology and applications internationally, Hui said,
adding that China had made remarkable achievements in space
science, technology and applications.
</P>
<P>
With its rockets becoming more and more matured and
sophisticated, China is capable of launching low-orbit satellites,
sun-synchronous satellites and geo-stationary satellites and can
satisfy the launching needs both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
China has by now independently developed and launched more than
40 satellites of various types with extensive applications in
economic, scientific and technological and cultural fields,
bringing about satisfactory social and economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
Hui informed the delegates from 28 Asia-Pacific countries that
remote sensing applications had been extended to more than 400
institutions and departments across China.
</P>
<P>
Satellite meteorology has become the most essential means in
weather forecasting and disaster assessment and long-distance
education network which consists of 16,000 satellite ground
stations and three television educational programs, he added.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP), Hui said, China commits itself to the
following:
</P>
<P>
-- Continue formulating the corresponding programs and projects
at the national level with inputs of necessary resources, enhance
coordination between the ministries and departments concerned and
implement specific follow-up measures;
</P>
<P>
-- Actively participate in the arrangements and activities at
the regional level;
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to implement space science and technology human
resource training programs for other developing countries in the
region;
</P>
<P>
-- Provide, free of charge, all countries in the region with
data of meteorological satellite FY-1C;
</P>
<P>
-- Distribute high-quality Chinese GIS software at a
preferential price and help developing countries of the region to
develop various kinds of GIS projects;
</P>
<P>
-- Participate in the implementation of the Asia-cover project
in cooperation with the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO);
</P>
<P>
-- Actively participate in discussions and consultations with
other countries on issues such as standardization of remote
sensing data, data sharing and development of small satellites in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day ministerial meeting was opened on Thursday by
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who called for the
development of space applications for global peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by ESCAP, is an immediate follow-up
of the Third U.N. Conference on Peaceful Use and Exploration of
Outer Space held in Vienna in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 delegates of the Asia-Pacific region also addressed the
ministerial conference that was preceded by a three-day senior
officials' meeting which was closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials' meeting adopted a draft report, which
said the participants observed the significant progress that has
been achieved in the field of space applications for sustainable
development since the first Ministerial Conference on Space
Applications for Development in Asia and the Pacific was held in
Beijing in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also adopted a strategy and action plan on space
technology applications for sustainable development in the region
and mechanism for effective regional cooperation and reviewed the
draft ministerial declaration that will be submitted to the
ministerial conference for adoption.

<HEADLINE> Eighteen Injured in Train Collision Near Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 18 (Xinhua) -- About 18 people suffered
minor injuries Thursday when a southbound Metrolink commuter train
ran into the last few cars of a northbound freight train that
apparently was switching to another track, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred just east of the Fullerton Airport, 32
kilometers southeast of Los Angeles, California.
</P>
<P>
"The latest information we have is that between 15 and 18
people have been injured, but they are all minor injuries," said
Fullerton Fire Chief Steve Magliocco, who added that one woman's
leg was broken.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the collision, the Metrolink train, which had
about 65 people aboard, was traveling 72 kph on track 2 and had a
green light 4.8 kilometers out -- about the same time the freight
train was switching from track 2 to track 1, said Fullerton Police
Sgt. Joe Klein.
</P>
<P>
The Metrolink train derailed after collision and a fire broke
out when diesel fuel spilled and was ignited from the train's
engine. Firefighters swiftly put out a second fire fueled by
wooden pallets aboard the freight train, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The transportation officials have closed the track, the main
route between southern Orange County and downtown Los Angeles,
stranding hundreds of commuters and other rail travelers.
</P>
<P>
The National transportation Safety Board is expected to
investigate the cause of the accident.

the two countries have a long-term friendship with fruitful
cooperation in many fields.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks while meeting with Buyoya here this morning
at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Li said that cooperation between the two countries in the

The Chinese government and people have offered their sympathy
and support to Burundi, the Burundi president said, adding that
these efforts make the Burundi people wholeheartedly feel sincere
friendship from the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Li said that stability is the prerequisite for pushing forward
all causes. "Without stability, no cause can be developed. That is
the experience we gained during the past 20 years of reform and
opening-up," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Also, there is no doubt that political reform should be
deepened and democracy, liberty, and human rights should be
continuously pushed forward, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All this can only be done based on reality, in particular, by
maintaining overall stability," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, given a situation of turmoil, nothing can be done,
much less the realization of democracy, liberty and human rights,"
he said, adding that "we have profound experience in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Li expressed appreciation for the efforts made by the Burundi
government and people to realize domestic stability, promote
national reconciliation, and develop their economy.
</P>
<P>
As a country friendly to Burundi, China sincerely hopes all
political fractions in Burundi will proceed from the fundamental
interests of the nation and the people, and abandon ethnic and
tribal hatred in order to resolve differences through dialogue and
restore peace and stability promptly.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya agreed with Li's opinion, saying his delegation had an
in-depth exchange of views during the visit and reached wide
consensus. "My visit is crowned with success," he told Li.

<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A United States-made engine
device displayed here today has attracted the attention of Chinese
environmental protection officials and auto parts dealers.
</P>
<P>
The small device, which WDB USA Inc. claims is fuel-efficient
and capable of reducing an engine's toxic gas emissions, is
manufactured by Tornado Air Management Systems in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of tests conducted by the China
National Car Quality Supervision and Test Center and a licensed U.
S. auto emission lab, the device can save up to 24.1 percent of
gas consumption and reduce toxic gas emissions by 5 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
At a demonstration jointly held by the China Foundation for
Environmental Protection and WDB USA Inc., Chinese auto parts
dealers from Beijing, Shanghai and Qingdao said they are very much

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Lockerbie Case Holds Big Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A Libyan, believed to be the
third man in the Lockerbie case, has transferred 1 million Cyprus
pounds (2 million U.S. dollars) through a Cyprus bank, the Cyprus
Weekly newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government recently sent part of a classified
document to a visiting team of Scottish detectives who was here to
investigate the Lockerbie issue. It mentioned an account held in a
foreign bank in Nicosia which reportedly saw up to 1 million
pounds (2 million dollars) pass though it.
</P>
<P>
The team was tracking down the movements of the Libyan man, who
was on the island as a tourist only two months before the December
21, 1988 Lockerbie explosion which took 270 lives.
</P>
<P>
They are trying to find out whether the unnamed man funded the
two Libyans suspected of bombing the Pan Am Flight 103 over the
Scottish village of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
They secured a court order, with the cooperation of Cyprus
police, to check the man's bank accounts and the calls he made
while staying at a Nicosia hotel.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the so-called third man in the decade-long
Lockerbie investigation traveled to Cyprus, using several false
names and was closely connected to the two Libyans to stand
trial in Holland.
</P>
<P>
The man also owned an off-shore company here in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the investigating team here was part of a
comprehensive effort to secure convictions against the two
accused Libyans, identified as Abdel-Basset Ali as-megarhi and
Al-Amain Khalifa Fahirma.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Spy Camera Found Near German Embassy in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The alleged placing of a
spy camera outside the German Embassy in Pretoria by the National
Intelligence Agency was being investigated by the police and
Department of Foreign Affairs, The Citizen newspaper quoted
government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The camera had apparently been placed in a dustbin, and wired
to a tree, in which the lens was placed. The lens was allegedly
focused on the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
South African Detective Services spokesman and Senior
Superintendent Faizel Abdul Kader said the police were summoned to
the embassy following the discovery of a suspicious parcel.
</P>
<P>
"The parcel was found to be video equipment. The matter is
under investigation and we are keeping an open mind in the
investigation," he added.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Guanghui, former Party
secretary of the city of Enping in south China's Guangdong
Province, was sentenced to four years in prison for neglect of
duty involving serious financial risk.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the trial took place on November 17
in the Intermediate People's Court of Jiangmen City which
exercises jurisdiction over Enping, a county-level city.
</P>
<P>
In the court's ruling, Li was found guilty of disregarding the
national laws of China and failing to do his duty according to law
when he acted as a leader of Enping, violating the law by
interfering in financial activities which eventually led to heavy
losses suffered by the state. He is sentenced as one of the main
persons responsible for the major financial breakdown in Enping.
</P>
<P>
Investigations showed that from August 1994 to August 1996
while Li was Party secretary of Enping, financial institutions in
the city were encouraged to use high interest rates to lure 11.2
billion yuan in savings deposits, while lending out over 6.3
billion yuan in loans in violation of relevant laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
By late 1996, overdue loans climbed to 4.6 billion yuan, and 1.
2 billion yuan in interest which should have been recovered, was
not. In the end, more than five billion yuan was taken from
elsewhere to ensure payment in Enping, causing the state to lose
500 million yuan.

leading international financial institution.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:

between on arms decommissioning.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has advised the two dominant communities in Burundi to
cooperate in resolving the conflicts in their country.
</P>
<P>
Moi pointed out that this was the only way the Hutu and Tutsi
could live in peace, which would benefit both sides, Kenya Times
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The two should consider each other as brothers and sisters if
the peace initiative was to succeed," the president said on
Thursday when meeting with outgoing Burundian Ambassador to Kenya
Stanislas Nakaha.

<P>
He also called on political leaders to put the interest of the
people first.

<HEADLINE> 10 Fingers Successfully Reconnected to Farmer's Palms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Guo'an was pounded into
hell in the middle of the night last week when all 10 of his
fingers were cut off in one second by the fall of a piece of
printing equipment weighing eight tons.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old farmer was brought back to reality by seven
surgeons who spent 17 continuous hours reconnecting Li's fingers
to his palms after they had been severed for more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
Li, who has just had the bandage removed, was choked with
emotion by this extreme experience. He was told that the blood
circulation in all 10 fingers is now OK, and the most critical
moments have passed.
</P>
<P>
The seven surgeons at the Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, using a
microscope, stitched 39 blood vessels, the diameters of which were
less than the thickness of 10 human hairs, nine nerves and 18
muscle tendons, in order to save Li's fingers.
</P>
<P>
Jishuitan Hospital thus successfully accomplished two of the
seven cases of 10-finger reconnection operations in China.
</P>
<P>
Li, from Pingyu County in central China's Henan Province and
working in Beijing, was lucky to have surgeon Chen Shanlin working
on the night shift on November 10 when Li and his fingers were
rushed to the hospital. Chen had taken part in a similar operation
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A mistake by Li's partner led to the fall of the huge jack from
a paper-cutter in a Beijing printing house.

<HEADLINE> Pak Apex Court Summons Former PM in Rowdyism Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court
Friday issued notices to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and
former Chief Commissioner of Islamabad Akram Javed to appear on
December 7 in the apex court rowdyism case.
</P>
<P>
A full bench headed by Chief Justice Saiduzzaman Siddique
issued the orders on a petition filed by freelance journalist
Shahid Orakzai, which was later converted into an appeal by the
court.
</P>
<P>
The bench ruled in May this year that contempt had been
committed by Pakistan Muslim League (PML) activists on November
28, 1997, but none of the accused could be convicted because of
lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
PML workers, including parliament members of the party,
attacked the apex court building here on November 28, 1997, when
the then chief justice, Sajjad Ali Shah, was hearing a contempt of
court case against Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said other PML leaders such as Senator Saifuur
Rehman, Mushahid Hussain and Shahbaz Sharif would have to be
summoned as evidence had come on the record that the three were
involved in the case.

ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A special anti-terrorist
court in Karachi remanded deposed Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Friday in police custody till November 22 in a case of
criminal conspiracy, hijacking, kidnapping and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, whose government was dismissed in a military coup on
October 12, was produced before the court Friday morning under
heavy security around the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who was in a blue-color Shalwar Qameez (a traditional
Pakistani suit), was taken straight to the court under strict
security arrangements, sources from Karachi said.
</P>
<P>
Police had to resort to baton charge to disperse supporters of
the Pakistan Muslim League, of which Sharif is the president, and
journalists outside the court.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the hijacking charge carries a maximum
punishment of death in Pakistan. The charges were connected to an
alleged attempt to divert a plane bringing Chief Executive General
Pervaiz Musharraf back from Sri Lanka on October 12.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani police formally arrested the former prime
minister on Thursday. He was brought to Karachi from Rawalpindi in
a special Boeing 737 plane.

<P>
Four others accused along with Sharif were arrested on November
15 and remanded in police custody till November 18.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's former Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Friday in Karachi that he was
innocent.
</P>
<P>
The deposed prime minister was telling reporters as he left a
special anti-terrorist court in the southern port city under heavy
police guard after a brief hearing Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"I did not conspire in a hijacking," he said, adding,
"Hijacking is done at gun point, in this case the whole democratic
government has been hijacked."
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who was formally arrested Thursday, has been charged
with treason, conspiracy of murder, kidnapping and hijacking a
plane.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Sharif had been seen in public
since he was ousted in a military coup on October 12.
</P>
<P>
The anti-terrorist court remanded Sharif Friday in police
custody till November 22.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who was in a blue-color Shalwar Qameez (a traditional
Pakistani suit) was taken straight to the court under strict
security arrangements, sources from Karachi said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the hijacking charge alone carries the
maximum punishment of death in Pakistan. The charges were
connected to an alleged attempt to divert a plane bringing Chief
Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf back from Sri Lanka on October
12.

<HEADLINE> Hometown of Late Chinese Marshal Becomes Sister City of Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A signing ceremony was held Thursday in Jiangjin, a city near
Chongqing Municipality in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
Jiangjin and Miyakonojo thus became the 202nd pair of sister
cities established between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This sister-city relationship was a long-cherished hope of the
late Chinese Marshal since two Japanese orphaned girls who had
lost their parents were saved by Marshal Nie on the front of the
War of Resistance to Japan in north China in August 1940. Nie then
had them sent back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the two sisters eventually met their savior in Beijing
after repeated reports about this moving incident.
</P>
<P>
Mashall Nie died in May 1992 and, since then the two Japanese
women have worked hard to see the two cities forge this friendly
relationship.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 100th birth anniversary of Marshal Nie, and
the establishment of the sister-city relationship serves as his
best memorial.

<P>
NANJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A short circuit has been
blamed for the early morning Nanjing Railway Station fire in east
China's Jiangsu Province on November 12, said local public
security officials today after a week of investigation.
</P>
<P>
Sparks from the short circuit ignited the ornament materials in
a video chamber on the second floor of the passenger waiting hall,
causing one casualty and destroying the 2,000-sq-m hall, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Direct economic loss has been reported at around 920,000 yuan (
110,890 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sources with the railway station said that two new waiting
halls, each with an area of 1,500 sq.m, will be built on either
side of the station next month, and a garden will be put up on the
site of the original waiting room.
</P>
<P>
A new 1,500-sq-m temporary waiting room was built soon after
the fire, and normal passenger and cargo transport operations have
not been affected.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters rushed to the scene about five minutes after the
fire started and brought the blaze under control in about a half
hour.
</P>
<P>
By 7:30 that morning, electric power had been restored and the
booking office, whose computer system was unaffected, reopened,
said railway station personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing Railway Station, a major stop on the Beijing-
Shanghai railway line, was built in 1968.

resolved the Y2K problem as it relates to flight safety, Chen
Haiju, director of the Air Control Administrative Bureau under the
Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remark after a drill targeted at the Y2K
millennium bug, jointly conducted by the CAAC and its counterpart
in the Republic of Korea (ROK), succeeded this morning.
</P>
<P>
The drill began at 10 p.m. (Beijing Time) Thursday night and
ended this morning, during which a Chinese plane flew from Beijing
to Seoul, and a ROK aircraft flew from Seoul to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The drill tested navigational and telecommunications systems,
airport energy supplies, and airborne equipment.
</P>
<P>
Kim Tschang-sun, director general of the Civil Aviation Bureau
of the ROK, who arrived in Beijing on the ROK aircraft, said, "
This exercise proves that all our systems concerning flight safety,
both on board and on the ground, will be unaffected by the Y2K
problem. And I believe that there will be no problem whatsoever at
the turn of century. The joint drill, which was also the first in
the world, was quite successful."

<HEADLINE> Successful Transgenetic Rice Experiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have
successfully grown a new strain of rice on an experimental basis.
It does not require pesticides to keep it free of pests and is
also resistant to herbicides.
</P>
<P>
The new strain of rice was created by the transfer of insect
and herbicide resistant genes.
</P>
<P>
Research into transgenetic rice was funded by the Shandong
Province Science and Technology Committee and the U.S-based
Rockefeller Foundation in the amount of more than one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A group of researchers headed by Professor Wen Fujiang of the
Shandong Agriculture University spent six years perfecting this
process.
</P>
<P>
Tests have shown that only 0.1 to 0.2 percent of the
transgenetic rice suffers from diseases caused by pests, compared
with 10 percent for ordinary rice.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the new strain of rice is expected to become
the second transgenetic crop grown worldwide since the
introduction of a strain of pest-resistent cotton.

<HEADLINE> Air Quality Better in Major Chinese Cities This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From November 12 to 18, windy condition and rainfall brought on
by cold fronts moving southward, and weak, wet and hot air
currents helped the diffusion and purification of pollutants over
most of China, thus reducing air pollution in some cities.
</P>
<P>
But several cities in northwest and north China reported
increased discharges of pollutants due to the increased use of
coal for heating.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the air quality in six cities, namely,
Haikou, Xiamen, Beihai, Nantong, Shantou and Fuzhou in southern
China was fine, while 28 other cities, including Tianjin,
Zhengzhou, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Shenyang, Chengdu, Nanjing,
Qinhuangdao and Suzhou, reported good air quality.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Beijing, Urumqi, Shijiazhuang, Shanghai, Taiyuan,
Chongqing, Guiyang, Hohhot and Guangzhou were slightly polluted.
</P>
<P>
The air quality in Xining and Lanzhou in the northwest was
polluted last week.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lanzhou, Hohhot, Xining and 12 other cities named
suspended particles as the major pollutant.
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen oxide was the major pollutant in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Wuhan, Jinan, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, whereas Chongqing,
Changsha and Guiyang claimed sulfur dioxide as the major problem.

<HEADLINE> HK Holds Forum on Global Connectivity Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong held a forum on
Bluetooth Friday to promote the awareness of the new global
connectivity standard and its impact on the local community.
</P>
<P>
Bluetooth, being supported by the Hong Kong government through
the Industrial Support Fund, should bring to Hong Kong
industrialists great opportunities in developing and marketing new
products, Richard Chan, head of the Technical Support Section of
the Industry Department, said at the forum.
</P>
<P>
"With the fast growing momentum, this new global connectivity
standard should bring about revolutionary applications in e-
commerce, personal communications, home and office automation and
other areas," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Bluetooth is the codename for a technology specification for
small form factor, low-cost, short-range radio links between
mobile PCs, mobile phones and other portable devices.
</P>
<P>
It will enable users to connect a wide range of computing and
telecommunications devices easily and simply, without the need to
buy, carry, or connect cables.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Nokia, Ericsson and IBM gave lectures at
the forum.
</P>
<P>
In May 1998, Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba jointly
founded the Bluetooth Special Interest Group to develop the
technology and bring it to the market.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 international companies from diversified fields,
covering telecommunications, information technology, automotive,
medical, metering and consumer devices, have joined the group.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Cup of Golf
will become the fourth event of the World Golf Championships next
year, offering bigger prizes and a new format, officials said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Linen, chairman of the International Golf Association,
said that the 45th World Cup being played now in Kuala Lumpur
would be the last using the four-round stroke total for 32 two-man
teams and offering a separate trophy for the top individual scorer.
</P>
<P>
The IGA announced that starting with the 2000 World Cup
December 4-10 at the Buenos Aires Golf Club in Argentina, total
prize money will be doubled to 3 million U.S. dollars from the
current 1.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new format will include two days of alternate shot play by
the two teammates and two days of four-ball, consistent with the
format used in Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup team play.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup, to be run now by the International Federation of
PGA Tours, will be the team component of the world championship
series, which also includes the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship, the NEC Invitational and the American Express
Championship.
</P>
<P>
Linen said the IGA, which has run the World Cup since 1953,
will retain an advisory role under its agreement with the
federation. IGA executive director Burch Riber said the IGA will
remain in a position to take over the cup's running again if the
federation does not live up to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, 18 teams will qualify based on individual
world rankings.

<HEADLINE> Packaging, Accessories Show Opens in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Packaging and
Accessories Exposition '99, aimed at attracting buyers for the
country's accessories industry, opened here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four companies are participating in the exhibition,
which is the first of its kind in Bangladesh and is organized by
the Bangladesh Corrugated Carton and Accessories Manufacturers and
Exporters Association (BCCAMEA).
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the show at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel, BCCAMEA
President Safiullah Chowdhury said the carton and accessories has
become an inseparable part of many other industries in Bangladesh,
such as the garment and the frozen food industries.
</P>
<P>
There were only 20-25 carton units in the country in 1989, but
the number had increased to more than 350 by 1999, showing an
unprecedented growth rate in the history of the industrial sector
in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Carton and accessories account for 12-15 percent of export
earnings of the garment industry, which earned about 4 billion
U.S. dollars during the July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year, according
to Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings of the industry would exceed 40 billion taka
(800 million dollars) within 2-3 years if the government could
provide necessary policy incentives and hassle-free support to it,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is now manufacturing accessories like carton,
polybag, button, zipper, plastic, hanger, elastic, label, thread
and embroidery and are exporting accessories to India, Germany and
Hong Kong after meeting domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The industry employs around 100,000 people and earns about 20
billion taka (400 million dollars) annually, according to the
BCCAMEA president.

<HEADLINE> Polls Show New Zealand's Opposition in Healthy Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Three opinion polls out on
Friday gave the Labor Party, the major opposition party in New
Zealand, a healthy lead with just a week to go until the November
27 election.
</P>
<P>
The polls also indicated that a coalition of the Labor Party,
the Alliance, and probably the Greens, would have enough seats in
Parliament to form the next government.
</P>
<P>
In TV3 poll the Labor Party had a support rate of 37 percent
and the ruling party, the National Party, 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, the National Party and its allies, the
ACT and the United, would hold just 53 seats in the 120-seat
Parliament, while the Labor Party and its potential coalition
partners, the Alliance and the Greens, would have 62 seats.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Herald-Digi poll had similar results.
</P>
<P>
The National Business Review-Compaq poll also showed the Labor
Party and the center-left bloc formed by the party and its allies
comfortably ahead. In that poll the Labor Party has a support rate
of 35.6 percent, the Alliance 10.4 percent and the Greens 4.6
percent. On the center-right bloc, the National Party has 30
percent support, the ACT 8.2 percent and the United 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
This week's polls followed a couple of weeks of quite volatile
polling but are in line with a two-year trend which points to a
public mood for change.

GUILIN, November 19 (Xinhua)-- Guilin, one of China's most
famous scenic spots, will organize a range of activities on
November 22 to celebrate its 2110th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, Guilin, located in south China
's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, was built at Shi'an County
during the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.). However, no
tombs from this period have been excavated to date, leading
experts to surmise that tombs were destroyed during construction
of the city.
</P>
<P>
Guilin is renowned for its green mountains, clear water and
strangely-shaped stone formations.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with more details Woman Falls Victim to Banned Evil Cult in Vancouver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Falun Gong, the evil cult
banned in China, has claimed its first victim in Canada's Pacific
city of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Chen Xiaolin, 29, has been hospitalized for schizophrenia
as a result of practicing Falun Gong, her mother told local
television this week.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolin is now recovering after weeks of intensive care at a
local psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
Before her hospitalization, she had refused to see any doctors
or take any medicine, believing that cult leader Li Hongzhi would
save her life, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
She refused nearly every request, even to the point of caring
for her new-born child. The only thing she wanted to do was to
read Li Hongzhi's book "Falun Dafa," according to Xiaolin's mother.
</P>
<P>
The results have been disastrous. With uncombed hair, she
would begin practicing Falun Gong in pajamas without bathing or
changing clothes. She eventually ran a high temperature and was
taken to hospital in June, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolin was taken so ill that she could not eat or drink
because of her ulcers.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, immediately after her return to Shanghai,
where she gave birth to a second baby, Xiaolin was approached by
the Falun Gong organization and started to practice the cult in
the hope that it might help her in postnatal recovery.
</P>
<P>
Her relatives in Shanghai noticed that her health was
drastically deteriorating after she began practicing Falun Gong.
They advised her to see doctors, but met only her refusal.
</P>
<P>
Worried about worsening consequences, her mother returned with
her to Canada, unaware that the cult had already spread abroad.
</P>
<P>
The mother was surprised when Falun Gong members in Vancouver
made many calls urging Xiaolin to join them.
</P>
<P>
"Only then did I realize that Falun Gong members were much more
tightly regimented than I thought, with a directory of addresses
and telephone numbers of all members," the mother said.
</P>
<P>
The mother was enraged with continual harassment from Falun
Gong, even after her daughter was seriously harmed by practicing
it.
</P>
<P>
Without the rescue efforts by the local hospital, you cannot
imagine what might have become of Xiaolin, the mother said.
</P>
<P>
She categorically denied that her daughter had been insane or
had had some other serious mental problems before practicing Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
According to Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi, if anything goes
wrong with a practitioner, it is because he or she must have been
insane or have had a serious illness before beginning to
practicing it.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaolin's suffering has aroused wide-spread concern in
Vancouver, where many people have contacted her family expressing
sympathy and outrage at the evil cult.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is right in taking resolute steps to
crack down on Falun Gong, which is even more harmful than opium,"
Xiaolin's mother said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs banned the Falun Gong
cult on July 22 this year. The organization's evil concepts have
led to more than 1,400 deaths and left many others injured since
it was launched in 1992 in China without lawful registration.
</P>
<P>
The government has warned that Falun Gong bears strong
resemblance to heterodox groups like Branch Davidian in the United
States and Japanese Aum Doomsday cult, which also injured and
killed innocent people.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Opposition Leader Promises Peace in Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has declared that if elected as
president he will work towards ending the war against Tamil
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Presenting on Thursday his manifesto for the election slated
for December 21, Wickremesinghe of the United National Party said
he will talk to Tamil rebels and make them a part of an interim
committee to be appointed to govern the Northeastern province.
</P>
<P>
He said in the manifesto titled "My Pact with the People" that
the interim committee will comprise all races and the separatist
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) will also be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
"First of all I will resume the food and medicine supply to
(rebel-controlled) Wanni and afterwards talk with them,"
Wickremesinghe said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ban on the LTTE should be lifted at home to promote
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old war between the
majority Sinhalese dominated government and LTTE rebels who are
fighting for a separate state for minority Tamils in the country's
north and east.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the presidential election, LTTE rebels have
intensified their offensive against government troops by capturing
three towns in the northern province on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in November, LTTE rebels in an operation code-named
"Unceasing Wave 3" had captured at least 10 key towns in the
northern Wanni region in five days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the government's successive defeats in the
battlefield might weaken the incumbent Chandrika Kumaratunga's
hope of reelection in the presidential poll.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Warns Against Threat from Western Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt warned Thursday that the world is
encountering a number of new challenges, particularly in
international affairs, as it enters the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a course of diplomacy here Thursday night, the
first ever organized by the Myanmar Foreign Ministry, Khin Nyunt,
first secretary of the State Peace and Development Council, said
some powerful western nations are attacking the very foundation of
international relations, which is based on equality between
independent and sovereign states, in their efforts to shape the
world according to their mold.
</P>
<P>
He noted that such a situation is a source of great concern for
third world countries.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar leader accused these western countries of trying to
impose their own concepts and values on the rest of the world in
their attempt to exert influences on others without paying any
regard to the historical background, cultural heritage,
traditions or objective conditions of other nations, warning that
these trends pose a great threat to small and developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt stressed the supreme importance of unity and
solidarity among developing nations under such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that another feature in today's international
relations is that some nations are using the facade of democracy
and human rights to interfere in the matters that are essentially
within the domestic jurisdiction of other states.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Myanmar continues to faithfully adhere to
its policy of striving to maintain friendly ties with all nations
in the world in accordance with its independent and active foreign
policy.

<HEADLINE> Poland Raises Loan Rates of Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Poland drastically raised loan
rates from its central bank Thursday, the second such move this
year and the biggest in recent years, amid a dampening economy and
rocketing loans by Polish businesses and individuals.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision Wednesday by the country's monetary
policy committee, the lombard bank rate was increased from 17
percent to 20.5 percent, and the discount rate from 15.5 percent
to 19 percent, and the intervention rate from 14 percent to 16.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in loan rates was aimed at stimulating bank
deposits, cutting down individual loans and containing this year's
inflation at the level of 5.4 to 6.8 percent, a top bank official
said.
</P>
<P>
With a sluggish economy for years, Polish corporate and
individual debts have soared this year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debts owed by businesses hit 11.9 billion U.S. dollars
last July, among which 40 percent are short-term loans due at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Loans by individuals have exceeded 33 billion zloties (more
than 8 billion dollars) this year, rocketing 40 percent compared
with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Many economists, amazed at such a big rate hike by the central
bank, believe the move is not good for the economy. However, the
long-time floppy zloty hardened slightly at the announcement of
the news though the stock market responded negatively.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tamil Rebels Capture More Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels
Thursday smashed military defense lines and captured three towns
in the Northern Province of the country, media sources here said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the rebels Thursday took the key Catholic
pilgrim town of Madhu and also captured the military held towns of
Periyamadu and Palampitty in the north western district of Mannar.
</P>
<P>
These moves saw them further consolidate unprecedented gains
made against the army earlier this month when they captured at
least 10 key towns in the Wanni District of the Northern Province.
</P>
<P>
Commando units of the Tigers have been pounding army defense
positions in the area and heavy fighting is continuing at Iranai
Irrappaikullam, the sources said quoting unofficial reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebels claim in a press release issued Thursday
evening that the troops suffered hundreds of casualties when their
cadres captured several military army camps on the strategic land
route between Vavuniya town and Vidithaltivu on the Western coast,
whereas 10 of their fighters also were killed in the fighting
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, defense sources said 46 Tamil rebels were killed and
33 government soldiers wounded in several attacks in the north of
the country on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting for separate state for the
Tamil minority in the north and east of Sri Lanka since 1983.

BELGRADE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavian Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic on Thursday denounced the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as having become a tool

the state news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the first graduates from the Yugoslavian Foreign
Affairs College, Jovanovic said the ongoing OSCE summit in
Istanbul has continued to impose pressure on Yugoslavia -- a
sovereign state and one of the organization's initiators, which
indicates that it has degenerated into a tool of NATO.

The OSCE did not invite Yugoslavian leaders to the summit that

<P>
YANGON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt reiterated Thursday that the
military government has no desire whatever to hold power for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a course of diplomacy here Thursday night, first
ever organized by the Myanmar Foreign Ministry, Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the State Peace and Development Council, said: "Once
the constitution has emerged, there must be a transfer of power to
the constitutional government which will lead the nation in the

</P>
<P>
He added that the Tatmadaw (military) government considers
itself a transitional administration which is laying the
foundation for the emergence of a multi-party democratic system
from the previous socialist one.
</P>
<P>
The present military government took over the power of state on
September 18, 1988. In order to transfer power back to a civilian
government, the military held a general election on May 27, 1990,
in which 93 political parties took part. In the election, the
opposition National League for Democracy won a vast majority of
votes, getting 396 out of the 485 parliamentary seats.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian Ministry of
Information condemned the NATO-led international peacekeeping
force in Kosovo (KFOR) Thursday for conniving at ethnic Albanian
extremists' pillage of public property.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ministry said the extremists have occupied
the office of Jedinstro, a Pristina-based Serbian newspaper,
driven away the Serbian staff, taken possession of computers worth
70,000 German marks (37,500 U.S. dollars), and started to publish
an Albanian-language newspaper, Dardanija.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the KFOR did nothing about this indicated that
the international peace-keeping force has turned into an
accomplice of the ethnic Albanian extremists in their ethnic
cleansing of the Serbs, the statement said.

The association have also targeted Erwin to finish 14th in the
championships to earn an Olympic ticket.
</P>
<P>
Djoko said all the lifters, except Lisa, have competed in world-
class tournaments and have made good preparations.
</P>
<P>
"Lisa is being sent to the championships because she needs
international experience and we are preparing her to replace
Indriyani in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Djoko said should his lifters fail to earn tickets in the
championships, PABBSI still had another chance by sending them to
the Asian Championships in India next year.
</P>
<P>
"If they fail this time, or if PABBSI wants to get more tickets,
we can send them to the Asian Championships next year. The problem
is the championships take place either in late August or early
September, which is too close to the Olympics," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Real Estate Investment Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 18 (Xinhua) -- While real estate markets
in the United States may still be hot, some important segments of
the corporate real estate finance sector are cooling off, a report
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Corporate loans to real estate investment trusts -- investment
vehicles known as REITs that fund major real estate developments
worldwide -- totaled only 5.9 billion U.S. dollars during this
year's third quarter, bringing the tally for the first nine months
of the year to 15.49 billion dollars, said the report from Loan
Pricing Corporation (LPC). In contrast, the report said, the
total for the first three quarters of 1998 was 43 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
REIT lending totaled a record of 51.5 billion dollars in 1998,
preceded by a then-record of 41.4 billion dollars in 1997. REIT
lending soared during this period as investors and corporate
lenders alike became increasingly comfortable with real estate
investment trusts in general.
</P>
<P>
According to the LPC, part of the decline in REIT lending is
because REIT stocks are not the high-fliers they once were. Since
their high point in 1997, stocks of some REITs have fallen more
than 50 percent, because U.S. Congress rescinded favorable
legislation and equity, investors shifted focus to higher-yielding
segments, such as technology and Internet. With the equity
markets cool, REITs are finding it hard to grow.
</P>
<P>
As for the lenders, the LPC said, Chase Manhattan led the most
REIT loans during the first three quarters of 1999, logging 6.9
billion dollars in volume. The Bank of America was next, with 5.6
billion dollars in deals.

<HEADLINE> Britain Names Judges in Lockerbie Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Thursday named the
three judges who will be sent to the Netherlands to try the two
Libyans accused of carrying out the 1988 Lockerbie airliner
bombing.
</P>
<P>
Scotland's legal authorities said the three judges will preside
over the trial in the Netherlands at a former U.S. airbase near
Utrecht that has been temporarily declared UK territory.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Scottish Court Service named the three as
Lord Sutherland, Lord Coulsfield and Lord MacLean. Lord
Sutherland was named as the presiding judge.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the two Libyans is scheduled to start next
February and could last many months.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects are accused of blowing up Pan-Am Flight 103
over Lockerbie in Scotland in December 1988, killing 259 people on
board and another 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Libya for years said the two men were innocent and refused to
hand them over for trial in Britain. Under a complex deal
brokered by the United Nations Secreatry-General Kofi Annan, the
two men were flown from Tripoli to the Netherlands in April. They
will be detained for trial by Scottish judges under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
A pretrial hearing is expected to be held on November 22 at
Edinburgh's High Court.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta, IMF Agree to Reimpose Import Duty on Rice, Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reimpose the import duty
on rice and sugar to protect local farmers from cheap imports.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik
Kian Gie said the IMF, which pressured the government to cut the
import tariff on both commodities to zero percent, was initially
opposed to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"IMF still wanted a zero percent duty. But we said zero percent
will kill farmers," Kwik Kian Gie was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the amount of tax to be levied on both commodities had
yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Trade Yusuf Kalla recently said the
government was considering imposing a 30 to 35 percent import duty
on rice, while Minister of Agriculture M. Prakosa recommended the
government establish an import duty on rice of between 55 and 78
percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia imported 4.8 million tons of rice in the 1998/1999
fiscal year ending March 31 because of a series of harvest
failures largely attributed to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rice imports are estimated to reach 1.5 million
tons in the current fiscal year, far below last year's figure of
4.8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia imported 1.7 million tons of sugar in 1998.

ATHENS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The responsibility for the
improvement of strained relations between Athens and Ankara lay
with Turkey, Greek government spokesman Yannis Nikolaou said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Greece expected that its positions would be understood and even
become accepted in the meeting of Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is to arrive in
Athens on Friday afternoon for a 24-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
As long-time rival neighbors, Greece and Turkey have been at
odds for decades over their disputes in the territorial waters,
air space limits, the delimitation of the continental shelf in the
Aegean Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Greece has made some goodwill gestures as
part of its effort to better bilateral ties with Turkey, and

WASHINGTON, November 18 (xinhua) -- Tennis star Jim Courier was
arrested on a drunken driving charge in Athens, Georgia early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
29-year-old Courier who lives in Orlando, Florida, was stopped
early in the morning for running a red light in his sport utility
vehicle. The police officer then found evidence to charge him with
driving under the influence, said Jimmy Williamson, assistant
chief of the University of Georgia's police department.
</P>
<P>
He declined to say what the evidence was or whether Courier was
subjected to a breath test.
</P>
<P>
Courier was booked into the Clarke County jail, then released
on bond.
</P>
<P>
Courier's Cleveland-based agent, Gavin Forbes, said his client
was in Athens to visit a friend.
</P>
<P>
Courier, currently rated No. 33 on the men's tour, was the No.

<HEADLINE> Former Marine Says US Pilots Short on Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Captain Richard Ashby was
too out of practice to fly the fatal mission in February 1998 when
his plane sliced through the wires holding a cable car, killing 20
people, a former marine captain said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Italian weekly Espresso, Steven Danyluk said
Ashby's superiors at the Aviano airbase in northeastern Italy
should never have ordered him to fly the training mission in the
Dolomite mountains.
</P>
<P>
"Six months had passed since Ashby did his last tactical flight
at low-level and so he didn't have the necessary level of
efficiency and competence for this type of flight," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ashby shouldn't have done it for any reason in the world and
his superiors should have known this," said Danyluk, who formerly
flew the same EA-6B Prowler jet as Ashby was flying when the
disaster on Mount Cermis happened.
</P>
<P>
Ashby was charged by a U.S. military court but cleared of
manslaughter charges. He was sentenced to six month's detention
for concealing a video of the flight and released in October,
after five months.
</P>
<P>
Danyluk said that the falling efficiency of its pilots was a
"bitter reality" for the American air force because they flew
fewer missions now than in the past.
</P>
<P>
The accident rate in 1999 was double that of 1998 and the
highest for five years, he added.
</P>
<P>
The root of the problem was money, he continued, noting that
the marine's annual budget had fallen from 24.4 billion U.S.
dollars in the early years of the decade to 11.1 billion now.
</P>
<P>
Less money also meant that planes were not replaced and
improved as frequently as in the past. "It follows from this that
the Prowler is technologically the most antiquated plane in the
U.S. air force's fleet," Danyluk said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) of the United States said Thursday that racial
prejudice was the motive of more than half of the 7,755 hate
crimes committed in 1998 in the country.
</P>
<P>
As in 1997 and 1996, racial prejudice was the most common
motivation for hate crimes, accounting for 4,321 incidents in
1998, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,390 incidents were attributed to prejudice over
religion, 1,260 over sexual orientation, 754 over ethnic or
national origin, 25 over disabilities and five over multiple
prejudices, according to the bureau's statistics.
</P>
<P>
Last year's data come from 10,730 law enforcement agencies in
46 states and the District of Columbia, representing 80 percent of
the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, there were 8,049 hate crime incidents, of which 4,710
were racially motivated.

WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- At least nine students were
killed and 28 injured as logs collapsed Thursday at a university in
Texas, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place as a huge bonfire being built from
thousands of logs for a Thanksgiving holiday football game
collapsed while 60 to 70 students were working on it at Texas
A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
Authorities and rescue workers said six bodies were taken from
the rubble and at least three more bodies remain in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
In the hours after the collapse at 2:30 a.m. local time,
rescuers pulled four students from the rubble alive.
</P>
<P>
Cranes were removing logs gingerly, one by one, in the search
for more students, rescue workers said.
</P>
<P>
University President Ray Bowen said the 28 students' injuries
vary and some were in "quite serious shape." At least three were
in critical condition.

has happened," he said.

WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Thursday the approval of a loan
of 15.8 million U.S. dollars to Panama to foster priority
activities for the implementation of the country's Law of the
Environment and its National Environmental Strategy.
</P>
<P>
The resources will finance a program to improve the
environmental management capabilities of the National
Environmental Authority and of the Interagency Environmental
System to address community priorities and implement a financing
mechanism to support community environmental initiatives, the IDB
said.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to demonstrate that small investments made at
a community level can achieve significant social and environmental
impact, which in turn will improve management credibility, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
Direct benefits of the program are: to have basic management
instruments to deal with challenges of sustainable economic
growth, competitiveness in the global economy and autonomous
administration of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
The loan is for a 20-year term, with a 4 and a half-year grace
period, at a variable interest rate, which now stands at 6.84
percent.

<HEADLINE> CIA Declassifies Cold War Soviet Union Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) Thursday declassified 24 documents about
the Soviet Union just before it dissolved in December 31, 1991.
</P>
<P>
One document shows that the Soviet Union had the ability of
striking all U.S. missile silos with two warheads each near the
end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
However, the report dated in 1988 said that the Soviet Union
believed the two sides could devastate each other in a nuclear
war, and "thus the Soviets have strong incentives to avoid risking
global nuclear war."
</P>
<P>
The CIA therefore believed the Soviet Union was unlikely to
launch a nuclear attack and provoke a clash with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
According to the 438-page book, the CIA also concluded that
Mikhail Gorbachev's prospects for holding on as president of the
Soviet Union were "doubtful at best" despite his forceful
personality and huge popularity in the West.
</P>
<P>
The document dated in September 1989, two months before the
fall of the Berlin Wall, expressed pessimistic attitude over the
long-term prospects of Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
The book covers the last three years of the Cold War, roughly
from November 1988 to December 31, 1991, when the Soviet Union
officially ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
The documents were declassified for release at a conference at
Texas A&AMP;M University's Bush School of Government. George Bush was
president through most of the time covered by the documents.
</P>
<P>
The CIA underestimated the pace of the Soviet Union's break-up.
One document dated July 21 1991 said that the Soviet Union
Communist Party would be swept from power and the country reshaped
within a "five year time frame." But it occurred in six months.
</P>
<P>
U.S. experts believe that the declassified documents were not
used by Bush to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
Tom Blanton, director of the private National Security Archive,
based at George Washington University, suggested that the
material, which includes many blacked-out sections, was
selectively released by the CIA to make the agency look good.
</P>
<P>
Blanton was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that the
CIA continues to keep under wraps its far-more-sensitive "daily
intelligence briefs," prepared for the president every day and
containing more specific information.
</P>
<P>
The documents released by the CIA "are not the documents George
Bush used to make decisions," Blanton said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Fair Treatment of Arrested Pakistani Politicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) --the United States said on
Thursday that it hoped the arrested Pakistani politicians should
be treated with due process and quick verdicts for their cases.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has recently arrested many politicians
in an anti-corruption drive. And former Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, who was overthrown by the military last month, may appear
in court on Friday. A complaint accusing him and four others of
criminal conspiracy, hijacking, kidnapping and attempted murder
was filed last week.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a regular
briefing that the United States hoped the Pakistani government
will "address this problem in an expeditious and transparent
manner."
</P>
<P>
"Those arrested should not be mistreated, should receive due
process that fully respects their rights, and a quick resolution
of their cases," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also showed some sympathy for the motives of the
Pakistani military, who, led by Chief Executive Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, is now launching the anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has major economic problems, due in part to serious
corruption over the past decade. Unpaid loans have indeed drained
billions of dollars from the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
On plans to try Sharif, Rubin said: "We are monitoring it
carefully, obviously. We have repeatedly urged that Sharif and
all others be treated fairly and impartially and in accordance
with international standards of due process."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Russia had agreed to extend the current U.N. Oil-for-food
program in Iraq until December 4, a U.N. diplomat said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The current oil-for-food program will expire on November 20.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, who asked not be identified, said U.S. and Russia
seek to have it voted in the United Nations Security Council on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Russia at first proposed a four-week rollover of the program
but then agreed to the two-week extension, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Wednesday circulated a draft resolution on renewing
the program for another six months and Russia made some adments
to it.
</P>
<P>
The United States wanted the oil-for-food program renewed
quickly on the same terms as the previous ones which allow Iraq to
sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months.
</P>
<P>
Russia urged the United Nations to lift the ceiling on Iraqi
oil export and double the oil revenue Iraq can use to import spare
parts and equipment for its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food program, began to be
implemented in late 1996, is aimed to ease the worsening
humanitarian situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq must be declared free from weapons of mass destruction if
it wants the sanctions lifted.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
sharply Thursday on a stronger-than-expected profit report from
the computer maker Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 152.61 at 11,035.70.
The blue chip index fell 49.24 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 14.23 at 1,424.94 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 77.72 at 3,347.11, both setting a new
record.
</P>
<P>
The market was buoyant because Hewlett-Packard reported after
the close of the trading late Wednesday that its earnings beat
analysts' revised estimates by 2 cents to 75 cents a share in the
third quarter. Its stock rose.
</P>
<P>
Investors' enthusiasm for Hewlett-Packard also lifted other
technology companies. Intel and Cisco Systems rose as well.
</P>
<P>
The computer maker's strong earnings enabled Stock investors to
put aside the news on higher oil prices that would spark
inflation. But the rising oil price at 26 U.S. dollars a barrel
Wednesday prompted bond investors to sell on fears of inflation,
pushing the yield of the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.17 percent
today, up from 6.13 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE Index rose 4.39 at 648.90 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 4.97 at 462.04. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 0.66 at 822.71.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues barely outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,539 down, 1,524 up and 496 unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 1.00 billion shares from 938.68

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government, FARC Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombian government
and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) resumed peace
talks on Thursday, despite recent escalation of rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
The third round of peace talks started Thursday in the
demilitary zone of San Vicente of Caguan, where six delegates from
the government and three from the FARC attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
The target of the meeting is to organize a public audience for
the initiation of debate of the agenda of economic, political and
social reforms.
</P>
<P>
The discussion may also concentrate in a truce at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
President Andres Pastrana has proposed a truce to the guerrilla
movement, as of December 15 and continuing to January 15, in order
"to achieve a moment of tranquility" for the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the FARC, the largest rebel group of the country, said
they would accept the truce on condition that the government agrees
to settle social problems in the country and to cancel the
extradition of drug-trafficers to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The FARC recently have attacked 13 municipals in six departments
since Tuesday evening, causing at least 50 dead including members
of rebel groups, right-wing militias and policemen.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's armed conflict, the oldest in Latin America, has
left some 400,000 dead. Authorities say that 200 kidnaping, 500
assassinations and five rebel occupations are registered every
month.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the government and the FARC started their
first round of talks this year on October 24, but no concrete
results have been reached so far.
