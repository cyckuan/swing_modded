Thai schools to stop students watching couple lose virginity on
</HEADLINE>
Internet

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Education Ministry has
ordered schools not to let students watch an American couple lose
their virginity on the Internet, a ministry official said Friday.
	   The ministry is also urging parents to prevent their children
from watching. The couple has said they will broadcast their first
sexual encounter live on an Internet website.
	   The broadcast is scheduled for Aug. 5 at 8 a.m. Bangkok time.
	   ``It's very difficult to control what is coming over the
Internet,'' said a ministry official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The controversy over the broadcast is fueling debate in Thailand
about freedom of expression and the Internet. Access to certain
websites, and even the Internet itself, is restricted in some Asian
countries, but Thailand has been relatively liberal in regulating
use of the worldwide computer network.
	   However, conservatives have been trying to push a bill through
parliament that would severely limit access to the Internet and
provide stiff legal penalties for a range of broadly worded
offenses.
	   Democracy activists and many Internet users strongly oppose the
bill, saying it infringes on freedom of expression and would have a
chilling effect on political dissent.
	   Deputy Education Minister Somsak Prisnananthakul said the
broadcast of the two teenagers losing their virginity was
deplorable and that the free sex culture may be acceptable in the
United States but not in many other countries, according to
Friday's Bangkok Post newspaper.
	   ``The ministry has a clear policy to combat pornography. If such
things can enter our country easily, Thai youth will be misled,''
he was quoted as saying by the Post.
	   Thai police have said because the broadcast is emanating from
the United States, no Thai laws will be broken.
	   Athorn Chantawimol, secretary-general of the National Culture
Commission, said the government cannot by law bar anyone from
accessing whatever websites they wish or censor the Internet,
according to the Post.
	   But both he and Somsak said they would speak with various
authorities about possible means of restricting the flow of
questionable material over the Internet while still somehow
protecting individual rights.

Police arrest Thai and Cameroon men in dollar counterfeiting scam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police have arrested two Thai and two
Cameroonian men for swindling people by claiming to teach them how
to counterfeit U.S. dollars, Thai newspapers reported Friday.
	   Police seized piles of paper cut in the size of U.S. dollar
notes, chemicals and other equipment when they arrested the four
men on Wednesday evening in Bangkok, The Nation said.
	   Police were alerted to the scam when a number of people told
police they had been cheated.
	   The gang convinced people that they could turn a blank piece of
paper into a dlrs 100 note by dipping it into a special chemical
compound along with a sample of the U.S. currency.
	   They charged more than a million baht (dlrs 23,800) for the
chemical solution.

Swiss police finding evidence against Raul Salinas. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police arrested an accountant on charges he
acted as a front-man for real estate purchases by Raul Salinas, the
imprisoned brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
prosecutors announced.
	   Juan Manuel Gomez Gutierrez was arrested Wednesday in the
northern city of Chihuahua on a 2-year-old warrant for illicit
enrichment, related to his stint as Raul Salinas' personal
accountant.
	   Gomez Gutierrez was transferred to a Mexico City prison, and was
released Thursday on bail of 600,000 pesos _ dlrs 67.000 _ and a
fine of 4,581 pesos _ dlrs 500 _ according to the government news
agency Notimex.
	   The attorney general's office accuses Gomez Gutierrez of using
Raul Salinas' money to buy properties under his own name.
	   Salinas is on trial on charges of illegally enriching himself
while serving as head of a government agricultural purchasing
agency, and Swiss police said Thursday that they had found evidence
that Salinas received bribes from drug traffickers.
	   Salinas, imprisoned since early 1995, is also being tried on
charges he masterminded the 1994 killing of a rival politician.
	   Carlos Salinas has not been charged with any crime in Mexico and
lives in self-imposed exile in Ireland.

Vietnam's population will reach 81 million by the year 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's population will hit 81 million
by the year 2000, up from nearly 78 million now, the local press
reported Friday.
	   The Labor newspaper quoted the General Statistical Office as
saying population growth slowed last year to 1.78 percent from 1.88
percent in 1996 for an increase of 1.3 million people.
	   The paper also quoted Nguyen Thien Truong, deputy chairman of
the National Committee for Population and Family Planning, as
saying the 1989 average of 3.2 children for women of reproductive
age fell to 2.69 last year, thanks to family planning efforts.
	   Although large families traditionally were encouraged in a
country where 80 percent of the people are farmers, the government
recently has encouraged couples to have fewer children.
	   Truong said population growth in mountainous regions remains
high. The annual rate is 2.5 percent in the central coastal
provinces and 3 percent in the central highlands and some northern
mountainous provinces.
	   Truong said 57 percent of Vietnam's population is under age 25.
	   The United Nations Fund for Population Activities forecast that
Vietnam's population will reach 81 million by 2000, 88 million by
2005, 94 million by 2010 and 104 million by 2020.

Knee injury could keep top forward out of Tiger Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A knee injury could keep Vietnam's top
forward out of the Tiger Cup soccer competition next month, the
Thanh Nien newspaper reported Friday.
	   It quoted doctors as saying it was uncertain whether Le Huynh
Duc's knee will be healed by the time the eight-team tournament
opens on Aug. 25.
	   Duc is training with the national team in the resort city of
Dalat in the central highlands but can only run at full speed for
short periods.
	   The team will spend two weeks training in China before the Tiger
Cup.
	   This is the first time that soccer-crazy Vietnam is hosting a
major regional sports event, even if it is by default.
	   The Tiger Cup initially was to be held in Indonesia, but the
political and economic uncertainties there forced a switch. The
competition was offered to Malaysia, which said it was too busy
preparing for the Commonwealth Games.
	   Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Laos will play in Group B in
Hanoi, while Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines will
compete in Group A in Ho Chi Minh City.

Rematch promoted for De La Hoya, Chavez
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The anticipated Las Vegas rematch between WBC
welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya and Mexico's Julio Cesar
Chavez was promoted Thursday as a chance for De La Hoya to regain
respect.
	   The fight is the main event Sept. 18 of a pay-per-view
television card. Undercard matches have not yet been set, Top Rank
spokeswoman Beth Rosenberg said.
	   ``This fight here, this boxing match, it's something personal,''
De La Hoya told KCBS-TV on Thursday. ``The first time he (Chavez)
didn't give me the credit that I deserved, saying he was cut, he
was not prepared. But this time, I'm going to show the crowd that
the first time wasn't a fluke.''
	   De La Hoya stopped Chavez, a former champion in three weight
classes, in four rounds in defense of the WBC super lightweight
title June 7, 1996 at Las Vegas. The 35-year-old Chavez said last
month he's still got a lot of fight left.
	   ``September 18 will be the surprise of the year. This time, I'm
going to beat Oscar,'' Chavez said during a June news conference.
	   Promoter Bob Arum is offering Chavez a dlrs 250,000 bonus if he
wins by knockout.
	   ``The first time I prepared myself and was in really good shape,
physically and mentally, and this time around I'm going to be in
better shape,'' De La Hoya said.

Maddux keys Braves' win over Brewers, 4-3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Greg Maddux became the NL's first 13-game winner
Thursday night, leading the Atlanta Braves to a 4-3 victory over
Milwaukee.
	   Maddux (13-3), who had a 10-game winning streak snapped in his
last start, limited the Brewers to four hits and one earned run in
6 2-3 innings, keeping his ERA at a major league-best 1.57.
	   Maddux's personal catcher, Eddie Perez, snapped a 2-2 tie with a
run-scoring single in the sixth inning off Cal Eldred (4-8). Perez
added another RBI single in the eighth off Chad Fox.
	   Rudy Seanez entered in the ninth with two runners on, getting
Marquis Grissom on a fly ball and striking out Jeff Cirillo for his
first save.
 &UR; Phillies 4, Mets 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, two defensive lapses by new outfielder Todd Hundley
led to all of Philadelphia's runs.
	   Hundley, a two-time All-Star catcher playing his fourth game in
left field after returning from reconstructive elbow surgery,
misjudged a fly ball in the first inning, allowing two runs to
score.
	   He dropped a routine fly in the eighth as Philadelphia made it
4-1, and made a throwing error in the ninth.
	   Mike Lieberthal doubled twice, tripled and drove in two runs for
the Phillies, who have won eight of 10.
	   Mark Portugal (5-2) limited New York to one run and seven hits
in six innings. Mark Leiter pitched the ninth for his 20th save.
	   John Olerud homered for the Mets. Rick Reed (10-6) took the
loss.
 &UR; Dodgers 8, Cardinals 2 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Ismael Valdes worked seven strong innings and Raul
Mondesi hit a three-run home run as Los Angeles beat St. Louis.
	   Mark McGwire remained stuck on 40 homers for the fourth straight
game. The St. Louis star was 0-for-4 with a tapper to the mound, a
fly ball to the warning track, a pop-out to center and a fly ball
to right.
	   Valdes (7-9) allowed six hits, struck out eight and walked none.
	   Gary Sheffield hit his 16th homer off Kent Mercker (5-7) in the
third, and Mondesi hit his 21st off Bobby Witt to cap a four-run
fourth.
 &UR; Expos 10, Pirates 5 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Mark Grudzielanek hit a three-run homer in
Montreal's six-run fifth as the Expos beat Pittsburgh for their
third straight victory.
	   Grudzielanek's homer chased Jason Schmidt (8-6), who allowed all
six runs in the fifth with two out. The Pirates have lost 13 of 17
games.
	   Expos starter Carl Pavano (3-3) allowed two runs on four hits in
5 2-3 innings. Kevin Young hit his 19th homer for Pittsburgh.

New proposal made for sharing Marcos wealth with victims of abuse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A senior official has proposed that
part of the money from the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos' Swiss
bank accounts be given to victims of abuse under Marcos' rule
before the government and his family share what is left, a lawyer
said Friday.
	   The proposal was made by presidential Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora in a meeting Wednesday with Luis Jalandoni, the head
negotiator for Marxist rebels in peace talks with the government,
said Romeo Capulong, a lawyer for the rebel negotiators.
	   Under the proposal, which requires the approval of President
Joseph Estrada, part of the dlrs 540 million from the Marcos bank
accounts would be given to 9,539 Filipinos who won a class action
suit for human rights abuses against the Marcos estate.
	   ``The division (between the government and the Marcos family)
will only take place after the victims have been duly paid or
compensated,'' said Capulong, a lawyer for the rebel National
Democratic Front.
	   ``I think the beauty of this Zamora-Jalandoni formula is that it
will not make the victims privy to or a party to a bilateral
agreement between the government and the Marcoses that would
contain provisions objectionable to them,'' Capulong said.
	   Human rights groups and the NDF are opposed to a sharing of the
Marcos wealth that would grant his family and associates immunity
from legal action.
	   Capulong said the Marcos victims are seeking at least 30 percent
of the Swiss deposits, which have been transferred to an escrow
account in a Philippine bank. Zamora did not immediately accept the
demand, he added.
	   He said details of the proposal, including how it would be
implemented, would be discussed further by the two sides.
	   Under a Swiss supreme court ruling, the money can only be
released to the Philippine government if it wins a criminal
conviction of Marcos' widow, Imelda, and if the victims of abuse
are fairly compensated.
	   The money can also be released if there is an amicable
settlement between the government and the Marcoses.
	   Zamora has earlier said a settlement would not be less than a
75-25 sharing of the Marcos wealth in favor of the government.
	   The money is part of the billions of dollars Marcos allegedly
amassed illegally during his 20-year administration.
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986 and died
in exile in Hawaii three years later.
	   The cash-strapped Estrada administration is considering an
out-of-court settlement to get the money after 12 years of largely
fruitless court battles.
	   Jalandoni was hopeful that Estrada would approve the proposal
and an agreement on human rights and international humanitarian
law, which was signed by negotiators but was not approved by former
President Fidel Ramos before he stepped down on June 30.
	   Ramos initiated the peace talks in 1992 to end three decades of
Communist insurgency.
	   The human rights agreement, which upholds compensation for the
Marcos victims, was the first of four planned major agreements
before a final political settlement is achieved.
	   The others cover economic and social reforms, political reforms
and disposition of the armed forces.

	   The Orioles had 18 hits, one off their season high set Wednesday
night in a 14-3 victory over Texas. The Rangers have lost five
straight.
	   Texas' Juan Gonzalez, the major league RBI leader with 101,
failed to drive in a run for the eighth straight game. He was
1-for-4.
	   Scott Erickson (10-7) limited Texas to three runs and eight hits
in seven inning. Aaron Sele (12-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Mariners 3, Twins 0 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Randy Johnson took a no-hitter into the eighth
inning before losing it on Brent Gates' one-out single as Seattle
beat Minnesota.
	   Gates, a utility infielder with the Mariners last season, hit a
sharp grounder over the mound that Johnson (9-8) barely missed.
	   Johnson, who no-hit Detroit in the Kingdome on June 2, 1990, has
three one-hitters. The 6-foot-10 (2.08 meters) left-hander struck
out 11, his 94th game with at least than many, and walked three.
	   Shane Monahan drove in all three runs off Brad Radke (9-8).
 &UR; Devil Rays 8, Angels 1 &QC; 
	   In Anaheim, California, Aaron Ledesma had three hits and three
RBIs and Tampa Bay capitalized on Anaheim knuckleballer Steve
Sparks' wildness with five runs in the first inning.
	   Ledesma, Tampa Bay's No. 9 hitter, capped the first inning with
a two-run single as the Devil Rays scored five runs on just two
hits to snap a four-game road losing streak. Paul Sorrento homered
for Tampa Bay.
	   Sparks (3-2) gave up five runs on three hits and five walks in
one-plus inning. Rolando Arrojo (11-6), who leads AL rookies in
victories, allowed one run on three hits in seven innings.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Imprisoned East Timor rebel leader
Xanana Gusmao met a visiting United Nations mediator Friday, and
urged Indonesia and former colonial master Portugal to mend severed
diplomatic relations to help bring peace to his troubled homeland.
	   Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence in Jakarta's Cipinang
Prison, talked with U.N. special envoy on East Timor Jamsheed
Marker for more than an hour in a office within the jail.
	   Although arrested in 1992, Gusmao continues to command influence
over groups which oppose Indonesian control of East Timor.
	   Diplomatic relations have been severed since Indonesia invaded
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1975 and annexed it the
following year as its 27th province.
	   Since then East Timor has endured a guerrilla war and human
rights abuses.
	   The troubled territory marked 22 years of integration with
Indonesia on Friday. However, the United Nations, Portugal and many
other governments do not recognize Indonesia's claim over the
half-island territory.
	   Portugal has proposed that it and Indonesia establish minimal
diplomatic posts known as ``interests sections'' in each other's
capitals.
	   Indonesia has so far rejected the plan because Portugal insists
that Gusmao be freed first.
	   ``I very much want interests sections opened. Before Portugal
said this could only happen if I were released,'' Gusmao told
reporters after meeting Marker. ``But I'll support it now even if I
am not free because I know that it is very important for the
solving of the East Timor problem.''
	   Marker, who is on a weeklong visit to Indonesia as part of
ongoing negotiations to find a settlement, said he and Gusmao
canvassed a wide range of issues.
	   ``It has been a very useful meeting and I go back very much
encouraged by my discussions with Xanana,'' Marker said.
	   ``I am, as always, impressed by his capabilities, by his
leadership and I look forward to continuing this process. I am sure
his contribution will be a major one toward finding a solution of
the problem of East Timor.''
	   Recently, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie offered to release
Gusmao and grant special status to East Timor in return for
international recognition of it as an integral part of Indonesia.

Aborigines concerned about `graffiti' of mystery man carved into

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Aborigines are upset that whoever is
behind a mysterious 2.5 mile- (4 kilometer-) long figure ploughed
into a remote patch of Outback desert may have plastered
``graffiti'' on tribal sites.
	   Police, Aboriginal authorities and locals are still baffled by
the appearance of the massive outline, of an Aboriginal hunter,
which is carved into the dust near Finniss Springs in northern
South Australia state.
	   It was discovered last week by locals from nearby Marree, after
directions were faxed anonymously to the town's hotel.
	   David Rathman, head of the state's Aboriginal Affairs
Department, said Friday local Aborigines are concerned that sacred
ceremonial sites may have been disturbed.
	   ``I imagine it's the appearance of this particular graffiti on
their land, (that has made them upset),'' Rathman told Australian
Broadcasting Crop. radio.
	   Raelene Warren, spokeswoman for the Dieri Mitha Council which
represents one of several Aboriginal clans in the region, said the
council wanted to stop tourists driving to or flying over the site.
	   ``We look at it as exploiting our culture and our dreaming,''
Warren told The Australian newspaper. ``The land is a very
significant area.''
	   Up to six different Aboriginal clans had laid native title
claims to the region before the figure was made.
	   Rob Ferguson, who sells satellite navigation and survey
equipment in the state capital Adelaide, said the figure was
probably mapped out using Global Positioning System navigation
technology, commonly used by geologists and mining surveyors.
	   Ferguson said the figure's creators probably converted a simple
plan to a scale drawing on a computer and set coordinates along
which to drive the machine that cut the figure.
	   ``You wouldn't have to be an expert surveyor,'' Ferguson said.
	   ``Somebody has obviously thought it out, they must have known
they could fit it in on that area and planned it out.''
	   It is believed a plough or scarifier was used to cut the drawing
into the earth.
	   In Marree, population 60, locals are getting sick of the
attention the figure has brought to the town. The figure has made
news around the world.
	   ``I have a job to do, I don't have time to give interviews,''
said a worker at the Marree Caravan Park by telephone.
	   Bartender Peter, who declined to give his second name, said he
had received calls from England and Japan about the figure and that
he was ``sick of talking about it.''

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ World squash champion Rodney Eyles of
Australia had a shaky start to the defense of his Australian Open
title, dropping a game before winning his first-round match
Thursday night.
	   Eyles, ranked No. 4 in the world, held off countryman John
Williams 15-13, 15-13, 13-15, 15-9. It was the only men's match to
go to four games.
	   Eyles, 30, who is playing in his first tournament since the
British Open in April, said his main problem in early rounds is
concentration.
	   ``I enjoy tough games first up as long as I get through them,''
Eyles said. ``It was tight in those games, but I played the big
points well.''
	   In another first-round match, Jonathon Power of Canada beat
Australian Anthony Ricketts 15-7, 15-9, 15-6.
	   In play at the South Australian Women's Open being held at the
same venue _ the Thebarton Theater _ Michelle Martin beat fellow
Australian Judith Mills 9-3, 9-3, 9-0 and Carol Owens of Australia
beat Laura Hamilton of Scotland 9-1, 9-2, 9-2.

Philippine trade deficit falls in first 5 months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine trade deficit shrank
dramatically in the first five months of 1998, reflecting an
economic slowdown caused by Asia's financial crisis, analysts said
Friday.
	   The trade deficit narrowed 66.1 percent to dlrs 1.60 billion in
the January to May period from dlrs 4.73 billion a year earlier,
the government announced Friday.
	   For May alone, the trade deficit narrowed 78.5 percent to dlrs
209 million from dlrs 971 million in the same month a year earlier.
	   Economists expect the deficit will narrow further as imports
continue to contract because of a slowdown in economic activity
caused by the regional financial crisis.
	   ``The economy is grinding to a halt,'' said Edgar Bancod,
analyst for Paribas Asia Equity Securities Inc.
	   A combination of the regional crisis and a prolonged drought
attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon, which caused a steep
drop in agricultural production, is expected to result in economic
growth slowing to 2.5 percent or less in 1998 from 5.8 percent in
1997.
	   The Philippines' trade deficit has been narrowing since last
October. The weak peso, which has fallen by about 36 percent
against the dollar in the past year, has caused the cost of many
imported goods to rise.
	   Exports in the first five months of 1998 rose 20.3 percent to
dlrs 11.51 billion, while imports fell 8.2 percent to dlrs 13.18
billion.
	   Imports of capital goods such as factory equipment, which
accounted for nearly 40 percent of total imports, fell 9.1 percent
in May from the year-ago month, while imports of consumer goods
fell 29.2 percent.
	   The latest trade figures support analysts' projections that the
trade deficit this year will be considerably lower than 1997's
deficit of dlrs 11.1 billion.
	   Peregrine Securities Philippines Inc. economist Luz Lorenzo
forecasts the deficit at dlrs 4 billion by year-end and says the
country may even post a small current account surplus this year.
	   The last time the Philippines posted a surplus in its current
account _ a broad measure of international financial flows _ was in
1986, when it totaled dlrs 954 million.

Villagers plan to sue Indonesia's ex-president over cattle ranch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of villagers plan to sue
ex-President Suharto for allegedly seizing their land and building
a prestigious cattle ranch there in the 1970s, The Jakarta Post
reported Friday.
	   They claim 300 hectares (740 acres) of Suharto's 700-hectare
(1,730-acre) Tri-S Tapos ranch belongs to 500 people in Cibedug
village, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The ranch sits in lush, hilly country and is considered one of
Indonesia's foremost cattle breeding and producing ranches.
	   A group of villagers filed a complaint with the National Human
Rights Commission on Thursday and said they were also planning to
take Suharto to court.
	   They said they had farmed the land for many years before they
were pushed out in the 1970s. They want to start farming there
again as many were running short of food because of an ongoing
economic crisis.
	   ``They found the land bulldozed and turned into the Tapos ranch
without any compensation,'' said Teddy Wibisana, a spokesman for
the farmers.
	   He said villagers had tried three times to take the land back in
recent weeks. In the latest attempt, 300 farmers clashed with
security guards on Wednesday, he said.
	   There was no immediate comment from Suharto.
	   Suharto quit as president in May, ending 32 years of
authoritarian rule.
	   Since then, activists have called for an investigation into his
wealth and allegations of corruption. Suharto has denied any
wrongdoing.

	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ World squash champion Rodney Eyles of
Australia had a shaky start to the defense of his Australian Open
title, dropping a game before winning his first-round match
Thursday night.
	   Eyles, ranked No. 4 in the world, held off countryman John
Williams 15-13, 15-13, 13-15, 15-9. It was the only men's match to
go to four games.
	   Eyles, 30, who is playing in his first tournament since the
British Open in April, said his main problem in early rounds is
concentration.
	   ``I enjoy tough games first up as long as I get through them,''
Eyles said. ``It was tight in those games, but I played the big
points well.''
	   In another first-round match, Jonathon Power of Canada beat
Australian Anthony Ricketts 15-7, 15-9, 15-6.
	   In play at the South Australian Women's Open being held at the
same venue _ the Thebarton Theater _ Michelle Martin beat fellow
Australian Judith Mills 9-3, 9-3, 9-0 and Carol Owens of Australia
beat Laura Hamilton of Scotland 9-1, 9-2, 9-2.

More than 5,000 textile workers lose jobs as factory closes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 5,000 workers lost their jobs
when one of Thailand's largest textile manufacturers shut down its
factory because of financial problems, union leaders said Friday.
	   Thai Melon Textile Company informed workers Thursday that the
company was ceasing production because it no longer had money to
buy raw materials and banks refused to lend it money.
	   Thailand is battling its worst economic crisis in modern times.
Profligate lending by banks and finance companies left many on
shaky ground and with little liquidity to lend to even healthy
companies.
	   More than a million Thais have become unemployed since the
crisis began in July 1997.
	   Textiles are considered a sunset industry in Thailand because
rising wages have made production costs less competitive compared
with some other countries.
	   The devaluation of the Thai currency, the baht, however, has
given many garment and textile manufacturers a second life by
effectively reducing their production costs.
	   The liquidity crunch, however, has wiped out those gains from
some companies, including Thai Melon.
	   ``When the company called us in, we thought some workers would
be laid off, but we didn't think the whole plant would shut down
and everyone would lose their jobs,'' said Prasart Sangthong, the
textile workers union leader at Thai Melon.
	   Union leaders and workers said they were concerned the company
would refuse to pay full severance because of its financial
problems.
	   Prasart said that more than 1,000 employees had worked for the
company more than 20 years, legally entitling them to 6.5 months
severance pay.
	   The company, which said only about 100 of the 5,000 workers will
be kept, has scheduled a meeting with union leaders on Tuesday to
discuss the severance issue.
	   Union officials were meeting with Labor Ministry officials
Thursday to try and iron out their concerns over compensation.
About 3,000 employees refused to leave the factory grounds on
Thursday until the issue was settled.
	   Union leaders were quoted in Friday's The Nation newspaper as
saying workers would demonstrate until a fair settlement was
reached.

Three Philippine Airlines unions threaten joint strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The three unions at financially
troubled Philippine Airlines threatened Friday to call a joint
strike to protest massive layoffs.
	   The unions also called for a boycott of products made by
companies owned by PAL majority owner Lucio Tan, who has interests
in banking, beer and tobacco.
	   The Philippines' three largest labor federations, erstwhile
rivals, said they would call a one-day nationwide general strike in
sympathy with the PAL unions if they walk out.
	   PAL union leaders did not set a date for the threatened joint
strike.
	   ``It will just happen,'' said Alex Barrientos, president of the
PAL Employees Association, the ground crew union.
	   Barrientos' union filed a strike notice after the company served
termination papers to 5,000 of its more than 13,000 workers.
	   But the labor department has assumed jurisdiction over the
dispute, effectively blocking a strike or further layoffs by the
company. Radical labor groups, however, have urged the union to go
ahead with strike plans.
	   Conciliation talks between the airline and the union failed on
Tuesday.
	   Airline officials say a strike by the 5,000-member union could
force Asia's oldest airline to shut down after 57 years of
operation.
	   President Joseph Estrada said a closure of the flag carrier
would cause embarrassment to the country and urged the labor
department to try to settle the dispute within two weeks.
	   PAL's 625 pilots went on strike for 22 days last month,
aggravating financial losses caused by Asia's currency crisis and
setting back an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program.
	   The airline fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a
government return-to-work order.
	   PAL says it is in a precarious condition with assets totaling 90
billion pesos (dlrs 2.1 billion) and financial obligations
amounting to 85 billion pesos (dlrs 2 billion).
	   PAL officials say they are seeking foreign investors to help
form break-off companies to handle some of the airline's major
operations.
	   The move is part of a rehabilitation plan being prepared to save
the airline from collapse.

Cambodian candidates play anti-Vietnam race card to win votes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PHN101 July 16 &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ One word has turned up day after day
in the Cambodian election campaign, picking at the scabs of
centuries of racial hatred: `Yuon,' an ethnic slur for Vietnamese.
	   ``I felt sick when I started hearing the word 'Yuon' on radio
and television,'' Khun Sokha says. Even though her family emigrated
from Vietnam generations ago, she fears for her life if July 26
elections are won by politicians using the term to tap a rich vein
of distrust.
	   Her fear may be justified: Three ethnic Vietnamese were shot
dead Wednesday night in what police say was the first such violence
of the campaign season. Unidentified gunmen burst into their home
in an eastern Cambodia fishing village, police said Thursday.
	   ``It was a terrorist attack because nothing was stolen after
that,'' Mao Chandara, a senior police official said. ``I think it
marks the harassment of the Vietnamese before the elections.''
	   Hatred of Vietnam runs deep; Cambodia's larger neighbor has
consumed large swaths of Cambodian territory over the past several
centuries.
	   Khun Sokha, a 50-year-old fisherwoman, recalls seeing corpses of
slain Vietnamese floating down a river after Prince Norodom
Sihanouk was deposed by Gen. Lon Nol in a 1970 U.S.-backed military
coup.
	   Attacks on ethnic Vietnamese fishing villages followed, as did
failed military offensives against the Vietnamese-backed Khmer
Rouge guerrillas, who seized power in 1975 and began a reign of
terror that cost the lives of as many as 2 million Cambodians.
	   The Khmer Rouge regime, however, proved every bit as rabidly
anti-Vietnamese as Lon Nol, and their old allies responded to
repeated border attacks by toppling the Khmer Rouge in 1979. A
decade of military occupation followed.
	   Hun Sen, a mid-ranking Khmer Rouge commander who defected to
escape purges, rose to the top of the Hanoi-installed government in
1985 and has been Cambodia's most powerful figure ever since. But
many Cambodians distrust their leader and accuse him of being a
puppet of Vietnam.
	   Hun Sen's main opponents in the upcoming elections are playing
up his alleged links to Hanoi, accusing him of giving away disputed
territory and allowing illegal Vietnamese immigrants to settle on
prime land.
	   In 1993, Hun Sen lost U.N.-sponsored elections. Still, he forced
his way into a co-premiership with the winner, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, and then deposed him in a bloody coup a year ago. Hun
Sen has called new elections and allowed Ranariddh to return from
exile in an effort to win back international legitimacy and foreign
aid.
	   Critics say that Hun Sen has stacked the electoral machinery in
his favor and is using violence and killings to intimidate
opponents, but his victory is not a foregone conclusion.
	   Ranariddh and another leading opponent, Sam Rainsy, have drawn
huge crowds at campaign rallies. They are popular to many because
they stand up to Hun Sen, but they also have made much of
anti-Vietnamese sentiment.
	   They accuse the Vietnamese of stealing land and depleting fish
stocks. They promise to get rid of all illegal immigrants, though
they insist they will do so peacefully and legally.
	   Sam Rainsy acknowledged to reporters Thursday that he may have
inadvertently raised anti-Vietnamese emotions in some of his
speeches, but said he has ``never advocated violence or the use of
violence to solve these problems.''
	   Since Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy both are French-educated lawyers
steeped in the culture of human rights, their rhetoric is jarring.
	   ``There are Vietnamese Khmers, but a Yuon is a Yuon,'' Ranariddh
told a cheering crowd in a campaign speech Wednesday. He has
repeated the message again and again while crisscrossing the
countryside.
	   The talk may seem like posturing, but to ordinary ethnic
Vietnamese in Cambodia, it's frightening. There are 200,000 to 1
million ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia, a nation of 10 million.
	   Ngoc Sanh, president of the Vietnamese Association in Phnom
Penh, says he hopes that if Ranariddh or Sam Rainsy wins, the
international community will ensure ethnic Vietnamese are protected
from violence or eviction.
	   Since violence is never far away, Pham Thi Cu Ba, 34, said she
and her family are preparing for the worst. They just sold their
small floating house and were buying new engines for their two
fishing boats.
	   They also have stocked up on gasoline so they can flee to
Vietnam.
	   ``We are ready to leave if things get too bad,'' she said,
producing papers showing she is a Cambodian resident. ``But we want
to go peacefully. We don't want any shooting.''

New twist in old trade row: Japan plans rice exports to U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Five years after a bitter trade dispute ended with
Japan reluctantly bowing to American demands to open its rice
market, Japanese farmers plan to start exports to a promising new
market _ the United States.
	   ``Rice consumption in Japan has peaked so we're interested in
finding new outlets to expand sales,'' Daisuke Shindo of Japan's
Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, told The Associated
Press Friday.
	   The cooperative, once a staunch opponent of freer rice trade,
formally approved a plan Thursday to market one-pound (453 gram)
bags of its rice through San Francisco-based retailer
Williams-Sonoma.
	   The premium grade rice, grown in Japan's Niigata prefecture, or
state, will be sold in the U.S. from next month for dlrs 6.75 a bag
_ roughly seven times higher than the cost of U.S. domestic rice.
	   It will be marketed under the brand name ``Kumai Harvest,'' with
Kumai meaning a rice offering to the gods. The cultivation of the
grain has long had mystic overtones in Japan, where it has
traditionally been considered a religious act.
	   Still, consumption of rice has slumped dramatically since the
1960s as wheat-based products such as bread and noodles have become
more popular.
	   Japan officially announced a partial opening of its rice market
in 1993 under a plan committing it to gradually increase imports up
to a maximum of eight percent of the market by 2000.

Indonesia to set up inquiry into rapes during rioting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president plans to launch
an inquiry into mass rapes during recent rioting, a news report
said Friday.
	   Women's Affairs Minister Tutty Alawiyah said an independent
national committee against violence toward women would be set up
next week, The Jakarta Post newspaper reported.
	   Its members would include prominent women's rights activists who
claim 168 women and girls, many of them from Indonesia's Chinese
minority, were raped. Twenty allegedly died after the attacks.
	   Some perished in homes set afire by mobs. One victim was only 9
years old.
	   The minister said the group's short term mission would be to
investigate the rapes and report its findings to President B.J.
Habibie.
	   After meeting women's groups on Wednesday, Habibie condemned the
rapes during the rioting as ``an inhuman episode in the history of
the nation.''
	   The riots led to the resignation of President Suharto after 32
years of autocratic rule. About 1,200 people died in the violence,
and thousands of homes and buildings were looted and burned.
	   It was Habibie's first direct condemnation of the rapes.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
population. But they dominate industry and commerce and have become
the scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30 years.

China's economic growth falls short for first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Battered by the Asian economic crisis, China's
economy grew by a lower than targeted 7 percent in the first six
months of 1998, the State Statistical Bureau reported Friday.
	   Bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said Asia's financial crisis ``exerted
more pressure'' on the Chinese economy, which has also been hit by
weak domestic demand and widespread summer flooding. ``It hasn't
been easy for China's economy to maintain stable growth,'' Ye said
at a news conference.
	   But measures to stimulate consumer spending and create jobs
should allow China to reach its goal of 8 percent growth for the
year, Ye said. The government regards the target as critical in
creating jobs for millions of workers being laid off from
loss-making state industries.
	   New Premier Zhu Rongji, an economic policymaker who took over
the premiership in March, has staked considerable political
credibility on achieving 8 percent growth.
	   Failure to meet the target could imperil his plans to turn the
state sector around within three years and increase bureaucratic
resistance toward other much needed economic reforms.
	   China has been trying to stimulate the economy by spending more
on public works and other major projects. Fixed asset investment
grew 13.8 percent in the first half of the year, slightly off the
target of around 15 percent annually for the next three years, the
bureau said.
	   The financial crisis ailing most Asian economies bit hard into
China's foreign trade, with exports growing 8.6 percent during the
first five months compared to 21 percent growth in the same period
last year.
	   Exports to Southeast Asian countries, South Korea and Japan all
fell an average of 16 percent in the first half.
	   But significant growth in trade with Europe, the United States,
Russia and Africa boosted the trade surplus to U.S. dlrs 22.6
billion, up dlrs 4.8 billion from a year ago.
	   Imports rose 2.2 percent during the first half to dlrs 64.3
billion,
	   Qiu Xiaohua, the bureau's chief economist, said floods across
much of central China caused a decline of 11 percent in the grain
harvest, shaving 0.4 percent off economic growth for the first
half.
	   Pledged foreign investment grew 5.5 percent in the first half,
but the amount of foreign capital actually invested dipped 1.3
percent.
	   The slowing economy has taken a toll on consumer prices, which
continue to decline. The retail price index, China's benchmark
inflation measure, fell 2.1 percent in the first half from the year
ago, the bureau said.

Thai lobbyist indicted in U.S. says she will return to Washington
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts with Kanchanalak saying she will return to U.S., edits
to conform; new to some points &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai lobbyist indicted in the United
States for allegedly making illegal campaign contributions said
Friday she will appear in court to fight the charges.
	   Pauline Kanchanalak said in a telephone interview with ITV, an
independent television station based in Bangkok, that she would
return to Washington D.C. in three or four days to begin preparing
her defense against the 24-count indictment.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai joined the chorus of Thais
defending Kanchanalak's character.
	   ``I personally think she is a highly capable Thai lady who has
wide contacts and protects the interests of the nation,'' Chuan was
quoted as saying in The Nation newspaper on Friday.
	   The prime minister did not comment on the charges on which
Kanchanalak, and her sister-in-law Duangnet ``Georgie'' Kronenberg,
were indicted earlier this week by a U.S. District Court.
	   It is illegal for non-U.S. citizens to make contributions to
political parties, but the U.S. Justice Department alleges that the
pair funneled dlrs 679,000 to the Democratic National Committee and
other committees associated with political candidates.
	   Kanchanalak's statement to ITV on Friday seems to end a
controversy over whether or not the U.S. would be able ask for her
extradition if she failed to appear in court.
	   It is not clear whether the crimes with which she was charged
are covered by the extradition treaty between Thailand and the
United States. Generally an extraditable offense must be considered
a crime in both countries.

Quake jolts Taiwan, 10 reportedly trapped in collapsed hotel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A strong earthquake jolted Taiwan on
Friday, reportedly burying 10 people in a mountain hotel, injuring
at least four others and damaging a railroad.
	   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.2, was centered
about 14 kilometers (8.5 miles) west of Mount Ali, 300 kilometers
(180 miles) south of Taipei. It was felt throughout the island.
	   State radio said the Rweili Hotel on the scenic mountain
collapsed, trapping 10 people inside, and that at least four other
people were hurt.
	   Highways leading to the mountain were blocked by landslides,
parts of a railroad caved in and several cars were damaged by
falling power poles, it said.
	   Several other people were injured by fallen rocks at waterfalls
in the mountain, it said.
	   The quake shook buildings throughout Taiwan, but there were no
immediate reports of other damage.
	   The magnitude is a measure of the total energy released by an
earthquake, as indicated by ground motion recorded on seismographs.
An increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold increase
in the strength of the quake.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Seeking to heal a national wound,
Russia prepared to bury its last czar in a low-key ceremony Friday,
the 80th anniversary of his execution at the dawn of the communist
era.
	   The remains of Czar Nicholas II were borne home to the old
imperial capital Thursday and placed inside the riverfront
cathedral where he, his family and servants, will take their places
alongside earlier Russian monarchs.
	   A huge security contingent surrounded the St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral in advance of Friday's ceremony, which will bring
together President Boris Yeltsin, dozens of the czar's relatives,
diplomats from about 50 countries, and Prince Michael of Kent, who,
as a member of the British royal family, is also a distant relative
of Russian royalty.
	   Yeltsin unexpectedly changed his mind Thursday and announced
that he would attend the burial, elevating its status to something
closer to the grand state ceremony that had once been foreseen.
	   ``The truth was concealed for 80 years,'' Yeltsin said.
``Nothing was said about it. And tomorrow, the truth should be
told, and I should take part.''
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917, the Romanov dynasty that preceded it, and the nature of
national guilt and repentance.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   But the burial has also raised multiple controversies among
political and religious leaders, and a number of leading figures
are skipping the event.
	   Among those not taking part will be Patriarch Alexy II, the head
of the Russian Orthodox Church, which has not yet recognized the
bones as those of the royal family.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony will be
relatively simple. When they are interred, the priest will not use
the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques are
already hanging on the walls of the chapel.
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for 300 years. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
Alexandra, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, nine of the 11 bodies
were recovered from a desolate forest outside the Ural Mountains
city of Yekaterinburg and subjected to years of painstaking tests
to confirm their identification.
	   The burial ceremonies began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg, when the
bones were taken from the city's police morgue and placed in small,
skeleton-sized coffins.
	   The coffins were flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday, and
thousands of Russians stood in silence along the city's streets and
river embankments Thursday as the czar's cortege passed by.
	   A long line of dark green hearses glided past the imperial
capital's canals and palaces, saluted by cannon and honor guards.
	   Lyuba Novikova, a 37-year-old secretary, said she was surprised
by the depth of emotion she felt when she saw the hearses.
	   ``I cried,'' she said. ``I'm a simple person. I can't say why,
but I cried.''
	   But then she gave it another thought and added: ``It's like a
shadow has been over us, and now we hope things will be better for
Russia.''

Report: Jakarta police cracking down on illegal gun-buying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police are reportedly stepping up
street operations following claims that some ethnic Chinese and
foreigners have illegally bought guns, fearing fresh riots in
Jakarta.
	   Police have seized 10 guns since July 1 from both members of the
military as well as civilians, the Jakarta Post on Friday quoted
city police chief Maj. Gen. Noegroho Djajoesman as saying.
	   About 1,200 people died in the Indonesian capital during riots
over price increases that led to the downfall of former President
Suharto. Looters targeted the stores and homes of Chinese, who are
resented in large part because of their relative wealth.
	   Indonesia's economic crisis has put millions of people out of
work and there are fears of another outburst of street violence as
conditions worsen.
	   Police seized the guns because the owners did not have the
necessary documents, Noegroho said. Police have been deployed in
public places such as business centers and intersections.
	   His comments came amid local media reports that armed robberies
in Jakarta are on the rise. Many wealthy ethnic Chinese and some
foreigners have reportedly obtained guns to defend themselves in
anticipation of more unrest.
	   Noegroho said authorities had found expatriates in possession of
guns capable of firing tear gas.
	   ``To possess a gun, one needs to go through very difficult
bureaucratic procedures,'' the Post quoted him as saying. ``So we
believe the guns we have recovered were purchased illegally on the
black market.''

Malaysia and Eritrea sign agreement to boost ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia and Eritrea on Friday
signed an agreement to boost cooperation in economic, scientific,
technical and cultural fields.
	   The signing of the agreement between the Southeast Asian nation
and the tiny country on the Horn of Africa was witnessed by
visiting Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki and Malaysia's Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   The document was signed by the transport ministers of the two
countries.
	   ``Eritrea is a very young nation but it has the determination to
develop politically and economically,'' said Malaysia's deputy
foreign minister, Leo Michael Toyad, after the signing ceremony.
	   Toyad said Afwerki had invited Malaysian businesses to invest in
his country ``when the time is right.''
	   A border conflict started two months ago between Eritrea and
Ethiopia, the country it gained independence from in 1993.
	   Bilateral trade between Malaysia and Eritrea totals dlrs 250,000
annually.
	   Afwerki leaves Malaysia later Friday, concluding a two-day
visit.

Suharto relative says he's ready to take responsibility for
</HEADLINE>
abductions

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - A son-in-law of former President
Suharto on Friday said he was ready to take responsibility for the
abductions of political activists earlier this year, the official
Antara news agency reported.
	   Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, the former head of Indonesia's
special forces, said he would await the results of a military
investigation of the kidnappings, which occurred before Suharto
quit in May after 32 years in power.
	   Seven soldiers of Kopassus, the unit he had commanded, have been
arrested in the abductions case.
	   ``If there is proof, I am ready to take responsibility,'' Antara
quoted Prabowo as saying. The commander was transferred to head a
military college in the city of Bandung after Suharto stepped down.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions and have called for investigations of
Prabowo and other senior officials.
	   According to the military, the seven soldiers had been ordered
to investigate the activities of several anti-government
protesters, but went beyond this and allegedly took the activists
captive.
	   Some activists, who are now free, have testified to Indonesia's
National Human Rights Commission that they were abducted by masked
men, tortured and questioned about their political activities.
	   Other human rights groups say as many as 24 activists were
abducted and that at least nine remain missing.
	   Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces chief, transferred Prabowo to the
less prestigious post in Bandung in what was seen as the removal of
a rival.
	   The ambitious and brash Prabowo is a controversial figure whose
fast-rising career was sidelined by the sudden downfall of his
father-in-law.

Groups file lawsuits over Indonesian riots

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A collection of human rights and other
groups have filed a class action lawsuit against the government and
security forces for allegedly not doing enough to stop violent
protests in May.
	   About 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of buildings
destroyed in the violence that led to the resignation of President
Suharto after 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   Women's groups say at least 168 women were raped.
	   Lawyer Ester Jusuf of the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute said
Friday the groups want 52.5 trillion rupiah (dlrs 3.7 billion) in
compensation to be paid to victims of the rioting that rocked
Jakarta and other cities.
	   They also want the government to apologize on television and in
newspapers for not providing adequate protection for Indonesian
citizens.
	   Ester said the suit was filed against Defense Minister and armed
forces commander Gen. Wiranto as well as several police chiefs.
	   Many of those targeted in the violence were members of
Indonesia's ethnic Chinese community, who have been portrayed as
scapegoats for the country's worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Vietnam wants investigation into Cambodian killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has asked for investigations into
the killings of an ethnic Vietnamese family in Cambodia, local
press reported Friday.
	   The request was made Thursday by the Vietnamese Embassy in Phnom
Penh to the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation and the U.N. Human Rights Center in Cambodia, the
Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan said.
	   The paper said Vietnam's ambassador to Cambodia expressed
``profound concern'' that recent anti-Vietnam statements by some
Cambodian politicians may cause instability and danger for
Vietnamese nationals living in Cambodia.
	   He asked the Cambodian government to implement effective
measures to ensure their safety and prevent any actions that could
hurt bilateral relations.
	   Ethnic Vietnamese have become an election issue in Cambodia,
where Sam Rainsy and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the main opponents
to Hun Sen in the July 26 elections, are preying on sentiment
against the country's big neighbor.
	   They accuse the Vietnamese of stealing land and depleting fish
stocks. They promise to get rid of all illegal immigrants, though
they insist they will do so peacefully and legally.
	   Cambodian police say three ethnic Vietnamese were shot dead
Wednesday night when gunmen burst into their home in an eastern
Cambodian fishing village. Vietnamese media said four people died.

Saddam vows to have sanctions lifted in 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein on Friday vowed to
have U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq lifted this year, saying he is
prepared to fight Western ``conspiracies'' to prolong the nation's
misery.
	   In a nationally broadcast speech, Saddam said a threatening
letter his government sent to the U.N. Security Council on May 1
``was not a mere outcry of protest but an expression of
determination.''
	   The letter said the government will reconsider ties with U.N.
arms monitors overseeing the destruction of Iraq's illegal weapons
if the embargo does not end soon.
	   Saddam did not say what action he will take if the sanctions are
not lifted by December. But this is the first time he has set a
deadline for their end. The Security Council is scheduled to review
the sanctions in October.
	   Iraq accuses the United States and Britain of working to keep
the sanctions, which cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify
that Saddam no longer presides over weapon of mass destruction.
	   ``We tell them, in the name of the great people of Iraq, that
they are under great illusion and that they should re-read ancient
history ... meticulously in order to derive lessons which may spare
us and spare them the consequences of their evil and malice,''
Saddam said.
	   The speech _ marking the 1968 coup that brought his Baath party
to power _ constituted Saddam's strongest remarks against the
sanctions this year.
	   Underneath the bluster and the rhetoric there is fear that
Saddam may be preparing for another confrontation with the United
Nations, similar to the one earlier this year over Iraq's refusal
to open presidential palace to the weapons inspectors.
	   That crisis was resolved in February, but hopes that it would
pave the way for ending the sanctions were dashed after a recent
report that Iraqi missile warheads, tested in the United States,
contained traces of the deadly VX nerve gas.
	   Iraq claims it never loaded missiles with VX. If a second round
of tests in Europe confirm the U.S. finding, Iraq is likely to lose
credibility, making any lifting of sanctions unlikely this year.
	   But Saddam stressed that ``this year ... God willing, will be
the year and time of virtual erosion of the blockade off Iraq.
	   ``It will be ... the driving force for giving the death blow to
the blockade, breaking its chains and ignominiously defeating the
evil doers, villains and minions,'' he said.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
have devastated this rich nation's economy by blocking regular sale
of oil, its main commodity.
	   Saddam said his government is now more confident than any time
of its ability to fight ``the plight of sanctions, threats,
conspiracies and ill-intentioned schemes coming from outside.''
	   The government blames its international trade isolation for a
large number of deaths, widespread poverty, malnutrition and a
crumbling infrastructure because of shortage of spare parts.
	   Saddam also criticized other Arab nations for urging Iraq to
honor its international obligations instead of working to have the
sanctions lifted.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar lower against yen in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency
prices; ADDS trader quote in 13th graf, details throughout.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices slipped Friday on
profit-taking after four straight days of gains. The U.S. dollar
declined against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 161.14 points, or 0.97
percent, to close at 16,570.78. On Thursday, the Nikkei average had
risen 117.78 points, or 0.71 percent.
	   Share prices were knocked lower as investors moved to lock in
recent gains ahead of a three-day holiday weekend, traders said.
The Nikkei index had rallied 641.86 points, or 4.0 percent, over
the past four trading sessions.
	   Financial markets in Tokyo will be closed Monday for Japan's
Marine Day holiday.
	   ``Although the market is weaker after the recent gains, further
downside risk is limited as pension funds are seen actively buying
blue chips,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, a general manager at Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 2.78 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,277.95. The
TOPIX had closed up 5.42 points, or 0.42 percent, the day before.
	   Uncertainty over the outcome of a struggle within the ruling
party to name a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto also weighed on the market, traders said.
	   Hashimoto announced his intention to resign Monday after his
Liberal Democratic Party suffered a humiliating defeat in elections
for the upper house of Parliament. The LDP has retained control of
the government because of its majority in the more powerful lower
house.
	   Once the ruling party selects Hashimoto's replacement next
Friday, both houses of Parliament will formally anoint a new
premier in a vote expected by month's end.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar fell against the yen
on optimism the new prime minister will act quickly to implement
measures to stimulate the anemic Japanese economy.
	   The U.S. currency bought 139.32 yen in mid-afternoon trading,
down 0.40 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its rate
of 139.94 overnight in New York.
	   The market was particularly excited by the decision early Friday
of former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama to throw his hat
in the ring as a possible successor to Hashimoto.
	   ``Kajiyama is expected to take drastic steps to cure the ills of
(the) Japanese economy,'' said Katsuaki Tanaka, a trader at Nippon
Credit Bank Ltd.
	   Kajiyama, a senior LDP politician, has earned a reputation for
tough talk about the need for reforms to stabilize Japan's troubled
financial industry.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.415 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.435 percent,
driving its price up to 110.30 yen from 110.16 yen the previous
day.

 &UR; Rebel leader says Timorese should be involved in peace talks

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Residents of East Timor should be
involved in any U.N.-mediated talks between Portugal and Indonesia
on the fate of the troubled territory, a jailed rebel leader said
Friday.
	   Xanana Gusmao, the head of East Timor's separatist guerrilla
movement, spoke after a United Nations mediator visited him in the
Jakarta jail where he is serving a 20-year sentence.
	   ``I think East Timorese people have to take part in discussions
about their own fate,'' said Gusmao.
	   He also urged Indonesia, which controls the territory, and
Portugal, East Timor's formal colonial master, to mend severed
bilateral diplomatic relations to help bring peace.
	   The rebel leader talked with the U.N.'s special envoy on East
Timor, Jamsheed Marker, for more than an hour inside Cipinang jail.
He later was visited by East Timor's Nobel peace laureate, Bishop
Carlos Belo.
	   Arrested in 1992, Gusmao continues to command influence over
groups which oppose Indonesian control of East Timor.
	   Indonesia's diplomatic relations with Portugal were severed
after the Southeast Asian country invaded East Timor in 1975 and
annexed it the following year as its 27th province.
	   Since then East Timor has endured a guerrilla war and human
rights abuses.
	   East Timor marked 22 years of integration with Indonesia on
Friday. However, the United Nations, Portugal and many other
governments do not recognize Indonesia's claim over the half-island
territory.
	   Portugal has proposed that it and Indonesia establish minimal
diplomatic posts known as ``interests sections'' in each other's
capitals.
	   Indonesia has so far rejected the plan because Portugal also
insists that Gusmao be freed first as part of the deal.
	   ``I very much want interests sections opened. Before Portugal
said this could only happen if I were released,'' Gusmao told
reporters after meeting Marker.
	   ``But I'll support it now even if I am not free because I know
that it is very important for the solving of the East Timor
problem.''
	   Marker, who is on a weeklong visit to Indonesia as part of
ongoing negotiations to find a settlement, said he and Gusmao
discussed a wide range of issues.
	   ``It has been a very useful meeting and I go back very much
encouraged by my discussions with Xanana,'' Marker said.
	   ``I am, as always, impressed by his capabilities, by his
leadership and I look forward to continuing this process. I am sure
his contribution will be a major one toward finding a solution of
the problem of East Timor.''
	   Recently, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie offered to release
Gusmao and grant special status to East Timor in return for
international recognition of it as an integral part of Indonesia.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Princess Elena gave birth Friday to a baby
boy, the Spanish royal couple's first grandchild, the Zarzuela
Palace said.
	   Elena, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia's eldest daughter, gave
birth shortly after 2 a.m. (0000 gmt) in a Madrid clinic where she
was admitted a day earlier.
	   The child is to be called Felipe Juan Froilan de Todos los
Santos and will be baptized this fall, the palace said in a
statement.
	   Elena is married to banker Jaime de Marichalar. A teacher and
skilled equestrian, she is second in line to the Spanish throne
after her brother Prince Felipe, who is single.
	   The family's younger daughter, Princess Cristina, is married but
childless.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A strong earthquake jolted Taiwan on
Friday, burying 10 people inside a mountain hotel and injuring at
least four. The quake also blocked roads and damaged a railroad.
	   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.2, was centered
about 14 kilometers (8.5 miles) west of Mount Ali, 300 kilometers
(180 miles) south of Taipei. It was felt throughout the island.
	   A hotel in the town of Rweili on the scenic mountain collapsed
in the quake, trapping 10 people inside, said police officer Tseng
Ta-lin in a telephone interview.
	   Rescue efforts were hampered because roads leading to the hotel
were blocked, and several bridges had collapsed, Tseng said.
Rescuers were trying to reach the site on foot, and helicopters
were being mobilized, he said.
	   State radio said parts of a railroad also caved in and several
cars were damaged by falling power poles.
	   Several other people were injured by fallen rocks at waterfalls
in the mountain, it said. Tseng could not confirm a TV report that
one person had been killed by falling rocks.
	   The quake was felt throughout Taiwan, but there were no
immediate reports of other damage. Reports said it was centered
only 500 meters (1,650 feet) underground, making the local impact
very strong.
	   Earthquakes are frequent in Taiwan, but most of them are
centered deep under the sea and cause little damage.
	   Mount Ali, 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) high, is known for its
diverse terrain and variety of animal and plant life.
	   Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the total energy released
by an earthquake, as indicated by ground motion recorded on
seismographs. An increase of one digit in the scale represents a
tenfold increase in the strength of the quake.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area.

Hundreds leave East Timor on tense anniversary

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Fearing fresh violence and carrying their
most prized possessions, hundreds of residents crowded onto a ship
Friday to flee East Timor.
	   In the streets of the territory's tense capital of Dili,
hundreds of soldiers armed with sticks and rifles patrolled on the
22nd anniversary of Indonesia's annexation of the former Portuguese
colony.
	   A flag-raising ceremony to mark the anniversary went ahead
peacefully outside Dili's main government building.
	   Thousands of people have left East Timor in recent days amid
worries that pro-independence activists might demonstrate on the
anniversary, touching off clashes with security forces. Since last
month, soldiers have killed two protesters during rallies.
	   The turmoil comes during a visit to Indonesia by U.N. envoy
Jamsheed Marker, who is trying to broker a solution to the bitter
impasse in East Timor.
	   The resignation in May of authoritarian President Suharto and
ensuing democratic change in Indonesia have given new impetus to
efforts to negotiate an accord. Still, new President B.J. Habibie
rules out independence in the territory, the fervent hope of many
East Timorese.
	   On Friday, Marker met East Timor's jailed separatist guerrilla
leader, Xanana Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence in a
Jakarta prison. The U.N. official was expected to meet Habibie this
weekend but he did not say whether he would visit East Timor.
	   Indonesian officials as well as Bishop Carlos Belo, East Timor's
Nobel peace laureate, have urged him to stay away for fear his
visit could touch off violence.
	   At the Dili port, many people carted radios, televisions,
luggage and other possessions onto a boat bound for Bali island.
Many planned to then travel to Java, the most populated of
Indonesia's 17,000 islands and home to the capital, Jakarta.
	   A few people shepherded pigs and ducks. Some waved and cheered
as the boat left port. Officials said all 1,200 tickets had been
sold.
	   The travelers were mostly immigrants from neighboring islands
who complained of intimidation and harassment by indigenous East
Timorese.
	   Ngadiyanto, a 37-year-old taxi driver who waited in line with
his wife and child, said thugs had demanded his watch and money
several times and he was robbed last week.
	   ``After five years living in Dili, I've been feeling insecure
for the past two months,'' he said.
	   In recent days, there have also been scattered incidents of
stone-throwing at cars in Dili.
	   Most shops in the seaside capital were shut Friday as the
Indonesian-appointed governor, Abilio Soares, pressed ahead with a
ceremony marking Indonesia's takeover of East Timor.
	   Hundreds of police, soldiers and civil servants in blue and
brown uniforms stood in rows outside the Portuguese colonial-era
governor's office as a military brass band played. A red and white
Indonesian flag was draped above the entrance to the pillared
building.
	   ``I urge all the parties to avoid the anarchist actions that
have been occurring recently and resulted in some migrant settlers
leaving East Timor,'' Soares said in a speech.
	   There were no reports of violence or anti-Indonesian protests.
Activists who want a vote on independence have said they would stay
off the streets in protest against the governor's celebrations.

Player thrown out for life over referee attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MACKAY, Australia (AP) _ An under-21 rugby league player has
been banned from competitive matches for life after admitting he
punched a referee during a game on July 5.
	   Mackay North player Terry Smith said in his defense that referee
Kerry Moore had racially abused him, but that was dismissed for
lack of evidence. Smith was sent off during a match between Mackay
North and Mackay West under-21 teams won by Wests 26-8.
	   ``The referee sent him (Smith) off and he turned around and
decked him,'' said Mackay and District Rugby League secretary Alf
Abdullah. (djp)

Election committee investigates illegal monitor complaints
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The body overseeing upcoming
elections said Friday it was investigating reports that thousands
of poll observers may have bought their way into the monitoring
process.
	   The National Election Committee has asked the Interior Ministry
to help determine how many people may have illegally purchased
national observer cards, committee spokesman Leng Sochea told a
news conference.
	   A high number of illegal monitors ``could affect the electoral
process,'' he said.
	   Nearly 60,000 people have signed up to monitor the July 26
electoral contest, enough for five monitors at each of the 11,000
polling stations, and almost six time the expected number according
to the NEC. The sheer numbers have raised eyebrows among electoral
watchdogs.
	   Some of the observers may have been tricked into paying fees of
up to dlrs 100 for nonexistent jobs, the Cambodia Daily reported
earlier this week, but others may be loyal to Cambodian leader Hun
Sen's ruling political party and could risk the neutrality of the
monitoring process.
	   One non-governmental organization, the Buddhist Relief
Association, which boasts 24,000 observers, reportedly has links to
high-ranking Cambodian People's Party members, the paper reported,
and some of the new recruits were allegedly uniformed soldiers.
	   ``Any people who obtain cards illegally will be punished by
law,'' said Leng Sochea.
	   Cambodia's elections are scheduled to take place one year after
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who won Cambodia's U.N.-sponsored
election in 1993, was ousted by the powerful Hun Sen in a bloody
coup.
	   As many as 90 of the prince's supporters were killed by Hun
Sen's forces in the months that followed, according to the U.N.
Center for Human Rights. There have been no investigations in any
of those killings.
	   In a bid to win back legitimacy and aid lost after his violent
takeover, Hun Sen called for new elections.
	   Critics say that the electoral process has been stacked in his
favor and that Hun Sen's CPP has engaged in intimidation, threats
and killings of opposition members in the provinces.
	   Ranariddh returned from exile late last month under the terms of
a Japanese-sponsored peace plan aimed at ensuring he has the
opportunity to take part in the election.
	   The United Nations is overseeing a group of 500 international
observers.
	   The NEC said Friday it is also investigating reports that the
CPP has been organizing mock elections across the northwestern
province of Battambang to make sure party supporters vote
``properly'' on election day, Leng Sochea said.
	   CPP agents have conducted mock election sessions in 89 communes
across the province, telling thousands of people to ``tick'' the
CPP box, the Cambodia Daily reported. The NEC and electoral laws
prohibit the use of ballots or sample ballots to try to influence
the way people vote.

Former Yamaichi executive given suspended prison term in payoff

scandal &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former executive of failed Yamaichi Securities
Co. was given a suspended prison term Friday in the first ruling in
a racketeer scandal that rocked Japan's financial world last year.
	   The Tokyo District Court handed Mitsuharu Matsushita, 56, the
10-month suspended sentence for his role in 107 million yen (dlrs
770,000) that Yamaichi allegedly gave admitted racketeer Ryuichi
Koike, a court official said.
	   Friday's ruling was the first handed down to one of the 33
executives now standing trial for payoffs to Koike, one of Japan's
most notorious ``sokaiya'' racketeers.
	   The scandal embroiled some of the biggest names in Japanese
finance, including the top three brokerages _ Nomura Securities
Co., Daiwa Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. _ and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Ltd., one of the country's biggest banks.
	   The executives are accused of handing millions of dollars to
Koike in exchange for his silencing noisy shareholders at the
companies' annual shareholders meetings.
	   During the trials, prosecutors accused the former Yamaichi
executives of paying Koike to help the brokerage cover up 274
billion yen (dlrs 1.97 billion) in hidden losses.
	   Yamaichi, one of Japan's ``Big Four'' brokerages, collapsed in
November in Japan's largest business failure since World War II
after the scandal brought these losses to light.
	   The company officially closed down at the end of March. Three
former executives have been arrested on charges of hiding the
losses.
	   Koike, 55, has pleaded guilty to receiving the illegal profits
in a separate trial.
	   ``By failing to face serious problems and instead using a
sokaiya, management lacked ethical sense and deserves severe
criticism,'' presiding Judge Kaoru Kanayama said in issuing
Friday's ruling.
	   Matsushita was one of eight Yamaichi executives arrested for
illegally funneling the money to Koike between December 1994 and
January 1995.
	   Matsushita and his company were also accused of illegally
compensating Showa Lease Co., a medium-size leasing firm, 316
million yen (dlrs 2.27 million) for investment losses between
November 1994 and March 1995.
	   In Friday's ruling, the court ordered defunct Yamaichi to pay an
80 million yen (dlrs 575,000) fine.
	   Under the Japanese legal system, Matsushita is unlikely to serve
his sentence as long as he does not commit any further legal
violations.
	   In a separate court session on Friday, the prosecution demanded
a three-year prison term for a former Ministry of Finance official.
	   Toshimi Taniuchi, a former assistant chief in the ministry's
inspection department, stands trial on charges of accepting bribery
in the form of lavish entertainment in exchange for tipping off
finance companies ahead of surprise inspections.
	   Taniuchi and another official of the powerful ministry were
arrested in January on suspicion of receiving lavish entertainment
between 1993 and earlier this year.

Australia concerned about clash between navy boat and illegal

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A violent clash between an Australian
navy patrol ship and an Indonesian boat caught fishing illegally in
Australian waters has triggered high-level defense and diplomatic
talks between the two countries, the government said Friday.
	   Australia's top naval commander spoke directly to his Indonesian
counterpart and other talks were held at officer level after the
incident, during which the Indonesian boat repeatedly rammed the
Australian ship. The Australian ship fired warning shots over the
intruder's bow.
	   During a tense 16 hour chase through rough seas, the Royal
Australian Navy's HMAS Cessnock on July 7 repeatedly tried to stop
an Indonesian boat spotted fishing about 125 miles (200 km)
northwest of the city of Darwin, within Australia's economic
exclusion zone.
	   Lt.-Com. Colin Cooper Friday said the Indonesian boat failed to
respond to his ship's calls for it to stop, and that the intruder's
helmsman was seen to swing the steering wheel several times towards
his ship before the boats clashed.
	   In a graduated response demonstrating ``deadly force,'' the
Cessnock fired a rifle shot over the Indonesian boat's bow, then
single shots from a 50-caliber machine gun, then a shot from a
40-millimeter Bofors deck-mounted gun.
	   The chase ended after about 340 miles (550 km) when the boat
re-entered Indonesian waters.
	   Prime Minister John Howard and Defense Minister Ian McLachlan
Friday backed Cooper's decision not to fire directly into the
intruders' boat.
	   ``We are talking about fish here. We don't want to go around
killing people for a bunch of fish,'' Cooper told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   But opposition defense spokesman Arch Beavis said that if a navy
patrol boat couldn't stop an unarmed fishing boat, it would be
useless against a vessel built to smuggle illegal immigrants or
drugs.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A Czech van slammed head-on Friday into
a Hungarian bus 120 kilometers (85 miles) east of Budapest, killing
two people and injuring 12 others, police said.
	   The accident occurred at 4:45 a.m. (02:45 GMT) near the town of
Toeroekszentmiklos, when the Czech van crossed the median and
crashed into the bus, police Lt. Col. Gyoergy Lengyel said by
telephone.
	   The dead included one passenger in the Czech van and a
20-year-old Hungarian on the bus. The Czech driver and a young
Czech boy were in critical condition, police said.
	   Ten others bus passengers were also injured.
	   The three Czech males were driving across Hungary to Bulgaria
when the accident occurred.

Prime minister threatens to end ruling coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
Friday warned she would collapse the governing coalition rather
than allow instability to persist in coalition partner the New
Zealand First party.
	   The warning came as five New Zealand First's legislators
continued to defy their party's decision Tuesday to dump Maori
Affairs Minister Tau Henare from his post as deputy leader of the
party.
	   The five legislators, who represent the country's five Maori
seats in the national Parliament, support Henare.
	   The group has said they may break away from New Zealand first
and form a ``Maori party.'' The five have pledged support for
Shipley as members either of the new party or New Zealand First.
	   But Shipley said she would not allow the government ``to be held
hostage'' by any group.
	   ``Interest groups, and in particular Maori, do have a special
place in New Zealand, but it's not at the cost of the rest of New
Zealand,'' Shipley said.
	   Shipley's National Party has 44 seats, and New Zealand First 17,
forming a narrow one-seat majority in the 120-seat legislature.
	   Political observers say Shipley has been working behind the
scenes to secure support from minority parties outside the
coalition.
	   But the numbers in Parliament mean her government but would
still depend on at least seven New Zealand First votes to remain in
power if the coalition dissolves.
	   The New Zealand First caucus meets Tuesday to decide on a new
deputy leader.

South African advances to quarterfinal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO, California (AP) _ Trevor Immelman of South Africa won
two matches Thursday to advance to the quarterfinals of the U.S.
Amateur Public Links Championship.
	   Immelman, runnerup last year in the U.S. Junior Amateur
runner-up, defeated Allen French, 35, of Gilbert, Arizona, 2 and 1,
in the second round and Andrew Komor, 22, of New Brighton,
Minnesota, 9 and 8, in the third round.
	   Also advancing to the quarterfinals were Sal Spallone, 20, of
Vero Beach, Florida; Lee Kinney, 25, of Red Wing, Minnesota; Byron
Schlagenhauf, 22, of Los Angeles, and Todd Rose, 20, of Fresno,
California. Because play was suspended Thursday evening by fog, the
remaining quarterfinalists will be decided Friday morning.
	   Quarterfinal and semifinal matches were scheduled Friday with
the 36-hole final on Saturday. advance to the quarterfinal round of
the U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship at the 7,010-yard
(6408-meter), par-72 South Course at Torrey Pines Golf Course.
	   Immelman, who has not trailed in any of his matches this week,
ended his third-round match in under two hours and finished the day
with 11 birdies in 27 holes.
	   In the third round, Immelman, of Somerset West, South Africa,
had six birdies on the front nine and ended the match with a birdie
on the 10th. He was the first player since 1954 to end a match 9
and 8.
	   ``I feel so comfortable this week,'' Immelman said, ``Lately,
I've started good and lost it on the back nine. After lunch I was
frustrated with my play in the morning match, and I thought that it
was time to play to my ability.''

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Karate blows to the chest and target
practice with machine guns and stun grenades are all in a day's
work for an elite batch of police men and women preparing to take
on organized crime in India's financial capital.
	   After a month's training, the first 39 officers to volunteer for
the dangerous duty will be posted Saturday at police stations in
some of Bombay most violent neighborhoods. Batch by batch,
officials hope to train at least a quarter of Bombay's
38,000-strong police force in commando tactics.
	   With citizens complaining violent crime has spiraled out of
control, the force is under pressure to show it can fight back. But
that is just one of the reasons officers are attracted to the
Special Operations Squad and its 12-hour daily regime of lectures,
exercises and target practice.
	   ``We need this training so we can survive,'' said Sub-Inspector
Hemant Sawant.
	   ``We will be the city's shield. I feel all police officers
should be given this training,'' added Sawant's classmate Tushar
Kadam, another sub-inspector.
	   A crackdown on organized crime has increased clashes between
police and criminals armed with sophisticated weapons. In one
incident in June, a gang threw a grenade when confronted by police,
killing two police officers and two civilians and injuring 17
others.
	   Bombay police have shot and killed more than 80 men since last
October. Police described the victims as known criminals; human
rights groups say they were denied the right to trial.
	   Retired Col. Mahendra Choudhary, who supervises the squad's
training, said his graduates will be disciplined. Their lectures
include tips on planning safe and effective raids.
	   ``They will shoot only when fired upon, only in self-defense,''
Choudhary said. ``Even the worst chap from this squad will be 50
times better than the average policeman.''
	   The squad is put through its paramilitary paces in an open-air
firing range in northeastern Bombay. The area resounds with grenade
blasts and staccato firing.
	   The officers use a bullet-riddled car filled with dummies of
``terrorists'' for target practice. Squad members who hit dummies
of ``innocent bystanders'' propped up around the car are penalized
with a heavier exercise load.
	   Bombay police first drafted 55 officers for the special squad,
of whom more than half dropped out before they were deployed last
month. When officials called for volunteers, hundreds applied.
	   The first batch of volunteers includes two women _ twice the
percentage of women as in the total police force.
	   ``When I was first kicked in the chest during karate training, I
felt faint,'' said police woman Sushma Surve. ``But now I know how
to defend myself.''

Toddler wanders desert for two hours after parents die
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ A toddler wandered alone through the
scorching desert of northern Mexico for two hours after his parents
died of carbon monoxide poisoning in an irrigation ditch.
	   A resident of the town of Puerto Guevara, 180 miles (290
kilometers) southwest of El Paso, Texas, found the 2-year-old boy
on Thursday lying by the side of a road, dehydrated and exhausted
in the 95-degree (35 Celsius) heat, according to local police.
	   The boy's father, Enrique Armendriz, 32, had been repairing a
pump in a farm ditch when he was overcome by fumes, police said.
His mother, Neima Armendriz, 28, found him and climbed into the
ditch to help, but was overcome as well.
	   The boy, whose name wasn't released, wandered for two hours
before he was found, police said.

Malaysian groups protest atrocities against women in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Several Malaysian groups Friday
demonstrated in front of the Indonesian embassy to protest against
mass rape of Chinese women in Indonesia.
	   About 20 protesters submitted a memorandum demanding immediate
government action. It was their second successive day of protest.
	   ``The government of Indonesia has to be responsible for the
brutal and inhuman acts,'' said the memorandum by nearly one dozen
volunteer groups, many of them representing ethnic Chinese in
Malaysia. They demanded a probe supervised by the United Nations.
	   ``We insist it acts immediately to establish a special panel to
investigate the incidents,'' the memorandum said.
	   The document was received by an embassy official, who declined
to speak to reporters.
	   Among signatories to the document are the International Movement
for A Just World, The Voice of People or SUARAM, the human rights
group, ALIRAN, and the Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall.
	   The rape of dozens of women and girls during riots two months
ago has been condemned by the new Indonesian president, B.J.
Habibe. He has promised to prevent it from happening again.
	   Women's groups say at least 168 women, mainly Chinese, were
sexually assaulted, including 20 who died as a result of the
attacks.
	   The groups organizing Friday's protest said they were especially
concerned about atrocities against women of the Tionghua, a small
minority even among the Chinese.
	   ``In May, the Tionghua women in Indonesia were brutally
murdered, their homes, shops, factories and belongings set ablaze
by the assailants,'' the statement said.
	   ``The women, as young as 10 years old, were tied, beaten and
raped in turns in the presence of their family members. Some were
raped to death,'' it said.
	   The riots which broke out across the country led to the
resignation of former President Suharto, who ended 32 years in
power. About 1,200 people died in the violence. Thousands of homes
and buildings were looted and burned.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
population. However they dominate industry and commerce and have
become the victims of the worst economic crisis in 30 years.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Seeking to heal a national wound,
Russia prepared to bury its last czar in a low-key ceremony Friday,
the 80th anniversary of his execution at the dawn of the communist
era.
	   As cathedral bells rang out, President Boris Yeltsin and dozens
of dignitaries gathered at the riverfront fortress where Czar
Nicholas II, his family and servants, were to take their places
alongside earlier Russian monarchs.
	   ``This is not just a funeral, but a national repentance,'' said
Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the world's leading conductors and
cellists, who was exiled during the Soviet era.
	   ``It shows the entire world that Russia is changing and becoming
more humane,'' he said on Russian television.
	   Yeltsin unexpectedly changed his mind Thursday and announced
that he would attend the burial, which many leading figures have
chosen to skip due to controversies surrounding the event.
	   Dozens of the czar's relatives, diplomats from about 50
countries, and Prince Michael of Kent, a member of the British
royal family, which is related to the Russian royalty, also arrived
for the service at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917, the Romanov dynasty that preceded it, and the nature of
national guilt and repentance.
	   The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but Russia has not
previously held any major, formal ceremonies dealing with the
abuses committed during communist times. Friday's service brought
the issue to the fore.
	   ``By burying the remains of innocent victims, this generation of
Russians is trying to expiate the sins of their ancestors,''
Yeltsin's press service said in a statement issued Thursday.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   But the burial has also raised multiple controversies among
political and religious leaders.
	   Among those not taking part was Patriarch Alexy II, the head of
the Russian Orthodox Church, which has not yet recognized the bones
as those of the royal family.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony was to be
relatively simple. When they are interred, the priest was not to
use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques are
already hanging on the walls of the chapel.
	   About 1,500 people gathered outside the fortress Friday morning,
most of them hoping to get a glimpse of the ceremonies. But a few
dozen were there to protest the burial.
	   ``Factories are closed. People aren't getting their pay _ what's
going on with this funeral?'' said Vyacheslav Marichev, a former
politician.
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for 300 years. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
Alexandra, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, nine of the 11 bodies
were recovered from a desolate forest outside the Ural Mountains
city of Yekaterinburg and subjected to years of painstaking tests
to confirm their identification.
	   The burial ceremonies began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg, when the
bones were taken from the city's police morgue and placed in small,
skeleton-sized coffins.
	   The coffins were flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday, and
thousands of Russians stood in silence along the city's streets and
river embankments Thursday as the czar's cortege passed by.
	   A long line of dark green hearses glided past the imperial
capital's canals and palaces, saluted by cannon and honor guards.
	   Lyuba Novikova, a 37-year-old secretary, said she was surprised
by the depth of emotion she felt when she saw the hearses.
	   ``I cried,'' she said. ``I'm a simple person. I can't say why,
but I cried.''
	   But then she gave it another thought and added: ``It's like a
shadow has been over us, and now we hope things will be better for
Russia.''

Festina officials still in detention, reportedly heading to Lille
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHOLET, France (AP) _ The Festina team's director and doctor
were still in detention Friday, and were reportedly headed to the
northern city of Lille to face possible charges in the drug case
that has rocked the Tour de France.
	   Lille is where the case is being investigated. Another Festina
member, a masseur, has been in custody there since last week, after
police found a stash of performance-enhancing drugs in his car.
	   Team director Bruno Roussel and doctor Eric Ryckaert, in custody
since Wednesday evening, were seen leaving Cholet Friday morning in
police cars, and Radio France Info said the men were headed for
Lille.
	   The cloud over the Tour de France was growing quickly. On
Thursday, Roussel was suspended from his sport.
	   The International Cycling Union announced just before the start
of the Tour's fifth stage that Roussel had failed to respond
adequately to an investigation from the French Cycling Federation.
It said it had suspended his cycling license.
	   But Jean-Marie LeBlanc, the Tour de France director, said there
was no reason to suspend the team from competing for the moment,
and the team insisted it would go on as usual.
	   Ryckaert told the L'Equipe newspaper Thursday he was ``broken''
by the allegations, and staunchly denied any involvement in doping.
	   ``My wife knows me, and she knows that everything they are
saying about me is a serious lie,'' he said.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said he'd seen ``with sadness _ but
not total surprise _ the news that people without scruples wanted
to give cyclists, and surely did, forbidden doping products,
difficult or impossible to detect, and at the same time certainly
very dangerous for athletes' health.''
	   He said it was essential ``that light be shed, and conclusions
drawn.''
	   The media was full of comments by doctors and others saying
they'd expected such a scandal to happen some day.
	   ``This Festina affair doesn't surprise me at all,'' said Dr. Guy
Zerhat, former doctor for the Bic cycling team in the 1970s.
	   ``I am happy it is breaking out today, in everyone's interest,
beginning with the cyclists themselves,'' he said on France 3
television.
	   He said that when he treated members of various teams, ``I saw
horrible things. I saw boys inject themselves during the race.''
	   Another doctor, specializing in doping, said the practice is
``part of daily life.''
	   ``The athlete has simply appropriated a practice that is
widespread in other fields,'' said Dr. Patrick Laure in an
interview with the daily ``L'Est Republicain.''
	   Festina's main sponsors, the Spanish watch company Festina, are
threatening to break their contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

Thai tourism authority fears boycott over chimpanzee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai tourism officials voiced concern
Friday over Swedish animals rights groups' call for a tourist
boycott of Thailand over a Bangkok safari park's treatment of a
chimpanzee from Sweden.
	   Ola, an aging but well-known chimpanzee once used in animal
stage performances in Sweden, has ended up in a 5 by 8 meter (16.5
by 26.4 foot) cage with three other chimpanzees at Safari World in
Bangkok.
	   Many people were outraged when a film of Ola was shown in Sweden
because they believed he had been sent to a sanctuary in Zambia.
	   Campaigns have been launched by the Swedish Society Against
Painful Experiments on Animals and the International Primate
Protection League urging European tourists not to visit Thailand.
	   The groups had offered to buy Ola back, but according to The
Nation newspaper, Safari World's owner refused.
	   Thailand is in the midst of a two-year tourism campaign called
``Amazing Thailand,'' aimed at revitalizing the flagging tourism
industry. European tourists form a high percentage of visitors to
Thailand.
	   A Tourism Authority of Thailand official said Friday that the
Swedish groups were telling only one side of the story. The
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his office is
planing to inspect Ola's living conditions.

Malaysia dreams of becoming Test playing nation by 2020

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pictures of Garfield Sobers, Sunil
Gavaskar and other cricketing greats fill a wall of the Long Bar in
Kuala Lumpur's Royal Selangor Club.
	   Bats decorate the mantelpiece of the clubhouse that overlooks a
lush green field beyond a pavilion, and one corner is dedicated to
Lal Singh, a Malaysian who played for an Indian side against
England at Lords in 1932.
	   The world of Malaysian cricket sequestered within the portals of
the 19th century colonial club has even lost its playing green _
now Independence Square.
	   But decades after it jettisoned the game of its colonial
masters, Malaysia is making a comeback to world cricket and even
hoping for Test status by 2020. That would put it in the league of
teams that play full-fledged, five-day matches and series.
	   After Malaysia lobbied and won inclusion of cricket in this
year's Commonwealth Games, to be held in the capital, Kuala Lumpur,
the government quickly built eight venues to match international
standards.
	   Last year, the city hosted the International Cricket Trophy
tournament, Malaysia's first world cricketing event.
	   Sports administrators are urging more Malaysians to strap on
pads and wield the willow so that stands are filled at such
tournaments.
	   This month, an eight-a-side tournament is being held as a run-up
to the Commonwealth Games that begin on Sept. 11. A national squad
is being trained by former Pakistani Test cap Sadiq Mohamed.
	   Malaysian cricket lovers have watched with dismay as Sri Lanka
and Zimbabwe developed Test teams and Kenya and Bangladesh moved
into the expanding world of one-day cricket.
	   ``At one time the difference between Malaysia and Sri Lanka
wasn't great,'' said Prince Imran, president of the Malaysian
Cricket Association, whose office as headquarters of a sprawling
business empire displays his picture, in white flannels, with
Sobers.
	   ``Independence in 1957 saw the decline of cricket. It was taken
out of schools and the government ignored the game,'' said the
prince, second son of Malaysia's King, Tuanku Ja'afar.
	   Lal Singh remains the only Malaysian to have donned a Test cap,
but Prince Imran, who this year became the first Malaysian to be
elected to the ICC, hopes there will be more in a few years.
	   Creating a world-class team will be an uphill task from among a
generation that knows very little of the game, cricket
administrators say.
	   ``It is a complicated game for people who haven't grown up with
it. Silly mid-offs and silly mid-ons can sound silly if you don't
understand cricket,'' said Karu Selvaratnam, secretary of the
cricket association.
	   Malaysia's national squad of 20 are amateurs. It has created two
domestic leagues, but there are less than a dozen teams
participating.
	   ``If there is no club cricket, then boys have nowhere to go
after playing school-level cricket,'' Selvaratnam said.
	   Cricket was imported by British officers and popularized among
rubber planters and their employees from Australia, New Zealand,
India and Sri Lanka.
	   More than 20 clubs nationwide regularly played each other, and a
unified Malaya team even won against an Australian Test team that
had stopped on the voyage back from an England series in 1926.
	   At independence, the game lost official patronage because
majority Malays preferred football and cricket was seen as a
preserve of ethnic Indians, who comprise 10 percent of the 22
million Malaysians. Ethnic Chinese, the largest minority, also
favored football over cricket.
	   A few like Prince Imran, who said he played for Nottingham
University and was in school with former English captain David
Gower, learned cricket in British schools and universities.
	   ``All races now are playing cricket, which is good for cricket
and good for the country,'' Prince Imran said.

British Development Corporation will double Thai investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Britain's Commonwealth Development
Corporation said Friday it plans to double its capital investment
in Thailand to dlrs 200 million over the next few years despite
gloomy economic forecasts for the region.
	   Chief Executive Roy Reynolds, in Asia to promote the work of the
British government's development finance institution, told
reporters he believes continued foreign investment in the region is
the key to economic recovery.
	   ``While Asia's current economic climate has seen many investors
turn their backs on countries such as Thailand, CDC is looking
forward,'' Reynolds said.
	   CDC now invests dlrs 110 million in small- and medium-sized Thai
businesses ranging from manufacturing concerns to agriculture and
service industries.
	   Reynolds said CDC aims to direct further investment at projects
in Thailand that can give sustainable growth to an economy which
has been damaged by inefficient use of capital.
	   ``Profit is crucial to a sustainable business but profitability
is not the key issue. It's where you put your profits,'' he said.
	   The British government said last year that it plans to sell a 60
percent stake in CDC to the private sector to increase capital
investment in 54 countries across the developing world.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Seeking to heal a national wound,
Russia prepared to bury its last czar in a low-key ceremony Friday,
the 80th anniversary of his execution at the dawn of the communist
era.
	   As cathedral bells rang out, President Boris Yeltsin and dozens
of dignitaries gathered at the riverfront fortress where Czar
Nicholas II, his family and servants, were to take their places
alongside earlier Russian monarchs.
	   ``We must tell the truth _ the (czar's) massacre has become one
of the most shameful pages of our history,'' Yeltsin said in
opening the ceremony in the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral. ``By
burying the innocent victims we want to expiate the sins of our
ancestors.''
	   Dozens of the czar's relatives, diplomats from about 50
countries, and Prince Michael of Kent, a member of the British
royal family, which is related to Russian royalty, stood for the
brief service in the intimate and elegant 18th-century cathedral.
	   However, many leading figures chose to skip the service due to
controversies it generated. Yeltsin was planning to stay away as
well, but changed his mind and said Thursday he would participate.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917, the Romanov dynasty that preceded it, and the nature of
national guilt and repentance.
	   The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but Russia has not
previously held any major, formal ceremonies dealing with the
abuses committed during communist times. Friday's service brought
the issue to the fore.
	   ``This is not just a funeral, but a national repentance,'' said
Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the world's leading conductors and
cellists, who was exiled during the Soviet era.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   But the burial has also raised multiple controversies among
political and religious leaders.
	   Among those not taking part was Patriarch Alexy II, the head of
the Russian Orthodox Church, which has not yet recognized the bones
as those of the royal family.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony was
relatively simple. When they are interred, the priest was not to
use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques are
already hanging on the walls of the chapel.
	   About 1,500 people gathered outside the fortress Friday morning,
most of them hoping to get a glimpse of the ceremonies. But a few
dozen were there to protest the burial.
	   ``Factories are closed. People aren't getting their pay _ what's
going on with this funeral?'' said Vyacheslav Marichev, a former
politician.
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for 300 years. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
Alexandra, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, nine of the 11 bodies
were recovered from a desolate forest outside the Ural Mountains
city of Yekaterinburg and subjected to years of painstaking tests
to confirm their identification.
	   The burial ceremonies began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg, when the
bones were taken from the city's police morgue and placed in small,
skeleton-sized coffins.
	   The coffins were flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday, and
thousands of Russians stood in silence along the city's streets and
river embankments Thursday as the czar's cortege passed by.

Israel and Palestinians working to arrange top-level meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians tried to arrange
their first top-level contacts in months, with Sunday cited as a
tentative date for talks between Israel's defense minister and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy.
	   The United States has urged the two sides to hold two or three
meetings over the period of a week in an attempt to resolve their
differences over an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank and
the procedures for amending the PLO Covenant.
	   The United States has proposed _ as part of a broader peace
initiative _ that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that a smaller forum, the PLO Executive Committee, annul parts of
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposals. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at handing
over 13 percent and insists that the covenant be rescinded by the
Palestine National Council, a larger body whose members are
dispersed all over the Middle East.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Friday the
Palestinians suspected the proposed meetings were another attempt
by Israel to gain time and wriggle out of its commitments.
	   ``We will go because the Americans want us to,'' Abourdeneh told
The Associated Press. ``Netanyahu just wants to waste time, and he
found those (the Americans) who will make this easy for him by
calling for direct talks.''
	   Abourdeneh said the meeting between Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas
and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai would likely take
place Sunday, but that the date had not been finalized.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, said he did not know what
arrangements have been worked out.
	   In a meeting of the so-called Kitchen Cabinet earlier this week,
Mordechai and Netanyahu argued over how the defense minister should
handle the talks. Netanyahu told Mordechai he should listen to what
the Palestinians have to say on the scope of the withdrawal and the
PLO Covenant, then report back to him.
	   Mordechai demanded a free hand in the negotiations.
	   Mordechai and Abbas last met in February, during a two-hour tour
of the Palestinian airport under construction in the Gaza Strip.

Thai labor ministry reviewing new law that worries investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Labor and Social Welfare
Ministry is reviewing a new labor protection act in response to
concerns about possible increases in production costs for local and
foreign investors, a senior ministry official said Friday.
	   Employers are concerned that the new act, which will take effect
on Aug. 19, will require them to pay much more in overtime wages if
their employees work more than eight hours a day, said Rungsarit
Chantarat, the ministry's deputy permanent secretary.
	   ``They are afraid that their overtime payments will become
staggering,'' Rungsarit said Thursday at a meeting organized by the
Federation of Thai Industries to discuss the new law.
	   Cheap labor was an important component in Thailand's 1985-95
economic boom. The economy crashed in 1997, but even before that,
rising labor costs had businessmen and economists warning that the
country was losing its cost competitiveness to nations such as
Indonesia, Vietnam and China.
	   If employees work nine hours a day, five days a week, they now
do not get paid for overtime. But under the new law, the employees
will receive credit for one hour of overtime each day.
	   The new Labor Protection Act says employers cannot ask their
employees to work more than eight hours a day or more than 48 hours
in a six-day week, while the current law does not set daily hour
limits.
	   The new law also requires employers to seek their employees'
consent for any work beyond regular hours or on holidays.
	   Middle-level managers or supervisors will also be eligible for
overtime payments to which they are not currently entitled.

Festina officials still in detention, reportedly heading to Lille
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHOLET, France (AP) _ The Festina team's director and doctor
were still in detention Friday, and were reportedly headed to the
northern city of Lille to face possible charges in the drug case
that has rocked the Tour de France.
	   Lille is where the case is being investigated. Another Festina
member, a masseur, has been in custody there since last week, after
police found a stash of performance-enhancing drugs in his car.
	   Team director Bruno Roussel and doctor Eric Ryckaert, in custody
since Wednesday evening, were seen leaving Cholet Friday morning in
police cars, and Radio France Info said the men were headed for
Lille.
	   The cloud over the Tour de France was growing quickly. On
Thursday, Roussel was suspended from his sport.
	   The International Cycling Union announced just before the start
of the Tour's fifth stage that Roussel had failed to respond
adequately to an investigation from the French Cycling Federation.
It said it had suspended his cycling license.
	   But Jean-Marie LeBlanc, the Tour de France director, said there
was no reason to suspend the team from competing for the moment,
and the team insisted it would go on as usual.
	   Ryckaert told the L'Equipe newspaper Thursday he was ``broken''
by the allegations, and staunchly denied any involvement in doping.
	   ``My wife knows me, and she knows that everything they are
saying about me is a serious lie,'' he said.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said he'd seen ``with sadness _ but
not total surprise _ the news that people without scruples wanted
to give cyclists, and surely did, forbidden doping products,
difficult or impossible to detect, and at the same time certainly
very dangerous for athletes' health.''
	   He said it was essential ``that light be shed, and conclusions
drawn.''
	   The media was full of comments by doctors and others saying
they'd expected such a scandal to happen some day.
	   ``This Festina affair doesn't surprise me at all,'' said Dr. Guy
Zerhat, former doctor for the Bic cycling team in the 1970s.
	   ``I am happy it is breaking out today, in everyone's interest,
beginning with the cyclists themselves,'' he said on France 3
television.
	   He said that when he treated members of various teams, ``I saw
horrible things. I saw boys inject themselves during the race.''
	   Another doctor, specializing in doping, said the practice is
``part of daily life.''
	   ``The athlete has simply appropriated a practice that is
widespread in other fields,'' said Dr. Patrick Laure in an
interview with the daily ``L'Est Republicain.''
	   Festina's main sponsors, the Spanish watch company Festina, are
threatening to break their contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

Two people killed, five missing in landslide in southern

Philippines

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Searchers dug up two bodies Friday
and were searching for at least five other victims of a landslide
in the southern Philippines, police said.
	   Three people rescued hours after the landslide Thursday said at
least seven of their neighbors had been buried under the mud and
debris, provincial police chief Ronaldo Roderos said.
	   Heavy rain loosened mud from a mountain which cascaded down on
several houses in Sergio Osmena in Zamboanga del Norte province,
Roderos said.
	   He said one of the three survivors was conscious and cried for
help, allowing rescuers to immediately find them. All of the
victims were in serious condition with bone fractures, he said.
	   ``We are doing the best we can to dig up possible survivors in
the village,'' Roderos said.
	   Investigators were also trying to verify reports that three
motorcycle taxis with people on board and a man on a horse were
also buried in the landslide, Roderos added.

Crowds at Kensington Palace gave me comfort, says Diana's mother
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For three nights before Princess Diana's funeral,
her mother mingled with mourners outside the princess's Kensington
Palace home, gaining strength from their grief.
	   In a television interview aired Thursday night on Fox in the
United States, Diana's mother Frances Shand Kydd said she could not
believe the scale of the mourning.
	   ``It was unbelievable, there aren't words to describe it,'' she
said in her first interview since her daughter's death in a Paris
car crash Aug. 31.
	   Tens of thousands of people flocked to Kensington Gardens to lay
flowers and mementos at the gates of the palace after Diana's
death.
	   ``With literally thousands of people comforting, sharing, we
were sharing a very deep hurt,'' said Mrs. Shand Kydd, who looked
drawn and sad during the interview in the library at the Spencer
family's ancestral home, Althorp House.
	   ``But I think far too little has been said about what people all
over the world gave to her. They nourished her, they made her
smile, they gave her strength.''
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd said she was frustrated by her inability to
shield her daughter from the frustrations that being famous brought
to her.
	   ``I wanted privacy for her, very often, when she wasn't
working,'' she said.
	   ``But it wasn't to be.''

Draft treaty rebuffs key U.S. demands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Over strenuous American opposition, a U.N.
conference on Friday forged a draft treaty for creating the world's
first permanent war crimes tribunal.
	   Delegates from 160 countries had until midnight Friday to
approve the treaty.
	   Despite weeks of arm-twisting, the United States failed to block
the creation of an independent prosecutor and insert a loophole
that could exempt U.S. citizens and soldiers from the court's
jurisdiction. The treaty's strongest opponents also included most
of Washington's closest allies.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the document from the United
States.
	   As envisioned in the draft, the international criminal court
would bring individuals to justice for genocide, crimes against
humanity, war crimes and aggression.
	   The court, to be based in The Hague, Netherlands, fulfills a
dream that was born after World War II with the Nuremberg trials of
Nazi war criminals and revived with the ad hoc tribunals for
alleged offenders from Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
	   Under the draft, a case could be triggered by the prosecutor,
with the approval of a pre-trial panel of judges, by a country or
by the U.N. Security Council.
	   To hear a case, the court would need the permission either of
the nation where the alleged crime was committed or the suspect's
home country.
	   The United States had sought a more restrictive option that
would let it veto, without interference, the prosecution of any
American citizen. With U.S. troops deployed in hot spots around the
world, Washington fears they could become targets of politically
motivated charges.
	   The U.S. effort to win such veto power was widely denounced.
	   The United States also fiercely opposed the creation of an
independent prosecutor, arguing that only the Security Council or
countries should be allowed to bring a case.
	   A prosecutor, it argued, risked becoming an overworked human
rights ombudsman rather than someone free to focus on only the most
heinous, widespread crimes.
	   The negotiations split the conference into two opposing camps _
one lobbying for the strongest, most independent court possible and
the other hoping to curb its scope.
	   Supporters of a strong court include most of America's closest
allies like Canada and Britain. Among those in the opposite group
are nations with dubious human rights records.

Turkish appeals court orders retrial in slain journalist case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An appeals court on Friday ordered a new
trial for five policemen convicted of fatally beating a journalist
and asked for a wider investigation into his death.
	   Each of the officers was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison in
March for killing Metin Goktepe, 27, by kicking, punching and
beating him with truncheons while he was under detention in Jan. 9,
1996. Six other police officers who were acquitted in Goktepe's
death will also stand trial again.
	   The appeals court ruled that a broader investigation was
necessary.
	   The original trial was viewed as a test of the government's
promise to crack down on torture and abuse by Turkey's security
forces.
	   The prosecution asked the court initially for the maximum
15-year sentence.
	   The defendants claimed Goktepe's death was accidental and said
he died after falling off a wall and hitting his head.
	   His body was found in an Istanbul park one day later after he
and hundreds of other people were detained during a mass funeral
for prisoners killed in jail riots. He was reporting on the funeral
for a left-wing daily, Evrensel.
	   No new trial date has been set.

Crowds at Kensington Palace gave me comfort, says Diana's mother

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For three nights before Princess Diana's funeral,
her mother mingled with mourners outside the princess's Kensington
Palace home, gaining strength from their grief.
	   In a television interview aired Thursday night on Fox in the
United States, Diana's mother Frances Shand Kydd said she could not
believe the scale of the mourning.
	   ``It was unbelievable, there aren't words to describe it,'' she
said in her first interview since her daughter's death in a Paris
car crash Aug. 31.
	   Tens of thousands of people flocked to Kensington Gardens to lay
flowers and mementos at the gates of the palace after Diana's
death.
	   ``With literally thousands of people comforting, sharing, we
were sharing a very deep hurt,'' said Mrs. Shand Kydd, who looked
drawn and sad during the interview in the library at the Spencer
family's ancestral home, Althorp House.
	   ``But I think far too little has been said about what people all
over the world gave to her. They nourished her, they made her
smile, they gave her strength.''
	   Earlier, The Mirror tabloid published a transcript of the
interview that differed substantially from the program.
	   A spokesman for Fox declined to comment on the discrepancy.
Officials at The Mirror could not immediately be reached for
comment.
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd said she was frustrated by her inability to
shield her daughter from the frustrations that being famous brought
to her.
	   ``I wanted privacy for her, very often, when she wasn't
working,'' she said.
	   ``But it wasn't to be.''

Bosnian Government takes over responsibility for demining in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Bosnian government has
taken over responsibility from the United Nations for removing up
to 1 million land mines believed buried throughout the country
after the 3 1/2-year ethnic war.
	   The Bosnian Cabinet formally assumed that responsibility
Thursday, although it plans to use international organizations and
experts to complete the multi-year project.
	   During a formal ceremony Thursday, U.N. special envoy Elisabeth
Rehn said more than 28,400 land mines were destroyed in Bosnia last
year.
	   ``In no other country similarly polluted by mines is such a
diverse effort being employed to rid the country of the menace, by
incorporating a mixture of military units, commercial companies,
non-governmental organizations and directly employed Government
mine clearance teams,'' Rehn said.
	   The 0.N. Mine Action Center estimates there could be between
750,000 and 1 million mines buried in about 30,000 minefields
across the country.

Israel and Palestinians working to arrange top-level meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Netanyahu spokesman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians tried to arrange
their first top-level contacts in months, with Sunday cited as a
tentative date for talks between Israel's defense minister and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy.
	   The United States has urged the two sides to hold two or three
meetings over the period of a week in an attempt to resolve their
differences over an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank and
the procedures for amending the PLO Covenant.
	   The United States has proposed _ as part of a broader peace
initiative _ that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that a smaller forum, the PLO Executive Committee, annul parts of
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposals. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at handing
over 13 percent and insists that the covenant be rescinded by the
Palestine National Council, a larger body whose members are
dispersed all over the Middle East.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Friday the
Palestinians suspected the proposed meetings were another attempt
by Israel to gain time and wriggle out of its commitments.
	   ``We will go because the Americans want us to,'' Abourdeneh told
The Associated Press. ``Netanyahu just wants to waste time, and he
found those (the Americans) who will make this easy for him by
calling for direct talks.''
	   Abourdeneh said the meeting between Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas
and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai would likely take
place Sunday, but that the date had not been finalized.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, also said there was a good
chance a meeting would take place Sunday. The Israelis want the
Palestinians to be represented by Arafat, but it appears likely the
Palestinian leader will send Abbas instead.

Two Senior politicians announce candidacies to become premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Obuchi's news conference

 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two senior politicians announced their candidacies
Friday to replace Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is stepping
down after his party suffered a setback in elections that was a
referendum on his economic policies.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, a 61-year-old party veteran seen
as the favorite of ruling Liberal Democratic Party elders, promised
a 6 trillion yen (dlrs 43.2 billion) income tax cut and a 40
percent reduction in the corporate tax to put the economy back on
track.
	   In his policy speech seeking support for his candidacy, he also
said he would cut the top income tax rate to 50 percent from 65
percent and would ease the tax burden on middle-income earners.
	   ``We must take the explosion of voter anger seriously,'' Obuchi
told reporters.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party president, who will be chosen July
24 in balloting by party lawmakers, is virtually sure to become
prime minister because the party controls the more powerful lower
house of Parliament.
	   The other candidate in the race is former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama. A growing number of reformist lawmakers
are throwing their support behind Kajiyama.
	   Kajiyama has often made controversial, offensive remarks. In
1990, he apologized after saying that prostitutes in Japan and
blacks in the United States both ``ruin the atmosphere of the
neighborhoods they move into.'' The remarks provoked an uproar in
the United States.
	   But many junior party members are protesting what they call
Obuchi's lack of ideas, saying the country needs strong leadership
to revive the stagnant economy.
	   They also oppose the way Obuchi has gone about securing party
support.
	   Before announcing his bid, Obuchi had spent days building up
support in the traditional manner of holding closed door meetings
with party power brokers.
	   The younger lawmakers say that secret deals and backroom
politicking were exactly what voters were rejecting in the polls
last Sunday.
	   Many expressed support for Kajiyama, 72, a longtime critic of
Hashimoto's economic policies and a champion of big tax cuts.
	   ``We must think about how to save Japan from this critical
situation,'' Kajiyama told supporters at a meeting Friday morning
to announce his bid.
	   The upper house elections was widely seen as a vote against the
way the government has managed Japan's economy, which is in the
midst of its worst recession since World War II.
	   Japanese media said a third candidate may also enter the race,
possibly Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi, an
outspoken 56-year-old who is widely seen as one of the party's
rising stars.
	   ``Having three candidates would probably increase the people's
interest,'' Koizumi told reporters. But he did not say clearly
whether he will run.
	   Former Deputy Prime Minister Yohei Kono, another possible
contender, also reportedly said he would support Kajiyama's
candidacy.
	   While the party had planned to choose its leader by July 21, the
date was postponed by three days to give candidates time to explain
their views.

Peru's economy trembles after Shell cancels massive jungle gas

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to highlight Fujimori's reaction. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KOOP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Stung by news that two of the world's leading
oil companies are bailing out of a dlrs 3 billion natural gas
project, President Alberto Fujimori promised to find new partners
to follow through on a plan that would be a boon to the Peruvian
economy.
	   Fujimori tried to reassure investors that other firms were eager
to have a stake in the development of the giant Camisea gas fields,
the largest natural gas reserves in the Americas. But analysts were
dubious.
	   ``I don't think many companies are waiting in the wings,'' said
Steve Turner, an analyst with the U.S.-based James Capel investment
bank.
	   Royal Dutch-Shell and Mobil said Wednesday night they had
decided after a two-year evaluation to pull out of the project
because they wanted more control over the sale and marketing of the
gas than Peru had offered. The Anglo-Dutch company Shell was the
operator and majority owner in a partnership with Mobil Oil Corp.
of the United States.
	   Analysts said rising projected costs and a lack of secure
markets for the gas diminished the appeal of the project. Peru's
stock market fell by almost 2 percent on the news of the deal's
collapse, but the drop was less than expected.
	   ``The government started working immediately to show that the
impact of the pullout would be less than anticipated,'' said Javier
Soh, a business consultant who specializes in natural resource
projects. ``It appears to be working.''
	   But it is still a bitter setback for an undertaking Fujimori
once called ``the project of the century.'' It had been expected to
spur this poor Andean nation's economic development into the 21st
century.
	   It would have been the largest natural resource investment in
Peru's history. The three Camisea gas fields, located deep in the
Amazon basin 350 miles (565 kilometers) southeast of Lima, are
estimated to contain more than 11 trillion cubic feet (310 million
cubic meters) of natural gas and 600 million barrels of
condensates, a liquid form of the fuel.
	   Shell estimated it would have started producing gas in 2001 and
brought Peru more than dlrs 8 billion in tax revenues, wages and
investment over the next ten years. It was to have produced gas for
40 years.
	   Peru had calculated its ability to meet foreign debt payments
relying on anticipated income from Camisea, analysts said.
	   Shell and Mobil Oil signed a deal with Peru to develop Camisea
in 1996 with the option to pull out before 1998 if their evaluation
of fields' economic feasibility proved negative. They had already
spent dlrs 250 million on the project.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Friday on
optimism Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's successor will
act quickly to implement economic stimulate measures. Tokyo stock
prices declined after four straight days of gains.
	   The U.S. currency bought 138.95 yen in late afternoon trading,
down 0.77 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its rate
of 139.94 overnight in New York.
	   The yen received a boost following former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama's decision early Friday to throw his hat
in the ring as contender to succeed Hashimoto.
	   ``Kajiyama is expected to take drastic steps to cure the ills of
(the) Japanese economy,'' said Katsuaki Tanaka, a trader at Nippon
Credit Bank Ltd.
	   Kajiyama has earned a reputation for tough talk about the need
for reforms to stabilize Japan's troubled financial industry. While
Kajiyama is a favorite among market players, other possible
candidates are also expected to focus on economic recovery efforts.
	   The dollar fell as low as 138.65 yen and traded as high as
140.23 yen.
	   Hashimoto announced his intention to resign Monday after his
party suffered a humiliating defeat in elections for the upper
house of Parliament. The ruling party has retained control of the
government because of its majority in the more powerful lower
house.
	   Once the ruling party selects Hashimoto's replacement next
Friday, both houses of Parliament will formally anoint a new
premier in a vote expected by month's end.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, the benchmark 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average fell 161.14 points, or 0.97 percent, to close
at 16,570.78. On Thursday, the Nikkei average had risen 117.78
points, or 0.71 percent.
	   Share prices were knocked lower as investors moved to lock in
recent gains ahead of a three-day holiday weekend, traders said.
	   The Nikkei index had rallied 641.86 points, or 4.0 percent, over
the past four trading sessions. Financial markets in Tokyo will be
closed Monday for Japan's Marine Day holiday.
	   ``Although the market is weaker after the recent gains, further
downside risk is limited as pension funds are seen actively buying
blue chips,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, a general manager at Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 2.78 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,277.95. The
TOPIX had closed up 5.42 points, or 0.42 percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 398 million shares changed hands on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 447 million on
Thursday. Declining stock exceeded advancers 612 to 496, with 161
issues closing unchanged.
	   Uncertainty over the outcome of a struggle within the ruling
party to name a successor to Hashimoto weighed on the market,
traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.425 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.435 percent,
driving its price up to 110.23 yen from 110.16 yen the previous
day.

	   ROME (AP) _ Over strenuous American opposition, a U.N.
conference on Friday forged a draft treaty for creating the world's
first permanent war crimes tribunal.
	   Delegates from 160 countries had until midnight Friday to
approve the treaty.
	   Despite weeks of arm-twisting, the United States failed to block
the creation of an independent prosecutor and insert a loophole
that could exempt U.S. citizens and soldiers from the court's
jurisdiction. The treaty's strongest opponents also included most
of Washington's closest allies.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the document from the United
States.
	   As envisioned in the draft, the international criminal court
would bring individuals to justice for genocide, crimes against
humanity, war crimes and aggression.
	   The court, to be based in The Hague, Netherlands, fulfills a
dream that was born after World War II with the Nuremberg trials of
Nazi war criminals and revived with the ad hoc tribunals for
alleged offenders from Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
	   Under the draft, a case could be triggered by the prosecutor,
with the approval of a pre-trial panel of judges, by a country or
by the U.N. Security Council.
	   To hear a case, the court would need the permission either of
the nation where the alleged crime was committed or the suspect's
home country.
	   The United States had sought a more restrictive option that
would let it veto, without interference, the prosecution of any
American citizen. With U.S. troops deployed in hot spots around the
world, Washington fears they could become targets of politically
motivated charges.
	   The U.S. effort to win such veto power was widely denounced.
	   The United States also fiercely opposed the creation of an
independent prosecutor, arguing that only the Security Council or
countries should be allowed to bring a case.
	   A prosecutor, it argued, risked becoming an overworked human
rights ombudsman rather than someone free to focus on only the most
heinous, widespread crimes.
	   The negotiations split the conference into two opposing camps _
one lobbying for the strongest, most independent court possible and
the other hoping to curb its scope.
	   Supporters of a strong court include most of America's closest
allies like Canada and Britain. Among those in the opposite group
are nations with dubious human rights records.

Takanohana keeps lead at 13-0.

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Yokozuna Takanohana kept his perfect record
at 13-0 and remained a sole leader Friday, with two days left in
the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Behind Takanohana was ozeki (champion) Musashimaru at 11-2.
Another victory behind at 10-3 were yokozuna Wakanohana and ozeki
Takanonami.
	   In the bout Friday, all Takanohana had to do was give a couple
of hand thrusts to sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai, who
suddenly slipped and fell on his knees. Chiyotaikai fell to 9-4.
	   Musashimaru threw himself on top of No. 5 maegashira Tochiazuma
(7-6) after surviving aggressive pushes at the ringside.
	   Wakanohana shoved out No. 9 maegashira Kotonowaka with a steady
push.
	   Akebono thrust out ozeki (champion) Takanonami, leaving both at
9-4.
	   No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
grabbed No. 6 maegashira Higonoumi's loin belt tightly and
bulldozed him out. Kyokushuzan is 8-5 and Higonoumi 5-8.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, also from
Mongolia, was thrown out by No. 6 maegashira Hamanoshima after
failing to give him a decisive push in his initial bulldozing
attempt.
	   No. 3 maegashira Shikishima withdrew from the tournament because
of his injury in the right knee he suffered in Thursday's bout
against No. 5 maegashira Tochiazuma. Shikishima had four victories
against eight losses.
	   In the highest junior division of makushita, No. 50-ranked
Ikemori, or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori, shoved out No. 51-ranked
Higashinogai for his third victory against four defeats.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Security minister orders banning of play about Gandhi's assassin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The federal government has told
officials in western India to shut down a play about the Hindu
nationalist who killed Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi,
the cabinet minister in charge of security said Friday.
	   ``I have every reason to believe my advice won't be
disregarded,'' Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani told lawmakers a
day after debate on the play, ``Nathuram Godse Speaks,'' erupted
into angry shouting in parliament.
	   ``The federal government strongly disapproves (of) any
denigration of Mahatam Gandhi,'' said Advani, whose
Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party leads the governing
coalition.
	   He said he had conveyed that disapproval Thursday to his
counterpart in the state government of Maharashtra. The play in the
local Marathi language has sparked nationwide controversy during
its recent run in Bombay, the Maharashtra capital.
	   In Bombay on Friday, producer Uday Dhurat said he had not been
informed of Advani's decree and that he believed a show scheduled
Friday afternoon would go on.
	   Gandhi, known as the mahatma or ``great soul,'' was assassinated
by Godse in 1948. Godse was enraged by Gandhi's overtures to
Muslims after Britain partitioned colonial India into predominately
Hindu India and officially Islamic Pakistan.
	   Playwright Pradeep Dalvi has told reporters his ``Nathuram Godse
Speaks'' was intended simply to give Godse's views, as well as
Gandhi's, a fair hearing.
	   The Congress Party, the BJP's main opposition, blocked the
play's performance in 1986 when it controlled the state government.
	   ``They said the play glorified Godse, and I was asked to change
the name of the play and to tone it down,'' Dalvi told The
Associated Press. Instead, he went to court to challenge Congress
censors.
	   He dropped his case when the BJP and its more extremist partner,
the Shiv Sena, took over the government of Maharastra and cleared
the play, which has been performed in two local languages, Gujarati
and Marathi.
	   Gandhi was an early leader of the Congress and is revered by
many Indians as the father of their nation. But Shiv Sena leader
Bal Thackeray has publicly ridiculed Gandhi.
	   Ajit Jogi, a lawmaker from the opposition Congress party, asked
in parliament Thursday why government censors allowed ``Nathuram
Godse Speaks'' to be performed.
	   ``Let the people be the judge,'' countered BJP lawmaker Lalmani
Chaube. ``The people should be allowed to make up their minds about
what they want to see.''

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A draft treaty creating the world's first permanent
war crimes tribunal but rebuffing key U.S. demands emerged early
Friday from marathon U.N. negotiations.
	   Delegates from 160 countries have until midnight Friday (2200
gmt) to endorse the treaty, and several said the draft had a good
chance of winning approval.
	   The carefully crafted plan makes concessions designed to win
broad support.
	   The list of crimes the court would prosecute, for example, was
expanded to add aggression, which the non-aligned nations had
sought. In a nod to the five nuclear powers on the U.N. Security
Council, it omits any specific mention of nuclear weapons. A
proviso on war crimes addresses French concerns.
	   But many of Washington's demands _ which many democratic
countries and human rights groups said could cripple the court _
were rebuffed.

World Bank's Piercy Says Kickback Probe 'Continuing'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Probes of corruption at the World Bank,
which resulted in charges against a former bank official, have been
successful and will continue, according to one bank executive. But,
she said they don't indicate a pattern of abuse within the bank.
	   ''One individual is being prosecuted, and the examinations are
continuing,'' Jan Piercy, U.S. representative to the World Bank,
told Dow Jones Friday.
	   Piercy, who is part of the delegation accompanying U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin on his weeklong tour of Africa, said the
corruption probe was set in motion almost a year ago by World Bank
president James Wolfensohn.
	   ''There was independent examination'' by an external fraud team
as well as an internal investigation, said Piercy, and deliberately
received little publicity, so as not to alert any wrongdoers.
	   According to reports this week, as a result of the probe, one
former official, Fritz Rodriguez, has been charged in a civil suit
which alleges he took kickbacks from a contractor working on a
World Bank project in Algeria. Rodriguez, who retired last year,
has denied the charges.
	   The probe reportedly is looking into potential kickbacks and
embezzlement within the World Bank's fund for development projects,
which spends dlrs 25 billion a year.
	   ''It has been successful in the sense than an individual,
several individuals, have been identified as perpetuating fraud,''
Piercy said.
	   However, she added that despite the charges against Rodriguez,
auditors don't believe there's a ''pattern of abuse'' within the
worldwide lender, and have found fewer incidents than would be
expected, given the organization's size. The bank, based in
Washington, D.C., employs about 8,500.
	   Nevertheless, Piercy said Wolfensohn believes that if the
international lender is to be successful in combating corruption in
developing countries, it must be vigorous in policing its own
staff.
	   ''He said we're holding ourselves to a higher standard,
internally and externally,'' she commented.

Two Senior politicians announce candidacies to become premier
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two senior politicians announced their candidacies
Friday to replace Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is stepping
down after his party suffered a setback in elections that was a
referendum on his economic policies.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, a 61-year-old party veteran seen
as the favorite of ruling Liberal Democratic Party elders, promised
more than 6 trillion yen (dlrs 43.2 billion) in permanent tax cuts.
	   The tax cuts will include slashing the top income tax rate to 50
percent from 65 percent to boost the economy.
	   In his policy speech seeking support for his candidacy, Obuchi
also said he would reduce the corporate tax to 40 percent from 46
percent and ease the tax burden on middle-income earners.
	   ``We must take the explosion of voter anger seriously,'' Obuchi
told reporters.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party president, who will be chosen July
24 in balloting by party lawmakers, is virtually sure to become
prime minister because the party controls the more powerful lower
house of Parliament.
	   The other candidate in the race is former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama. A growing number of reformist lawmakers
are throwing their support behind Kajiyama.
	   Kajiyama has often made controversial, offensive remarks. In
1990, he apologized after saying that prostitutes in Japan and
blacks in the United States both ``ruin the atmosphere of the
neighborhoods they move into.'' The remarks provoked an uproar in
the United States.
	   But many junior party members are protesting what they call
Obuchi's lack of ideas, saying the country needs strong leadership
to revive the stagnant economy.
	   They also oppose the way Obuchi has gone about securing party
support.
	   Before announcing his bid, Obuchi had spent days building up
support in the traditional manner of holding closed door meetings
with party power brokers.
	   The younger lawmakers say that secret deals and backroom
politicking were exactly what voters were rejecting in the polls
last Sunday.
	   Many expressed support for Kajiyama, 72, a longtime critic of
Hashimoto's economic policies and a champion of big tax cuts.
	   ``We must think about how to save Japan from this critical
situation,'' Kajiyama told supporters at a meeting Friday morning
to announce his bid.
	   The upper house elections was widely seen as a vote against the
way the government has managed Japan's economy, which is in the
midst of its worst recession since World War II.
	   Japanese media said a third candidate may also enter the race,
possibly Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi, an
outspoken 56-year-old who is widely seen as one of the party's
rising stars.
	   ``Having three candidates would probably increase the people's
interest,'' Koizumi told reporters. But he did not say clearly
whether he will run.
	   Former Deputy Prime Minister Yohei Kono, another possible
contender, also reportedly said he would support Kajiyama's
candidacy.
	   While the party had planned to choose its leader by July 21, the
date was postponed by three days to give candidates time to explain
their views.

Freeze urged in Boston ties with Chinese city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Exiled Chinese dissidents in Boston have called
on the U.S. city to freeze contacts with a Chinese city where
police rounded up democracy campaigners, a rights group said
Friday.
	   The dissidents appealed to Boston Mayor Thomas Menino to convey
concern for the arrests to the mayor of eastern Hangzhou city, said
the letter released by the Hong Kong-based Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   All official visits and cultural and economic exchanges should
be suspended until authorities free all 10 dissidents detained in
the crackdown in Hangzhou and other cities in Zhejiang province,
said the letter.
	   The petition's 10 signers include many student leaders from the
1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, among them Wang Dan who
was released from a Chinese prison in April and now student at
Harvard University.
	   According to the dissidents and the Hangzhou government, Boston
and Hangzhou have sister-city relations, a largely symbolic
association China pushed in the 1980s to try to woo more foreign
contacts and investment.
	   A spokeswoman for Menino said the mayor has never heard of
Hangzhou nor of the dissidents' petition. If Hangzhou declared a
sister-city relationship with Boston, the gesture was not
reciprocated, said the spokeswoman.
	   The detention of the 10 democracy campaigners over the past
eight days marks the most concerted police action against a
dissident group in years. Five of the 10 are still in custody.
	   The dissidents tried to set up an opposition party in defiance
of the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on political power. They
announced the formation of the China Democracy Party on June 25,
the day U.S. President Bill Clinton began his nine-day China visit.
	   One hundred dissidents from across China petitioned President
Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji this week to release the five.
Such appeals are routinely ignored by the Chinese government.

International team heading for Kosovo; US denounces police raid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with OSCE in Kosovo; Rugova pledges to
continue building institutions &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying Serb authorities, Kosovo's
leading Albanian politician pledged Friday to continue building
institutions of government in this rebellious province despite a
police crackdown on his unauthorized parliment.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said a policeman was shot and killed
late Thursday in the town of Kosovska Mitrovica about 20 kilometers
(19 miles) northwest of here by suspected Albanian extremists who
opened fire from a speeding car.
	   Police set up roadblocks in the area to try to find the
assailants.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's self-styled president, made the
declaration as an international fact-finding team met with Serb
officials here in the latest diplomatic bid to end the fighting and
pave the way for peace talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   The team from the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe is to meet Rugova later. He is the ethnic
Albanian politician whom the Americans and Europeans want to lead a
delegation in talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But Yugoslavia's bloody, five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash not
only against the government but also against Rugova, whose
commitment to non-violence has failed to end the bloodshed or win
self-rule.
	   That has won converts to the extremist Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting for independence from Serbia, which is part of
Yugoslavia. Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected last March but
never authorized by the government in Belgrade.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   There were no arrests, but police said the prosecutor could file
charges because of the ``attempt to constitute'' the illegal
parliament. Police waited until the end of the 20-minute session to
enter the building, suggesting Serb authorities were not seriously
attempting to muzzle Rugova but rather send a warning.
	   Nevertheless, Rugova told reporters Friday that ``after
convening parliament, we will continue to build other bodies of
government in Kosovo'' and would invite ethnic Serbs in the
province to take part.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
raid was part of a ``repressive'' strategy that is driving ethnic
Albanians into the extremists' camp.
	   Like the KLA, Rugova also supports independence but his
opposition to violence has won him international support. In the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade, a senior aide to Milosevic was willing
to negotiate autonomy, which the government withdrew in 1989.
	   But the aide, Gorica Gajevic, said the government would never
agree to an independent Kosovo established ``through terrorism and
banditry.''
	   Meanwhile, both Serb and Albanian sources reported scattered
clashes in the province, which is part of Serbia. Serbia and
Montenegro constitute the Yugoslav federation.
	   On Thursday, the government-allied Serb Media Center said a
``large group'' of Albanians attacked a police patrol near Prizren,
about 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Pristina and withdrew
after a two-hour gunbattle.
	   There was no report of casualties in the fighting, the first
reported in the Prizren area.
	   Earlier, Serb sources reported KLA rebels attacked a patrol late
Wednesday near Urosevac and one Albanian was killed. Urosevac
controls the main highway between Pristina and Skopje, and the
fighting could signal a KLA attempt to block a major transport
artery.
	   In reporting on the Prizren clashes, the Kosovo Information
Center, close to Rugova's party, said Serbian police set fire to
three Albanian homes near the town and heavy gunfire could be heard
in the area.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said Albanian fighters attacked a lead
and zinc mine 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina but
were driven off. Rebels control most of that area except for the
mine itself.
	   In their account of the mine clash, Albanian sources said police
shelled seven KLA-controlled villages in the area late Wednesday
but there were no casualties.
	   The Albanian center also reported that fighting in the Decane
region of western Kosovo had claimed the lives of two ethnic
Albanians in the past two days.

Officials: Water will be more expensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore on Friday warned its citizens that
water, which is scarce in this island state of 3.1 million, will
become more expensive.
	   ``Unconventional schemes'' to which Singapore has turned to,
like desalination and collecting water from storm run offs, will
become increasingly expensive, Public Utilities Board said in a
statement.
	   Roughly half of the 1.2 million cubic meters (42 million cubic
feet) of water consumed in Singapore each day comes from Malaysia,
and the sometimes strained relations between the neighbors have
brought the water issue to the fore.
	   Though the two countries' prime ministers in February
tentatively agreed to renew the water contract, the 60-day deadline
for confirming the terms had meanwhile expired.
	   In May, Singapore announced that it was working on plans to
build two seawater desalinization plants by 2011 in addition to one
already under construction, to replace the water supplied by its
northern neighbor.
	   But even with these additional water resources, the amount will
not be enough to meet the people's needs, PUB said. It added the
best solution is to use water more rationally.
	   Earlier this month Singapore launched a water conservation
campaign, announcing higher water tariffs and conservation taxes.
	   As part of campaign, on Sunday PUB will cut off water supplies
in randomly selected areas in Singapore for about two hours.
	   The objective of the exercise is ``to highlight that water is a
strategic resource, by giving the public a feel of what life
without water is like,'' PUB said.

Saddam vows to have sanctions lifted in 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein vowed Friday to
shake off U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq this year, saying he is
prepared to fight Western ``conspiracies'' that aim to prolong the
nation's misery.
	   In a nationally broadcast speech, Saddam said a threatening
letter his government sent to the U.N. Security Council on May 1
``was not a mere outcry of protest but an expression of
determination.''
	   The letter said the government will reconsider ties with U.N.
arms monitors overseeing the destruction of Iraq's illegal weapons
if the embargo does not end soon.
	   Saddam did not say what action he will take if the United
Nations does not lift its embargo by December. But this is the
first time he has set a deadline for their demise. The Security
Council is scheduled to review the sanctions in October.
	   His speech _ marking the 1968 coup that brought his Baath party
to power _ constituted Saddam's strongest remarks against the
sanctions this year.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
have devastated this rich nation's economy by blocking regular
sales of oil, its main commodity.
	   Iraq accuses the United States and Britain of working to
maintain the sanctions, which cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that Saddam no longer presides over weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``We tell them, in the name of the great people of Iraq, that
they are under great illusion and that they should re-read ancient
history ... meticulously in order to derive lessons which may spare
us and spare them the consequences of their evil and malice,''
Saddam said.
	   Underneath the bluster and the rhetoric there is fear that
Saddam may be preparing for another confrontation with the United
Nations, similar to the one earlier this year over Iraq's refusal
to open presidential palace to the weapons inspectors.
	   That crisis was resolved in February, but hopes that it would
pave the way for ending the sanctions were dashed after a recent
report that Iraqi missile warheads, tested in the United States,
contained traces of the deadly VX nerve gas.
	   Iraq claims it never loaded missiles with VX. If a second round
of tests in Europe confirm the U.S. finding, Iraq is likely to lose
credibility, making any lifting of sanctions unlikely this year.
	   But Saddam stressed that ``this year ... God willing, will be
the year and time of virtual erosion of the blockade off Iraq.''
	   Saddam said his government is now more confident than at any
other time of its ability to fight ``the plight of sanctions,
threats, conspiracies and ill-intentioned schemes coming from
outside.''
	   The government blames its international trade isolation for a
large number of deaths, widespread poverty, malnutrition and
crumbling roads, bridges and other facilities.

Philippine peso rises in heavy trading, stocks end mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso closed higher
against the U.S. dollar in unusually heavy trading Friday, buoyed
by robust foreign-currency inflows and gains in the Japanese yen,
dealers said.
	   Stocks, meanwhile, ended mixed after a choppy session which saw
bargain-hunters picking up oversold second-tier issues, while
foreign fund managers cashed in on early gains by blue chip stocks,
analysts said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.392 pesos for the day, down from 41.662
pesos on Thursday. It fell to a day-low of 41.250 pesos and was
last traded at 41.490 pesos.
	   After several sessions of meager volume, turnover was a
surprisingly high dlrs 203.9 million, up from dlrs 85.7 million on
Thursday. Dollar inflows and corporate buying of the U.S. currency
underpinned the heavy volume.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said the market nevertheless
remains essentially long on dollars, and is likely to continue to
closely track the dollar-yen rate.
	   In stock trading, the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index
fell 9.74 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,787.26, reversing a
2.94-point rise on Thursday.
	   Gainers outnumbered decliners 49 to 39, while 49 issues were
unchanged.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 93.72-point surge overnight
to a record 9,328.19 contributed to the market's early gains,
traders said.
	   Also aiding the market's rise was the favorable performance of
most regional currencies, traders added.
	   Local traders were baffled by subsequent trading. ``It was
strange because we had it pretty good at the start, then choppy
trading set in,'' said Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales
of Abacus Securities Corp.
	   Siao said most of the sellers were foreign brokerage houses.
	   He said the only explanation for the volatile trading was
investors' desire to make money out of even the mildest market
rally. This limits the upside of local shares, he said.
	   ``We see some more sideways movement with a downward bias in the
market,'' said Russell Ong, senior analyst of Anscor-Hagedorn
Securities Inc. Ong said regional and domestic developments will
play a critical part in influencing the market in the next
sessions.
	   Ong said investors are likely to remain preoccupied with
developments in Japan, in particular the election of a new prime
minister next week.
	   Any positive news in Japan, such as concrete reforms to boost
its sagging economy and an acceptable new leader for the nation, is
expected to improve overall stock market sentiment in the region,
traders said.
	   There are also domestic considerations, said Ong, such as the
declining productivity of the manufacturing sector and its effect
on the country's second quarter economic performance.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Princess Elena gave birth Friday to a baby
boy, the Spanish royal couple's first grandchild, the Zarzuela
Palace said.
	   Elena, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia's eldest daughter, gave
birth shortly after 2 a.m. (0000 GMT) in a Madrid clinic where she
was admitted a day earlier.
	   The child is to be named Felipe Juan Froilan de Todos los Santos
and will be baptized this fall, the palace said in a statement.
	   Elena is married to banker Jaime de Marichalar. A teacher and

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ With the scent of incense hanging
in the air, Russia laid to rest its last czar in a somber ceremony
Friday, the 80th anniversary of his execution at the dawn of the
communist era.
	   As a stoic President Boris Yeltsin looked on, the coffins of
Czar Nicholas II, his family and servants, were lowered into one
large crypt beneath the floor of the gilded, 18th-century St. Peter
and Paul Cathedral.
	   ``We must tell the truth _ the (czar's) massacre has become one
of the most shameful pages of our history,'' Yeltsin told the
dignitaries in the cathedral and a nationwide television audience.
``By burying the remains of the innocent victims we want to expiate
the sins of our ancestors.''
	   Dozens of the czar's relatives, diplomats from 50 countries, and
Prince Michael of Kent, a member of the British royal family, which
is related to Russian royalty, stood and held lit candles at the
cathedral on the banks of the Neva River.
	   The czar's family members tossed white sand, representing the
earth, onto the coffins before the crypt was covered. Outside on
the river bank, cannons boomed in a 19-shot salute _ two shy of the
customary 21 because the czar had abdicated.
	   With a dozen bearded priests in gold-and-white robes
officiating, the ceremony was handled with an understated dignity,
in sharp contrast to the months of controversy that preceded the
event.
	   Many leading Russian figures, including the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church, skipped the service due to the disputes it
generated. Yeltsin was planning to stay away as well, but changed
his mind and announced Thursday he would participate.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917, the Romanov dynasty, and the nature of national guilt and
contrition.
	   The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but Russia has not
previously held any major, formal ceremonies dealing with the
abuses committed during communist times. Friday's service brought
the issue to the fore.
	   ``This is not just a funeral, but a national repentance,'' said
Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the world's leading conductors and
cellists, who was exiled during the Soviet era.
	   ``It shows the entire world that Russia is changing and becoming
more humane,'' he said on Russian television.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   But the burial has also raised multiple controversies among
political and religious leaders. The Orthodox Church, as well as
some ordinary Russians, have questioned the authenticity of the
remains despite extensive DNA testing in the United States, Russia
and Britain.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony was
relatively simple. When the coffins were interred, the priest did
not use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques
were on the walls of the chapel.
	   About 1,500 people gathered outside the fortress Friday morning,
though they were not able to see the ceremonies. But a few dozen
were there to protest the burial.
	   ``Factories are closed. People aren't getting their pay _ what's
going on with this funeral?'' said Vyacheslav Marichev, a former
politician.
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for three centuries. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
his wife Alexandra, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, nine of the 11 bodies
were recovered from a desolate forest outside the Ural Mountains
city of Yekaterinburg.
	   The burial ceremonies began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg, when the
bones were taken from the city's police morgue and placed in small,
skeleton-sized coffins.
	   The coffins were flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday, and
thousands of Russians stood in silence along the city's streets and
river embankments Thursday as the czar's cortege passed by.

New twist in old trade row: Japan plans rice exports to U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details; ADDS byline.
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Five years after a bitter trade dispute ended with
Japan reluctantly bowing to American demands to open its rice
market, Japanese farmers plan to start exports to a promising new
market _ the United States.
	   ``Rice consumption in Japan has peaked so we're interested in
finding new outlets to expand sales,'' Daisuke Shindo of Japan's
Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, told The Associated
Press Friday.
	   The cooperative, once a staunch opponent of freer rice trade,
formally approved a plan Thursday to sell one-pound (453 gram) bags
of its rice through San Francisco-based retailer Williams-Sonoma.
	   It marks the first such large-scale rice exporting campaign
orchestrated by a national farm group in Japan. Most of the
Japanese-style rice now sold in the United States for use in dishes
such as sushi is produced in California.
	   The premium grade rice, grown in Japan's Niigata prefecture, or
state, will be marketed in the United States from next month for
dlrs 6.75 a bag.
	   At that price, it will be roughly seven times more expensive
than the average cost of Californian rice, according to Japanese
media reports.
	   Rice prices in Japan are among the highest in the world as a
result of a system designed to subsidize domestic farmers and
protect them from foreign competition.
	   Japan officially announced a partial opening of its rice market
in 1993 under a plan committing it to gradually increase imports up
to a maximum of 8 percent of the market by 2000.
	   The Williams-Sonoma rice will be marketed under the brand name
``Kumai Harvest,'' with Kumai meaning a rice offering to the gods.
Cultivation of the staple grain has mystic overtones in Japan,
where it has long been considered a religious act.
	   Still, consumption of rice has slumped dramatically since the
1960s as wheat-based products such as bread and noodles have become
more popular.

Report: Dalai Lama says ready for dialogue with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual
leader, said his exile government has increased contacts with China
in the expectation of reopening dialogue, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   In an interview at Ladakh, a Buddhist region of India's
Jammu-Kashmir state, the Dalai Lama told a China Times reporter he
has postponed indefinitely a planned visit to Taiwan to avoid
provoking China.
	   ``Our contacts with China have increased in the last few
months,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We also have expectations of
the Chinese government. That's why I announced an indefinite
postponement of my trip to Taiwan.''
	   ``I really hope to open dialogue with the Chinese government,''
he was quoted as saying.
	   He said he had consulted Chinese authorities before making his
first visit to Taiwan early last year. ``I told Beijing clearly
that if China is ready to negotiate with us, I could immediately
cancel my trip to Taiwan. But there was no response from the
Chinese government. So I went.''
	   China has ruled Tibet with military force since a 1950 invasion,
and claims Taiwan as a secessionist province. It viewed the Dalai
Lama's visit to Taiwan last year as a union of Taiwanese and
Tibetan forces trying to break up the motherland.
	   The Dalai Lama was quoted as saying that the Taiwan and Tibet
issues should be separated.
	   During his recent visit to China, U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged Chinese President Jiang Zemin to open dialogue with the
spiritual leader.
	   But Jiang said one of the preconditions for the talks would be
for the Dalai Lama to recognize Taiwan as a province of China.
	   In the interview with the China Times, the Dalai Lama said he
would have to discuss the precondition with his staff before
reacting.
	   He said he believed Clinton's comments on the Tibetan issue in
China ``will have a positive impact in the long run.''
	   Although he does not believe Tibet is a part of China, he said,
``we can work together if both sides will benefit from it.''
	   He said he wanted to go to Taiwan only to preach Buddhism and he
should not be embroiled in political questions.
	   ``Now this issue has become too complicated, and I must handle
it with great care,'' he said.
	   The Dalai Lama fled Tibet following an abortive uprising in
1959.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Bosnian government has
taken over responsibility from the United Nations for removing up
to 1 million land mines believed buried throughout the country
after the 3 1/2-year ethnic war.
	   The Bosnian Cabinet formally assumed that responsibility
Thursday, although it plans to use international organizations and
experts to complete the multi-year project.
	   During a formal ceremony Thursday, U.N. special envoy Elisabeth
Rehn said more than 28,400 land mines were destroyed in Bosnia last
year.
	   ``In no other country similarly polluted by mines is such a
diverse effort being employed to rid the country of the menace, by
incorporating a mixture of military units, commercial companies,
non-governmental organizations and directly employed government
mine clearance teams,'' Rehn said.
	   The U.N. Mine Action Center estimates there could be between
750,000 and 1 million mines buried in about 30,000 minefields
across the country.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A draft treaty creating the world's first permanent
war crimes tribunal but rebuffing key U.S. demands emerged early
Friday from marathon U.N. negotiations.
	   Delegates from 160 countries have until midnight Friday (2200
gmt) to endorse the treaty, and several said the draft had a good
chance of winning approval.
	   The carefully crafted plan makes concessions designed to win
broad support.
	   The list of crimes the court would prosecute, for example, was
expanded to add aggression, which the non-aligned nations had
sought. In a nod to the five nuclear powers on the U.N. Security
Council, it omits any specific mention of nuclear weapons. A
proviso on war crimes addresses French concerns.
	   But many of Washington's demands _ which many democratic
countries and human rights groups said could cripple the court _
were rebuffed.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Women's rights activists protested
outside the headquarters of Indonesia's defense department Friday
and accused the military of not doing enough to prevent mass rape
during recent rioting.
	   About 50 members of a group, calling itself the Coalition of
Indonesian Women for Justice and Democracy, said mobs used rape as
a ``weapon of terror'' during the riots in May.
	   Women's activists claim 168 women and girls, many of them from
Indonesia's Chinese minority, were attacked. Twenty allegedly died,
some in homes set afire. One victim was only 9 years old.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
population. But they dominate industry and commerce and have become
the scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   On Thursday Women's Affairs Minister Tutty Alawiyah said an
independent national committee against violence toward women would
be set up next week.
	   The minister said the group's short term mission would be to
investigate the rapes and report its findings to President B.J.
Habibie.
	   After meeting women's groups on Wednesday, Habibie condemned the
rapes during the riots as ``an inhuman episode in the history of
the nation.''
	   The riots led to the resignation of President Suharto after 32
years of autocratic rule. About 1,200 people died in the violence,
and thousands of homes and buildings were looted and burned.
	   Meanwhile, a collection of human rights and other groups have
filed a class action lawsuit against the government and security
forces for allegedly not controlling May's violence.
	   Lawyer Ester Jusuf of the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute said the
groups want 52.5 trillion rupiahs (dlrs 3.7 billion) in
compensation to be paid to victims of the rioting.
	   They also want the government to apologize on television and in
newspapers for not providing adequate protection for Indonesian
citizens.
	   Ester said the lawsuit was filed against Gen. Wiranto, the
defense minister and armed forces commander, as well as several
police chiefs.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, about 20 people staged
an anti-rape protest for the second consecutive day Friday in front
of the Indonesian embassy.

hostages &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Authorities have failed to trace four
Westerners kidnapped in India's troubled Kashmir state three years
ago, the Indian interior minister said Friday.
	   ``We'll continue to pursue the matter. We have no information. I
think it's a distressing the situation,'' Home Minister Lal Krishna
Advani told reporters after discussing the kidnappings with U.S.
Ambassador Richard Celeste.
	   Celeste had no public comment. Advani said the ambassador told
him American officials had heard nothing since the 1995 kidnappings
of Donald Hutchings of Spokane, Washington, Dirk Hasert of Erfurt,
Germany, Keith Mangan of Middlesborough, England and Paul Wells of
London.
	   Advani has also met recently with the German and British
ambassadors.
	   A little known separatist group called Al Faran claimed
responsibility for the abductions and demanded the release of 21
anti-India guerrilla leaders in exchange for the hostages.
	   Captured militants have since told police the four hostages were
killed in December 1995 or January 1996. But no bodies have been
found.
	   Advani added that in his talks with Celeste he raised India's
charges that neighboring Pakistan is arming and training
separatists in the Indian-held part of Kashmir. India and Pakistan
have fought two wars over the Himalayan territory, which now lies
divided between them. Both countries claim all of Kashmir.
	   Celeste assured Advani that India's accusations against Pakistan
could be discussed during meetings next week between U.S. envoy
Strobe Talbott and his Indian counterpart Jaswant Singh.

Russia to maintain peacekeepers in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament decided Friday to maintain
peacekeeping troops in Bosina for another year, a news report said.
	   The government's upper house, the Federation Council, voted
unanimously to maintain its 1,400-soldier presence in Bosnia as
part of a multinational peacekeeping operation, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   The decision follows a United Nations Security Council agreement
on Monday to keep 34,000 NATO troops in the region because of
mounting tensions in Kosovo.
	   Russian president Boris Yeltsin sought the extension for
``strategic and political reasons,'' said presidential
representative Gen. Nikolai Staskov, according to Interfax.
	   Russian troops have participated in peacekeeping operations in
the Balkans alongside NATO forces as part of an easing of Cold War
tensions with the organization.

Critics attack staging of ``Turandot'' in Forbidden City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Critics are assailing lavish plans to stage the
opera ``Turandot'' in Beijing's Forbidden City, saying the ancient
imperial palace is historically too valuable to be used for shows.
	   Conductor Zubin Mehta and Chinese film director Zhang Yimou will
stage a U.S. dlrs 15 million production of the opera about a
Chinese emperor's daughter in the Forbidden City in September.
	   But on Friday, less that two weeks after producers announced
plans for the show, the state-run newspaper Beijing Youth Daily
said the production has provoked ``sharp voices of opposition.''
	   The opera, Giacomo Puccini's last, will be staged in the
500-year-old courtyard of a temple where Chinese emperors offered
sacrifices to their ancestors.
	   The Beijing Youth Daily warned of fire risks because the
Forbidden City's buildings are built of bricks and wood and its
electrical system is outdated.
	   ``Cultural relics cannot be turned into stage props,'' the
newspaper paraphrased Xie Chengsheng, an expert on relic
preservation, as saying.
	   ``There's no need to stage performances in such an important
place,'' Xie reportedly said.
	   Historian Wang Canchi said ``the consequences would be
disastrous'' if fire broke out in such a valuable historical site.
	   Large cultural shows ``absolutely should not be promoted''
there, said Wang, a researcher at the prestigious Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.
	   The newspaper said other shows held in the temple where the
opera will be performed damaged floors, balustrades and ancient
trees.
	   Tickets for each of the eight 4,200-seat shows Sept. 5-13 range
from dlrs 150 to dlrs 1,200.
	   A hefty premium was paid to Lloyds of London to insure the
buildings, and the Chinese government was paid a substantial but
undisclosed rental for the ancient site.
	   Seating for the production will be distanced from buildings and
wooden flooring and extra electrical cables will be laid, the
Beijing Youth Daily said.
	   Zhang, the Chinese director whose film credits include the
Oscar-nominated ``Raise the Red Lantern,'' has insisted that not
even a ``thumbtack can be hammered in willy-nilly,'' the newspaper
said.

Israel and Palestinians working to arrange top-level meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians tried to arrange
their first top-level contacts in months, with Sunday cited as a
tentative date for talks between Israel's defense minister and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy.
	   The United States has urged the two sides to hold two or three
meetings over the period of a week in an attempt to resolve their
differences over an Israeli troop withdrawal from the occupied West
Bank and procedures for amending the PLO Covenant.
	   The United States has proposed _ as part of a broader peace
initiative _ that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that a smaller forum, the PLO Executive Committee, annul parts of
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposals. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at handing
over 13 percent and insists that the covenant be rescinded by the
Palestine National Council, a larger body whose members are
dispersed all over the Middle East.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Friday the
Palestinians suspected the proposed meetings were another attempt
by Israel to gain time and wriggle out of its commitments.
	   ``We will go because the Americans want us to,'' Abourdeneh told
The Associated Press. ``Netanyahu just wants to waste time, and he
found those (the Americans) who will make this easy for him by
calling for direct talks.''
	   Abourdeneh said the meeting between Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas
and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai would likely take
place Sunday, but that the date had not been finalized.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, also said there was a good
chance a meeting would take place Sunday. The Israelis want the
Palestinians to be represented by Arafat, but it appears likely the
Palestinian leader will send Abbas instead.
	   In a meeting of the so-called Kitchen Cabinet earlier this week,
Mordechai and Netanyahu argued over how the defense minister should
handle the talks. Netanyahu told Mordechai he should listen to what
the Palestinians have to say on the scope of the withdrawal and the
PLO Covenant, then report back to him.
	   Mordechai demanded a free hand in the negotiations.
	   Mordechai and Abbas last met in February, during a two-hour tour
of the Palestinian airport under construction in the Gaza Strip.

Election committee investigates illegal monitor complaints
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS allegation in lede, more details of ties to ruling party
in 3rd graf, opposition statement last 3 grafs; edits thruout
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The body overseeing upcoming
elections said Friday it was investigating reports that thousands
of poll observers may be closely associated with the ruling
political party or have bought their way into the monitoring
process.
	   Nearly 60,000 people have signed up to monitor the July 26
electoral contest, enough for five monitors at each of the 11,000
polling stations, and almost six time the expected number according
to the National Election Committee. The sheer numbers have raised
eyebrows among electoral watchdogs.
	   The Phnom Penh Post newspaper on Friday quoted committee
official Tep Jahnvibol as saying that the Buddhist Association for
the Relief of the Poor appears to have close ties with the ruling
Cambodian People's Party ``in clear violation of the code of
conduct.''
	   ``If there are active ties between an observer and a politician,
it's a big problem,'' he said about reports that the association
appears to be working with Gen. Nhim Vanda of the ruling party to
sign up accredited observers. Much of its paperwork appeared to be
forged, he added.
	   Nhim Vanda's office denied the reports.
	   The committee also has asked the Interior Ministry to help
determine how many people may have illegally purchased national
observer cards, committee spokesman Leng Sochea said at a news
conference.
	   A high number of illegal monitors ``could affect the electoral
process,'' he said. ``Any people who obtain cards illegally will be
punished by law,''
	   Some of the observers may have been tricked into paying fees of
up to dlrs 100 for nonexistent jobs, the newspaper Cambodia Daily
reported earlier this week, but others may be loyal to Cambodian
leader Hun Sen's ruling party and could risk the neutrality of the
monitoring process.
	   The election committee said Friday it is also investigating
reports that Hun Sen's party has been organizing mock elections
across the northwestern province of Battambang to make sure party
supporters vote ``properly'' on election day.
	   The election committee and electoral laws prohibit the use of
ballots or sample ballots to try to influence the way people vote.
	   Cambodia's elections are scheduled to take place one year after
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who won a U.N.-sponsored election in
1993, was ousted by the powerful Hun Sen in a bloody coup d'etat.
	   Critics say that the electoral process has been skewed in his
favor and that Hun Sen's party has engaged in intimidation, threats
and killings of opposition members in the provinces.
	   Ranariddh returned from exile to lead his FUNCINPEC party in the
campaign.
	   The United Nations is overseeing a group of 500 international
observers.
	   Meanwhile, an umbrella group of opposition parties _ including
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party _ issued a complaint
to the Joint International Observing Group Friday listing remaining
concerns about the electoral process.
	   They listed inequitable access to the media and threats,
assaults, and killings of activists as among the complaints that
have been ignored by the election committee.
	   ``Serious flaws in the plans for polling day threaten to destroy
what little credibility remains in this electoral process,'' they
wrote, hinting that the problems appear to stem from the fact that
the committee is dominated by supporters of Hun Sen's party.

Russian electricity debtors cut from power supply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Power companies have cut energy supplies to
hundreds of debtors in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, local
energy officials said Friday.
	   In the last month, energy suppliers in the region have gradually
cut power from more than 750 companies with large electricity
debts, including the agricultural giant Rostselmash, said the chief
engineer of local energy supplier Rostovenergo, Georgi Fedochenko.
	   The move appears to be one of the first responses to a
government decision last month to get tough with companies not
paying federal taxes. Many of the companies say they have been
unable to pay taxes because consumers don't pay their bills.
	   Previously, power companies have been reluctant to cut off
consumers who didn't pay their bills.
	   Another 2,000 enterprises in the region could lose power soon if
they don't pay their bills, Rostovenergo General Director Fedor
Kushnarev told the ITAR-Tass news agency.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ East Timorese should be involved in
any U.N.-mediated talks between Portugal and Indonesia on their
troubled territory's fate, a jailed rebel leader said Friday.
	   Xanana Gusmao, the leader of East Timor's separatist guerrilla
movement, spoke after a United Nations mediator visited him in the
Jakarta jail where he is serving a 20-year sentence.
	   ``I think East Timorese people have to take part in discussions
about their own fate,'' said Gusmao, who urged Indonesia and
Portugal, East Timor's formal colonial master, to mend severed
diplomatic relations to help bring peace.
	   The rebel talked with the U.N. special envoy on East Timor,
Jamsheed Marker, for more than an hour inside Cipinang jail. He
later was visited by East Timor's Nobel peace laureate, Bishop
Carlos Belo.
	   Arrested in 1992, Gusmao continues to command influence over
groups which oppose Indonesian control of East Timor.
	   Diplomatic relations with Portugal have been severed since
Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following
year as its 27th province.
	   In a sign of progress in negotiations, Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said Friday he would meet his Portuguese
counterpart, Jaime Gama, in August under the auspices of the United
Nations. He did not say where the meeting would be held.
	   East Timor, which has endured a guerrilla war and human rights
abuses, marked 22 years of integration with Indonesia on Friday.
However, the United Nations, Portugal and many other governments do
not recognize Indonesia's claim over the half-island territory.
	   Portugal has proposed that it and Indonesia establish minimal
diplomatic posts known as ``interests sections'' in each other's
capitals.
	   Indonesia has so far rejected the plan because Portugal insists
that Gusmao be freed first.
	   ``I very much want interests sections opened. Before Portugal
said this could only happen if I were released,'' Gusmao told
reporters after meeting Marker. ``But I'll support it now even if I
am not free because I know that it is very important for the
solving of the East Timor problem.''
	   Marker, who is on a weeklong visit to Indonesia as part of
ongoing negotiations to find a settlement, said he and Gusmao
canvassed a wide range of issues.
	   ``It has been a very useful meeting and I go back very much
encouraged by my discussions with Xanana,'' Marker said.
	   ``I am, as always, impressed by his capabilities, by his
leadership and I look forward to continuing this process. I am sure
his contribution will be a major one toward finding a solution of
the problem of East Timor.''
	   Recently, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie offered to release
Gusmao and grant special status to East Timor in return for
international recognition of it as an integral part of Indonesia.

With Tiger in front, Americans dominate first round at Birkdale

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ American weather. American golfers.
	   For one day, at least, they went together like tea and crumpets
at the British Open.
	   With Tiger Woods and John Huston leading the way, Americans
dominated the leaderboard in an opening round played under
conditions more like a summer day in San Diego than the normal
blustery conditions on the coast of the Irish Sea.
	   Players who make their living on the friendly courses of the
U.S. PGA Tour were right at home on the smooth fairways and soft
greens of Royal Birkdale, and the scores showed it. Eight tour
regulars were among the top 10 leaders, and the top five players
all live in the United States.
	   Woods and Huston shot 65s, while Fred Couples, Loren Roberts and
Nick Price were only a stroke behind. In all, 27 golfers broke par
and another 14 matched it on a course that only days earlier was
generating predictions of U.S. Open-type scores.
	   Those predictions came when the wind was blowing, however, and
only a breeze rippled through the bushes and tall meadow rye
Thursday as Woods took his first lead in a major since winning the
1997 Masters.
	   The sun even came out by midmorning, about the same time that
Woods was making his run.
	   ``As the sun broke through, it was almost perfect,'' Woods said.
``We might even get some people with heat stroke out here.''
	   Woods, using a putter given to him by buddy Mark O'Meara, broke
out of the putting slump that has bedeviled him in the majors since
his Masters win. He made four birdie putts on the front nine, and
then ran in a curling 35-footer (10.67-meter shot) on the 13th
hole.
	   Woods would have had the lead all to himself but couldn't get
up-and-down from just off the 18th green, missing a 5-footer
(1.52-meter shot) for a bogey 5.
	   ``Hopefully, if he continues to putt well I'll get a commission
on some of his rewards,'' said O'Meara, the Masters champion who
opened with a 72.
	   Huston didn't have any new clubs, but he had something even
better _ his magnets.
	   Since January, he has slept on a magnet-laced mattress cover to
try to alleviate bursitis and tendinitis, which forced him into a
deep slump last year and made it painful to play. It seems to be
working.
	   Huston was going along at 2 under when he ran in a 40-foot
(12.19-meter) eagle putt on 17 and followed it with a spectacular
7-iron out of the rough to within three feet (0.91 meters) on 18
for a final birdie.
	   ``Who knows what the weather will be like tomorrow, so I'll just
take it like it comes,'' Huston said.
	   The weather, in fact, was supposed to get worse.
	   Forecasters predicted afternoon winds of up to 25 mph (40
kilometers) and periods of rain, weather more suited to the typical
seaside Open.
	   That might be just fine with the European players, who are more
used to playing in such conditions than the Americans. Instead of
trying to simply survive, they were forced to try and shoot low
scores to keep up.
	   ``With there not being so much wind today, you are not used to
that,'' said Jesper Parnevik, who shot a 68 and was three strokes
back. ``The tough thing was to change all your goals. From thinking
about a 71, you had to try and shoot a low score.''
	   The top five players and eight of the top 10 were all either
Americans or live in the United States, while Britain's top golfers
could not break par. Colin Montgomerie continued his streak of
over-par first rounds in the Open with a 73, while rising English
star Lee Westwood shot 71.
	   It was the latest of Open woes for Montgomerie, the No. 5 player
in the world who has yet to break par in the first round of an Open
and has missed cuts in four of the last six.
	   ``Hopefully, I can try and make the cut. That's all I'm
interested in right now,'' Montgomerie said.
	   Westwood, the 25-year-old who is England's hottest player, had
other ideas.
	   ``As soon as the putts start going in I think I will be making a
move in the right direction,'' he said.
	   The putts were dropping for Price, the 1994 Open winner who
contended on the last day of the U.S. Open but has also had
problems on the green.
	   Price played in the same group as Woods, and they seemed to feed
off each other and the large galleries that followed their every
shot.
	   ``When I putt well, I've got a good chance to win,'' Price said.
``For me, my ball striking has always been a standard. I guess it
is just a question of how sharp my short game is.''

Study: Asian CEOs predict recovery to take 3 more years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Executives across Asia are predicting that
economies in the region will need three years to recover from the
current crisis, a study released Friday said.
	   The survey by the global executive search firm Spencer Stuart
disclosed growing pessimism across the continent on the time
required to ride out the crisis.
	   ``In November last year, research pegged the perception of time
to recovery at about one year plus,'' said Martin Tang, managing
director for Southeast Asia of Spencer Stuart.
	   ``By January, a majority of respondents said two years or more.
And the results of our poll conducted in mid-May show that Asian
executives are even more cautious and pessimistic, expecting the
time to recovery to be more like three years,'' Tang said.
	   According to the survey, the countries hardest hit by the crisis
are in northern and Southeast Asia. Taiwan and China were the most
optimistic, while South Korea seemed to be the hardest hit in all
sectors.
	   On the positive side, Tang said, the poll showed ``that the
region is not focusing entirely on doom and gloom. Smart companies
with long-term investment views are taking advantage of this
uncertain period to strengthen their business assets and human
resources pools.''
	   The survey included more than 400 executive of companies in 11
countries in the region.

Cyprus Airways pilots call off planned strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Cyprus Airways pilots union has
called off its planned three-day strike that was to start next
Thursday.
	   The union said Friday it has agreed to hold more talks with the
airline management in the presence of a government minister to
discuss outstanding differences, mainly on pay.
	   The cancellation followed intense criticism of the pilots union
by the business and tourism sector associations. They complained
the the strike in the middle of the high tourist season would have
a disastrous effect on the island's economy, which relies heavily
on tourism.

Chirac says talks with Assad ``very positive''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ There will never be peace in the Middle East
without active Syrian involvement _ and France wants to be
involved, too, President Jacques Chirac said Friday after talks
with Hafez Assad.
	   ``Our concern is peace,'' Chirac said after meeting the Syrian
president for a second time, terming the talks ``very positive.''
Assad is on an extremely rare visit to the West.
	   ``We know very well that there won't be peace in the region
without the active participation of Syria,'' Chirac said.
``Consequently, we want to combine our efforts, France and Syria,
to attain our objective.''
	   Chirac was referring to the objective of Mideast peace, but it's
also clear that France wants to play a role in breaking the impasse
in the region _ and to counter-balance the heavy weight of the
United States.
	   It's been 22 years since Assad visited France, and he's been to
the West only a couple of times in the past decade. So it must have
felt good to get the red-carpet treatment at Chirac's elegant
Elysee Palace.
	   Leaving the palace Thursday for a quick rest after the first
round of presidential talks, Assad was feted by a band of the
Republican Guard, in their golden helmets with long red plumes. The
minute he left, women in flowing gowns began arriving for a state
dinner in his honor.
	   The first round of talks went on for two hours and 40 minutes _
considerably longer than expected.
	   While reiterating his support for American mediation, Chirac
said it was necessary to consider what to do ``in case the current
efforts halt,'' said his spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna.
	   An international conference could end the impasse, Chirac said,
again raising a French-Egyptian proposal made in May.
	   Assad apparently gave a lukewarm response to the proposal.
Colonna said only that the Syrian ``did not refuse the idea.''
	   In his own toast, Assad blamed Israel for ``reducing to zero''
the peace process.
	   For Assad, the trip could be a chance to become more of a global
player. He, too, seeks an alternative to U.S. mediation in the
Mideast _ though in his toast, he said he saw no ``opposition''
between the European and U.S. efforts.
	   The United States has accused Syria of sponsoring international
terrorism, a charge that Damascus denies.
	   France has special leverage with Syria, partly because the Arab
nation was once a French-mandated territory, from 1920-1946.
	   Among Arab nations, there is a growing interest in greater
European diplomacy. French intervention in the region has
occasionally advanced the process where American policy failed.
	   During Israel's offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in
southern Lebanon in 1996, France engineered a truce that still
stands. And last month, France guaranteed an exchange of prisoners
and soldiers' remains between Lebanon and Israel.
	   There was one problematic issue that Chirac had to bring up with
Assad _ the case of accused Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner, long
said to be hiding in Syria.
	   Colonna said Chirac raised the issue, but failed to get a
``precise response.''
	   Brunner is blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from Germany,
Austria, France and Greece. Holocaust victims have protested
Assad's silence on the matter.
	   ``Shame to Assad Who Protects the Nazi Criminal Brunner'' read
one banner at a peaceful protest at the Syrian Embassy Thursday.

Government considers strategy to protect blood supplies from CJD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government is considering new safety measures
to reduce the risk of spreading the human form of ``mad cow
disease'' through blood transfusions, a newspaper said Friday.
	   The Times reported that the Spongiform Encaphalopathy Advisory
Committee, a government advisory group, has concluded after
studying a series of reports that it is currently impossible to
guarantee blood transfusions are safe.
	   A spokesman for the Department of Health would confirm only that
the government is considering a report from its advisers and would
make an announcement in the next few weeks.
	   The Times said three of the 25 known British victims of the
brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were blood donors, although
it is not known if they were carrying the disease when they gave
blood. All three have since died.
	   The newspaper said the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee cited one report showing that a blood purification system
known as leukodepletion _ which removes white cells _ could not be
guaranteed to clear the CJD infection from blood, as had been
hoped. Experts believe the white blood cells carry the disease.
	   The Times said the report, based on studies in the United
States, found that leukodepletion was effective in clearing CJD,
but not perfect.
	   Geoffrey Almond, a member of the advisory committee, said Friday
that there is a ``theoretical risk of blood from patients who might
be incubating'' the disease.
	   ``But that doesn't mean that the risk is substantial. It may be
tiny,'' he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio, adding that the
risk must be weighed against the risk of patients dying if they did
not get blood transfusions.
	   The advisory group has not recommended a ban on the transfusion
of British blood, Almond said.
	   An intermediate solution could be to remove the white cells from
the blood in cases where the infection is mild, he said.
	   ``It may well be that leukodepletion will in fact become routine
in this country, but the government will decide that in its own
time,'' he said.
	   Dr. Stephen Dealler, a microbiologist and expert on BSE, told
the BBC that scientists do not know exactly how many people could
be infected.
	   ``But the numbers could be quite high and this is where the
worry comes in about perhaps one in every 250 blood donors being
infected,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A pair of senior politicians _ one a favorite of
the old guard, the other championed by younger lawmakers _
announced their candidacies Friday to replace outgoing Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and unveiled their strategies to revive
Japan's economy.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, a 61-year-old party veteran seen
as the favorite of ruling Liberal Democratic Party elders, promised
more than 6 trillion yen (dlrs 43.2 billion) in permanent tax cuts.
	   The tax cuts will include slashing the top income tax rate to 50
percent from 65 percent to boost the economy.
	   In his policy speech seeking support for his candidacy, Obuchi
also said he would reduce the corporate tax to 40 percent from 46
percent and ease the tax burden on middle-income earners.
	   ``We will use every available means to revive the economy,''
Obuchi told reporters. ``We must take the explosion of voter anger
seriously.''
	   Obuchi's leading rival, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama, warned there was no quick fix for Japan's recession and
that some painful measures were necessary to put the economy back
on track.
	   ``Some bloodletting will be inevitable,'' Kajiyama told a news
conference minutes after Obuchi spoke.
	   Kajiyama vowed to get tough on banks saddled with bad debt,
requiring them to set aside provisions for problem loans and make
bank managements take full responsibility for their difficulties.
	   Although he did not offer specifics, Kajiyama echoed Obuchi's
view that corporate tax cuts and a permanent reduction in income
taxes were needed to revive the economy.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party president, who will be chosen July
24 in balloting by party lawmakers, is virtually sure to become
prime minister because the party controls the more powerful lower
house of Parliament.
	   Prime Minister Hashimoto was forced to resign Monday to take
responsibility for his party's disastrous performance in weekend
elections for Parliament's upper house.
	   While Obuchi is seen as the frontrunner in the race, a growing
number of reformist lawmakers are throwing their support behind the
blunt, outspoken Kajiyama.
	   Kajiyama has often made controversial, offensive remarks. In
1990, he apologized after saying that prostitutes in Japan and
blacks in the United States both ``ruin the atmosphere of the
neighborhoods they move into.'' The remarks provoked an uproar in
the United States.
	   But many junior party members are protesting what they call
Obuchi's lack of ideas, saying the country needs strong leadership
to revive the stagnant economy.
	   They also oppose the way Obuchi has gone about securing party
support.
	   Before announcing his bid, Obuchi had spent days building up
support in the traditional manner of holding closed door meetings
with party power brokers.
	   The younger lawmakers say that secret deals and backroom
politicking were exactly what voters were rejecting in the polls
last Sunday.
	   Many expressed support for Kajiyama, 72, a longtime critic of
Hashimoto's economic policies and a champion of big tax cuts.
	   ``We must think about how to save Japan from this critical
situation,'' Kajiyama told supporters at a meeting Friday morning
to announce his bid.
	   A third candidate, 56-year-old Health and Welfare Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, has also decided to throw his hat into the ring,
Kyodo News reported.
	   Koizumi is widely considered a rising star in the Liberal
Democratic Party, but he is also seen as an outsider for his
outspoken advocacy of privatizing the postal ministry.
	   The upper house elections were widely seen as a vote against the
way the government has managed Japan's economy, which is in the
midst of its worst recession since World War II.
	   Former Deputy Prime Minister Yohei Kono, another possible
contender, also reportedly said he would support Kajiyama's
candidacy.
	   While the party had planned to choose its leader by July 21, the
vote was postponed by three days to give candidates time to explain
their views.

Polish lawmakers uphold ban on beer ads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Parliament's upper chamber has upheld
Poland's ban on beer advertisements, continuing a law intended to
discourage drinking in a country with one of Europe's highest
alcohol consumption rates.
	   Lawmakers rejected a bill calling for relaxed regulations on
alcohol ads. The vote late Thursday night was 80-5, with seven
abstentions, in favor of keeping the ban for five more years.
	   Debate over the beer ads had divided Poland's government
coalition, led by the Solidarity bloc with the centrist Freedom
Union as the junior partner.
	   Solidarity supported the ban, saying that beer ads encourage
young people to drink more. Studies show 60 percent of customers in
pubs are below 19 years of age.
	   But the Freedom Union, with opposition support, had pushed the
bill to relax the laws through parliament's lower chamber on July
2, arguing that the ban is hard to enforce.
	   Some breweries, for example, dodge the law by using bottles of
non-alcoholic beer in their ads. The non-alcoholic labels are
almost identical to the regular brews, and many of the
non-alcoholic brands are not available in stores.
	   This practice is likely to continue: Senators also rejected a
motion calling for extending the ban on alcohol-free beers.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A strong earthquake jolted Taiwan on
Friday, causing rock slides on a southern mountain that killed at
least three people and injured 10.
	   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.2, was felt
throughout Taiwan and on the coast of mainland China. It was
centered about 14 kilometers (8.5 miles) west of Alishan, known
also as Mount Ali, located 300 kilometers (180 miles) south of
Taipei.
	   A hotel in the town of Rweili on the scenic mountain suffered
serious cracks, injuring four of its staffers, said Mo Hwei-tsu,
head of the Taiwan Rescue Center. He said previous reports that the
hotel collapsed, trapping 10 people inside, were mistaken.
	   A driver was killed on a mountain road by a rockslide, and
another person was killed by a falling rock. A landslide buried the
exit of a tunnel, killing one person, he said.
	   State radio said a total of four people were killed, including a
person killed by another landslide.
	   Policeman Tseng Ta-lin said mountain roads were blocked and
bridges collapsed, and that helicopters had ferried about 10
injured people to hospitals. Rescuers were rushing to the mountain
areas where scores of tourists reported were trapped, he said.
	   TVBS television network quoted policeman Tsai Cheng-heng in
Rweili as saying police were checking a report that about 10 other
people were trapped in a teahouse near the hotel.
	   State radio said parts of a railroad also caved in and several
cars were damaged by falling power poles.
	   The quake was felt throughout Taiwan, but there were no
immediate reports of other damage. Reports said it was centered
only 500 meters (1,650 feet) underground, making the local impact
very strong.
	   On the Chinese mainland, 130 kilometers (78 miles) across the
Taiwan Strait, an official at the Fujian Provincial Seismological
Bureau said the quake ``was felt quite strongly along the
seaboard.'' The official, who refused to give his name, said damage
was unlikely.
	   Officials said about 120 minor aftershocks were registered.
Earthquakes are frequent in Taiwan, but most of them are centered
deep under the sea and cause little damage.
	   Alishan, 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) high, is known for its
diverse terrain and variety of animal and plant life.
	   Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the total energy released
by an earthquake, as indicated by ground motion recorded on
seismographs. An increase of one digit in the scale represents a
tenfold increase in the strength of the quake.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area.
	   The Chinese official Xinhua News Agency said the quake was also
felt in coastal areas in China's eastern Zhejiang province.
	   Officials said this was the worst earthquake that hit southern
Taiwan since 1964 when a quake killed 106 people, injured 650 and
buried 10,500 homes.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police on Friday arrested four
more people in connection with the deaths of three young brothers
in a sectarian firebombing attack. Three other suspects remain in
custody.
	   In her first public interview, aired Friday morning, the boys'
mother said she feels guilty about the deaths.
	   ``I do. I wish I hadn't stayed there,'' Chrissie Quinn, 29, said
in an interview with the news channel GMTV.
	   News reports said the latest arrests were made in the boys' home
town of Ballymoney, 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast, but
police refused to confirm that.
	   Authorities say they believe the Quinn household _ located in a
staunchly Protestant housing complex _ was targeted because the
boys' Catholic mother lived there with her Protestant boyfriend.
	   Ms. Quinn noted that the family had fled to England once after
being harassed for being Catholic, but that the boys wanted to be
with their friends and she felt they would be safe, since she was
raising them as Protestants.
	   She said she had no intention, however, of leaving Northern
Ireland. She nodded when asked if that was to allow her to be near
the gravesite of the three boys.
	   Ms. Quinn described the brothers _ Richard, 11, Mark, 10, and
Jason, 9 _ as mischievous boys who were ``into everything.''
	   ``Richard was a devil, but he had a big heart,'' she said.
``Jason was a good wean (wee one), Mark was a good wean. They were
just boys. They were into everything, but everybody liked them.''
	   She recalled that her last memory of her sons was the sound of
their shouts when she awoke to find the family home ablaze.
	   ``I woke up to smoke. The kids were in their bedroom. I heard
them and I went to them and they weren't there,'' she said. ``I
shall always remember that.''
	   Her only surviving child, 12-year-old Lee, sat next to her
during the interview, which took place at the house of Ms. Quinn's
mother in Rasharkin. Lee was sleeping over at his grandmother's the
night of the firebombing.
	   Asked if she believed their deaths would change anything in
Northern Ireland, she said in an almost inaudible voice: ``No.''
	   Tensions spilling over from a Protestant march blocked since
July 5 near Portadown, 60 miles (100 kms) southwest of Ballymoney,
were blamed for the Sunday morning firebombing of the Quinn house.
	   Ms. Quinn agreed, saying of the standoff, ``It has everything to
do with it.'' Asked if she blamed members of the Protestant Orange
Order, she nodded.
	   Police detained two people on Thursday in connection with the
attack and one on Monday. Another man arrested on Monday was
released a day later without charge.
	   On Thursday, the man supervising the handover of terrorist
weapons as part of Northern Ireland's peace agreement said he
believed paramilitary groups would meet the May 2000
decommissioning target date listed in the accord.
	   ``Our perspective is that it is going to happen and, we feel,
sooner rather than later,'' Canada Gen. Jean de Chastelain told BBC
Radio Ulster.
	   De Chastelain said he would like to see some weapons handed over
before the new Belfast Assembly reconvenes Sept. 14.

Prince cites U.S. backing, tells voters not to fear conflict

<TEXT>
	   PREY VENG, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh told Cambodian voters Friday that the United States and
other countries would reject any bid by his arch-rival, Hun Sen, to
rob him of victory in elections July 26.
	   Ranariddh hoped to assure voters jittery of post-election
violence that casting a ballot for his royalist FUNCINPEC party
would not lead to a new round of armed conflict in the country's
turbulent politics.
	   The prince finished atop U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 but
was forced to accept a co-premiership when Hun Sen threatened civil
war. The power-sharing arrangement ended in pitched street battles
last year when Hun Sen seized power in a bloody takeover.
	   ``If you want to vote for FUNCINPEC and people scare you that
there will be a war if we win, don't worry,'' Ranariddh said. ``The
Friends of Cambodia, especially the United States, will not
tolerate those who lose the elections refusing to transfer power.''
	   The Friends of Cambodia are a loose group including the United
States, Australia, France, Japan and several other countries who
put pressure on Hun Sen after last year's coup to allow the prince
to return from exile and contest a new election.
	   Ranariddh did not claim Washington would send in troops to roll
back a seizure of power. The United Nations had deployed 20,000
peacekeepers in Cambodia in 1993, but did not use them to enforce
the election result.
	   The prince was speaking to about 5,000 people, many of them
trucked in from the capital, Phnom Penh, under a scorching tropical
sun at this southeastern town. Men and women shielded their heads
from the heat with traditional checkered scarves. Some carried
pictures of his father, King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   The opposition has steadily accused Hun Sen of using violence
and intimidation against voters to ensure victory, plus stacking
the electoral machinery with his supporters. The prince
acknowledged to reporters, however, that electoral violence was
lower than in 1993.
	   In Phnom Penh, the National Election Committee overseeing the
polls said it was investigating reports that thousands of national
poll observers may be closely associated with Hun Sen's party or
have bought their way into the monitoring process.
	   To the southwest in Takeo province, Hun Sen made a rare campaign
appearances, arriving by helicopter to meet about 5,000 people at
an irrigation project. He dug a ditch with a hoe and appeared at
ease talking with reporters.
	   Hun Sen also said that election violence was down and dismissed
rumors that a new round of fighting could erupt. Since last year,
the military and police are under his near-total control.
	   ``I ask who will fight who. All guns are collected and stored in
the warehouse already,'' Hun Sen said. ``Those who spread the
rumors are silly, but sillier are those who believe them, and the
silliest of those are journalists.''
	   Hun Sen noted that security in the elections has been better
than in many other Asian countries.
	   Both Hun Sen and Ranariddh said that in the event of an
inconclusive election result, they would be willing to form a
coalition with the third major candidate, prominent dissident Sam
Rainsy, a one-time finance minister and FUNCINPEC member.
	   The prince said he would be willing to enter a partnership with
Hun Sen's formerly communist Cambodian People's Party, if a new
leader replaces Hun Sen.
	   Hun Sen said his top priority if victorious would be to revive
the economy. Cambodia is one of the world's poorest countries, and
his coup resulted in aid cuts and lost investor confidence at the
same time that richer Southeast Asian countries suffered economic
meltdowns.

Policeman shot in bar attack dies in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A police officer who was severely wounded
in a grisly bar attack in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odessa
has died of his wounds, bringing the number of victims to six, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Four people were killed and 15 others were wounded in the
submachine-gun and grenade attack May 1. Two of the wounded later
died, including police Sgt. Serhiy Dovzhenko, 33, who was paralyzed
following the shooting, Kievskiye Vedomosti said.
	   Police arrested several suspects but the trial has not yet
started. The attack was blamed on a bar scuffle or described as a
gangland-style settling of accounts.
	   Meanwhile, police were still searching for an Odessa man who
shot and killed three people in a similar bar attack in the city
late last month. The shooting was reportedly provoked by an
argument with bar owners. Kievskiye Vedomosti identified him as
Vyacheslav Yarlykov.

	   No financial details were announced.
	   His current contract, granting him more than 40 billion lire

	   ``Ferrari informs that its driver Michael Schumacher will

	   Schumacher, who won his third consecutive Grand Prix this season
at Silverstone last Sunday, said this week that he felt confident
he would clinch the 1998 world drivers title as his Ferrari ``is
very competitive.''
	   His McLaren-Mercedes rival Mika Hakkinen leads Schumacher by
only two points going into the next race, in Austria on July 26.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ As many as 5,426 people have contracted
syphilis in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region in the first half of
1998, regional health authorities reported Friday.
	   The report noted that the number included 261 youngsters under
18 years of age, most of them schoolchildren. The number of
syphilis cases among them has grown by 22 percent from the same
period last year, said the report, cited by the Interfax news
agency.

Russia's GDP falls in first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's gross domestic product dropped by .5
percent in the first half of 1998 from the same time last year, a
news agency reported Friday.
	   The drop is hard evidence of Russia's deep financial crisis. The
stock market has dropped by half so far this year, and the Central
Bank has been fighting off a ruble devaluation.
	   Russians' real disposable income also plunged for the same
period, by nine percent. Though wages rose by 12 percent, inflation
shaved real wage growth to three percent.
	   Still, industrial output in the first half of 1998 rose by .1
percent against the same period last year. Agricultural output also
grew, by .6 percent.
	   Until 1997, Russia's economy contracted for a decade, going into
a freefall after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union. In 1996,
both GDP and industrial production fell 5 percent.
	   But the country saw small gains last year, and expected more in
1998 until a financial crisis led economists to predict that the
economy would shrink once again.

China's economic growth falls short for first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with comments from economists
 &UR; By CHRIS BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's economic growth slowed during the first
half of the year, but in a region of shattered financial systems,
its economy shows remarkable health, economists said Friday.
	   Buffeted by weakened trading partners and their devalued
currencies, China's economy grew by a lower than targeted 7 percent
in the first six months of 1998, the State Statistical Bureau
reported Friday.
	   Lower growth is expected to put pressure on Premier Zhu Rongji
and his four-month-old Cabinet to slow down a painful restructuring
of state industries that is cutting millions of workers from state
payrolls.
	   Despite the dim economic report and the higher political
pressures, China looks robust compared to the anemic and shrinking
economies of many Asian countries, economists said.
	   ``China's still in good shape,'' said Nikko Securities economist
Ken Chan. He added that growth appeared to bottom out in the first
half and should accelerate. That could put the government nearer
its 8 percent target.
	   Asia's financial crisis ``exerted more pressure'' on the Chinese
economy, which has also been hit by weak domestic demand and
widespread summer flooding, bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said at a news
conference.
	   The slide to 7 percent growth for the first six months of 1998 _
compared with 8.8 percent last year _ was due in part to falling
trade in the region.
	   Exports, long a growth engine, rose 7.6 percent during the first
half of the year, sharply down from the 21-percent clip for all of
1997.
	   Exports to Southeast Asia, South Korea and Japan all fell an
average of 16 percent in the first half, though higher trade with
Europe, the United States, Russia and Africa offset some of the
damage.
	   Japan in the past took 20 percent of China's total exports.
Japanese investment and bank loans are also drying up.
	   Pledged foreign investment grew 5.5 percent in the first half,
but foreign money actually invested dipped 1.3 percent in the first
half.
	   Prices fell, too. The retail price index, China's benchmark
inflation measure, declined 2.1 percent in the first half from a
year ago, the bureau said.
	   The immediate effect of lowered growth will be felt in shrinking
disposable incomes, hurting makers and sellers of consumer goods,
said Denis Simon, a China specialist with Andersen Consulting.
	   Premier Zhu's government is betting that spending on
infrastructure projects can stimulate the economy to meet the
year's 8-percent target _ without backing down on reforms.
	   But failure to meet the target could imperil Zhu's plans to turn
the state sector around within three years and increase
bureaucratic resistance toward other much needed economic reforms _
such as encouraging private home ownership.
	   The government regards the growth target as critical in creating
jobs for millions of workers being laid off from loss-making state
industries.
	   ``The economic environment of China has become more
challenging,'' said Paul A. Coughlin, a director at Standard and
Poor's which rates banks' credit worthiness.

International team heading for Kosovo; US denounces police raid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with OSCE in Kosovo; Rugova pledges to continue
building institutions. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying Serb authorities, Kosovo's
leading Albanian politician pledged Friday to continue building
government institutions in the rebellious province despite a police
crackdown on his unauthorized parliament.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said a policeman was shot and killed
late Thursday in the town of Kosovska Mitrovica about 20 kilometers
(12 miles) northwest of here by suspected Albanian extremists who
opened fire from a speeding car. Police set up roadblocks in the
area to try to find the assailants.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's self-styled president, made his
declaration as an international fact-finding team met with Serb
officials here in the latest diplomatic bid to end the fighting and
pave the way for peace talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   The team from the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe is to meet later with Rugova, the ethnic
Albanian whom the Americans and Europeans want to lead a delegation
in talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But Yugoslavia's bloody, five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash not
only against the government but also against Rugova, whose
commitment to non-violence has failed either to end the bloodshed
or win self-rule.
	   As a result, converts have flocked to the extremist Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   To try to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected last March but
never authorized by the Yugoslavian government in Belgrade.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   There were no arrests, but police said the prosecutor could file
charges because of the ``attempt to constitute'' the illegal
parliament. Police waited until the end of the 20-minute session to
enter the building, suggesting Serb authorities were not seriously
attempting to muzzle Rugova but rather send a warning.
	   Nevertheless, Rugova told reporters Friday that ``after
convening parliament, we will continue to build other bodies of
government in Kosovo'' and invite ethnic Serbs in the province to
take part.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
the Serb raid was part of a ``repressive'' strategy that is driving
ethnic Albanians into the extremists' camp.
	   In Belgrade, a senior aide to Milosevic said the government was
willing to negotiate autonomy, which it withdrew from Kosovo in
1989. But the aide, Gorica Gajevic, said the government would never
agree to an independent Kosovo established ``through terrorism and
banditry.''
	   Meanwhile, both Serb and Albanian sources reported scattered
clashes in the province, which is part of Serbia.
	   On Thursday, the government-allied Serb Media Center said a
``large group'' of Albanians attacked a police patrol near Prizren,
about 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Pristina and withdrew
after a two-hour gunbattle. There was no report of casualties in
the fighting.
	   In reporting on the clash, the Kosovo Information Center, close
to Rugova's party, said Serbian police set fire to three Albanian
homes near the town and heavy gunfire could be heard in the area.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said Albanian fighters attacked a lead
and zinc mine 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina but
were driven off. Rebels control most of that area except for the
mine itself.

Most Asian stock markets close higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended the week higher
Friday, with the key index in Bangkok surging 4.7 percent on the
back of a record rally overnight on Wall Street.
	   Bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where share
prices fell after four straight days of advances.
	   Thai shares rose sharply because the rally on Wall Street
triggered buying by foreign investors, dealers said. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average on Thursday rose 93.72 points to 9,328.19,
closing above 9,300 for the first time.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index surged 13.27 points to
close at 295.28.
	   Malaysian share prices also closed sharply higher on an influx
of overseas orders.
	   Dealers said foreign investors were buying blue-chip stocks as
the region's currencies stabilize amid hopes for more decisive
political leadership in Japan.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index rose
15.32 points, or 3.6 percent, to 445.31.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 161.14 points, or 0.97 percent, to close at 16,570.78. On
Thursday, the Nikkei average had risen 117.78 points, or 0.71
percent.
	   Share prices fell as investors moved to lock in recent gains
ahead of a three-day holiday weekend, traders said.
	   The Nikkei index had rallied 641.86 points, or 4.0 percent, over
the past four trading sessions.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 138.95 yen in
late afternoon trading, down 0.77 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo
and also below its rate of 139.94 overnight in New York.
	   The yen received a boost following former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama's decision early Friday to throw his hat
in the ring as a contender to succeed Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
	   Hashimoto announced his resignation on Monday after his party
suffered a humiliating defeat in elections for the upper house of
Parliament.
	   The market was closed in South Korea for a holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed sharply higher, boosted by the
International Monetary Fund's approval of a U.S. dlrs 1.3 billion
loan to Indonesia. The Composite Index rose 12.46 points, or 2.6
percent, to 486.23.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed higher. The Straits Times Industrials
Index surged 2 percent, or 21.13 points, to close at 1,095.10.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed sharply higher in reaction to an
overnight record rally on Wall Street. The market's key Weighted
Stock Price Index rose 108.02 points, or 1.36 percent, to 8,032.86.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, boosted by
declining short-term interest rates and record setting rallies on
Wall Street. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 40.63, or 1.9 percent,
to 2,172.35, its highest close since June 2.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed generally higher, with the key
index rising for the fourth consecutive session. The Hang Seng
Index rose 42.36 points to 8,628.93.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed. The Philippine Stock
Exchange Index of 30 selected issues fell 9.74 points, or 0.5
percent, to 1,787.26.
	   SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed marginally higher,
supported by banking stocks and selected industrial blue chips. The
All Ordinaries Index rose 4.1 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,814.7.

Absent prime minister gets impromptu visitor staying overnight

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A self-effacing housebreaker thought
the first place he broke into was too grand, so he opted for a
less-impressive pad _ the prime minister's.
	   Police said Friday that a man out on parole from a burglary
conviction climbed into the second story of Prime Minister Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen's villa, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of
Copenhagen, on July 10.
	   Nyrup Rasmussen was away on vacation and the burglar alarm
seemed to be off-duty as well. It didn't detect the man, even
though he went in and out several times, including one trip to go
to a casino.
	   The man, whose name was not released, slept on a sofa. The next
day, when he decided to explore the house more, the alarm system
finally detected him. He fled, but police found him hiding under a
bridge over a nearby lake.
	   Police said the man told them he had first broken into the
nearby Frederiksdal Castle, a private residence, but he thought it
was too distinguished.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ There will never be peace in the Middle East
without active Syrian involvement _ and France wants to be
involved, too, President Jacques Chirac said Friday after talks
with Hafez Assad.
	   ``Our concern is peace,'' Chirac said after meeting the Syrian
president for a second time, terming the talks ``very positive.''
Assad is on an extremely rare visit to the West.
	   On another, more sticky issue for the two nations, Assad told
Chirac Friday that ``to his knowledge,'' Alois Brunner _ one of the
world's most-wanted Nazi war criminals _ is not in Syria, the
French president's spokeswoman said.
	   Brunner, a top Nazi operative who once was commandant of the
squalid French transit camp at Drancy, is the subject of a French
judicial investigation. Chirac asked that Syria finally respond
officially to the French investigation, and Assad said he would
``examine the issue,'' said French spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
	   Brunner has long been believed to be hiding out in Syria.
	   Leaving a second round of talks with the Syrian leader, Chirac
made clear the importance he places on Syria's role in the peace
process.
	   ``We know very well that there won't be peace in the region
without the active participation of Syria,'' Chirac said.
``Consequently, we want to combine our efforts, France and Syria,
to attain our objective.''
	   He was referring to the objective of Mideast peace, but it's
also clear that France wants to play a role in breaking the impasse
in the region _ and to counter-balance the heavy weight of the
United States.
	   It's been 22 years since Assad visited France, and he's been to
the West only a couple of times in the past decade. So it must have
felt good to get the red-carpet treatment at Chirac's elegant
Elysee Palace.
	   Leaving the palace Thursday for a quick rest after the first
round of presidential talks, Assad was feted by a band of the
Republican Guard, in their golden helmets with long red plumes. The
minute he left, women in flowing gowns began arriving for a state
dinner in his honor.
	   The first round of talks went on for two hours and 40 minutes _
considerably longer than expected.
	   While reiterating his support for American mediation, Chirac
said it was necessary to consider what to do ``in case the current
efforts halt,'' said his spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna.
	   An international conference could end the impasse, Chirac said,
again raising a French-Egyptian proposal made in May.
	   Assad apparently gave a lukewarm response to the proposal.
Colonna said only that the Syrian ``did not refuse the idea.''
	   For Assad, the trip could be a chance to become more of a global
player. He, too, seeks an alternative to U.S. mediation in the
Mideast _ though in his dinner toast, he said he saw no
``opposition'' between the European and U.S. efforts.
	   The United States has accused Syria of sponsoring international
terrorism, a charge that Damascus denies.
	   France has special leverage with Syria, partly because the Arab
nation was once a French-mandated territory, from 1920-1946.
	   Among Arab nations, there is a growing interest in greater
European diplomacy. French intervention in the region has
occasionally advanced the process where American policy failed.
	   During Israel's offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in
southern Lebanon in 1996, France engineered a truce that still
stands. And last month, France guaranteed an exchange of prisoners
and soldiers' remains between Lebanon and Israel.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The Swiss head of observer mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and his
Croatian driver were seriously injured in a traffic accident in
downtown Zagreb, police reported Friday.
	   Tim Guldimann, 48, suffered a broken vertebra and other
injuries, Dr. Igor Krpan said. Krpan said Guldimann's injuries were
not life-threatening and he was expected to recover.
	   The head of the U.N. refugee agency in Croatia, Robert Robinson,
was also injured in the accident but not seriously, police said.
Robinson, an American, was treated at a hospital.
	   The accident occurred late Thursday when the officials' vehicle
collided with a truck that was towing away illegally parked
vehicles.
	   Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
	   The OSCE mission monitors Croatia's human rights and democracy

World nuclear threat now high: Australian Report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The world is facing the most serious
threat of nuclear conflict since at least the Cuban missile crisis,
an Australian parliamentary report released Friday warns.
	   In fact, residual tensions after the recent nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan may represent ``the most serious risk of a
nuclear exchange that we have ever known,'' says the report,
prepared jointly by Australia's defense, intelligence and
diplomatic services.
	   The report was prepared for a committee of Parliament's upper
house, the Senate, which is considering the India-Pakistan
situation.
	   India conducted five nuclear tests early in May. Pakistan
responded, apparently with six tests, later the same month.
	   The Australian report says national pride played a big part in
India's decision to defy world opinion by conducting the tests.
	   ``The fundamental motivation for India's tests is tied up with
its sense of place in the international community and its long
standing desire to be recognized as a global power,'' the report
said. ``India appears to believe it had not been afforded due
respect as the world's largest democracy and second most populous
nation.''
	   The report also said India was ``frustrated'' that the
international community had not sufficiently acknowledged how it
had not openly advanced its nuclear weapons program.
	   Strategically, the nuclear tests made little sense for India,
the report says.
	   Pakistan's tests were the result of the government responding to
overwhelming political and public pressure after India's tests.
	   The enmity between the two countries is virulent, the report
observes.
	   ``They each have the bomb,'' the report said. ``They represent
perhaps the most serious risk of nuclear exchange that we have ever
known.''

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ While full-scale war has not broken
out between Ethiopia and Eritrea, neither is there peace. The
armies of both countries remain hunkered down along the disputed
border where they came to blows a month ago.
	   Ethiopia says a showdown is inevitable if Eritrea doesn't give
in and withdraw from Badme and Shiraro, disputed districts on the
western end of the 600-mile (965-kilometer) border separating the
two countries that were one until Eritrea became independent in
1993.
	   Ethiopia says it was Eritrea's invasion of the two districts on
May 6 that precipitated the crisis and subsequent fighting. But
Eritrean presidential spokesman Yemana Ghebreab calls Ethiopia's
sabre-rattling a ``bluff'' to maneuver the international community
into pressuring Eritrea to withdraw to get the two sides talking.
	   Speaking on Eritrean television Wednesday, Ghebreab said chances
for a peaceful settlement were ``very much alive.''
	   Kenya, the latest in a series of countries to try to mediate the
crisis, says it is trying to ``level the area of disagreement
between the two.''
	   ``In a sense, the two countries have gotten into a situation
which _ it is clear to us _ none of them really wanted to get
into,'' Kenyan Foreign Minister Boyana Godana told reporters in
Nairobi on Wednesday.
	   He said successful peace talks must result in a binding
agreement, adding that there were questions about the two sides'
commitment to reaching such a pact.
	   Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi held three hours of talks
with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi on July 13. Godana said
Eritrean President Isias Afwerki is expected in the Kenyan capital
next week.
	   A recent United Nations mission to Ethiopia's northern Tigray
and eastern Afar regions said as many as 100,000 people had been
displaced by the fighting. Ethiopia puts the figure at 180,000.
	   The U.N. World Food program says its emergency food stocks in
the region are being rapidly depleted, and another shipment is not
expected until September.
	   Eritrea says 100,000 of its people have been forced to flee
because of the conflict. It condemns Ethiopian authorities for
expelling several thousand Eritrean citizens and says it has not
deported a single Ethiopian from its territory.
	   A statement from the Eritrean Foreign Ministry said hundreds of
Eritreans were being dumped at the border and left to walk in the
blazing sun on the road leading to the Red Sea port of Assab.
	   Ethiopia said the deportations were carried out for security
reasons. It has also detained another 1,000 Eritrean military
personnel and conscripts at a military camp in Fiche, 60 miles (97
kilometers) north of Addis Ababa.
	   The Red Cross has visited the camp and registered the detainees.
	   Ethiopia claims that at least 4,400 of its citizens have been
expelled from Eritrea.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ As many as 5,426 people have contracted
syphilis in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region in the first half of
1998, regional health authorities reported Friday.
	   The report noted that the number included 261 youngsters under
18 years of age, most of them schoolchildren. The number of
syphilis cases among them has grown by 22 percent from the same
period last year, said the report, cited by the Interfax news
agency.

Researchers map genes for syphilis, call for eradication campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Researchers have mapped the entire genetic
pattern of the syphilis bacterium, a breakthrough that may lead to
a new vaccine and, eventually, eradication of a sexually
transmitted disease that has been a worldwide scourge for 500
years.
	   Scientists at the University of Texas Health Science Center in
Houston and the Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville,
Maryland, say they have mapped the 1.1 million base pairs of DNA
that make up the syphilis genome.
	   A report on the work was published Friday in the journal
Science.
	   Experts said the new gene map eventually will enable researchers
to more effectively detect and treat syphilis. It also should help
in developing a vaccine that will prevent infection by the microbe.
	   ``Completion of this project is an extraordinary boost for
efforts to develop a protective vaccine,'' said Dr. Anthony S.
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, the federal agency that funded the syphilis genome
research.
	   Dr. Michael E. St. Louis and Dr. Judith N. Wasserheit of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said mapping the
syphilis genome, along with other technical advances, may make it
possible to eradicate the disease altogether.
	   Writing in Science, they called mapping of the syphilis genome
``a landmark project'' that may lead to rapid advances in diagnosis
and treatment.
	   Syphilis became a worldwide scourge following the first
permanent European presence in the Americas after 1492. This
suggested to some experts that the disease originated in the New
World, but that has never been proven.
	   The disease, which is spread only through sexual intercourse,
causes genital lesions that put its victims at higher risk of
contracting HIV, the viral infection that causes AIDS.
	   Once called the ``great imitator'' because it can mimic symptoms
of other diseases, syphilis can be very mild in its early stages.
It often is difficult to detect in blood tests.
	   The organism cannot live outside of the human body, and research
into the disease has been frustrated because it cannot be cultured
in the laboratory.
	   Dr. Penelope J. Hitchcock, an NIAID researcher, said the new
gene map of syphilis may enable experts to develop a laboratory
culture and a more accurate diagnostic test for the disease.
	   Untreated, syphilis can eventually cause heart ailments,
insanity and blindness, but the course of the disease may take
decades and include long periods when there are few indications of
disease.
	   In the 1930s, syphilis was considered a major U.S. public health
problem, but the introduction of penicillin saw the incidence of
the disease drop sharply.
	   In 1997, the United States recorded 8,551 cases, a rate of about
3.2 cases per 100,000 people. During a 1990 surge of the disease,
the syphilis rate was more than 20 per 100,000.
	   Despite medical innovations, however, Russia has reported a
steady rise, with authorities citing drug abuse and prostitution
rings, as well as a lack of effective drugs.
	   Regional health authorities in Ukraine also reported Friday that
as many as 5,426 people have contracted syphilis in Ukraine's
eastern Donetsk region in the first half of 1998, according to the
Interfax news agency.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A pair of senior politicians _ one a favorite of
the old guard, the other championed by younger lawmakers _
announced their candidacies Friday to replace outgoing Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and unveiled their strategies to revive
Japan's economy. Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, a 61-year-old party
veteran seen as the favorite of ruling Liberal Democratic Party
elders, promised more than 6 trillion yen (dlrs 43.2 billion) in
permanent tax cuts. The tax cuts will include slashing the top
income tax rate to 50 percent from 65 percent to boost the economy.
In his policy speech seeking support for his candidacy, Obuchi also
said he would reduce the corporate tax to 40 percent from 46
percent and ease the tax burden on middle-income earners.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ East Timorese should be involved in
any U.N.-mediated talks between Portugal and Indonesia on their
troubled territory's fate, a jailed rebel leader said Friday.
Xanana Gusmao, the leader of East Timor's separatist guerrilla
movement, spoke after a United Nations mediator visited him in the
Jakarta jail where he is serving a 20-year sentence. ``I think East
Timorese people have to take part in discussions about their own
fate,'' said Gusmao, who urged Indonesia and Portugal, East Timor's
formal colonial master, to mend severed diplomatic relations to
help bring peace. The rebel talked with the U.N. special envoy on
East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, for more than an hour inside Cipinang
jail. He later was visited by East Timor's Nobel peace laureate,
Bishop Carlos Belo. (INDONESIA-UN-EAST TIMOR)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police on Friday arrested four
more people in connection with the deaths of three young brothers
in a sectarian firebombing attack. Three other suspects remain in
custody.In her first public interview, aired Friday morning, the
boys' mother said she feels guilty about the deaths. ``I do. I wish
I hadn't stayed there,'' Chrissie Quinn, 29, said in an interview
with the news channel GMTV. News reports said the latest arrests
were made in the boys' home town of Ballymoney, 40 miles (65 kms)
northwest of Belfast, but police refused to confirm that.
Authorities say they believe the Quinn household _ located in a
staunchly Protestant housing complex _ was targeted because the
boys' Catholic mother lived there with her Protestant boyfriend.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A strong earthquake jolted Taiwan on
Friday, causing rock slides on a southern mountain that killed at
least three people and injured 10. The quake, with a preliminary
magnitude of 6.2, was felt throughout Taiwan and on the coast of
mainland China. It was centered about 14 kilometers (8.5 miles)
west of Alishan, known also as Mount Ali, located 300 kilometers
(180 miles) south of Taipei. A hotel in the town of Rweili on the
scenic mountain suffered serious cracks, injuring four of its
staffers, said Mo Hwei-tsu, head of the Taiwan Rescue Center. He
said previous reports that the hotel collapsed, trapping 10 people
inside, were mistaken. A driver was killed on a mountain road by a
rockslide, and another person was killed by a falling rock. A
landslide buried the exit of a tunnel, killing one person, he said.
State radio said a total of four people were killed, including a
person killed by another landslide. (TAIWAN-EARTHQUAKE)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying Serb authorities, Kosovo's
leading Albanian politician pledged Friday to continue building
institutions of government in this rebellious province despite a
police crackdown on his unauthorized parliment. Elsewhere, Serb
sources said a policeman was shot and killed late Thursday in the
town of Kosovska Mitrovica about 20 kilometers (19 miles) northwest
of here by suspected Albanian extremists who opened fire from a
speeding car. Police set up roadblocks in the area to try to find
the assailants. Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's self-styled president,
made the declaration as an international fact-finding team met with
Serb officials here in the latest diplomatic bid to end the
fighting and pave the way for peace talks with the Yugoslav
government. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For three nights before Princess Diana's funeral,
her mother mingled with mourners outside the princess's Kensington
Palace home, gaining strength from their grief.
	   In a television interview aired Thursday night on Fox in the
United States, Diana's mother Frances Shand Kydd said she could not
believe the scale of the mourning.
	   ``It was unbelievable, there aren't words to describe it,'' she
said in her first interview since her daughter's death in a Paris
car crash Aug. 31.
	   Tens of thousands of people flocked to Kensington Gardens to lay
flowers and mementos at the gates of the palace after Diana's
death.
	   ``With literally thousands of people comforting, sharing, we
were sharing a very deep hurt,'' said Mrs. Shand Kydd, who looked
drawn and sad during the interview in the library at the Spencer
family's ancestral home, Althorp House.
	   ``But I think far too little has been said about what people all
over the world gave to her. They nourished her, they made her
smile, they gave her strength.''
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd said she was frustrated by her inability to
shield her daughter from the frustrations that being famous brought
to her.
	   ``I wanted privacy for her, very often, when she wasn't
working,'' she said. ''But it wasn't to be.''
	   On Thursday, The Mirror tabloid published a transcript of the
interview that differed substantially from the program. A spokesman
for Fox declined to comment on the discrepancy.
	   Mirror head of public relations Nick Fullagar said the newspaper
``was supplied by the company that made the film with an unedited,
pre-broadcast copy'' of the interview which it accepted ``in good
faith.''
	   The newspaper stands by its transcript, he said. ``We are
delighted that we were able to give our readers more than Fox could
give its viewers.'' Fullagar said cuts to the material were Fox's
decision. ``Who knows why they did it? They make their own
editorial decisions,'' he said.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ A day after four English hooligans were
sentenced to jail terms for rioting during the World Cup, two
Tunisians and an Algerian received terms Friday for the same
rioting.
	   English fans battled local residents, many of them North
Africans, in this southern city for three days surrounding the June
15 England-Tunisia game.
	   Along with violence by German thugs in the northern city of
Lens, which left a French policeman in a coma, the brawls were
among the worst disturbances of the tournament.
	   On Friday, two Tunisians, Emim Abdesstar, 24, and Fetmi
Bergachi, 19, were sentenced to one-month terms _ which they had
already served. They were immediately freed.
	   A third, Algerian Farid Michtaoui, 30, was sentenced to three
months, and banned from France for a year.
	   On Thursday, four British hooligans received jail terms, and
several more were to face a judge late Friday.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Six children died in drowning incidents in
southern Ukraine in one day, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Two girls and a boy, aged 7 to 13, from the village of Nerushai
in the Odessa region, drowned in an artificial lake, the daily
Segodnya said.
	   According to Anatoly Shatylo of the regional civil defense
office, the children may have slipped and hit themselves against
the concrete wall of the lake, which was used for draining
purposes.
	   The bodies of three girls, aged 10 to 14 years old, were found
in the North Crimean canal near the village of Krasnosilske on the
Crimean peninsula. Local police said the girls, whose names were
withheld, could have been raped and then thrown into the water.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A pair of senior politicians _ one a favorite of
the old guard, the other championed by younger lawmakers _
announced their candidacies Friday to replace outgoing Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and unveiled their strategies to revive
Japan's economy.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, a 61-year-old party veteran seen
as the favorite of ruling Liberal Democratic Party elders, promised
more than 6 trillion yen (dlrs 43.2 billion) in permanent tax cuts
and a 10 trillion yen (dlrs 71.9 billion) extra budget.
	   The tax cuts will include slashing the top income tax rate to 50
percent from 65 percent to boost the economy.
	   In his policy speech seeking support for his candidacy, Obuchi
also said he would reduce the corporate tax to 40 percent from 46
percent and ease the tax burden on middle-income earners.
	   Obuchi said the government would pay for the tax cuts by
suspending the fiscal stringency law, which committed the
government to deficit reduction targets, and issuing
deficit-covering bonds.
	   ``We will use every available means to revive the economy,''
Obuchi told reporters. ``We must take the explosion of voter anger
seriously.''
	   The other candidate, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama, warned there was no quick fix for Japan's recession and
that some painful measures were necessary to put the economy back
on track.
	   ``Some bloodletting will be inevitable,'' Kajiyama told a news
conference minutes after Obuchi spoke.
	   A growing number of reformist lawmakers in the Liberal
Democratic Party is throwing their support behind the blunt,
outspoken Kajiyama, protesting what they call Obuchi's lack of
ideas to revive the stagnant economy.
	   But Kajiyama, 72, has often made controversial, offensive
remarks. In 1990, he apologized after saying that prostitutes in
Japan and blacks in the United States both ``ruin the atmosphere of
the neighborhoods they move into.'' The remarks provoked an uproar
in the United States.
	   At his news conference, Kajiyama vowed to get tough on banks
saddled with bad debt, requiring them to set aside provisions for
problem loans and make bank managements take full responsibility
for their difficulties.
	   Although he did not offer specifics, Kajiyama echoed Obuchi's
view that corporate tax cuts and a permanent reduction in income
taxes were needed to revive the economy.
	   Kajiyama also promised to tackle Japan's record high 4.1 percent
unemployment rate by creating 1 million new jobs.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party president, who will be chosen July
24 in balloting by party lawmakers, is virtually sure to become
prime minister because the party controls the more powerful lower
house of Parliament.
	   Prime Minister Hashimoto stepped down Monday to take
responsibility for his party's disastrous performance in weekend
elections for Parliament's upper house.
	   The elections were widely seen as a vote against the way the
government has managed Japan's economy, which is in the midst of
its worst recession since World War II.
	   Some younger lawmakers have also opposed the way Obuchi has gone
about securing party support.
	   Before announcing his bid, Obuchi had spent days building up
support in the traditional manner of holding closed door meetings
with party power brokers.
	   The lawmakers say that secret deals and backroom politicking
were exactly what voters were rejecting in the polls last Sunday.
	   Kyodo News service reported that Health and Welfare Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, considered a rising star in the Liberal
Democratic Party, has also decided to run for the party presidency,
Kyodo News reported.
	   Neither Koizumi's office nor the party would confirm the Kyodo
report.
	   The party had initially planned to choose its leader July 21,
but the vote was postponed by three days to give candidates time to
explain their views.

Three North Africans sentenced for soccer rioting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ A day after four English hooligans were
sentenced to jail terms for rioting during the World Cup, two
Tunisians and an Algerian received terms Friday for the same
rioting.
	   English fans battled local residents, many of them North
Africans, in this southern city for three days surrounding the June
15 England-Tunisia game.
	   Along with violence by German thugs in the northern city of
Lens, which left a French policeman in a coma, the brawls were
among the worst disturbances of the tournament.
	   On Friday, two Tunisians, Emim Abdesstar, 24, and Fetmi
Bergachi, 19, were sentenced to one-month terms _ which they had
already served. They were immediately freed.
	   A third, Algerian Farid Michtaoui, 30, was sentenced to three
months, and banned from France for a year.
	   On Thursday, four British hooligans received jail terms, and
several more were to face a judge late Friday.

Draft treaty rebuffs key U.S. demands on permanent war crimes
</HEADLINE>
tribunal &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS reaction, CLARIFIES that Washington's allies were
opposed to US position and supported treaty, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A draft treaty creating the world's first permanent
war crimes tribunal but rebuffing key U.S. demands emerged early
Friday from marathon U.N. negotiations.
	   Delegates from 160 countries have until midnight Friday (2200
gmt) to endorse the treaty, and several said the draft had a good
chance of winning approval.
	   The carefully crafted plan makes concessions designed to win
broad support.
	   The list of crimes the court would prosecute, for example, was
expanded to add aggression, which the non-aligned nations had
sought. In a nod to the five nuclear powers on the U.N. Security
Council, it omits any specific mention of nuclear weapons. A
proviso on war crimes addresses French concerns.
	   But many of Washington's demands _ which many democratic
countries and human rights groups said could cripple the court _
were rebuffed.
	   Despite weeks of arm-twisting, the United States failed to block
the creation of an independent prosecutor and insert a loophole
that could exempt U.S. citizens and soldiers from the court's
jurisdiction. Most of Washington's closest allies were opposed to
its stand on the court.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the document from the United
States.
	   Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch, part of a coalition of 800
non-governmental organizations, told reporters there were ``real
problems with the treaty.''
	   He said there were no provisions for suspects given shelter in
other countries to be turned over to the court.
	   ``This is a treaty that traveling tyrants will be very
comfortable with,'' he said.
	   But Emma Bonino, the European Union's human rights commissioner,
said she thought the draft treaty was an acceptable compromise and
deserved approval.
	   As envisioned in the draft, the international criminal court
would bring individuals to justice for genocide, crimes against
humanity, war crimes and aggression.
	   The court, to be based in The Hague, Netherlands, fulfills a
dream that was born after World War II with the Nuremberg trials of
Nazi war criminals and revived with the ad hoc tribunals for
alleged offenders from Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
	   Under the draft, a case could be triggered by the prosecutor,
with the approval of a pre-trial panel of judges, by a country or
by the U.N. Security Council.
	   To hear a case, the court would need the permission either of
the nation where the alleged crime was committed or the suspect's
home country.
	   The United States had sought a more restrictive option that
would let it veto, without interference, the prosecution of any
American citizen. With U.S. troops deployed in hot spots around the
world, Washington fears they could become targets of politically
motivated charges.
	   The United States also fiercely opposed the creation of an
independent prosecutor, arguing that only the Security Council or
countries should be allowed to bring a case.
	   A prosecutor, it argued, risked becoming an overworked human
rights ombudsman rather than someone free to focus on only the most
heinous, widespread crimes.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ With the scent of incense hanging
in the air, Russia buried its last czar Friday in a somber ceremony
that Boris Yeltsin called an atonement for ``one of the most
shameful pages of our history.''
	   On the 80th anniversary of the executions of the Russian royal
family, nine separate coffins with the bones of Czar Nicholas II,
his wife, daughters and servants were lowered into one large crypt
beneath the floor of the gilded, 18th-century St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral.
	   ``We have long been silent about this monstrous crime,'' Yeltsin
said of the executions, carried out by Bolshevik revolutionaries at
the dawn of the communist era. ``Guilty are those who committed
this heinous crime, and those who have been justifying it for
decades, all of us.''
	   In a powerful speech, Yeltsin said the burial should serve in a
catalyst for national reconciliation in a country that has lurched
from one upheaval to another during the 20th century _ from
revolution and civil war, to famine, political purges and the
collapse of an empire.
	   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation,'' Yeltsin said.
	   The burial was officiated by a dozen bearded priests in
gold-and-white robes, with one gently swinging a censer that sent
small puffs of burning incense wafting over the coffins.
	   Dozens of the czar's relatives, diplomats from 50 countries, and
Prince Michael of Kent, a member of the British royal family, which
is related to Russian royalty, stood and held lit candles at the
cathedral on the banks of the Neva River.
	   The czar's family members tossed white sand, representing the
earth, onto the coffins before the crypt was covered. Outside on
the river bank, cannons boomed in a 19-shot salute _ two shy of the
customary 21 because the czar abdicated a year before he was
killed.
	   ``We must tell the truth _ the (czar's) massacre has become one
of the most shameful pages of our history,'' Yeltsin said. ``By
burying the remains of the innocent victims we want to expiate the
sins of our ancestors.''
	   As the ceremony drew to a close, Yeltsin clasped the hands of
Nicholas Romanov, the most prominent of the czar's relatives at the
service, and they spoke briefly.
	   With its understated dignity, the burial was in sharp contrast
to the months of controversy that preceded it.
	   Many leading Russian figures, including the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church, skipped the service due to multiple disputes it
generated. Yeltsin was planning to stay away as well, but changed
his mind and announced Thursday he would participate.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917, the Romanov dynasty, and the nature of national guilt and
contrition.
	   The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but Russia has not
previously held any major, formal ceremonies dealing with the
abuses committed during communist times. Friday's service brought
the issue to the fore.
	   ``This is not just a funeral, but a national repentance,'' said
Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the world's leading conductors and
cellists, who was exiled during the Soviet era.
	   ``It shows the entire world that Russia is changing and becoming
more humane,'' he said on Russian television.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   But the burial also raised controversies. The Orthodox Church,
as well as some ordinary Russians, have questioned the authenticity
of the remains despite extensive DNA testing in the United States,
Russia and Britain.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony was
relatively simple. When the coffins were interred, the priest did
not use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques
were on the walls of the chapel.
	   About 1,500 people gathered outside the fortress Friday morning,
though they were not able to see the ceremonies. A few dozen were
there to protest.
	   ``Factories are closed. People aren't getting their pay _ what's
going on with this funeral?'' said Vyacheslav Marichev, a former
politician.
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for three centuries. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
his wife, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   Nine of the 11 bodies were recovered in 1991 from a desolate
forest outside the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. Two
skeletons have never been found _ Alexei, the czar's only son and a
daughter that scientists believe was Maria. Most investigators
believe their bodies were buried to ashes by their killers.

Ukrainian government again tries to sell oil refinery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's state privatization agency is
trying once again to sell one of the country's most lucrative oil
refineries, its fourth attempt so far, the State Property Fund
reported Friday.
	   The SPF will sell a 41.4 percent stake in the eastern Ukrainian
Linos oil refinery to the buyer offering the best investment plan,
according to an SPF decision, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Three previous Linos tenders, announced earlier this year in an
attempt to find an investor for the poorly performing company, were
canceled because they attracted no bidders.
	   The government's attempts to sell three other oil refineries
have also failed.
	   Linos, the second-largest of Ukraine's six refineries, is
capable of processing 18 million tons of crude oil annually and
produces high-octane gasoline and a variety of other oil products.
The enterprise is considered potentially one of the most lucrative
in Ukraine.
	   But a severe economic crisis in the country has forced Linos
into huge debts and left it working at about 15 percent of its
capacity over the last few years.
	   Some Russian oil companies, widely seen as the most realistic
buyers for Linos, originally expressed interest in purchasing the
company, but then changed their mind.
	   Dozens of privatization tenders have been canceled in Ukraine
this year after investors, scared away by lack of economic reforms
and unstable tax and legal environment, expressed no interest in
acquiring stakes in the country's enterprises.

Singapore court raises damages to prime minister in defamation
</HEADLINE>
ruling

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's highest court on Friday vastly
increased the amount of damages awarded to Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong in a closely watched defamation case.
	   The tangled case involves a political activist's campaign rally
statement that some of his supporters had filed police complaints
against Goh.
	   Although the statement was true, Goh successfully sued J.B.
Jeyaretnam, one of only three opposition members in the 84-seat
Parliament.
	   The case was used as an example in this year's U.S. State
Department Human Rights Report of how it said the Singapore
government uses libel and defamation suits to stifle freedom of
speech and intimidate the political opposition.
	   The Singapore government rejected the criticism, saying that
leaders of Goh's People's Action Party, in power for 38 years, must
sue for large damages to clear their names in order to maintain
credibility in this nation of 3.1 million people.
	   A lower court ruled last year that Jeyaretnam's statement was
defamatory because it could lead a hearer to believe the prime
minister might be investigated for doing something wrong.
	   The lower court awarded Goh 20,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
12,400) in damages.
	   On Friday, the Singapore Court of Appeal awarded Goh five times
that amount, 100,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 58,800). In addition,
Jeyaretnam must pay full court costs.
	   Jeyaretnam said the court costs are estimated at about 100,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 58,800).
	   ``I cannot pay the damages,'' Jeyaretnam told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview. ``I don't know what I will do.''
	   If proclaimed bankrupt, Jeyaretnam will lose his Parliament
seat, according to the Constitution, he said.
	   In addition to the prime minister, 10 other ruling party leaders
sued Jeyaretnam, and the total damage and cost awards are about 2
million Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.25 million), including Friday's
ruling.
	   The case stems from a campaign rally on the eve of the Jan. 1,
1998 election when Jeyaretnam told a rally that one of his Worker's
Party colleagues had filed police reports against ``Goh and his
people.''

Weather taking its toll at British Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with morning play; Elkington out &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Now, this is more like the British
Open.
	   Cold rain and high winds returned to the coast of the Irish Sea
Friday, making life difficult for the players with early tee times
at Royal Birkdale.
	   Fred Couples, a stroke behind Tiger Woods and John Huston
beginning the day, bogeyed three of the first eight holes to fall
back to 1 under, while Davis Love III shot a 1-over-35 on the front
side then took a double bogey on No. 11 to go to even par.
	   Loren Roberts, who began the day tied with Couples, bogeyed
three of the first six holes and dropped to 1 under after eight.
	   Sun occasionally broke through the clouds, but players and fans
still were forced to bundle up in an assortment of colorful rain
gear and head coverings. Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal wore a wool
hat pulled down low over his ears.
	   Woods and Huston, who led after Thursday's opening round with
65s had afternoon tee times, as did Nick Price, who began with a
66.
	   The conditions were in stark contrast to the opening round, when
light breezes and warm weather greeted golfers expecting the normal
wind and rain on the northwest coast of England.
	   One player who won't have to deal with the tough conditions is
1995 PGA champion Steve Elkington. The Australian withdrew from the
Open Friday because of a pinched nerve in his neck. He shot a
5-over 75 on Thursday.
	   With Woods and Huston leading the way, Americans dominated the
leaderboard in the opening round.
	   Players who make their living on the friendly courses of the PGA
Tour were right at home on the smooth fairways and soft greens, and
the scores showed it. Eight tour regulars were among the top 10
leaders, and the top five players all live in the United States.
	   In all, 27 golfers broke par and another 14 matched it on a
course that only days earlier generated predictions of U.S.
Open-type scores.
	   Those predictions came when the wind was blowing, however, and
only a breeze blew through the bushes and tall meadow rye Thursday
as Woods took his first lead in a major since winning the 1997
Masters.
	   The sun even came out by midmorning, about the same time that
Woods was making his run.
	   Woods, using a putter given to him by buddy Mark O'Meara, broke
out of the putting slump that has bedeviled him in the majors since
his Masters win. He made four birdie putts on the front nine, and
then ran in a curling 35-footer (10 1/2-meter) on the 13th hole.
	   Woods would have had the lead all to himself but couldn't get
up-and-down from just off the 18th green, missing a 5-footer (1
1/2-meter) for a bogey 5.
	   ``Hopefully, if he continues to putt well I'll get a commission
on some of his rewards,'' said O'Meara, the Masters champion who
opened with a 72.
	   Huston didn't have any new clubs, but he had something even
better _ his magnets.
	   Since January, he has slept on a magnet-laced mattress cover to
try to alleviate bursitis and tendinitis, which forced him into a
deep slump last year and made it painful to play. It seems to be
working.
	   Huston was 2 under when he ran in a 40-foot (12-meter) eagle
putt on 17 and followed it with a spectacular 7-iron out of the
rough to within 3-feet (1-meter) on 18 for a final birdie.
	   European players are more used to playing in foul weather than
the Americans. Instead of trying to simply survive, they were
forced to try and shoot low scores to keep up in the opening round.
	   ``The tough thing was to change all your goals,'' said Swede
Jesper Parnevik, who shot a 68 and was three strokes back. ``From
thinking about a 71, you had to try and shoot a low score.''
	   The top five players and eight of the top 10 were all either
Americans or live in the United States, while Britain's top golfers
could not break par. Colin Montgomerie continued his streak of
over-par first rounds in the Open with a 73, while rising English
star Lee Westwood shot 71.
	   It was the latest of Open woes for Montgomerie, the No. 5 player
in the world who has yet to break par in the first round of an Open
and has missed cuts in four of the last six.
	   ``Hopefully, I can try and make the cut. That's all I'm
interested in right now,'' Montgomerie said.
	   Westwood, the 25-year-old who is England's hottest player, had
other ideas.
	   ``As soon as the putts start going in I think I will be making a
move in the right direction,'' he said.
	   The putts were dropping for Price, the 1994 Open winner who
contended on the last day of the U.S. Open but has also had
problems on the green.
	   Price played in the same group as Woods, and they seemed to feed
off each other and the large galleries that followed their every
shot.
	   ``When I putt well, I've got a good chance to win,'' Price said.
``For me, my ball striking has always been a standard. I guess it
is just a question of how sharp my short game is.''

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The body overseeing upcoming
elections said Friday it was investigating reports that thousands
of poll observers may be closely associated with the ruling
political party or have bought their way into the monitoring
process.
	   Nearly 60,000 people have signed up to monitor the July 26
electoral contest, enough for five monitors at each of the 11,000
polling stations, and almost six times the expected number
according to the National Election Committee. The sheer numbers
have raised eyebrows among electoral watchdogs.
	   The Phnom Penh Post newspaper on Friday quoted committee
official Tep Jahnvibol as saying that the Buddhist Association for
the Relief of the Poor appears to have close ties with the ruling
Cambodian People's Party ``in clear violation of the code of
conduct.''
	   The association alone is reported to have supplied 24,000
election observers, or 40 percent of the total.
	   ``If there are active ties between an observer and a politician,
it's a big problem,'' he said about reports that the association
appears to be working with Gen. Nhim Vanda of the ruling party to
sign up accredited observers. Much of its paperwork appeared to be
forged, he added.
	   Nhim Vanda's office denied the reports.
	   The committee also has asked the Interior Ministry to help
determine how many people may have illegally purchased national
observer cards, committee spokesman Leng Sochea said at a news
conference.
	   A high number of illegal monitors ``could affect the electoral
process,'' he said. ``Any people who obtain cards illegally will be
punished by law,''
	   Some of the observers may have been tricked into paying fees of
up to dlrs 100 for nonexistent jobs, the newspaper Cambodia Daily
reported earlier this week, but others may be loyal to Cambodian
leader Hun Sen's ruling party and could risk the neutrality of the
monitoring process.
	   The election committee said Friday it is also investigating
reports that Hun Sen's party has been organizing mock elections
across the northwestern province of Battambang to make sure party
supporters vote ``properly'' on election day.
	   The election committee and electoral laws prohibit the use of
ballots or sample ballots to try to influence the way people vote.
	   Cambodia's elections are scheduled to take place one year after
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who won a U.N.-sponsored election in
1993, was ousted by the powerful Hun Sen in a bloody coup d'etat.
	   Critics say that the electoral process has been skewed in his
favor and that Hun Sen's party has engaged in intimidation, threats
and killings of opposition members in the provinces.
	   Ranariddh returned from exile to lead his FUNCINPEC party in the
campaign. The United Nations is overseeing a group of 500
international observers.
	   Meanwhile, an umbrella group of opposition parties _ including
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party _ issued a complaint
to the Joint International Observing Group Friday listing remaining
concerns about the electoral process.
	   They listed unequal access to the media and threats, assaults,
and killings of activists as among the complaints that have been
ignored by the election committee.
	   ``Serious flaws in the plans for polling day threaten to destroy
what little credibility remains in this electoral process,'' they
wrote, hinting that the problems appear to stem from the fact that
the committee is dominated by supporters of Hun Sen's party.

Russian and Chinese presidents to meet next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin and China's leader Jiang
Zemin are planning to meet in the end of August, the Kremlin said
on Friday.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang agreed to hold the informal ``without
jackets'' summit when the Russian president visited China last
November.
	   Relations between the two nations have flourished in recent
years after decades of friction. Moscow sees the relationship as a
``strategic partnership'' that counterbalances what it describes as
U.S. attempts to dominate the world.

Analysts say forecast of cargo losses still too low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Analysts said Friday that a revised government
estimate of financial losses due to cargo-handling problems at the
new airport still may be far too low.
	   Anthony Charter, the main cargo handling company's chairman,
also told government radio Friday that the main reason for the
problems at its new terminal was dust contamination of sensitive
mechanical and electrical equipment.
	   ``We've embarked on the cleaning and restoration of the sensors
and electrical systems,'' Charter said on Hong Kong radio.
	   He added that software glitches after the airport's opening July
6 have been fixed.
	   Singapore-based DBS securities said that the long-term negative
effects of the cargo delays at the new Chek Lap Kok airport will
cause the economy to contract by 2.2 percent this year, compared
with their earlier estimate of 1.5 percent.
	   Government estimates of revenue loss due to the cargo problems
represented ``only the income loss due of exports and imports,''
DBS added.
	   The airport's main cargo handler Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals
Ltd. announced last week it would not be able to bring its facility
at the new airport up to full speed until the end of August. It had
previously frozen most cargo shipments until July 19.
	   The government said Thursday that the protracted cargo delays
would result in a loss of about 4.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 589 million), or 0.35 percent of Hong Kong's Gross Domestic
Product this year.
	   The latest estimates were higher than earlier statements of
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, who said that losses would total
about 1.3 billion (U.S. dlrs 166 million) or 0.1 percent of GDP
this year.
	   The Hong Kong Standard quoted Morgan Stanley's Andy Xie Guozhong
as predicting that economic losses could run up to 60 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 7.7 billion) due to a ``ripple effect on
the rest of the economy.''
	   DBS predicted that Hong Kong's GDP growth for 1999 would drop
from 1.3 percent to 1 percent, saying there was no guarantee the
exporters and importers forced to move to other freight handlers
would come back to Hong Kong.
	   The cargo problems could also drive 30,000 small and
medium-sized firms _ about 10 percent of the total in Hong Kong _
out of business in the next few months, pushing the unemployment
rate to a high of 6.0 percent in the third quarter of this year,
DBS said.
	   Its unemployment forecast for the whole year is 5 percent.
	   Secretary for Trade and Industry Brian Chau said Thursday that
the cargo limitations were unfair to small and medium businesses,
the backbone of Hong Kong's once-robust economy, especially at a
time when it is slipping into recession.
	   Hong Kong officials have sought China's assistance for airlines
to use Huangtian airport in the bordering mainland city of
Shenzhen. Officials said Huangtian could handle up to 30 percent of
the territory's usual cargo. Some airlines also have been using the
airport in the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau.

Three Philippine Airlines unions threaten joint strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with PAL to ask for more time to work out
rehabilitation plan in grafs 15-18

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The three unions at financially
troubled Philippine Airlines threatened Friday to call a joint
strike to protest massive layoffs.
	   The unions also called for a boycott of products made by
companies owned by PAL majority owner Lucio Tan, who has interests
in banking, beer and tobacco.
	   The Philippines' three largest labor federations said they would
also call a one-day nationwide general strike in sympathy with the
PAL unions if they walk out.
	   PAL union leaders did not set a date for the threatened joint
strike.
	   ``It will just happen,'' said Alex Barrientos, president of the
PAL Employees Association, the ground crew union.
	   Barrientos' union filed a strike notice after the company served
termination papers to 5,000 of its more than 13,000 workers, but
the labor department has assumed jurisdiction over the dispute,
effectively blocking a strike or further layoffs by the company.
	   Radical labor groups, however, have urged the union to go ahead
with strike plans.
	   Conciliation talks between the airline and the union failed on
Tuesday.
	   Airline officials say a strike by the 5,000-member union could
force Asia's oldest airline to shut down after 57 years of
operation.
	   President Joseph Estrada said a closure of the flag carrier
would cause embarrassment to the country and urged the labor
department to try to settle the labor dispute within two weeks.
	   PAL's 625 pilots went on strike for 22 days last month,
aggravating financial losses caused by Asia's currency crisis and
setting back an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program.
	   The airline fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a
government return-to-work order.
	   PAL says it is in a precarious condition with assets totaling 90
billion pesos (dlrs 2.1 billion) and financial obligations
amounting to 85 billion pesos (dlrs 2 billion).
	   PAL officials say they are seeking foreign investors to help
form break-off companies to handle some of the airline's major
operations.
	   The move is part of a rehabilitation plan being prepared to save
the airline from collapse.
	   PAL's chief finance officer, Jaime Bautista, said the airline
will ask Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission next week for
more time to work out the rehabilitation plan.
	   The commission gave the airline until July 23 to devise a
program.
	   Bautista, a member of the five-man board tasked to draw up the
plan, told reporters the group needs more time to detail the
program, which broadly calls for a downsizing of the airline and a
restructuring of debts.
	   He said another 30-day extension would be sought.

Government slaps dlrs 100 fee on Seychelles arrivals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ The government has slapped a dlrs
100 tax on all tourists and other non-Seychelles passport holders
arriving in this Indian Ocean archipelago whose principal source of
income is tourism.
	   In a statement Wednesday, the Ministry of Finance said funds
raised through the tax would be used to protect the environment of
the granitic and coral islands that make up the achipelago spread
out over 1,040,000 sq. kms. (400,000 sq. mi.).
	   Taxpayers are entitled to a gold card that allows them free
entry into such places as the Vallee de Mai on Praslin Island,
which 19th century British military officier Gen. Charles Gordon
thought could have been the original Garden of Eden.
	   Seychelles passport holders are now required to pay a 500 rupee
(dlrs 100) departure tax when they leave via the international
airport on Mahe, the largest island. The previous departure tax was
100 rupees (dlrs 20).
	   The Finance Ministry said the tax was raised to pay for
improvements to the airport.
	   Last year, 100,000 tourists produced dlrs 100 million in revenue
for the Seychelles.
	   Preliminary figures for this year indicate that the number of
tourists held steady through May but began to decline in June and
July. The majority of tourists to the Seychelles come from France,
and it is believed many stayed home to watch the month-long soccer
World Cup that ended July 12.

Ukrainian, German and Russian experts work out proposals for new
</HEADLINE>
plane &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Experts from the Ukrainian-Russian STS
consortium and Germany's Daimler Benz Aerospace company (DASA) have
started work on technical proposals for an international tender on
a new military cargo plane, officials said Friday.
	   A delegation of STS experts left for Germany on Thursday for the
first in a series of meetings, said Dmytro Kyva, chief builder at
Ukraine's Antonov aviation design bureau.
	   STS, or Medium Transport Plane, and DASA are looking into the
possibility of adapting the new Ukrainian An-70 aircraft and plan
to work out joint proposals by the end of the year, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   The tender for a new military transport aircraft was announced
in June by Germany, France, Britain and Italy, who will take
proposals until 2000.
	   Those expected to take part besides STS and DASA are members of
Europe's Future Large Aircraft program and British and U.S.
producers with their new version of C-130 aircraft.
	   The STS consortium includes the Antonov bureau, the Ukrainian
plants Aviant and Motor-Sich and the Progress company, and Russia's
Aviakor, located in the Volga River city of Samara, Interfax said.
	   Prototypes of the An-70 are already flying. The An-70 can carry
up to 47 metric tons (51.7 short tons) of cargo or 300 armed
soldiers, and it can use relatively short runways.

Red Cross says Chinese flood victims need food, medicine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Some of the worst summer flooding on record has
left hundreds of thousands of Chinese families living in flimsy
shelters with little food and drinking water, the Red Cross said
Friday.
	   Flood waters remain so high in southern Jiangxi province boats
are needed for travel, while in neighboring Fujian, receding waters
uncovered homes crushed by flooding, said Red Cross experts sent to
assess the damage.
	   In one area, the experts found families living atop dikes in
shelters made from straw and plastic bags. Their crops, nearly
ready for harvest, were inundated.
	   ``They basically lack everything. Hopes were washed away,'' said
Helge Kvam, a team member based in Geneva for the Red Cross.
``People sought refuge in the mountains or on dikes, but they
couldn't take food or belongings.''
	   Clean water is hard to find, and colds, respiratory infections
and other minor illnesses are spreading, said Kvam who arrived in
Beijing from southern China Friday.
	   China's Civil Affairs Ministry estimated Thursday that the
seasonal flooding has killed 760 people and caused more than 47
billion yuan (dlrs 5.6 billion) in economic losses across 13
provinces and regions.
	   The Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies has already disbursed dlrs 167,000 in emergency
funds and is drafting a worldwide appeal for dlrs 4 million to buy
food, medicine and water purification supplies.
	   Aid would go to the worst-off families in the five worst-hit
areas _ Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, Hunan and Sichuan. The aid will
be distributed by the Red Cross' China chapter, which has relief
teams already operating in the disaster area.
	   Although seasonal floods afflict much of China every summer,
rains began earlier and have been heavier than usual. In some
Jiangxi counties, the floods were the worst on record and in Fujian
waters had not been so high in 150 years, the Red Cross said.
	   ``This year's floods have been extraordinarily violent,'' said
Kvam. ``They came suddenly and the waters rose quickly.''
	   Kvam said damage to villages in Fujian where flooding has
receded reminded him of the destruction he saw visiting north China
communities devastated by an earthquake in January. Video footage
he provided showed people digging through a crush of boulders and
beams where their homes once stood.
	   ``They are poor people who didn't have much and now they have
even less of the little they had,'' said Kvam.

Slovenian prime minister says country ready for EU within three
</HEADLINE>
years &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Slovenia will be ready to enter the
European Union within three years despite the slow pace of
privatization, the country's prime minister was quoted Friday.
	   ``Slovenia is already now integrated in the European economy,''
Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek was quoted as saying in Friday's
edition of the newspaper Die Presse. ``Slovenia would simply bring
along no problems to the EU, neither in agriculture or other''
areas.
	   In the interview, Drnovsek admitted that the former Yugoslav
republic has still not enacted much of the body of existing EU law
and has yet to liberalize its financial sector.
	   ``We still need about three years,'' Drnovsek said. ``However,
within three years, we would be ready to enter the market.''
	   Despite the slow pace of privatization in the business and
financial sectors, Drnovsek insisted that the process is moving
forward.
	   He said Slovenia has just completed the privatization of
``socially owned companies.''
	   But the government has not moved in the fields of energy and
railways. Drnovsek said EU accession may be subject to a
referendum.

Indonesian military chief warns looters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Indonesia-Suharto's Ranch; Single names for
Suharto and Wiranto are correct

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military chief Friday
ordered his troops to crack down on looters after mobs raided farms
and plantations.
	   Disputes over land ownership have also flared recently,
including one between a group of disgruntled villagers and
ex-President Suharto over a cattle ranch.
	   Poor farmers have also tried to take back land now used as a
golf course near Jakarta.
	   ``The government will not tolerate looting or the taking of
others land because this is against the law,'' said military
commander Gen. Wiranto, who is also defense minister. ``I have
ordered the security forces throughout the country to anticipate
and prevent this kind of action from happening.
	   ``I ordered them to take action and to arrest those involved,''
he said.
	   Lawlessness has increased after a wave of riots and protests in
May helped force Suharto to quit after 32 years in power.
	   Crime has been exacerbated by the worst economic crisis in 30
years, which has resulted in soaring inflation, mass unemployment
and growing poverty.
	   ``Although the country is dealing with an economic crisis and
even if people are hungry, no one should do just what they want and
take the property of others by force,'' Wiranto said.
	   On Wednesday police fired warning shots to stop a crowd from
stealing thousands of dollars worth of shrimp from fish ponds near
Jakarta.
	   Earlier mobs stripped valuable coffee beans from hundreds of
trees in poorly guarded plantations in the eastern part of the main
island of Java.
	   Hundreds of villagers plan to sue ex-President Suharto for
allegedly seizing their land and building a prestigious cattle
ranch there in the 1970s, The Jakarta Post reported Friday.
	   Over recent weeks villagers have clashed with security guards at
the ranch.
	   The villagers claim 300 hectares (740 acres) of Suharto's
700-hectare (1,730-acre) Tri-S Tapos ranch belongs to 500 people in
Cibedug village, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The ranch sits in lush, hilly country and is considered one of
Indonesia's foremost cattle breeding and producing ranches.
	   They said they had farmed the land for many years before they
were pushed out with no compensation.
	   Suharto has not commented on their claims.

Rubin urges Kenya to combat corruption, spur growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
Friday urged Kenya to combat corruption and get its economy back on
track.
	   In an address to the Kenyan School For Monetary Studies, Rubin
said Kenya's reforms have slowed along with its economy.
	   ``The challenge for Kenya is to get back on track toward strong
growth and higher standards of living for its people,'' Rubin said.
	   To attract foreign investment, he said developing countries need
sound macroeconomic policies, a strong financial system, open
markets and good governments.
	   Corruption, which Rubin said could not be discussed until
recently, is ``very much an economic issue,'' he added.
	   ``Corruption exists everywhere, but corruption is especially
troubling in developing countries'' where it diverts scarce
resources, Rubin noted. ``In short, corruption benefits the few and
hurts the many.''
	   Foreign investors are deterred from countries with high levels
of corruption, he added.
	   Kenya had success previously in attracting foreign capital,
producing growth of nearly 5 percent in 1995. Rubin said that
should have allowed the country to work toward even higher growth
``but instead, Kenya is now going in the opposite direction.
Foreign direct investment has declined and growth has slowed.''
	   Earlier this week the Central Bank of Kenya put the current
growth rate at around 1.9 percent.
	   To combat corruption and and attract investment, Rubin said
developing countries need clear laws and regulations that are
fairly and easily enforced, honest, well trained regulators and
judges, and anti-corruption units with real power to crack down on
corrupt practices.
	   Privatizing state-owned enterprises also reduces opportunities
for corruption, Rubin said, noting that corruption has declined
significantly in former Communist countries that have privatized
businesses previously run by the government.
	   Well-regulated financial systems where credit isn't allocated
based on connections and efficient public service also are
essential in Rubin's view.
	   While none of that is easy, Rubin said developing countries of
Africa can't turn away from the struggle, saying ``the politics of
reform must keep pace with the policies of reform.''
	   Rubin's remarks followed his meeting with Kenyan President Moi.
He was scheduled to meet with East African central bankers and
finance ministers later Friday before concluding his week-long
African trip that also included stops in Ivory Coast, South Africa,
Namibia and Mozambique.

Australia scores two wins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia scored two wins on the
opening day of the Super Max 8s cricket tournament Friday to
strengthen their bid for a hat-trick of titles.
	   Australia, champions in 1996 and 1997, humiliated Pakistan by
six wickets, scoring 106 for one to Pakistan's 102 all out, the
national news agency Bernama reported.
	   In their second match, the Aussies beat India by four wickets
scoring 126 for 4 to India's 124 for 4.
	   In other matches of the eight-a-side tournament, New Zealand
beat South Africa by one wicket. South Africa scored 126 in their
14 overs. New Zealand passed the score of the last ball for a total
of 128.
	   In the last match, South Africa beat Pakistan with two balls to
spare. Pakistan scored 119 and South Africa replied with 120 for
four wickets.
	   The Indian innings was boosted by skipper Robin Singh who hit
three fours including a double boundary and three sixes including a
double six in his 68 not out in 34 balls.
	   The Indians appeared to be in full control when Singh and Ajay
Jadeja were together. But when Jadeja left with the score at 106
for 35, the innings fell apart.
	   The Indians were tied down by tight bowling especially in the
final over when they scored a paltry single.
	   In reply, the Aussies chalked up 146 for four wickets with Ricky
Ponting top-scoring with an unbeaten 57 off 37 balls. He hit five
fours and two sixes.
	   In their game against Pakistan, wicketkeeper and captain Adam
Gilchrist starred with three catches. He later went on to score an
unbeaten 36 in the Australian innings, finishing with three mighty
sixes off successive balls to seal the match.
	   His first wicket partnership with Greg Blewett (65) produced 82
runs in 1.2 overs to spark the Aussies to a convincing victory.
	   Blewett was in great form, hitting five boundaries, two sixes
and one ``max six'' which counts for 12 runs. Shots hit into the
``max zone,'' or boundaries behind both ends of the wicket, count
as a double six.
	   Zahid Fazal batted best for Pakistan with 30 which included two
fours and a six. But generally the Pakistanis found runs hard to
get because of the tight Australian fielding.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended the week higher
Friday, with the key index in Bangkok surging 4.7 percent on the
back of a record rally overnight on Wall Street. Bucking the trend
was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where share prices fell after four
straight days of advances. Thai shares rose sharply because the
rally on Wall Street triggered buying by foreign investors, dealers
said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday rose 93.72
points to 9,328.19, closing above 9,300 for the first time. The
Stock Exchange of Thailand index surged 13.27 points to close at
295.28. Malaysian share prices also closed sharply higher on an
influx of overseas orders. Dealers said foreign investors were
buying blue-chip stocks as the region's currencies stabilize amid
hopes for more decisive political leadership in Japan. (ASIAN
MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Five years after a bitter trade dispute ended with
Japan reluctantly bowing to American demands to open its rice
market, Japanese farmers plan to start exports to a promising new
market _ the United States. ``Rice consumption in Japan has peaked
so we're interested in finding new outlets to expand sales,''
Daisuke Shindo of Japan's Central Union of Agricultural
Cooperatives, told The Associated Press Friday. The cooperative,
once a staunch opponent of freer rice trade, formally approved a
plan Thursday to sell one-pound (453 gram) bags of its rice through
San Francisco-based retailer Williams-Sonoma. It marks the first
such large-scale rice exporting campaign orchestrated by a national
farm group in Japan. Most of the Japanese-style rice now sold in
the United States for use in dishes such as sushi is produced in
California. (JAPAN-US-RICE)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's economic growth slowed during the first
half of the year, but in a region of shattered financial systems,
its economy shows remarkable health, economists said Friday.
Buffeted by weakened trading partners and their devalued
currencies, China's economy grew by a lower than targeted 7 percent
in the first six months of 1998, the State Statistical Bureau
reported Friday. Lower growth is expected to put pressure on
Premier Zhu Rongji and his four-month-old Cabinet to slow down a
painful restructuring of state industries that is cutting millions
of workers from state payrolls. Despite the dim economic report and
the higher political pressures, China looks robust compared to the
anemic and shrinking economies of many Asian countries, economists
said. (CHINA-ECONOMY)
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Defense giant Lockheed Martin called off its
dlrs 8.3 billion deal to buy Northrop Grumman Corp. because of
government opposition. It was the biggest merger proposal ever
challenged by the U.S. government. Thursday's announcement came
just hours after the Pentagon said that it was unable to work out
an agreement with Lockheed Martin to modify the deal and that it
would press on with a lawsuit it filed in March to block the
merger. ``Continuing the litigation at this point is simply not in
the best interests of Lockheed Martin's customers, shareholders or
employees,'' Vance Coffman, Lockheed Martin chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement. He said it was ``regrettable'' that
the merger did not go through, but he added that the two companies
plan to continue cooperating. The Pentagon and Justice Department
had argued that the combination of the two aerospace giants would
reduce competition in areas such as electronics and missile warning
systems. The case had been scheduled to go to trial Sept. 8.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Britain's Commonwealth Development
Corporation said Friday it plans to double its capital investment
in Thailand to dlrs 200 million over the next few years despite
gloomy economic forecasts for the region. Chief Executive Roy
Reynolds, in Asia to promote the work of the British government's
development finance institution, told reporters he believes
continued foreign investment in the region is the key to economic
recovery. ``While Asia's current economic climate has seen many
investors turn their backs on countries such as Thailand, CDC is
looking forward,'' Reynolds said. CDC now invests dlrs 110 million
in small- and medium-sized Thai businesses ranging from
manufacturing concerns to agriculture and service industries.

Chirac discusses joint peace efforts with Assad

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ There will never be peace in the Middle East
without active Syrian involvement _ and France wants to be
involved, too, President Jacques Chirac said Friday after talks
with Hafez Assad.
	   ``Our concern is peace,'' Chirac said after meeting the Syrian
president for a second time, terming the talks ``very positive.''
Assad is on an extremely rare visit to the West.
	   On another, more sticky issue for the two nations, Assad told
Chirac Friday that ``to his knowledge,'' Alois Brunner _ one of the
world's most-wanted Nazi war criminals _ is not in Syria, the
French president's spokeswoman said.
	   Brunner, a top Nazi operative who once was commandant of the
squalid French transit camp at Drancy, is the subject of a French
judicial investigation. Chirac asked that Syria finally respond
officially to the French investigation, and Assad said he would
``examine the issue,'' said French spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
	   Brunner has long been believed to be hiding out in Syria.
	   Leaving a second round of talks with the Syrian leader, Chirac
made clear the importance he places on Syria's role in the peace
process _ and how he wants France to have a role, too.
	   ``We know very well that there won't be peace in the region
without the active participation of Syria,'' Chirac said.
	   ``Consequently, we want to combine our efforts, France and
Syria, to attain our objective.''
	   He was referring to the objective of Mideast peace, but it's
also clear that France wants to be a player in the peace process,
and to counter-balance the heavy weight of the United States.
	   Assad, too, seeks a partnership with another country that would
balance Israel's alliance with Washington.
	   Standing beside Chirac, he praised the efforts of ``France and
other countries'' toward peace, but said that up to now, ``they
haven't borne fruit.''
	   Asked about the French-Egyptian idea of an international peace
conference to relaunch the process, Assad said that ``Up until now,
there is nothing concrete.''
	   ``If there is a peaceful initiative Syria will be present, but
it has to be in accord with our fundamental demands,'' he said.
Assad refuses to negotiate with Israel unless it returns the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
	   It's been 22 years since Assad visited France, and he's been to
the West only a couple of times in the past decade. So it must have
felt good to get the red-carpet treatment at Chirac's elegant
Elysee Palace.
	   Leaving the palace Thursday for a quick rest after the first
round of presidential talks, Assad was feted by a band of the
Republican Guard, in their golden helmets with long red plumes. The
minute he left, women in flowing gowns began arriving for a state
dinner in his honor.
	   The first round of talks went on for two hours and 40 minutes _
considerably longer than expected.
	   While reiterating his support for American mediation, Chirac
said it was necessary to consider what to do ``in case the current
efforts halt,'' said Colonna.
	   The United States has accused Syria of sponsoring international
terrorism, a charge that Damascus denies.
	   France has special leverage with Syria, partly because the Arab
nation was once a French-mandated territory, from 1920-1946.
	   Among Arab nations, there is a growing interest in greater
European diplomacy. French intervention in the region has
occasionally advanced the process where American policy failed.

Number of intestinal diseases up in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The number of intestinal disease cases
increased by 30 percent in Ukraine in the first half of 1998
compared to the same period last year, a senior health official
said Friday.
	   So far this year, 25 outbreaks of intestinal disease were
registered in 14 regions of Ukraine, comparable to the figure for
all of 1997, said Irina Kozlova, chief sanitary medic of the
capital Kiev.
	   In the most threatening development this summer, three family
members carrying the cholera bacteria and 28 people who came in
contact with them were hospitalized in the eastern city of
Mariupol. No actual cholera cases were reported.
	   Kozlova gave no total for intestinal disease cases, but
attributed the high number of such ailments to poor quality of
products purchased at outdoor markets not controlled by health
authorities, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   She said 80 percent of the infections were passed along by meat,
milk and other products bought at the markets, which attract many
Ukrainians because of relatively cheap prices.

Congolese officials welcome U.N. decision on prosecutions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese officials have welcomed a U.N.
Security Council decision calling on them to prosecute their own
citizens for alleged massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees during the
1996-1997 rebellion.
	   ``The U.N. has returned to reason,'' Foreign Minister Bizima
Karaha told a Kinshasa radio station Thursday.
	   The Congolese have long resented U.N. involvement in the inquiry
into the death of the refugees, and repeatedly stymied a U.N. team
that tried to investigate the deaths.
	   Rwandan Tutsis who fought for President Laurent Kabila are
accused of killing the refugees to retaliate for the 1994 genocide
of more than 500,000 Tutsis by Hutus in Rwanda. The refugees were
Rwandan Hutus who had fled their homeland to escape punishment for
the Hutu-orchestrated slaughter in that country.
	   Kabila's forces ended their swing across Zaire in May 1997,
ousting Zaire's longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, and renaming
the country Congo.
	   Kabila denies his forces targeted refugees, but has acknowledged
that some Rwandan Hutus, armed by Mobutu to fight the rebels, may
have been killed in battle along with women and children they hid
among.
	   A statement endorsed Monday by the Security Council called on
Rwanda and Congo to use their own judicial systems to prosecute
suspects. It made no mention of suggestions by U.N. rights
investigators that an international tribunal prosecute the crimes
if Congo and Rwanda are unable or unwilling to do so.
	   But the council, apparently aware of this possibility, said it
was ready to consider ``additional steps to ensure that the
perpetrators of the massacres, other atrocities and violations of
international humanitarian law are brought to justice.''
	   The tribunal recommendation was made in a report by the U.N.
team. The group was withdrawn from Congo in April, when the world
body said their work had been made impossible by a ``total absence
of cooperation'' from Congolese authorities.
	   Though incomplete because of the aborted mission, the U.N.
report gave evidence of Rwandan involvement in the massacres of
hundreds of unarmed civilians by troops loyal to Kabila. It also
documented Congolese government attempts to cover up the massacres.
	   Congo strongly rejected the findings of that report, raising
questions about whether their courts had the ability or the
political will to prosecute the crimes.

Government announces measures to protect blood supplies from CJD
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government announces new measures, edits, changes
overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government said Friday it is introducing new
safety measures to reduce the risk of spreading the human form of
``mad cow disease'' through blood transfusions.
	   The Department of Health said its advisers have concluded it
should implement the blood purification system known as
leukodepletion, which involves removing white blood cells from
donated blood. Experts believe the white blood cells carry the
human brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   The Times newspaper reported Friday that the government's
Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Group concluded after studying a
series of reports that it is currently impossible to guarantee that
blood transfusions are safe.
	   The Times said three of the 25 known British victims of the
brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were blood donors, although
it is not known if they were carrying the disease when they gave
blood. All three have since died.
	   Geoffrey Almond, a member of the advisory committee, said Friday
that there is currently a ``theoretical risk of blood from patients
who might be incubating'' the disease.
	   ``But that doesn't mean that the risk is substantial. It may be
tiny,'' he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio before the
government's announcement. He added that the risk must be weighed
against the risk of patients dying if they did not get blood
transfusions.
	   The advisory group did not favor a ban on the transfusion of
British blood, Almond said.
	   Dr. Stephen Dealler, a microbiologist and expert on BSE, told
the BBC that scientists do not know exactly how many people could
be infected.
	   ``But the numbers could be quite high and this is where the
worry comes in about perhaps one in every 250 blood donors being
infected,'' he said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a bid to pull the economy out of its prolonged
slump, Japan's chief economic agency called on Japan Inc. Friday to
boost productivity by scrapping cherished practices such as
lifetime employment.
	   The recommendation came in an unusually blunt assessment of the
economy compiled by the Economic Planning Agency, which also urged
the government to carry out further deregulation and major
financial and tax reforms.
	   ``Japanese corporations are now suffering from system fatigue,''
said Akira Furukawa, director of the EPA's domestic economy
research bureau, ahead of the release of the annual economic
report.
	   Citing a long-term downturn in industrial labor productivity,
the agency stressed the need to give companies more flexibility
over hiring and firing, but also for increasing the boardroom's
accountability to shareholders.
	   Traditional practices such as seniority-based promotion and cozy
corporate ties between related firms are not suited for promoting
growth in important new fields such as software development, the
report said.
	   ``Japanese business relationships based on long-term, implicit
contracts functioned well in an age when the advance consensus
could be secured among parties concerned,'' it said.
	   The agency also said, however, that some traditional elements of
the current system remain appropriate in the manufacturing sector.
	   The EPA report marks an abrupt departure from last year's
``white paper'' on the economy, which had confidently stated Japan
was on track for solid recovery and that injections of public
spending were no longer needed.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said
Friday predictions that Australia is sliding into recession are
``too gloomy'' and that the government's economic forecasts have
not been revised lower.
	   In newspaper reports Friday, economic forecaster Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet warned that economic growth in Australia will be weaker
than at any time in the past two years, and that there's a 50
percent chance of the country going into recession.
	   ``I think that's too gloomy, but we are obviously being affected
by the Asian downturn,'' Howard said in a radio interview.
	   The government hasn't revised its economic growth forecasts,
though the possibility of a revision is always open, he said.
	   Howard said he hasn't decided when the next federal election
will be held. He said the government would release its tax reform
package soon.
	   The unveiling of the tax package is thought to be the precursor
to national elections, due by May 1999 but which could be called at
any time.
	   ``I don't know when the election is going to be,'' Howard said.
``We're going to release the tax policy soon, and we'll spend a lot
of time explaining that to the Australian public.''
	   The tax package is widely expected to include a broad-based
consumption tax.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine trade deficit shrank
dramatically in the first five months of 1998, reflecting an
economic slowdown caused by Asia's financial crisis, analysts said
Friday.
	   The trade deficit narrowed 66.1 percent to dlrs 1.60 billion in
the January to May period from dlrs 4.73 billion a year earlier,
the government announced Friday.
	   For May alone, the trade deficit narrowed 78.5 percent to dlrs
209 million from dlrs 971 million in the same month a year earlier.
	   Economists expect the deficit will narrow further as imports
continue to contract because of a slowdown in economic activity
caused by the regional financial crisis.
	   ``The economy is grinding to a halt,'' said Edgar Bancod,
analyst for Paribas Asia Equity Securities Inc.
	   A combination of the regional crisis and a prolonged drought
attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon, which caused a steep
drop in agricultural production, is expected to result in economic
growth slowing to 2.5 percent or less in 1998 from 5.8 percent in
1997.
	   The Philippines' trade deficit has been narrowing since last
October. The weak peso, which has fallen by about 36 percent
against the dollar in the past year, has caused the cost of many
imported goods to rise.
	   Exports in the first five months of 1998 rose 20.3 percent to
dlrs 11.51 billion, while imports fell 8.2 percent to dlrs 13.18
billion.
	   Imports of capital goods such as factory equipment, which
accounted for nearly 40 percent of total imports, fell 9.1 percent
in May from the year-ago month, while imports of consumer goods
fell 29.2 percent.
	   The latest trade figures support analysts' projections that the
trade deficit this year will be considerably lower than 1997's
deficit of dlrs 11.1 billion.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 5,000 workers lost their jobs
when one of Thailand's largest textile manufacturers shut down its
factory because of financial problems, union leaders said Friday.
	   Thai Melon Textile Company informed workers Thursday that the
company was ceasing production because it no longer had money to
buy raw materials and banks refused to lend it money.
	   Thailand is battling its worst economic crisis in modern times.
Profligate lending by banks and finance companies left many on
shaky ground and with little liquidity to lend to even healthy
companies.
	   More than a million Thais have become unemployed since the
crisis began in July 1997.
	   Textiles are considered a sunset industry in Thailand because
rising wages have made production costs less competitive compared
with some other countries.
	   The devaluation of the Thai currency, the baht, however, has
given many garment and textile manufacturers a second life by
effectively reducing their production costs.
	   The liquidity crunch, however, has wiped out those gains from
some companies, including Thai Melon.
	   Union leaders and workers said they were concerned the company
would refuse to pay full severance because of its financial
problems.
	   Prasart said that more than 1,000 employees had worked for the
company more than 20 years, legally entitling them to 6.5 months
severance pay.

Georgia passes border law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's parliament passed a law on
Friday that makes the former Soviet republic fully responsible for
protecting its own borders.
	   Russian coast guard vessels will still patrol Georgian Black Sea
waters under agreements signed in 1994 to ease tensions between
Georgia and the breakaway Abkhazia republic, who fought a bloody
1992-93 war.
	   Russia will still monitor the border, and train Georgia's guards
so they can take over patrols fully in 1999.
	   Abkhazia opposes the switch because it would strengthen
Georgia's control over the republic's Black Sea banks, opposition
leaders say. They fear Georgia will block arms deliveries and
possibly hurt trade.
	   But Georgian leaders said on Thursday that vessels would not
patrol Abkhazia's border until an agreement with the region is
reached.

<TEXT>
	   The text of President Boris Yeltsin's speech at the burial
ceremony Friday for Russia's last czar and his family in St.
Petersburg, Russia:
	    &UR; ---
	   Dear fellow citizens,
	   It's a historical day for Russia. Eighty years have passed since
the slaying of the last Russian emperor and his family. We have
long been silent about this monstrous crime. We must say the truth,
the Yekaterinburg massacre has become one of the most shameful
pages of our history.
	   By burying the remains of innocent victims we want to expiate
the sins of our ancestors.
	   Guilty are those who committed this heinous crime, and those who
have been justifying it for decades, all of us.
	   We must not lie to ourselves, explaining this senseless cruelty
with political goals. The execution of the Romanov family was the
result of an irreconcilable split in Russian society. Its results
are felt to this day.
	   The burial of the remains of the Yekaterinburg (victims) is,
first of all, an act of human justice. It's a symbol of unity of
the nation, an expiation of common guilt.
	   We all bear responsibility for the historical memory of the
nation. And that's why I could not fail to come here. I must be
here as both an individual and the president.
	   I bow my head before the victims of the merciless slaying.
	   While building a new Russia, we must rely on its historical
experience.
	   Many glorious pages of Russian history are linked with the
Romanovs. But also connected with their name is one of the most
bitter lessons _ that any attempts to change life by violence are
doomed.
	   We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation irrespective of political and religious views and
ethnic origin.
	   This is our historical chance. On the eve of the third
millennium, we must do it for the sake of our generation and those
to come. Let's remember those innocent victims who have fallen to
hatred and violence. May they rest in peace.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Now, this is more like the British
Open.
	   Cold rain, then high winds returned to the coast of the Irish
Sea Friday, making life difficult for the players at Royal
Birkdale.
	   Fred Couples, a stroke behind Tiger Woods and John Huston
beginning the day, bogeyed four of the first nine holes to fall
back to par, while Davis Love III shot a 1-over-35 on the front
side then took a double bogey on No. 11 and dropped to par.
	   Loren Roberts, who began the day tied with Couples, bogeyed four
of the first 10 holes and also fell to par.
	   Players and fans bundled up in an assortment of colorful rain
gear and head coverings _ Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal wore a wool
hat pulled down low over his ears.
	   The wind then cleared away the rain clouds and picked up
strength as the day went on, sending scores skyrocketing.

Big bank seeks court protection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) Financial services group
Arab-Malaysian Corp. sought court protection Friday from its
creditors to enable it get the best price possible on its 43
percent stake in AMMB Holdings, the national news agency Bernama
reported.
	   Bernama said Arab-Malaysian Corp. hoped to get at least 800
million ringgit (dlrs 200 million) from the sale.
	   Earlier this week, it was reported that Fortis, the
Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group, had emerged as a new
foreign bidder seeking to acquire a stake in AMMB Holdings, which
is Malaysia's seventh largest financial group.
	   Company officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment,
although sources close to the deal said Malaysia's central bank had
given its permission for negotiations to get under way.
	   The move to seek protection indicates the extent to which
financial institutions are suffering from Malaysia's economic
deterioration.
	   Arab-Malaysian Corp. has debts of around 1.1 billion ringgit
(dlrs 250 million) resulting from the collapse in the country's
stock market, Bernama reported.
	   The agency said court protection was needed to provide the
company with sufficient time to sell its assets at a favorable
price and avoid a fire sale.
	   Arab-Malaysian Corp. is the third large company to seek court
protection from creditors in the past week after MBF Holdings and
Time Engineering.
	   Malaysia's gross domestic product contracted 1.8 percent in the
first quarter of 1998, compared with 6.9 percent growth in the
previous three months. Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim has conceded
that the country's economy could shrink by up to 2 percent this
year.

New Philippine government to resume peace talks with rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The government of new Philippine
President Joseph Estrada will soon resume peace talks with Muslim
and Communist rebels, a senior official said Friday.
	   Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the peace
negotiations will begin ``in a few weeks'' after Estrada approves a
list of government negotiators.
	   Talks with the rebel groups were suspended during the campaign
period for national elections in May, in which Estrada won an
overwhelming mandate to succeed President Fidel Ramos.
	   ``There is no question that the Estrada administration is
determined to pursue the peace process,'' Zamora said in a
statement.
	   On Thursday, Muslim rebels accused the Estrada government of
insincerity because of delays in the naming of new negotiators.
	   Al-haj Murad, vice chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, said Estrada ``appears to be reluctant to form the
government peace panel.''
	   Murad said the delay is the major cause of skirmishes in recent
weeks in the southern Philippines.
	   The MILF, which has been holding peace talks with the government
since last year, is the bigger of two Muslim groups still fighting
the government. The largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro National
Liberation Front, signed a peace pact in 1996.
	   Talks to end nearly three decades of communist insurgency were
initiated by Ramos in 1992 but have been postponed several times.
	   Estrada has said he wants to conclude the peace talks in 18
months.

Forest fires flare again in Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Greece (AP) _ Firefighters, soldiers and residents
joined forces Friday to battle blazes in parched forests in
southern Greece. Meanwhile, another blaze raced through areas in
the north.
	   Some of the fires are stubborn remnants of a wave of more than
180 blazes that scorched brush and woodlands earlier this month.
Officials blamed some of the fires on arson.
	   In southern Greece, two main fires have burned unchecked.
Fire-fighting planes, soldiers and residents have tried to control
the fires, which have so far not directly threatened any villages.
	   Near Kalavrita, about 300 kilometers (180 miles) southwest of
Athens, more than 40,000 acres (16,000 hectares) of forest have
been burned.
	   Outside Tripoli, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of
Athens, another blaze has consumed 20,000 acres (8,000 hectares).
	   In northern Greece, strong winds grounded fire-fighting planes
near Kavala, about 700 kilometers (435 miles) northeast of Athens,
where a forest fire burned out of control.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The government said Friday it is introducing new
safety measures to reduce the risk of spreading the human form of
``mad cow disease'' through blood transfusions.
	   The Department of Health said its advisers have concluded it
should implement the blood purification system known as
leukodepletion, which involves removing white blood cells from
donated blood. Experts believe the white blood cells carry the
human brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   ``Although the risks are still theoretical, it is better to be
safe than sorry,'' said Health Secretary Frank Dobson,. Dr. Jeremy
Metters, the government's deputy chief medical officer, said the
move was a ``purely precautionary measure.''
	   But The Times newspaper reported Friday that the government's
Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Group concluded after studying a
series of reports that it is currently impossible to guarantee that
blood transfusions are safe.

Kohl government denies quashing child poverty report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government Friday
rejected opposition charges that it is quashing a report on child
poverty until after Sept. 27 elections.
	   Family minister Claudia Nolte blamed the delay in publication on
the authors of the study, saying they handed it in six months late.
She called accusations of government meddling ``a malicious
twisting of the facts.''
	   But her ministry confirmed it would not present the report to
parliament in time for debate and official publication before the
election.
	   Excerpts from the study on the state of German children and
youth, drafted by a government-commissioned panel of experts, have
surfaced in German media.
	   Members of the panel believe the government is sitting on the
700-page survey because of fears that its criticism of poverty and
the situation of young foreigners would hurt Kohl's uphill
re-election campaign, according to the reports.
	   Kohl trails the opposition in opinion polls.
	   His spokesman swept aside the report's leaked conclusion that 22
percent of children in eastern Germany and 12 percent in the west
live in poverty.
	   ``In my opinion, there is no material poverty here'' because of
the government's social welfare spending, Otto Hauser told a news
conference Friday.
	   The government rejects the report's definition of poverty _
anyone who makes less than half the average German income _ as too
wide, Nolte said.
	   ``I call on the opposition finally to discuss poverty
seriously,'' she said. ``Whoever talks about mass poverty in our
country is distorting reality.''
	   But the main opposition party kept up its criticism.
	   ``If the government is withholding important information as a
means of election tactics, it is is acting ... irresponsibly,''
Social Democratic lawmaker Wolfgang Wodarg said Friday.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Snubbing the burial service for Czar Nicholas II,
the head of the Russian Orthodox Church held his own memorial
service on Friday for mourners who included a prominent claimant to
the throne.
	   It was yet another strange twist in the tangled saga of the last
Russian emperor. At the alternative service in the monastic town of
Sergiyev Posad, just north of Moscow, Patriarch Alexy II echoed
words being spoken by President Boris Yeltsin at the burial service
in St. Petersburg.
	   Alexy had long said he wouldn't take part in the burial, citing
doubts about the authenticity of the remains of Nicholas, his
family and servants.
	   Still, he agreed to hold a separate service to mourn the czar's
execution by a Bolshevik firing squad on July 17, 1918. Among those
who joined him were Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna Romanov and
her 17-year-old son, Georgy, whom she claims is heir to the throne
	   In the service at the Assumption Cathedral, Alexy once again
expressed doubts that the bones found in a pit near the Ural
Mountains city of Yekaterinburg were those of the czar and other
members of the royal family.
	   But, he added, requiems for Nicholas II and other victims of the
Communist rule were being recited in all Orthodox churches
throughout the nation on Friday to ``help reconciliation, peace and
accord that the people need so much.''
	   In words that rang eerily close to those spoken by Yeltsin in
St. Petersburg, he said: ``A long time has passed since this
heinous crime, but the people have a living memory of this lawless
act, feel their guilt and the need to repent.''
	   Despite elaborate DNA and other tests carried out in Britain,
United States and Russia which scientists believe have conclusively
proven the remains' authenticity, the church has refused to
recognize them and kept its role at the St. Petersburg burial to a
minimum.
	   A local priest officiated, and, when the remains of Nicholas II,
his wife, three daughters and four servants were placed in a crypt,
did not use their names, even though their name plaques were
already hanging on the walls of the chapel.
	   Apart from doubts of the remains' authenticity, the church's
reluctance apparently stems from its complicated relations with a
branch of Russian Orthodoxy set abroad after the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution.
	   The exiled church has canonized Nicholas II and would have been
deeply offended if the Russian Orthodox Church buried the royal
remains without treating them as those of a saint. The church in
Moscow isn't yet ready to decide on canonization.
	   Yeltsin, who wasn't planning to attend because of the church's
stance, changed his mind at the last minute and took part in the
burial ceremony. Alexy said Thursday he respected ``the moral
motives'' behind Yeltsin's decision.
	   Adding to the controversy within the church, there also has been
a rift among descendants of the royal Romanov family. Many of them
attended the funeral in St. Petersburg. But Maria and Georgy
Romanov, who live in Madrid, Spain, declined after being told they
were welcome as members of the Romanov family but not as claimants
to the throne.
	   Georgy's claim, supported by some monarchist groups inside
Russia, is spurned by other Romanovs and disputed by the
authoritative Almanac de Gotha on European royal families.

Ex-premier elected Parliament speaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Completing his political comeback,
former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus won a landslide victory Friday
in secret balloting for speaker of the Czech parliament.
	   Klaus got 137 votes in the 200-seat legislature, beating his
opponent Stanislav Volak with 39 votes. Two legislators were absent
and 22 votes were declared invalid, officials said.
	   Following the 1989 anti-Communist revolution, Klaus led the
Czech economic reform, based on swift privatization and
liberalization. He was also instrumental in the 1993 peaceful
breakup of the Czechoslovak federation.
	   As Czech economy bogged down last year, his government
collapsed. Klaus stepped down as premier in the fall of 1997 amid
accusations of illegal campaign financing.
	   His Civic Democratic Party broke up after the scandal with
anti-Klaus rebels forming the Freedom Union. Klaus' ratings
plummeted to an all time low of 9 percent in January.
	   In a remarkable comeback this year, his Civic Democratic Party
finished second in the June election, gaining 63 seats in
Parliament, losing only to Social Democrats with 74 seats.
	   His election as Parliament speaker was made possible due to
Klaus' power-sharing deal with Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman,
a move criticized by President Vaclav Havel and small parliamentary
parties fearing political obliteration.
	   Later Friday, Havel is expected to name Zeman prime minister. He
is then scheduled to officially appoint the country's one-party
minority cabinet on Wednesday.

Floods in India leave 56 dead, 100,000 homeless
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Four swollen rivers that overflowed in a
populous northern state this week have left 56 people dead and
about 100,000 homeless, an official said Friday.
	   As many as 1,671 villages in Uttar Pradesh state have been
inundated after the Rapti, Buri Rapti, Gandak and Sharda Rivers
overflowed after torrential rains, according to officials at the
state government's flood control and monitoring cell.
	   Rice paddy crop in about 66,000 hectares (163,000 acres) have
been destroyed and 275 cows, buffaloes and goats have been killed
so far, said Relief Department Secretary S.N. Shukla.
	   Shukla said the deaths occurred last week, many of them caused
by collapsing walls of the mud-and-thatch huts in which poor people
live.
	   By Friday, officials moved about 17,000 people to relief centers
in 10 mostly eastern districts.
	   Rain could raise the levels of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, the
two main rivers of northern India, officials said.
	   Floods are frequent in India, where houses and shops often
encroach on public land along the river banks. Environmentalists
also blame rising deforestation in the Himalayas for rising silting
of the rivers, which causes water to overflow.

Chinese ex-sex slave says her stress disorder continues
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In court testimony, a Chinese former sex slave
demanding compensation from the government said Friday that she
continues to suffer from stress-caused trauma from being raped by
Japanese soldiers during World War II.
	   Hou Qiang Lien, 70, is the latest to testify in lawsuits filed
by former sex slaves demanding official Japanese government apology
and compensation.
	   But she is among the first to detail in court the painful
symptoms of the psychological scars she has endured _ a problem her
lawyers believe many other former sex slaves also share.
	   ``Because of that experience, I became insane,'' Hou said in an
interview with The Associated Press, wiping tears. ``It destroyed
my life, and I was only left with pain and disability.''
	   Hou still has nightmare. When caught by surprise by a siren or a
stranger, she has seizures, she said.
	   ``I demand that the Japanese government apologize and pay
compensation for the suffering,'' Hou, who filed a lawsuit in 1995
with five other Chinese women, told the Tokyo District Court.
	   Historians say as many as 200,000 Asian women, euphemistically
called ``comfort women,'' were abducted as sex slaves for Japanese
soldiers.
	   Hou, a daughter of chief of a small village in Shanxi Province
in northern China, was abducted in April 1942, and confined with
five other young women in barracks.
	   There, she was repeatedly raped by Japanese soldiers for more
than a month until her mother paid money to win her release. She
was only 14 at that time.
	   Hou said she was bed-ridden for a year because of bleeding and
trauma-caused mental stress. She also lived with shame because
everyone in the small village knew what had happened to her.
	   Hou's lawyer Emiko Miki said that she brought up her client's
mental stress, hoping to prevent the court from using a statute of
limitations to dismiss her demands.
	   It was only in 1992 that the Japanese government admitted that
its wartime military was involved in setting up and running
front-line brothels.
	   No one knows for sure how many former sex slaves are still
alive. Many keep their past a secret out of shame.
	   In April, the Yamaguchi District Court ordered the Japanese
government to pay damages to three South Korean former sex slaves _
the first time a court supported former sex slaves' compensation
demands.
	   The government has appealed. But the ruling received widespread
attention because it appeared to refute claims by the Japanese
government that postwar treaties had settled all wartime claims.
	   Japan has paid some assistance to the women through a
privately-funded body. Most victims have refused to accept payments
from the fund, saying it allows Japan to avoid taking full
responsibility for its wartime actions.

Fire destroys large furniture store in Bahrain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A pre-dawn fire destroyed one of the
largest furniture showrooms in Bahrain Friday.
	   There were no injuries from the blaze at the four-story Bukanan
Furnishings. Thick clouds of smoke belched from the building even
12 hours after the fire broke out at about 2 a.m. local time (2300
gmt).
	   About a dozen fire engines tried to put out the fire, in the
main commercial area of Isa Town, nearly 15 kilometers (10 miles)
south of the capital, Manama.
	   Government officials said it was early to pin point the cause of
the fire. An investigation has started, they said.
	   Firemen at the scene, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the fire appeared to have been caused by an electrical short
circuit.
	   No other details were available.
	   Bahrain has in the past witnessed several arson attacks blamed
on Shiite Muslim activists campaigning for political and social
reforms. More than 40 people have been reportedly killed in the
violent campaign since December 1994.
	   Shiites form a slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens but
the Gulf state is ruled by the Al Khalifa family, which belongs to
the mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin and China's leader Jiang
Zemin are planning to meet in Moscow at the the end of August, the
Kremlin announced Friday.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang agreed to hold the informal ``without
jackets'' summit when the Russian president visited China last
November, presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov is expected to discuss plans
for the informal summit when he visits China on July 22, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Relations between the two nations have flourished in recent
years after decades of friction. Moscow sees the relationship as a
``strategic partnership'' that counterbalances what it describes as
U.S. attempts to dominate the world.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French soccer officials said Friday they will not
announce the successor to Aime Jacquet, the coach who led France to
World Cup glory, until next week.
	   The French Football Federation had been expected to name a new
coach Friday, but said that it wanted to hold further discussions
before making a decision.
	   Jacquet said early this year that he would leave the post after
the World Cup, no matter how France performed at the competition.
	   There are three main candidates for the job: Roger Lemerre,
Jacquet's assistant; Monaco coach Jean Tigana; and Auxerre coach
Guy Roux.
	   Lemerre is believed the favorite, especially among officials at
the federation. But some outsiders favor a more widely known
figure, such as Tigana.
	   The FFF did announce that Jacquet _ now a national hero _ will
take over the role of national technical director at the
federation.
	   Jacquet will replace Gerard Houllier, himself a former coach of
the French soccer team.
	   Houiller announced Thursday that he would become the joint
manager at English club Liverpool.

Britain switches stance and favors ban on dumping oil rigs at sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Friday it favors a ban on dumping old
oil rigs at sea, backing away from a stance that made it a European
pariah in the fight over oil giant Shell's plans to sink one
platform, the Brent Spar.
	   European officials meet next week to decide what to do about all
their obsolete offshore steel structures, notably oil equipment in
the North Sea. Britain and Norway had previously been the only two
nations seeking to retain the right to just dump the obsolete
platforms.
	   Environment Minister Michael Meacher announced Friday that
Britain had changed its mind, after consultation with experts who
suggested other ways of disposal are feasible.
	   ``This is not a climb-down,'' Energy Minister John Battle
insisted. ``We have always said `no more Brent Spars' and sought to
bring everything to shore where it is safe and practicable to do
so. This initiative goes much further.''
	   But Battle noted during a news briefing that the removal of all
the footings from the bottoms of oil platforms was a different
matter that should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
	   Getting rid of North Sea drilling equipment became a flashpoint
in 1995, when Greenpeace activists boarded the Brent Spar to
prevent Shell from sinking it in the North Atlantic.
	   Shell's plans, approved by the previous British government of
Prime Minister John Major, prompted environmental protests across
continental Europe, including some violent attacks on retail
service stations.
	   Shell ultimately backed down and towed the Brent Spar to a
Norwegian fjord, where it is still floating. The company now wants
to chop up the old Brent Spar vessel to make pillars for a
Norwegian ferry pier.
	   Greenpeace welcomed the British government's change of heart and
said it should pave the way for a better deal to be reached next
week when representatives of various nations meet in Sintra,
Portugal, just outside Lisbon.
	   ``It looks very promising,'' said Sarah Burton, campaign
director for Greenpeace U.K. ``Obviously, a great deal has changed
since the last government.''

Prodi wins support, if reluctant, from far left allies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi offered concessions to his
far-left allies Friday, gaining their support -- if lukewarm --
needed to win a vote of confidence in parliament next week.
	   Prodi set a new course for his government, focusing on aid to
the depressed south, tax breaks for businesses and a commitment for
a 35-hour work week by the end of the year.
	   The Communists almost caused the collapse of Prodi's center-left
government last month when they voted against him in parliament on
NATO expansion. This forced him to draft a new program with and
seek a vote of confidence. He needs the support of the Communist
Refoundation party for a majority in the lower house of parliament.
	   Communist leader Fausto Bertinotti was less than enthusiastic
after Prodi's speech, saying ``there is no change in direction in
favor of reform.''
	   But Bertinotti said the Communists would back Prodi in the
confidence votes, due separately in the Senate on Tuesday and in
the lower house on Wednesday.
	   In line with Communist requests, Prodi focused on the south of
Italy where unemployment is twice the national average of 12.5
percent. New funds amounting to 36 trillion lire (dlrs 20 billion)
would be spent over three years on aid to the economy, and are
expected to be spent chiefly in the south.
	   Prodi's government, in office since mid-1996, already has lasted
longer than most of the other 54 Italian governments since World
War II. Its mandate expires in 2001.

Quake Jolts Taiwan, kills at least three people

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A strong earthquake jolted Taiwan on
Friday, causing rock slides on a southern mountain that killed at
least four people and injured 19.
	   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.2, was felt
throughout Taiwan and on the coast of mainland China. It was
centered about 14 kilometers (8.5 miles) west of Alishan, known
also as Mount Ali, about 300 kilometers (180 miles) south of
Taipei.
	   A hotel in the town of Rweili on the scenic mountain suffered
serious cracks, injuring four of its staffers, said Mo Hwei-tsu,
head of the Taiwan Rescue Center. He said previous reports that the
hotel collapsed, trapping 10 people inside, were mistaken.
	   A landslide buried the exit of a tunnel, killing one person. A
driver was killed on a mountain road by a rockslide, and two people
were killed by falling rocks, the Rescue Center said.
	   Policeman Tseng Ta-lin said mountain roads were blocked and
bridges collapsed, and that helicopters had ferried about 10
injured people to hospitals. Rescuers were rushing to the mountain
areas where scores of tourists reportedly were trapped, he said.
	   TVBS television network quoted policeman Tsai Cheng-heng in
Rweili as saying police were checking a report that about 10 other
people were trapped in a teahouse near the hotel.
	   State radio said parts of a railroad also caved in and several
cars were damaged by falling power poles.
	   The quake was felt throughout Taiwan, but there were no
immediate reports of other damage. Reports said it was centered
only 500 meters (1,650 feet) underground, making the local impact
very strong.
	   On the Chinese mainland, 130 kilometers (78 miles) across the
Taiwan Strait, an official at the Fujian Provincial Seismological
Bureau said the quake ``was felt quite strongly along the
seaboard.'' The official, who refused to give his name, said damage
was unlikely.
	   Officials said there were about 120 minor aftershocks.
Earthquakes are frequent in Taiwan, but most of them are centered
deep under the sea and cause little damage.
	   Alishan, 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) high, is known for its
diverse terrain and variety of animal and plant life.
	   Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the total energy released
by an earthquake, as indicated by ground motion recorded on
seismographs. An increase of one digit in the scale represents a
tenfold increase in the strength of the quake.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area.
	   The Chinese official Xinhua News Agency said the quake was also
felt in coastal areas in China's eastern Zhejiang province.
	   Officials said this was the worst earthquake that hit southern
Taiwan since 1964 when a quake killed 106 people, injured 650 and
buried 10,500 homes.

India's election chief again seeks to keep criminals out of
</HEADLINE>
legislatures &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Four days after a lawmaker with a
criminal background allegedly walked into parliament with knives
and a pistol, India's election chief suggested Friday that the
government bar people suspected of crimes from running for office.
	   Lawmaker Anand Mohan, who has denied being armed, scuffled with
marshals who were ejecting him for unruly behavior Tuesday. The
Hindustan Times said doctors treating him for minor injuries
discovered the weapons.
	   Mohan once conducted a parliamentary campaign from prison and
went on to win. He has been linked to cases ranging from arson to
murder.
	   For years, the independent Election Commission has tried to keep
criminals and suspected criminals out of the legislature, with
limited success. Election chief M.S. Gill said the government
should bar even those charged by a judge but not yet convicted.
	   Under Indian law, police press charges and present evidence. A
judge formally charges only if he or she is persuaded there is
enough evidence to go to trial.
	   Gill's suggestions come as the government considers electoral
reforms ranging from state funding of elections to lowering the age
for candidates.
	   Gill also suggested speeding up the process for disqualifying
candidates guilty of campaign violations. Under current procedures,
it can take years before a candidate is punished for offenses
ranging from taking people to polling booths to paying for votes.
	   India's general elections are usually held once every five years
to choose members of a 545-member lower house of parliament.

Swiss banks say their offer stands despite reports of doubling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The two largest Swiss banks said Friday their
final offer to settle Holocaust claims in the United States remains
dlrs 600 million, despite reports that the amount could be doubled.
	   United Bank of Switzerland spokesman Christoph Meier in Basel
denied reports in the Financial Times of London and Germany's
Handelsblatt that the banks were considering doubling their offer.
	   Meier and Paul Rhyn, a Zurich-based spokesman for Credit Suisse
Group, said the banks' dlrs 600 million offer, made June 19, was
still valid and that there was no possibility of raising it.
	   That is ``the highest possible `rough justice' amount that can
be justified,'' Rhyn said, referring to the U.S.-sponsored efforts
to find a fair settlement based on estimates of what is owed from
Holocaust accounts.
	   Jewish groups say tens of thousands of Holocaust victims
deposited money in Swiss banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe.
But victims' relatives say bank officials stonewalled survivors and
their heirs after World War II.
	   Jewish leaders said the banks should be paying more than dlrs 1
billion.
	   The Financial Times, citing ``sources close to the
negotiations,'' said that after months of wrangling ``the World
Jewish Congress and some lawyers for Holocaust victims seem
prepared to reach a deal.''
	   The Duesseldorf-based daily Handelsblatt reported that the Swiss
banks ``apparently'' were ready to improve their offer. ``In
knowledgeable circles, a sum in the order of up to dlrs 1.2 billion
is being discussed,'' it said.
	   The Financial Times article said the latest proposal _ it did
not say which side made it _ was ``understood to be that the banks
should guarantee'' that a U.S.-led search would produce an
additional dlrs 600 million in dormant accounts that may have been
left by victims of the Nazis.
	   The proposed guarantee would be more than 10 times as much as
the dormant accounts already found by all Swiss banks, not just the
two largest involved in the New York-based negotiations.
	   There is no indication what proportion of the total sum found so
far _ 67 million Swiss francs (dlrs 46 million) _ is linked to
Holocaust victims.
	   An audit headed by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the U.S.
Federal Reserve, has employed a large team of international experts
to search every bank for dormant Holocaust-era accounts. There have
been no indications it they are finding any more funds.
	   Some U.S. cities and states have threatened to impose sanctions
on the two major banks _ which have extensive operations in the
United States _ if they do not agree an acceptable package of
compensation.

Goh: Singapore must press on with reforms to ride out crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Greater transparency and market discipline will
help Singapore ride out the regional crisis and emerge as one of
prime financial centers in Asia, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said
Friday.
	   ``The regional financial crisis had taught us that we must
proceed with caution, but we must press on with reforms to
strengthen and grow our financial sector,'' Goh said in a speech at
a local event.
	   Goh said Singapore must improve its foreign exchange and futures
trading and develop expertise in other financial areas like fund
management and private banking.
	   Adding that private sector ``must take the reins and move
forward,'' Goh urged local banks to prepare for the tougher
competitive environment. But he said the crisis will get worse
before it gets better.
	   The regional slump has also affected this rich island nation of
3.1. million, particularly in areas of trade, financial services,
tourism and transportation.
	   Goh in particular addressed the property market in Singapore,
which he said ``must reflect new economic realities'' and lower
property prices.

Unemployed Chinese worker detained in dissent crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead and UPDATES throughout with detention of
dissident worker; no pickup

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police detained a laid-off Chinese textile worker
for three days, apparently for organizing a discussion group on
China's domestic problems, a rights group reported Friday.
	   The detention of Feng Jianru comes amid one of the most
concerted police sweeps against China's beleaguered dissidents in
several years. In the past eight days, police have rounded up 10
democracy campaigners who tried to set up a political opposition
party.
	   Police took Feng from his home in southern Xiangtan city on
Tuesday, three days after he and 13 others met to discuss
``hot-button domestic issues,'' the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Police released Feng Friday morning. The Information Center did
not say what police questioned Feng about. While describing Feng
and his colleagues as dissidents, it did not elaborate on what they
discussed at their July 11 meeting.
	   Feng, however, spent three months in prison in the nationwide
crackdown that ended the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations
in 1989 and more recently was laid off from the Xiangtan Printing
and Dying Factory, the group said.
	   Mounting lay-offs from state industries and repeated outbursts
of worker unrest present one of the most worrisome challenges to
the ruling Communist Party. Chinese leaders are emphasizing the
need for stability as they engineer market-style reforms.
	   Since July 11, police in eastern Zhejiang province, 500
kilometers (300 miles) east of Xiangtan, have rounded up 10
dissidents who tried to organize and register the China Democracy
Party in a direct challenge to the Communist Party's political
monopoly.
	   Five are still in custody. Police on Thursday took books and
other personal effects from the home of one of those detained, Lin
Hui, and questioned the wife and mother of another, Zhu Yufu, the
Information Center said.
	   China Democracy Party organizers contend they were trying to
assert their legal rights and register the party as required by
law. Their detentions have drawn appeals from sympathizers in China
and abroad.
	   One hundred dissidents from across China petitioned President
Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji this week to release the five.
	   Exiled dissidents in Boston have called on the U.S. city's mayor
to halt all official visits and cultural and economic exchanges
with Hangzhou, the Zhejiang provincial capital, until the China
Democracy Party organizers are freed, the Information Center said.
	   The petition's 10 signers include many student leaders from the
1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, among them Wang Dan who
was released from a Chinese prison in April and now student at
Harvard University.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A moderate earthquake shook the Pacific
resort city of Acapulco on Friday morning, frightening tourists but
apparently causing no damage or injuries.
	   The 4.8-magnitude quake occurred at 6:20 a.m. (7:20 a.m. EDT)
and was centered along the coast of Guerrero state, west of Mexico
City, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Acapulco Fire Department Chief Lazaro Manuel Martinez and the
local Red Cross said there had been no immediate calls for
assistance.
	   The temblor was strong enough, however, to send Mexican and
foreign tourists toward the lower floors of their hotels for
safety, Notimex reported.

Kiriyenko says government austerity program to be introduced by

session. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said on
Friday that the government would act by decree to introduce its
austerity program after the parliament failed to approve many of
its segments.
	   The program, intended to boost the government's cash resources
amid financial crisis, included a series of bills that would bring
additional revenues totaling 102 billion rubles (dlrs 16.5
billion).
	   However, the parliament's lower house, the State Duma, has so
far approved bills that would bring only 28 billion rubles (dlrs
4.5 billion), Kiriyenko said in a speech before lawmakers.
	   And of those potential revenues, the federal budget is only
expected to receive 3 billion rubles (dlrs 483 million), with the
rest going to local budgets, he said.
	   During its session on Friday, the Duma rejected several bills
proposed by the government before recessing for a summer vacation
that is expected to last until the end of September,
	   ``Regrettably, we have failed to reach a comprehensive solution
on how to boost revenues,'' Kiriyenko said in a brief speech before
lawmakers. ``We can't stop with that and will now have to act
ourselves.''
	   He said that some bills turned down by the Duma will be
introduced by decree of President Boris Yeltsin while others could
be enacted by the cabinet in accordance with Russian law.
	   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have made it
clear they want the government austerity program passed before they
start delivering dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans this year and next
to help stabilize financial markets.
	   Communists and other hardliners dominating the Duma have balked
at fiscal steps proposed by the government, saying they would
further exacerbate the nation's social woes.
	   The Duma has passed some of the government's bills, including a
key measure introducing an additional 5-percent sales tax which was
approved on Thursday.
	   But on Friday, lawmakers rejected an income tax bill along with
a document which would cut various social payments for this year, a
measure to increase cash collection for the state insurance and
pension funds and several other fiscal initiatives.
	   Speaking before parliament, Kiriyenko proposed a new bill which
would give the government the right to unilaterally change the tax
rate.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the lawmakers to his
proposal.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said that the house might hold an
emergency session next month to discuss some of the government's
proposals.
	   Seleznyov lashed out at the government, saying that new foreign
loans would boost Russia's debt to a dangerous level.
	   The government has hailed an agreement with the IMF and other
lenders for new loans as a major success that would save Russian
financial markets from collapse.
	   Russia's economy, which seemed on the way to recovery last year,
shrank again this year because of Asian financial crisis, a drop in
world oil prices and other factors. Russia's gross domestic product
dropped by .5 percent in the first half of 1998 from the same
period last year.
	   The stock market has dropped by half so far this year, and the
Central Bank has been fighting off a ruble devaluation.

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters clashed with police
outside a Bombay theater Friday, forcing producers to call off
performances of a play demonstrators said glorified the gunman who
killed Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi.
	   The protest succeeded where the advice of the federal security
minister failed.
	   Producer Uday Dhurat had said he would go ahead with a Friday
afternoon performance of ``Nathuram Godse Speaks'' because he had
received no official word of a recommendation by Home Minister Lal
Krishna Advani that the play be shut down.
	   But after police battled protesters for more than an hour
outside the theater, State Minister of Culture Pramod Navalkar told
reporters he and Dhurat agreed to suspend the play indefinitely.
	   Navalkar, who had planned to see the play for the first time
Friday, said he would now read the script with Advani's
recommendation in mind before making a final decision on the future
of the play.
	   Police clubbed protesters as they shouting ``Down with Nathuram
Godse!'' and blocked the road outside the theater.
	   `It is up to me to make up my mind about a play,'' said Prakash
Patel, holding a ticket for Friday's performance. ``Gandhi will
always be a great person in India, despite any play.''
	   Gandhi, known as the mahatma or ``great soul,'' was assassinated
in 1948 by Godse, a Hindu nationalist. Godse was enraged by
Gandhi's overtures to Muslims after the partition of Britain's
Indian empire into predominately Hindu India and officially Islamic
Pakistan.
	   Playwright Pradeep Dalvi has told reporters his ``Nathuram Godse
Speaks'' was intended simply to give Godse's views, as well as
Gandhi's, a fair hearing. But newspapers said the play portrayed
Godse as a hero, prompting denunciations in the parliament
Thursday.
	   On Friday, Home Minister Advani told parliament he had advised
the Maharashtra chief minister, the state's top politician, to stop
the play.
	   ``The federal government strongly disapproves any denigration of
Mahatma Gandhi,'' said Advani, whose Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party leads a multiparty federal governing coalition. The
state government of Maharashtra is controlled by the BJP and its
more extremist partner the Shiv Sena.
	   Congress, the BJP's main opposition, had blocked performances of
``Nathuram Godse Speaks'' in 1986, when it controlled the state
government. Dalvi challenged Congress censors in court, but dropped
his case when the BJP-Shiv Sena government took over Maharashtra
and cleared the play.
	   Gandhi was an early leader of the Congress and is revered by
many Indians as the father of independent India. But Shiv Sena
leader Bal Thackeray has publicly ridiculed Gandhi.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ With the scent of incense hanging
in the air, Russia buried its last czar Friday in a somber ceremony
that Boris Yeltsin called an atonement for ``one of the most
shameful pages of our history.''
	   On the 80th anniversary of the executions of the Russian royal
family, nine wooden coffins with the bones of Czar Nicholas II, his
wife, daughters and servants were lowered into one large crypt
beneath the floor of the gilded, 18th-century, St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral.
	   ``We have long been silent about this monstrous crime,'' Yeltsin
said of the executions, carried out by Bolshevik revolutionaries at
the dawn of the communist era. ``Guilty are those who committed
this heinous crime, and those who have been justifying it for
decades, all of us.''
	   In a powerful speech, the Russian president said the burial
should serve as a catalyst for national reconciliation in a country
that's lurched from one upheaval to another during the 20th century
_ from revolution and civil war, to famine, political purges and
the collapse of the Soviet empire.
	   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation,'' Yeltsin said.
	   The burial was officiated by a dozen bearded priests in
gold-and-white robes, with one gently swinging a censer that sent
small puffs of burning incense wafting over the coffins.
	   Dozens of the czar's relatives, diplomats from 50 countries, and
Prince Michael of Kent, a member of the British royal family, which
is related to Russian royalty, stood and held lit candles at the
cathedral on the banks of the Neva River.
	   The czar's family members tossed white sand, representing the
earth, onto the coffins before the crypt was covered. Outside on
the river bank, cannons boomed in a 19-shot salute _ two shy of the
customary 21 because the czar abdicated a year before he was
killed.
	   ``We must tell the truth _ the (czar's) massacre has become one
of the most shameful pages of our history,'' Yeltsin said. ``By
burying the remains of the innocent victims we want to expiate the
sins of our ancestors.''
	   As the ceremony drew to a close, Yeltsin clasped the hands of
Nicholas Romanov, the most prominent of the czar's relatives at the
service, and they spoke briefly.
	   With its understated dignity, the burial was in sharp contrast
to the months of controversy that preceded it.
	   Many leading Russian figures, including the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church, skipped the service due to multiple disputes it
generated. Yeltsin was planning to stay away as well, but changed
his mind and announced Thursday he would participate.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917, the Romanov dynasty, and the nature of national guilt and
contrition.
	   The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but Russia has not
previously held any major, formal ceremonies dealing with the
abuses committed during communist times. Friday's service brought
the issue to the fore.
	   ``This is not just a funeral, but a national repentance,'' said
Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the world's leading conductors and
cellists, who was exiled during the Soviet era.
	   ``It shows the entire world that Russia is changing and becoming
more humane,'' he said on Russian television.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   But the burial also raised controversies. The Orthodox Church,
as well as some ordinary Russians, have questioned the authenticity
of the remains despite extensive DNA testing in the United States,
Russia and Britain.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony was
relatively simple. When the coffins were interred, the priest did
not use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques
were on the walls of the chapel.
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for three centuries. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
his wife, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   Nine of the 11 bodies were recovered in 1991 from a desolate
forest outside the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. Two
skeletons have never been found _ Alexei, the czar's only son and a
daughter that scientists believe was Maria. Most investigators
believe their bodies were burned to ashes by their killers.

Crass not class highlights Italian couture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIELA PETROFF &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The fall-winter Italian high fashion shows, which
ended with a gala event down the Spanish Steps, had everything to
do with show and very little with fashion.
	   Beautiful settings, extravagant parties and tanned celebrities
combined to recreate a ``Dolce Vita'' atmosphere, but failed to
make-up for the generally poor and sometimes crass quality of the
couture product.
	   G-strings and triangles, sequined condoms, and bared breasts may
be stylish in the brothel, but seemed out of place on what was once
the most aristocratic of runways.
	   According to retired French designer Hubert de Givenchy, who
dressed such symbols of good taste as Audrey Hepburn and Jacqueline
Kennedy, ``couture is becoming extinct.''
	   Givenchy was in town to present Irene Galitzine, the Russian
princess who set up shop in Rome in the 1950's, a special award for
her contribution to Italian fashion. He did that during the ``Donna
Sotto Le Stelle'' (Women Under the Stars) gala Thursday night.
	   Galitzine is credited with the invention of the palazzo pajama,
and was one of the hot labels during the ``Hollywood on the Tiber''
heyday in the 1960's.
	   Among the best of this weeks offerings were the elegant white
gowns in finely stiched white lace by Fausto Sarli, presented in
the romantic gardens of a downtown Roman palazzo, and the
sophisticated velvet gowns by Rafaella Curiel.
	   Their old world class accompanied by subdued music fit the
Spanish Steps background much better than the hip hop tunes and
contemporary styles chosen by many of the 30 Italian designers
during the gala.
	   The Spanish Steps was not the only setting used and abused.
	   Gattinoni sent his political message -- a gown all ripped up to
look like the roadwork going on all over Rome at the moment as the
city prepares for the Jubilee celebrations for 2000 -- in the
manicured gardens of the recently restored Borghese museum.
	   Gai Mattiolo instead sent his red and black gowned devils down
the Renaissance Bridge of the Angels with its pure white marble
winged statues. The bridge crosses the Tiber near St. Peter's
Square.
	   But if the setting was heavenly, and the styles hellish, the
result lingered in purgatory. The bright boy of the Roman runway
missed the mark this round, loading his heavy velvet gowns with
tons of fringes, sequins and unnecessary detailing like a beaded
bondage chain, and hands trapped in leather sleeves, a jab at
Italy's corruption scandals.
	   Honorable mention goes to Andre Laug with his perennial neat
little wool suit worn with feminine silk blouse. Not only does it
represent true couture chic, but it allows the signora to leave the
home before dark. Daywear was almost totally absent from this round
of Roman fashion.

Christie's to auction James Bond memorabilia in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Costumes, props, four cars and the most extensive
collection of posters ever auctioned from the 18 movies featuring
James Bond will be sold by Christie's this fall.
	   Much of the material, which will be up for sale in 250 lots,
comes from a private, single-owner collection amassed over 28
years, the auction house said.
	   The highlight of the Sept. 17 auction will be the car that
converts into a submarine used in the 1977 film ``The Spy Who Loved
Me,'' starring Roger Moore, who inherited the role from Sean
Connery, the first actor to play Ian Fleming's fictional British
secret agent.
	   The Lotus Esprit Submarine Shell is expected to sell for more
than 20,000 pounds (dlrs 33,000), while the Triumph Stag driven by
Connery in 1971's ``Diamonds Are Forever'' will probably go for
slightly less, Christie's said.
	   Other items to be sold include a tarantula model constructed in
1962 for the first Bond movie, ``Dr. No,'' prop diamonds from
``Diamonds Are Forever,'' a wristwatch with a magnet that could
attract objects from across the room from 1971's ``Live and Let
Die,'' and the metal-rimmed bowler hat used by Goldfinger's
henchman, Oddjob, to decapitate his victims.
	   ``We are expecting a great deal of interest in this sale from
private collectors, dealers and probably some theme restaurants,
too,'' said Carey Wallace, Christie's film and entertainment
specialist.
	   Christopher Lee, who played the villain Scaramanga in ``The Man
With The Golden Gun,'' and Shirley Eaton, Bond's lover in
``Goldfinger,'' both visited Christie's sale room Friday to view
some of the memorabilia.
	   Many of the key props were on display at a bar at the London
Hilton called the James Bond Nightspot until the late 1970s.

Thai police clash with protesting hill tribe villagers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAE SOT, Thailand (AP) _ More than 200 members of a tribal
minority clashed Friday with police while protesting the arrests of
three fellow villagers arrested on drug charges. About a dozen
people were injured.
	   Some 120 villagers of the Hmong hill tribe were arrested after
the violent morning protest in front of a police station in the
Pop-pra district of Tak province, 370 kilometers (230 miles)
northwest of Bangkok.
	   The crowd gathered early Friday demanding the release of three
villagers they claimed were innocent, police said. They accused the
police of abuses in their drug investigations in Hmong villages
along the border with Myanmar, which is also called Burma.
	   Myanmar, especially the border area near Thailand, is a major
producer of heroin and methamphetamine.
	   The confrontation started before dawn Friday morning and ended
after an hour when more police were brought in from a neighboring
district. Police said the villagers started off by blocking the
road and making threatening remarks before the situation got out of
hand.
	   Sixty soldiers stationed in the area were dispatched to a nearby
Hmong village to prevent them from joining the protest.
	   Tension between Thai narcotics police and the Hmong hill tribes
have been building up in recent months as authorities have stepped
up their activities to combat methamphetamine abuse. They have
arrested more than 30 Hmong people in the past three months.
	   Ten protesters _ including three women _ and one police officer
were injured in Friday's clash.
	   A spokesman for the Tak provincial court said the arrested will
be charged with disturbing the peace, resisting arrest and
assaulting government officials.
	   Relations between the hill tribe communities and Thai officials
have deteriorated recently. The most notable case involved Hmong
villagers who clashed with about 10,000 lowland Thais who were
demanding the government expel 20,000 Karen and Hmong from a
national park in Chiang Mai province.
	   The lowland villagers said the tribesmen's slash-and-burn
farming caused deforestation in a watershed area, keeping water
from reaching their crops.

Soldiers help flood victims in Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ The death toll after a week of flooding
in Bangladesh has risen to 54, with officials and newspapers
reporting that 16 more people, including seven children, have
drowned.
	   The deaths on Thursday were reported in Pabna, Gaibandha,
Mymensingh to the north and Cox's Bazar to the south.
	   Hundreds die in floods and cyclones every year in this low-lying
delta nation of 120 million people.
	   On Friday soldiers shored up embankments and rescued stranded
people, an official at the Relief Ministry said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society _ the Islamic equivalent of
Red Cross _ on Friday appealed to the International Red Cross for
house building equipment and medicine.
	   Bangladesh's three main rivers, the Ganges, Brahmaputra and
Meghna, are overflowing after monsoon rains. Authorities say the
flooding will worsen and more rain is expected.
	   The week-long floods have affected at least 3 million people,
stranding some on high ground and destroying the houses or crops of
others in 27 of the country's 64 districts, according to the Flood
Information Center in Dhaka.

Russia, Iran confirm commitment to nuclear non-proliferation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Iran jointly pledged to promote nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation, a news report said Friday.
	   The two sides issued a joint statement condemning the spread of
nuclear arms, Interfax reported. The statement followed a visit to
Tehran this week by Grigory Berdennikov, head of the Security and
Disarmament Department of Russia's Foreign Minister.
	   The statement said Russia ``notes Iran's commitment to the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and absence of a desire to
obtain access to such weapons,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmain said, according to Interfax.
	   Russia has often been accused of providing nuclear missile
technology to Iran, where it is helping to build a nuclear power
plant. Russia acknowledges that Iran has asked for long-range
missile technology, but says all efforts have been rebuffed.
	   Despite Western criticism, Russia continues to seek arms sales
and nuclear projects in some of the world's most volatile regions.
It earns badly needed cash from the contracts.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying Serb authorities, Kosovo's
leading Albanian politician pledged Friday to continue building
governmental institutions in this rebellious province despite a
police crackdown on his unauthorized parliament.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's self-styled president, made his pledge
as an international fact-finding team met with Serb officials here
in the latest diplomatic bid to end the fighting and start peace
talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   Hansjoerg Eiff, the German leader of the team from the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said he found
a ``positive reaction'' from Serb officials in Kosovo to the OSCE's
desire to establish a permanent monitoring mission here.
	   But another diplomat, speaking on condition he not be named,
said the deal could falter if President Slobodan Milosevic sticks
by his demand that Yugoslavia first be readmitted to the OSCE, from
which it was suspended in 1992 after ethnic wars in Croatia and
Bosnia.
	   The 11-member OSCE team _ including diplomats from the United
States, Germany, Russia, Austria, Denmark, Britain and other
countries _ meets later Friday with pro-independence hardliner Adem
Demaci.
	   Team members meet with Rugova on Saturday. He is the ethnic
Albanian politician whom the Americans and Europeans want to lead a
delegation in talks with Milosevic.
	   But Yugoslavia's bloody, five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash not
only against the government but also against Rugova, whose
commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the bloodshed or win
self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA, which is fighting for
independence from Serbia. Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo
9-to-1.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected in March but
never authorized by the Belgrade government.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   There were no arrests, but police said charges could be filed
because of the ``attempt to constitute'' the illegal parliament.
	   Nevertheless, Rugova told reporters Friday ``after convening
parliament, we will continue to build other bodies of government in
Kosovo'' and would invite ethnic Serbs in the province to take
part.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
raid Thursday was part of a ``repressive'' strategy that is driving
ethnic Albanians into the extremists' camp.
	   Like the KLA, Rugova also supports independence but his
opposition to violence has won him international support. In the
Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, a senior aide to Milosevic was willing
to negotiate autonomy, which the government rescinded in 1989.
	   But the aide, Gorica Gajevic, said the government would never
agree to an independent Kosovo established ``through terrorism and
banditry.''
	   Meanwhile, both Serb and Albanian sources reported scattered
clashes in the province, which is part of Serbia. Serbia and
Montenegro constitute the Yugoslav federation.
	   Serb sources said a policeman was shot and killed late Thursday
in the town of Kosovska Mitrovica, about 30 kilometers (19 miles)
northwest of Pristina, when suspected Albanian extremists opened
fire from a speeding car. Police set up roadblocks in the area in
hopes of catching the assailants.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugova, said an ethnic
Albanian was killed Thursday in the village of Jezerce, near
Urosevac, while approaching a police check-point.

Friday from marathon U.N. negotiations.
	   The United States expressed its reservations.
	   ``Unfortunately, the draft treaty released in Rome does not
address major U.S. concerns, including those regarding the court's
jurisdiction and the role of the prosecutor,'' said a U.S.
spokesman who asked that his name not be used.
	   He said negotiations were continuing and the delegation was
hopeful that ``a satisfactory outcome will still emerge.''

<TEXT>
	   The text of President Boris Yeltsin's speech at the burial
ceremony Friday for Russia's last czar and his family in St.
Petersburg, Russia:
	    &UR; ---
	   Dear fellow citizens,
	   It's a historic day for Russia. Eighty years have passed since
the slaying of the last Russian emperor and his family. We have
long been silent about this monstrous crime. We must say the truth,
the Yekaterinburg massacre has become one of the most shameful
pages of our history.
	   By burying the remains of innocent victims we want to expiate
the sins of our ancestors.
	   Guilty are those who committed this heinous crime, and those who
have been justifying it for decades, all of us.
	   We must not lie to ourselves, explaining this senseless cruelty
with political goals. The execution of the Romanov family was the
result of an irreconcilable split in Russian society. Its results
are felt to this day.
	   The burial of the remains of the Yekaterinburg (victims) is,
first of all, an act of human justice. It's a symbol of unity of
the nation, an expiation of common guilt.
	   We all bear responsibility for the historical memory of the
nation. And that's why I could not fail to come here. I must be
here as both an individual and the president.
	   I bow my head before the victims of the merciless slaying.
	   While building a new Russia, we must rely on its historical
experience.
	   Many glorious pages of Russian history are linked with the
Romanovs. But also connected with their name is one of the most
bitter lessons _ that any attempts to change life by violence are
doomed.
	   We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation irrespective of political and religious views and
ethnic origin.
	   This is our historic chance. On the eve of the third millennium,
we must do it for the sake of our generation and those to come.
Let's remember those innocent victims who have fallen to hatred and
violence. May they rest in peace.
	   (vi/gm)

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's deposit-taking financial institutions were
saddled with 35.2 trillion yen (dlrs 253.3 billion) in problem
loans at the end of March 1998, the Financial Supervisory Agency
said Friday.
	   The total, calculated under more stringest accounting standards
set by Japan's banking federation, included loans to bankrupt
borrowers, loans in arrears for three months or more and loans on
which conditions have been eased, the agency said.
	   The figures cannot be compared directly with the previous year
because the standards have been revised.
	   But under the old standards, problem loans at all deposit-taking
financial institutions fell to 24.98 trillion yen (dlrs 179.7
billion) from 28.078 trillion yen (dlrs 202 billion) the previous
year.
	   The old standards didn't include loans in arrears for between
three to six months or loans on which interest had been reduced but
still remained above the discount rate.

Retailers strike to protest general sales tax
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo KAR101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A strike shut down Pakistan's largest
city on Friday as shopowners protested a sales tax imposed by the
government to limit what it says are the effects of sanctions that
followed the country's nuclear tests.
	   Karachi jewelers declared an indefinite strike, while other shop
owners limited their protest to a one-day strike.
	   The general sales tax is applied to businesses that generate
five million rupees (dlrs 109,000) profit annually, and is an
attempt by the cash-strapped government to increase its tax base.
	   Pakistan's debt is dlrs 32 billion and its monthly service
charge on that debt is about dlrs 800 million, roughly what
Pakistan has in foreign exchange reserves.
	   Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz has warned Pakistan may have to
seek a moratorium on its debt repayment because of lack of funds.
	   Pakistan is blaming its financial woes on international
sanctions imposed after its nuclear tests in May.
	   Credit rating agency Standard and Poors has already downgraded
Pakistan to a triple C from a B minus, making it more expensive to
get loans.
	   Meanwhile, Pakistan is negotiating with the International
Monetary Fund for its next installment of dlrs 25 million and a
promise that sanctions will not be applied to international lending
institutions.
	   ``This general sales tax is just another burden on the
traders,'' said Saeed Qureshi, president of the All-Pakistan
Traders' Association.
	   Karachi is Pakistan's financial center that generates 70 percent
of all the country's revenue.

Japan's junior lawmakers break open search for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS thruout for AMs &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ They yell into microphones. They don't wait their
turn. They criticize their elders.
	   A brash band of young lawmakers is shouting and clawing its way
to influence in Japan's ruling party, trying to hijack the old
guard's selection of the country's next prime minister and
challenging the way political leaders have done business for
decades.
	   In the few days since Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced
he would resign, the pack of a few dozen mavericks in the Liberal
Democratic Party has thrown the race for a successor _ usually
decided behind closed doors _ into a public brawl.
	   Clamoring for more open debate, they have already delayed the
vote for party president to give candidates time to detail their
proposals. Now they threaten to derail the choice of the party's
top powerbrokers, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   The battle raging in the party could have lasting implications,
determining who takes the helm in Japan as it is struggling to pull
itself out of it worst recession since World War II and possibly
leading to a realignment in Japanese politics.
	   ``This is nothing short of an earthquake happening under the
LDP,'' said John Neuffer, a senior research fellow who follows
politics for Mitsui Marine Research Institute, a think tank in
Tokyo.
	   On Friday, the two front-runners _ Obuchi and the favorite of
the dissidents, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama _
made major policy statements. Obuchi promised more than 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 43.2 billion) in permanent tax cuts. Kajiyama also called
for tax cuts, as well as reform of Japan's troubled banks.
	   The dissidents howled in protest during a raucous party meeting
on Thursday, forcing the leadership to push back the vote for party
president from July 21 to July 24. Since the LDP controls the
powerful lower house of Parliament, the party president is certain
to become prime minister when the legislature votes at the end of
the month.
	   ``The people want an open debate of issues,'' declared Keiji
Furuya, 45, an LDP member of the lower house.
	   But party rebels also have a more mundane motivation: keeping
their jobs.
	   Hashimoto announced on Monday he would resign, the day after the
LDP was dealt a crushing defeat in elections for the upper house of
Parliament, losing 17 seats. Growing animosity to the party was
credited with boosting voter participation to nearly 60 percent.
	   The LDP is not in immediate danger of losing its grip on the
premiership, since it still commands the more powerful lower house.
But the writing is on the wall: the party has to regain public
support or more trouble lies ahead.
	   The danger is especially acute for younger lawmakers, who are at
the bottom of the party pecking order and little opportunity for
boosting their public appeal. For them, a push for more openness
and bolder policies can only enhance their standing with voters.
	   ``What this party's got to do in the next days and months is to
win back credibility with the public,'' said Neuffer. ``I think an
open election will help.''
	   Some of the dissidents have thrown their support behind
Kajiyama, who despite his age _ he's 72 _ has cast himself in
recent months as an economic reformer and prime backer of income
tax cuts. He announced his candidacy on Friday.
	   Others are supporting Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi, an
outspoken 56-year-old. He is widely seen as one of the party's
rising stars, but is not widely expected to win this time.
	   This is the not the first time dissidents have wreaked havoc
within the party. In 1993, massive defections broke the LDP's
38-year grip on power. The party moved back into the premiership
when Hashimoto took office in 1996.
	   And the rebels are not acting alone. Analysts say alliances with
some old guard politicians _ notably former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone _ have lead to the widening support for Kajiyama, another
longtime LDP figure.
	   The restiveness in the ruling party threatens to prolong _ and
confuse _ the selection process. But economists could be pleased if
it results in a prime minister who backs tax cuts and other stimuli
needed to repair Japan's economy.
	   Reflecting optimism that a new prime minister will move on the
economy, the U.S. dollar fell against the yen Friday after Kajiyama
announced his candidacy. Tokyo stock prices declined after four
straight days of gains.
	   ``I think what you will find is that the market likes the idea
of a strong man and this is why Kajiyama is good news for the
yen,'' said Jesper Koll, an economist at JP Morgan Securities.
``However the reality is that the political process is going to be
very clogged up.''

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The two officials at the heart of the drug
scandal rocking the Tour de France were brought to this northern
city Friday, where they were to appear in court, judicial sources
said.
	   Bruno Roussel, director of the Festina team, and Eric Ryckaert,
the team's doctor, have been in custody since Wednesday evening,
after police found a stash of performance-enhancing drugs in the
team masseur's car.
	   They were taken to Lille Friday, where a court is investigating
the case. They were to appear later before a magistrate, and likely
would be placed under formal investigation, judicial sources said
on customary anonymity.
	   The daily Le Parisien reported Friday that Roussel and Ryckaert
were implicated in another doping case that came to light in
Belgium in December 1997.
	   It said the names of both officials came up in an investigation
that began when the Belgian Department of Social Security suspected
that a pharmacist was diverting the drug EPO.
	   EPO is a substance that allows the better transport of oxygen
within the blood stream.
	   As the controversy over the drug scandal grew Friday, Jean-Paul
Escande, former president of a national commission against doping,
said the affair is unfairly targeting the Festina team.
	   Escande said the use of such drugs is widespread in sports.
	   ``There is more and more of it,'' he said on France 2
television.
	   Festina's masseur, Willy Voet, is still in custody in Lille.
	   Roussel, meanwhile, has been suspended from his functions by the
International Cycling Union.
	   But Jean-Marie LeBlanc, the Tour de France director, said there
was no reason to suspend the team from competing for the moment,
and the team insisted it would go on as usual.
	   Ryckaert told the L'Equipe newspaper Thursday he was ``broken''
by the allegations, and staunchly denied any involvement in doping.
	   ``My wife knows me, and she knows that everything they are
saying about me is a serious lie,'' he said.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said he'd seen ``with sadness _ but
not total surprise _ the news that people without scruples wanted
to give cyclists, and surely did, forbidden doping products,
difficult or impossible to detect, and at the same time certainly
very dangerous for athletes' health.''
	   He said it was essential ``that light be shed, and conclusions
drawn.''
	   Festina's main sponsors, the Spanish watch company Festina, are
threatening to break their contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

Next Mir to scale back flight program due to money crunch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The next crew of the Mir space station, whose
mission was threatened with cancellation because of a funding
crunch, said Friday they would have to cut their scientific
program.
	   ``We will have enough food and hygienic products,'' the crew's
commander, Gennady Padalka, said at a news conference. However,
instead of the originally-planned four spacewalks, the crew will
carry out only two because of the money shortage, he said.
	   Also, instead of two cargo ships with supplies the crew will
receive only one during their six-month stint on the station.
	   Along with Padalka, the crew includes flight engineer Sergei
Avdeyev and Yuri Baturin, a former secretary of President Boris
Yeltsin's Defense Council.
	   Baturin, 49, a space physicist by training, said a flight to
space has been his lifelong dream. The money troubles have led to
his flight being cut from three weeks to just 13 days.
	   The Russian space agency's cash shortage was so desperate that
officials even discussed abandoning Mir next month.
	   Last month, the government finally promised to pay the dlrs 600
million it owed for Mir's operations last year and space officials
said they could keep the station in orbit until June 1999. They
earlier had planned to discard Mir in December 1999.
	   To control Mir's descent to Earth, the space agency plans to
launch several cargo ships to dock with the station and use their
engines to guide it into lower orbits. Most of the Mir is expected
to burn up during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, while large
pieces will be directed to fall into the sea.

Eubank aims to stop champion in six
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ After tossing away chances to take the
WBO cruiserweight title from Carl Thompson three months ago, Chris
Eubank says this time he'll go out and finish the job.
	   Another loss to Thompson will almost certainly finish Eubank's
colorful career.
	   The 31-year-old former world middleweight and super-middleweight
champion had Thompson down twice during their 12-round fight at
Manchester in April but didn't follow up his good work and lost on
points.
	   ``My mind was blank, the puppeteer wasn't pulling the puppet,''
Eubank said heading into Saturday's rematch at the Sheffield Arena.
	   ``Last time I followed somebody else's theory. This time I'll
stop him in six rounds. If I don't finish him this time when I
should, it may well be time for me to retire.''
	   Even in defeat against fellow-Briton Thompson, Eubank put up one
of the bravest performances of his 46-fight career. He stayed on
his feet despite taking a pounding that left an eye virtually shut
and sent him to a hospital.
	   Eubank, who stands to make 400,000 pounds (dlrs 668,000) from
the fight compared with the champion's 250,000 (417,500), also has
two losses to Steve Collins. All his defeats have come in the last
three years after he went 43 fights unbeaten.
	   ``Losing is part of life and you have to take the rough with the
smooth,'' Eubank said. ``When I lost for the first time it was a
relief, it was other people who made such a thing of that unbeaten
record.''
	   But he has moved up two weight divisions to challenge Thompson,
who showed when they met in Manchester that he was much stronger.
	   Thompson, who is 23-4-0, makes the second defense of the title
he won from Germany's Ralf Rocchigiani in Hanover last October.
He's not a big hitter and couldn't put Eubank down in their first
fight even though he had the challenger in trouble several times.
	   Saturday's fight is also likely to go to the judges and Thompson
is angry at suggestions that Eubank should have knocked him out
first time.
	   ``It's the biggest load of rubbish to think Eubank could have
finished me off,'' the champion said.
	   ``Not only did he know I wasn't badly hurt, he knew he risked
getting finished off himself. I makes me angry that people are
assuming that he only has to turn up to win.
	   ``For some unknown reason people don't seem to acknowledge my
achievements,'' Thompson said. ``So what do you do? I don't know
what I can do to get the people on my side. I've just got to keep
on winning. Believe me, I think I'm going to be the first person to
stop Chris.''

Bulgaria joins Central European Free Trade Agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria joined a free trade pact Friday
linking seven Central European countries in a common market of more
than 100 million consumers.
	   Under the pact, Bulgaria will join the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in the Central European Free
Trade Agreement (CEFTA) as of Jan. 1.
	   The agreement, seen as a stepping stone to the European Union,
calls for phasing out all tariffs among member states by the end of
2001.
	   From the beginning of next year, Bulgaria will remove tariffs on
80 percent of industrial products traded with other CEFTA
countries.
	   Protective tariffs on textiles, clothes, ferrous metals,
chemical products and electric bulbs will remain.
	   The agreement envisages gradual liberalization of protective
tariffs on agricultural products.
	   Tariffs will be in effect on cheese, salami, eggs, cooking oil,
cucumbers, tomatoes, potatoes, grapes, wine, cigarettes and
tobacco.
	   ``I expect our dlrs 450 million annual trade with other CEFTA
members to grow by 30 percent next year,'' said Valentin Vasilev,
Bulgaria's minister of trade and tourism.
	   ``CEFTA helps us prepare to become eligible for the European
Union, because ... we get used to free trade,'' said Slovenian
Minister of Trade Marian Senjur.
	   CEFTA took effect on March 1, 1993. The original members were
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary.

Indian, US officials prepare for new nuclear talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian and U.S. officials prepared
Friday for the third round of quiet diplomacy aimed at reconciling
New Delhi's nuclear ambitions and Washington's nonproliferation
agenda.
	   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott meets his Indian
counterpart Jaswant Singh Monday and Tuesday in New Delhi. Singh is
a key foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, though his only official title is head of the country's
economic planning commission.
	   Talbott and Singh held the first of what are likely to be many
meetings in Washington in June, followed by another in Frankfurt,
Germany earlier this month. Few details have emerged from the
earlier meetings, and U.S. and Indian officials indicated Friday
the upcoming meeting would yield little publicly beyond posed
photographs.
	   India detonated a series of underground nuclear tests in May,
prompting Pakistan to respond with its own tests. India and
Pakistan have fought three wars since both gained independence from
Britain in 1947, and their shared frontier remains tense.
	   Washington, fearing their longtime rivalry could erupt into
nuclear war, has slapped economic sanctions on India and Pakistan.
It also has called on both to adhere to an international test ban
treaty.
	   India insists it needs a nuclear deterrent because of the threat
posed by neighboring China and Pakistan. But it may now be ready to
sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which it once condemned as
doing nothing to force nuclear powers like China and the United
States to dismantle their arsenals. India claims its May tests
established it as nuclear power.
	   Pakistan has said it would sign the CTBT only if India does, but
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub has said recently Pakistan is keeping
all options open on the test ban treaty.
	   A day after his talks in New Delhi, Talbott moves on to Pakistan
where he will meet Ayub and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
	   In Washington on Thursday, State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said proposals by U.S. lawmakers do not give President Bill
Clinton as much flexibility as he wants on anti-nuclear sanctions.
	   At the same time, Rubin said the sanctions imposed thus far will
remain in place regardless of whether the legislation wins final
congressional approval.
	   Clinton was required by law to cut off loans and aid to India
and Pakistan following their nuclear tests, and only Congress can
lift the sanctions. Legislation approved by the Senate Wednesday
would give Clinton waiver authority for up to 12 months. Rubin said
the administration wants waiver authority for an unlimited period.
	   ``If granted waiver authority of the type now under
consideration, the administration would not _ I emphasize the word
``not'' _ be prepared to use such authority in whole or in part
until there has been substantial progress toward achieving the
goals set forth in the U.N. Security Council Permanent 5
declaration of June the 4th in Geneva,'' Rubin said.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying Serb authorities, Kosovo's
leading Albanian politician pledged Friday to continue building
government institutions in this rebellious province despite a
police crackdown on his unauthorized parliament.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's self-styled president, made his pledge
as an international fact-finding team met with Serb officials here
in the latest diplomatic bid to end the fighting and start peace
talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   Hansjoerg Eiff, the German leader of the team from the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said he found
a ``positive reaction'' from Serb officials in Kosovo to the OSCE's
desire to establish a permanent monitoring mission here.
	   But another diplomat, speaking on condition he not be named,
said the deal could falter if President Slobodan Milosevic sticks
by his demand that Yugoslavia first be readmitted to the OSCE, from
which it was suspended in 1992 after ethnic wars in Croatia and
Bosnia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since February, when
Milosevic launched the crackdown on Albanian separatists who had
been attacking Serb police and military facilities.
	   The 11-member OSCE team _ including diplomats from the United
States, Germany, Russia, Austria, Denmark, Britain and other
countries _ meets later Friday with pro-independence hardliner Adem
Demaci.
	   Team members are scheduled to meet with Rugova on Saturday. He
is the ethnic Albanian politician whom the Americans and Europeans
want to lead a delegation in talks with Milosevic.
	   But Yugoslavia's bloody, five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash not
only against the government but also against Rugova, whose
commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the bloodshed or win
self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA, which is fighting for
independence from Serbia. Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo
9-to-1.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected in March but
never authorized by the Belgrade government.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   On Friday, Rugova said ``after convening parliament, we will
continue to build other bodies of government in Kosovo'' and invite
ethnic Serbs in the province to take part.
	   Meanwhile, both Serb and Albanian sources reported scattered
clashes in the province, which is part of Serbia. Serbia and
Montenegro constitute the Yugoslav federation.

Germany seeks drive against Internet child porn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government ordered
a nationwide drive to fight child pornography in cyberspace Friday
after revelations that an international porn ring apparently had
links to Germany.
	   Germans have been shocked by a still unfolding Dutch probe into
a ring believed to have sexually abused children as young as 12
months and spread the images on the Internet. Some of its members
reportedly come from Berlin.
	   ``We have to set an example,'' Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel was
quoted Friday saying in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper. ``The
people who did this must be brought behind bars.''
	   Kohl's Cabinet on Friday set up a committee of the interior,
justice and family ministries to draft ways for Germany's federal
states to improve coordination of the fight against child porn.
	   The government also urged police to step up patrols of the
Internet. All state police forces should designate ``cyber cops''
who scan the Internet for illegal content, government spokesman
Otto Hauser said.
	   Bavaria, the most aggressive German state in prosecuting
Internet smut, was the first to appoint the so-called cyber cops in
1995.
	   ``The Internet is not a lawless space,'' Hauser said. ``We must
widen our search for these criminals.''
	   Possession of child pornography is punishable in Germany by up
to one year in prison. This applies also to digital images stored
on a computer.
	   News of the Dutch investigation hit Germany at a time of
heightened concern over the abuse of children after several
high-profile child sex slayings over the past two years.
	   Dutch police said Thursday they had gathered computer material
last month from an apartment in the seaside town of Zandvoort that
contained images of ``very serious sexual abuse of children.''
	   The apartment's owner, a 49-year-old German identified as
Gert-Jan Ulrich, recently was murdered in Italy by a suspected
fellow gang member, apparently because he had tipped off police
about the ring's activities, Dutch media reported.

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Now, this is more like the British
Open.
	   Cold rain, then high winds returned to the coast of the Irish
Sea Friday, making life difficult for the players in the second
round at Royal Birkdale.
	   Tiger Woods took the sole lead even before teeing off when John
Huston three-putted the first hole for bogey.
	   Fred Couples, after starting the round a stroke behind Woods and
Huston, faltered badly and was 5 over for the day and 1 over for
the tournament. Loren Roberts, who began the day tied with Couples,
was also 5 over for the day, while Davis Love III was even after
losing three strokes.
	   The leaderboard did contain one surprise. Brian Watts, who plays
on the Japanese PGA Tour and has missed the cut in three of his
previous five Opens, was two strokes off the lead after a 1-under
69 to go with the 68 he shot Thursday.
	   Among the early finishers Friday were Masters champion Mark
O'Meara, who shot a 68 to get to even par, and David Duval, who had
a 71 and was 1 over.
	   ``All day it was hard,'' Duval said. ``I made some good saves,
like everybody is doing. You have to right now.''
	   John Daly didn't. He took a 10 on the 18th hole for a 78 that
left him at 11 over and with virtually no chance of making the cut.
	   Woods, who grabbed a share of the opening-round lead with Huston
at 65, had an afternoon tee time along with Nick Price, who began
with a 66.
	   They might need an extra sweater. Players and fans bundled up in
an assortment of colorful rain gear and head coverings _ Spaniard
Jose Maria Olazabal wore a wool hat pulled down low over his ears.
	   The wind cleared away the rain clouds and picked up strength as
the day went on, sending wayward shots into the deep meadow rye
lining the fairways and greens.
	   The conditions were in stark contrast to the opening round, when
light breezes and warm weather greeted golfers expecting the normal
wind and rain on the northwest coast of England.
	   One player who won't have to deal with the tough conditions is
1995 PGA champion Steve Elkington. The Australian withdrew from the
Open Friday because of a pinched nerve in his neck. He shot a
5-over 75 on Thursday.
	   With Woods and Huston leading the way, Americans dominated the
leaderboard in the opening round.
	   Players who make their living on the friendly courses of the PGA
Tour were right at home on the smooth fairways and soft greens, and
the scores showed it. Eight tour regulars were among the top 10
leaders, and the top five players all live in the United States.
	   In all, 12th graf pvs

Russia, Iran confirm commitment to nuclear non-proliferation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Iran jointly pledged to promote nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation, a news report said Friday.
	   The two sides issued a joint statement condemning the spread of
nuclear arms, Interfax reported. The statement followed a visit to
Tehran this week by Grigory Berdennikov, head of the Security and
Disarmament Department of Russia's Foreign Minister.
	   The statement said Russia ``notes Iran's commitment to the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and absence of a desire to
obtain access to such weapons,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmain said, according to Interfax.
	   Russia has often been accused of providing nuclear missile
technology to Iran, where it is helping to build a nuclear power
plant. Russia acknowledges that Iran has asked for long-range
missile technology, but says all efforts have been rebuffed.
	   Despite Western criticism, Russia continues to seek arms sales
and nuclear projects in some of the world's most volatile regions.
It earns badly needed cash from the contracts.

France delays appointment of national coach until next week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Jacquet again slamming L'Equipe; other
comments in Le Monde interview. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French soccer officials said Friday they will not
announce the successor to Aime Jacquet, the coach who led France to
World Cup glory, until next week.
	   Jacquet, meanwhile, renewed his vitriolic criticism of the
nation's main sports daily, L'Equipe, which had questioned his
abilities before the tournament.
	   ``I hate these people because they respect nothing,'' he told
the daily Le Monde.
	   The French Football Federation had been expected to name a new
coach Friday, but said it wanted to hold further discussions before
making a decision.
	   Jacquet said early this year that he would leave the post after
the World Cup, no matter how France performed at the competition.
	   There are three main candidates for the job: Roger Lemerre,
Jacquet's assistant; Monaco coach Jean Tigana; and Auxerre coach
Guy Roux.
	   Lemerre is believed the favorite, especially among officials at
the federation. But some outsiders favor a more widely known
figure, such as Tigana.
	   The FFF did announce that Jacquet _ now a national hero _ will
take over the role of national technical director at the
federation.
	   Jacquet will replace Gerard Houllier, himself a former coach of
the French soccer team. Houiller announced Thursday he would become
the joint manager at the English club Liverpool.
	   While Jacquet has been hailed ``Saint Aime'' and awarded the
Legion of Honor, his anger at some quarters of the French press
hasn't waned.
	   In an interview with the French daily Le Monde Friday, he again
said he would not forgive the severe criticisms of him by the
sports daily L'Equipe.
	   ``I accept criticism when it concerns soccer,'' he said. ``But
it is the cynicism, the contempt and the distortion that shocks
me.''
	   Jacquet also said he hoped that the success of ``Les Bleus,'' a
team that included players with backgrounds from Algeria, Ghana,
Guadeloupe, New Caledonia and elsewhere, might work against the
anti-immigrant National Front and its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
	   ``France has recognized this multi-ethnic team,'' Jacquet told
Le Monde. ``I think that it can give impetus for national unity and
return confidence to a nation that often doubts its abilities. They
say that Les Bleus have contributed to the fight against Le Pen: I
am very happy about that and very proud.''

Belgian police seek to indentify children in pornographic photos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Police have been attempting for the
past three weeks to identify missing Belgian children from among
340 photographs made from pornographic videos seized in a raid in
northern Belgium, officials confirmed Friday.
	   Authorities said the Belgian case was not related to
international child pornography ring discovered in the Netherlands.
	   More than 300 video cassettes, most of them depicting Portuguese
children on the island of Madeira, were seized from the home of a
pedophile in Tamise, north of Brussels, according to the local
prosecutor's office.
	   Christian Dufour, the state prosecutor in Dendermonde, confirmed
an investigation was underway but said it was not connected to the
raid on an apartment in Zandvoort, Netherlands which Dutch police
said Thursday uncovered pornographic computer disks depicting
sexual abuse of children.
	   The videos seized last month in Belgium date from 1992. While
most are believed to come from Portugal, there were some from the
Netherlands and Belgium. So far, however, authorities say they have
not spotted any children reported missing in Belgium.
	   Dufour said he planned to file charges soon against at least one
person.

AC Milan rejects 7 million pounds bid by Arsenal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ AC Milan on Friday rejected a
7-million-pound bid by Premiere League champion Arsenal for Dutch
striker Patrick Kluivert.
	   Club officials said Arsenal or any other team willing to sign
the young Dutch forward will have to add at least two million
pounds, for a transfer fee of nine million pounds.
	   Adriano Galliani, vice-president of the Milan club which is
owned by former premier Silvio Berlusconi, said Kluivert will stay
with the Italian team if Milan can't negotiate a satisfactory deal
for his transfer.
	   The 22-year-old Dutch star wants to leave AC Milan following a
disappointing season which spoiled his relations with teammates and
club officials.
	   Kluivert, who moved to Milan from Ajax last year, reaffirmed
recently that he wanted to join either Arsenal or Juventus of Turin
after some Milan officials had expressed second thoughts about his
transfer following Kluivert's brilliant performances in the World
Cup.
	   ``We are not begging for Kluivert's transfer ... we will agree
on his transfer only if the bid reaches 9 million pounds ...
otherwise the player sill stay with us. His transfer to another
Italian team is not being considered,'' Galliani said at AC Milan
training camp.
	   The Milan club already has signed German striker Oliver
Bierhoff, from Udinese, to team with George Weah next season.

Prince Charles knights actor Michael Gambon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles knighted the actor Michael Gambon
on Friday _ then planned a night at the theater.
	   The prince, tapping Sir Michael on the shoulder with the
ceremonial sword at the Buckingham Palace investiture, quipped,
``It's not quite dramatic enough, is it?''
	   Then, hearing that the Gambon, one of Britain's most admired
actors, is appearing in a new play, ``The Unexpected Man,'' Prince
Charles said, ``Oh, I must come and see it.''
	   Gambon said later it would be better if Prince Charles were to
leave Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, at home.
	   ``The new play is not really suitable for children, so I don't
think the prince could bring his young sons,'' he said. ``There's a
bit of swearing.''
	   Gambon's recent Broadway debut in David Hare's play ``Skylight''
won him a Tony Award nomination for best actor. His most recent
film performance was as an impoverished father in ``The Wings of
the Dove,'' released last year.

U.S. and Israeli authorities probe sale of church property
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli and U.S. police are investigating the
possibly fraudulent sale of Roman Catholic Church property worth
millions of dollars to an Israeli businessman, police said Friday.
	   The probe began after the custodian of church properties in the
Middle East, Father Joseph Lazaro, said his signature had been
forged on a sales contract involving 30 acres of olive groves owned
by the church in the central Israeli town of Ramle.
	   In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, lands sales
are much more than real estate transactions.
	   In the campaign to claim as much land as possible for a future
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Palestinian
Authority forbids the sale of land to Jews.
	   The Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, which have vast
land holdings both in Israel and the West Bank, have also been
careful not to violate that prohibition, in part because most of
their flock are Palestinians.
	   Moien Khoury, a lawyer for the Roman Catholic Church, said the
church only learned of the sale from the Israel Lands Authority
which received copies of the transaction with Lazaro's signature.
	   As custodian, Lazaro is the only one who can authorize the sale
of Roman Catholic property in the Middle East.
	   ``We immediately informed police of the fraud and won a court
order to freeze the sale until the investigation is complete,''
Khoury said Friday.
	   Israeli police are investigating the authenticity of a document
with Lazaro's signature which claims a Christian resident of Ramle
was authorized by a Franciscan group in Chicago to sell the
property, said Israeli police spokeswoman Leah Zohar.
	   The Ramle resident's signature, in turn, appeared on a sales
document to an Israeli from Ramat Gan, Zohar said.
	   ``Father Lazaro did not sign any document or give any one any
power of attorney,'' Khoury said.
	   Khoury said the church was informed that Israeli police were
conducting a joint investigation with their counterparts in the
United States to determine the authenticity of the documents.
	   Khoury would not say how much money was involved in the sale,
but said the land is worth several millions dollars.

Analysts say forecast of cargo losses still too low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS final graf pvs with three new final grafs to UPDATE with
special arrangements at Chinese airport &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Analysts said Friday that a revised government
estimate of financial losses due to cargo-handling problems at the
new airport still may be far too low.
	   Anthony Charter, the main cargo handling company's chairman,
also told government radio Friday that the main reason for the
problems at its new terminal was dust contamination of sensitive
mechanical and electrical equipment.
	   ``We've embarked on the cleaning and restoration of the sensors
and electrical systems,'' Charter said on Hong Kong radio.
	   He added that software glitches after the airport's opening July
6 have been fixed.
	   Singapore-based DBS securities said that the long-term negative
effects of the cargo delays at the new Chek Lap Kok airport will
cause the economy to contract by 2.2 percent this year, compared
with their earlier estimate of 1.5 percent.
	   Government estimates of revenue loss due to the cargo problems
represented ``only the income loss due of exports and imports,''
DBS added.
	   The airport's main cargo handler Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals
Ltd. announced last week it would not be able to bring its facility
at the new airport up to full speed until the end of August. It had
previously frozen most cargo shipments until July 19.
	   The government said Thursday that the protracted cargo delays
would result in a loss of about 4.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 589 million), or 0.35 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic
product this year.
	   The latest estimates were higher than earlier statements of
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, who said that losses would total
about 1.3 billion (U.S. dlrs 166 million) or 0.1 percent of GDP
this year.
	   The Hong Kong Standard quoted Morgan Stanley's Andy Xie Guozhong
as predicting that economic losses could run up to 60 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 7.7 billion) due to a ``ripple effect on
the rest of the economy.''
	   DBS predicted that Hong Kong's GDP growth for 1999 would drop
from 1.3 percent to 1 percent, saying there was no guarantee the
exporters and importers forced to move to other freight handlers
would come back to Hong Kong.
	   The cargo problems could also drive 30,000 small and
medium-sized firms _ about 10 percent of the total in Hong Kong _
out of business in the next few months, pushing the unemployment
rate to 6.0 percent in the third quarter of this year, DBS said.
	   Its unemployment forecast for the whole year is 5 percent.
	   Secretary for Trade and Industry Brian Chau said Thursday that
the cargo limitations were unfair to small and medium businesses,
the backbone of Hong Kong's once-robust economy, especially at a
time when it is slipping into recession.
	   Meanwhile, the Hong Kong government announced that special
arrangements have been made for airlines to use Huangtian airport
in the bordering mainland city of Shenzhen.
	   It said cargo from Hong Kong's new airport will be sent directly
to Huangtian with simplified customs procedures. A statement said
the new arrangements will run round the clock from Saturday until
resumption of normal cargo operations at Chek Lap Kok.
	   Hong Kong officials had sought China's assistance for the use of
Huangtian airport, which they say can handle up to 30 percent of
the territory's usual cargo. Some airlines also have been using the
airport in the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau.

Blood samples on suspects' clothing don't match those of British
</HEADLINE>
victim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYERI, Kenya (AP) _ Blood samples taken from clothing of two
Kenyans on trial for the murder of a British tourist do not match
the victim's blood type, a court was told Friday.
	   That was the conclusion of tests by the Metropolitan Police
Laboratories in London, police witness Kibera Karanja told a
magistrate's court trying the case of Roy Chiver's murder.
	   Karanja, a police superintendent, presented a report from the
laboratories prepared by senior forensic scientist Raymond Chapman.
	   Four blood stains taken from the clothes worn by the defendants
were compared with samples from Chivers and his wife, Sandra
Christine, who suffered cuts on her fingers during the attack.
	   The report said tests on two samples were inconclusive, and
additional DNA tests were being carried out to try and reach a
conclusion.
	   Peter Hiuhu Gachau and Simon Njoroge Wairimu are charged with
Chivers' murder Feb. 5 on the grounds of Aberdare Country Club,
about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kenya's capital, Nairobi.
	   Chivers, 50, of Orpington, Kent, was stabbed in the chest and
died while being flown to a Nairobi hospital.
	   The defendants, who have no legal representation, have also been
charged with robbing the Chivers of two cameras and a pair of
binoculars.
	   The Kenyan defendants have already been convicted of murdering a
man in a separate incident and sentence to hang.
	   Although Kenyan courts routinely impose the death sentence, no
one has been executed for more than a decade.
	   Both defendants confessed their guilt to police for the Chivers
killing. But they have since told Principal Magistrate Julius S.
Mushelle that the confessions were beaten out of them. However,
both confessions have been admitted as evidence in the trial.
	   The hearing was adjourned until Thursday.

	   ROME (AP) _ Here are some key provisions of the draft treaty on
creating the world's first permanent, international criminal court:
	   _ The court would prosecute individuals for ``the most serious
crimes of concern to the international community'': genocide, war
crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression.
	   _ The court would step in only if a state is unwilling or unable
to prosecute.
	   _ The maximum penalty would be life imprisonment.
	   _ Rape, forced pregnancy and the forced recruitment of children
are on the list of war crimes.
	   _ Cases would be referred to the court by states, the prosecutor
or the U.N. Security Council.
	   _ The Security Council could, in certain circumstances, ask the
court to defer action for a year.
	   _ The court would be located in The Hague in the Netherlands,
already the site of the World Court, which handles disputes between
states.
	   _ It would have 18 judges, elected for nine-year terms. No two
judges would be from the same country.
	   _ There would be a prosecutor's office, a pre-trial judicial
chamber, a trial chamber and an appeals chamber.
	   _ The working languages would be English and French.
	   _ The court would have the power to issue arrest warrants and
summons to appear.
	   _ No one under the age of 18 when a crime was committed could be
tried by the court.
	   _ Parties to the treaty could exempt themselves from the court's
jurisdiction over war crimes for the first seven years.
	   _ An assembly of representatives of the countries which are
party to the treaty would oversee the court.
	   _ Funding would come from the parties to the treaty, the United
Nations and any interested parties.

Government to free 9,000 prison inmates to mark Mandela's birthday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The government said Friday it will
release 9,000 prison inmates with less than six months to serve on
their sentences to mark President Nelson Mandela's 80th birthday.
	   Correctional Services Minister Sipho Mzimela said the government
would begin releasing the prisoners on Monday and that it would
take about two weeks to complete the release.
	   Mzimela said prisoners who have six months or less to serve on
their sentences as of Saturday, Mandela's birthday, could be
eligible for release.
	   He said except for the mentally disturbed, all prisoners with
less than six months to serve would be freed. He said the program
did not apply to escaped prisoners with less than six months
remaining on their sentence.
	   However, an escapee that surrenders before Saturday would be
eligible, he said.
	   Mzimela denied the move was in conflict with the government's
intention to stamp out crime. Instead, it was sending out a
positive message to prisoners.
	   ``While we are determined to root out crime, we don't want to
appear to use draconian measures,'' he said. ``We also want to
encourage people to improve their behavior, knowing that at the end
of the tunnel there is some light.''
	   Prisoners released early would be put on parole.

Myanmar government denies detaining opposition lawmakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military government on Friday
denied it has detained any lawmakers from the opposition National
League for Democracy in a recent crackdown, claiming they had only
been confined to their home towns to prevent them from agitating
among students.
	   Opposition groups inside and outside Myanmar have claimed that
the league's lawmakers _ elected in a 1990 general election but
never allowed to take their seats _ have been put under tight
restriction in recent weeks by the military government.
	   Those who did not agree to stay in their townships and report to
the authorities twice a day were reported to have been detained.
	   ``As a matter of fact not a single person has been arrested but
they have just been temporarily prevented from leaving their
respective township...'' said a statement faxed to Bangkok by the
government's spokesman.
	   It said the action was taken ``so that the process of resuming
of the classes of the institutions of higher learning can proceed
without being disturbed and politically exploited by certain
quarters.'
	   In the past month, the country's major colleges have begun
resuming their activities after having been closed after student
unrest in the capital in December 1996.
	   The government accused the National League for Democracy and its
leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, of fomenting the trouble. They denied the
charge.
	   Students have spearheaded most political protest movements in
Myanmar since World War II, when it was a British colony, and the
government highly values stability and order.
	   The government statement Friday, headlined ``Rumor Milling,''
said it was in response to reports in some news media stating that
79 members of parliament had been detained in the past two weeks
and they had been treated badly.
	   It is difficult to verify such reports, since Myanmar
journalists cannot report freely and the government prefers to
issue visas only to foreign journalists it thinks will report
favorably on its activities.
	   ``There have been a lot of rumors and fabrications created by
some dissidents, criminals and terrorists groups residing abroad
and also from some unsavory elements within the country in the past
two weeks,' said the government statement.
	   The recent crackdown began after Mrs. Suu Kyi, winner of the
1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and her party demanded that the
pro-opposition parliament elected in 1990 but never allowed by the
military to meet finally be convened.
	   The opposition set a deadline of Aug. 21, around the dates of
several anniversaries marking 10 years since a nationwide uprising
against military rule that was bloodily suppressed.
	   In Tokyo on Friday, Japan's chief government spokesman, Kanezo
Muraoka, said ``Japan is concerned about the current situation in
Myanmar, because there has been heightened tension between its
government and the National League for Democracy.''
	   ``Japan recognizes the importance of dialogue between the
government of Myanmar and the NLD including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi,
and strongly hopes that the two sides will make every effort, with
tolerance and restraint, to improve the situation,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The Swiss head of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe's observer mission was injured
in a traffic accident in downtown Zagreb, police reported Friday.
	   Tim Guldimann, 48, suffered a fractured vertebra and other
injuries in the Thursday evening accident, Dr. Igor Krpan said.
Guldimann's injuries were not life-threatening and he was expected
to recover, the doctor said.
	   Guldimann is scheduled to be transferred to Switzerland later
Friday for further treatment, the Swiss Foreign Department in Bern
said.
	   The head of the U.N. refugee agency in Croatia, Robert Robinson,
also was injured in the accident but not seriously, police said.
Robinson, an American, was briefly treated at a hospital and then
released.
	   The driver of the U.N. vehicle, Damir Horvat, 30, suffered a
broken leg and underwent surgery, the state news agency HINA
reported.
	   The accident occurred when the officials' vehicle collided with
a truck that was towing away illegally parked vehicles.
	   Police spokesman Damir Begovic said the truck driver is believed
to be responsible for causing the crash, and a criminal
investigation will be launched against him.
	   Begovic said the U.N. car had right of way at an intersection.
	   A policeman traveling with the tow truck suffered a concussion
and other minor injuries, HINA said.
	   The crash occurred as Guldimann was en route to a meeting at the
Croatian Foreign Ministry to discuss refugee returns with
government officials, according to a statement released by the
OSCE.
	   Although shaken, Guldimann walked to the nearby ministry and
attended the meeting. Afterwards, Guldimann realized he was more
seriously injured than he originally thought and sought medical
treatment, the OSCE reported.
	   The OSCE mission monitors Croatia's human rights and democracy
record. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees takes care of
thousands of people displaced by the ethnic conflicts in the
region.

Egalitarian Norway launches affirmative action for men
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After two decades of affirmative action
programs to promote equal employment for women, Norway on Friday
announced new rules that would do the same for men.
	   Norway prides itself on being among the world's most egalitarian
nations. In 1978, it passed a law allowing employers to advertise
for women to fill jobs in traditionally male-dominated professions
in advertising, and to give preferential treatment in hiring.
	   The government Friday amended equal rights regulations to allow
the same treatment for men in the female-dominated professions of
child care, preschool and primary school teaching and child welfare
institutions.
	   ``Equality will be strengthened by a more even proportion of
sexes in education and child care,'' Minister of Families and
Children Valgerd Svarstad Haugland said.
	   A greater number of men working with children would help change
children's views of gender roles, and provide boys male role models
in their schools or care centers, she said.
	   The new regulations also allow for setting limited quotas of men
in those professions, in the same way as some jobs are reserved for
women in male-dominated fields, a news release said. The law also
allows employers to use gender as a criteria in choosing between
equally qualified candidates to increase the number of men or women
represented in a profession dominated by the opposite sex.

India's lower house of parliament approves budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India has approved the first budget of
its Hindu nationalist-led government Friday, ensuring passage into
law of proposals to protect domestic industry against foreign
competition and spend more on infrastructure, defense and nuclear
energy.
	   The budget was passed by the lower house of parliament and its
approval by the upper house next week is a formality.
	   India's economic future is not threatened by anti-nuclear
sanctions imposed by the United States and others, said Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha in his speech urging lawmakers to adopt the
finance bill.
	   ``No projects will be allowed to suffer on that account,'' Sinha
said of sanctions. ``We can stand up to any international
blackmail. The country has the capacity,'' he said, while warning
that India could lose dlrs 1.5 billion in international assistance
as punishment for conducting nuclear tests in May.
	   Before the vote, Sinha offered a few amendments to the budget he
first outlined to parliament June 1. Among the changes was an
additional four percent import duty, which he said the domestic
industry needed as protection for some time before it could take on
international competition.
	   India began dismantling state controls seven years ago following
more than four decades of socialist-patterned economy.
	   The 1998-99 federal budget contained a 14 percent increase in
defense expenditures and a hefty 68 percent hike in spending on
atomic energy. The defense expenditure was raised to 412 billion
rupees (dlrs 10 billion) from 361 billion rupees (dlrs 8.6 billion)
last year.
	   India will spend 611 billion rupees (dlrs 1.5 billion) _ a 35
percent increase from last year _ on the key infrastructure areas
of energy, transportation and communications.
	   Sinha also promised a hassle-free procedure for foreign
investors who have complained that bureaucratic red tape presents a
huge obstacle to doing business in India.
	   Sinha already has announced opening the government-owned
insurance sector to competition from private Indian companies. The
government was considering the question of allowing foreign
companies in the insurance sector, the minister told Parliament on
Friday.
	   India's fiscal year extends from April 1 to March 31. But this
year the budget was delayed because of midterm elections held in
March.
	   The finance minister lowered the excise duty on tea, butter,
cheese and textiles to meet public criticism over 10-25 percent
increase in food prices. He also announced that all gifts made
after September would be free from any tax.

150 years after his birth, legend of W.G. Grace lives on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A big, burly man with a black, bushy beard
dominates early images of cricket in its modern form _ almost as
entirely as the name W.G Grace dominates all the early entries to
record books.
	   There's a simple explanation for the correlation. It's because
the bearded Victorian-era gentleman, Dr. William Gilbert Grace, was
so superior to his cricketing contemporaries that he became a
figure synonymous with the game.
	   W.G. Grace is considered the father of modern cricket and
regarded as being responsible for turning a nobleman's past-time
into England's national sport.
	   Saturday marks the 150th anniversary of his birth, July 18,
1948.
	   A match between the World eleven and the Marylebone Cricket Club
is being played Saturday at Lord's _ the home of cricket _ and, not
purely by coincidence, the winner will claim the W.G. Grace trophy.
	   The MCC selected the date for the match as a tribute to Princess
Diana and a celebration of Grace's birth.
	   Grace amassed 54,980 runs, including 126 centuries, and took
2,876 wickets in a first class cricket career which spanned 43
years _ a record in itself.
	   He set all the early cricket records. He was the first player
ever to score a century in the first session of a match and he was
the first man to score 1,000 runs and take 100 wickets in a season.
	   He was also first to score 2,000 runs and take 100 wickets in a
season. Grace was also the oldest man to captain England, aged
almost 51 when he played his final test in 1899.
	   He scored the first triple century in first class cricket in
1896 and was the first player to score more than 3,000 runs in a
first class season.
	   According to the Daily Mail newspaper, the Bishop of Hereford
declared around the turn of the century that Grace would have
rewritten history had he lived in another era.
	   ``Had he lived in ancient Greece, the Iliad would have been a
different book. Had he lived in the middle-ages, he would have been
a crusader,'' the bishop said.
	   W.G. Grace had undoubted ability on cricket pitches much
inferior to pitches of today but as a robust man with a quick
temper and a big reputation, he also had gamesmanship on his side.
	   Grace was once reported to have been bowled out in a minor match
but calmly picked up the bail, replaced it on top of the stumps and
remarked to the umpire, ``strong wind today.'' With fans attending
cricket in their droves just to see Grace play, what could an
umpire do but go along with him.
	   As captain of Gloustershire, he once declared an innings closed
when he was on 93. When asked why, he explained this was the only
score between 0 and 100 he had never finished an innings with.
	   Outside of cricket he practiced as a family doctor in Bristol.
But he made his mark, and a small fortune paid in ``expenses'', out
of cricket before he retired in 1908 aged 60. He died in 1915 of a
heart attack brought on by fear of a Zeppelin air raid.

	   CONSTANTA, Romania (AP) _ Strong winds and heavy surf tore three
freighters from their moorings, slamming one into a Romanian naval
vessel which sank, the navy said Friday.
	   The accident occurred late Thursday near the port of Mangalia,
225 kilometers (140 miles) east of Bucharest. Three commercial
ships broke loose during a 8-10 knot storm.
	   One of them rammed a torpedo boat which sank, the navy said.
	   No fatalities were reported and no figure for damage was
immediately available. A navy officer is leading an investigation.

Britain switches stance, favors ban on dumping oil rigs at sea
</HEADLINE>

stance, new graf at bottom showing who will be at next week's
meeting; adds byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Friday it favors a ban on dumping old
oil rigs at sea, backing away from a stance that made it a European
pariah in the fight over oil giant Shell's plans to sink one
platform, the Brent Spar.
	   North East Atlantic nations meet next week to decide what to do
about all their obsolete offshore steel structures, notably oil
equipment in the North Sea. Britain and Norway, the big oil
producers, had previously been the only two nations seeking to
retain the right to just dump the obsolete platforms.
	   Environment Minister Michael Meacher said Friday that Britain
had changed its mind, after consultation with experts who suggested
other ways of disposal are feasible.
	   ``This is not a climb-down,'' Energy Minister John Battle
insisted. ``We have always said `no more Brent Spars' and sought to
bring everything to shore where it is safe and practicable to do
so. This initiative goes much further.''
	   Oil companies expressed disappointment at Britain's reversal.
	   ``The industry's position continues to favor case-by-case
assessments for the largest structures, taking account of all
relevant factors,'' said James May, director-general of the UK
Offshore Opearators Association Ltd., a lobbying group.
	   Cost is one vital factor in the minds of the oil companies, who
would have to pay up to dlrs 200 million to decommission a big
platform on land.
	   But money isn't the only issue _ safety to workers,
environmental impact and technical feasibility must also be
considered, according to Trisha O'Reilly, a spokeswoman for the oil
lobbyists.
	   ``Some of these structures can be as big as the Eiffel Tower and
weigh four times as much,'' O'Reilly said.
	   The British ministers say they still think removal of all the
footings from the bottoms of oil platforms should be considered on
a case-by-case basis.
	   Getting rid of North Sea drilling equipment became a flashpoint
in 1995, when Greenpeace activists boarded the Brent Spar to
prevent Shell from sinking it in the North Atlantic.
	   Shell's plans, approved by the previous British government of
Prime Minister John Major, sparked environmental protests across
continental Europe, including some violent attacks on service
stations.
	   Shell ultimately backed down and towed the Brent Spar to a
Norwegian fjord, where it is still floating. Shell now wants to
chop up the old vessel to make pillars for a Norwegian ferry pier.
	   Greenpeace welcomed the British government's change of heart and
said it should pave the way for more stringent rules to be set on
deep-sea dupming next week, representatives of various nations meet
in Sintra, Portugal, just outside Lisbon.
	   ``It looks very promising,'' said Sarah Burton, campaign
director for Greenpeace U.K. ``Obviously, a great deal has changed
since the last government.''
	   The new rules will be decided by ministers from 12 of the 15
European Union nations plus Norway and Iceland, who are members of
the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the
North East Atlantic, also called OSPAR.

Ruling party to recall Suharto's relatives from legislature
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The ruling party will soon recall all
four children of former President Suharto from the consultative
assembly, a party official said Friday.
	   Irsyad Sudiro, chairman of the ruling Golkar party's faction at
the parliament, said the decision to sever the party's ties with
the family of the former autocrat was based on pressures raised
during a recent party congress.
	   The assembly _ made up of 500 lawmakers and 500 government
appointees _ is part of the reform agenda put in place by
Indonesia's new President B.J. Habibie after Suharto's resignation
that ended his 32-year rule.
	   Its main task is to elect the president and vice president. It
is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting in November to
prepare new political laws for Parliament elections.
	   Last week, the party took a major political step by electing a
new chairman and severed ties with Suharto, by dissolving its board
of patrons, headed by the former state leader. The body had been
instrumental in deciding party policy where Suharto had a veto
right.
	   Suharto, who had ruled the country with an iron grip, stepped
down May 21 amid violence and student-led protest against his
authoritarian rule.
	   Four of Suharto's six wealthy children are members of the
People's Consultative Assembly _ eldest daughter Siti Hardijanti
Indra Rukmana, second son Bambang Trihatmodjo, youngest son Hutomo
Mandala Putra and second daughter Siti Hediyanti Prabowo.
	   Rukmana, known as ``Tutut'' and once named minister of social
affairs, and Bambang, have already been ousted from Golkar's
executive board.
	   ``The decision has been final and a decree is under process,''
Sudiro said. ``The remaining are merely the mechanism and
administrative procedures.''
	   Sudiro refused to comment on the fate of two other Suharto's
relatives _ half-brother Probosutedjo and daughter-in-law Halimah
Bambang Trihatmodjo.
	   But another party official, who requested anonymity, said both
Probosutedjo and Halimah may also be discharged.
	   New President B.J. Habibie, who was a longtime Suharto Cabinet
minister and friend, has promised to hold a new Parliament election
by mid 1999 at the latest.

Moderate earthquake shakes Acapulco resort
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS top 3 grafs to UPDATE with revised magnitude reading;
ADDS that quake felt in Mexico City.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A moderate earthquake shook the Pacific
resort city of Acapulco on Friday morning, frightening tourists but
apparently causing no damage or injuries.
	   The quake occurred at 6:18 a.m. (1118 GMT) and had a magnitude
of 5.2, the National Seismological Service said, revising an
initial reading of magnitude 4.8.
	   The quake was centered along the coast of Guerrero state near
Acapulco and was felt in Mexico City, 180 miles (290 kilometers) to
the northwest, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Acapulco Fire Department Chief Lazaro Manuel Martinez and the
local Red Cross said there had been no immediate calls for
assistance.
	   The temblor was strong enough, however, to send Mexican and
foreign tourists toward the lower floors of their hotels for
safety, Notimex reported.

German driver signs with Ferrari through 2002
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new financial conditions given to German driver,
German reports on amount, other detail

<TEXT>
	   MARANELLO, Italy (AP) _ Formula One driver Michael Schumacher
extended his contract Friday with Ferrari for three years, keeping
him with the Italian race car company through 2002.
	   No financial details were announced, but Ferrari officials said
that the 29-year-old German driver negotiated new financial terms
for the three-year extension.
	   According to published reports in Germany Schumacher would get
about dlrs 42 million a year under the new contract which would
make him one of the highest paid sportsmen in the world.
	   Schumacher's current contract, granting him more than 40 billion
lire (dlrs 22 million) a year, expires in 1999.
	   ``Ferrari informs that its driver Michael Schumacher will
continue his collaboration with the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro until
the end of the 2002 season,'' the brief announcement from Ferrari
headquarters said.
	   The two-time world champion ``will also act as `ambassador' of
the Fiat trademark,'' Ferrari said.
	   Italy's auto giant Fiat is Ferrari's parent company and is
expected to use Schumacher as a consultant for new technologies and
for advertising the trademark of the Turin-based group.
	   Friday's announcement ended weeks of rumors about Schumacher's
future, including reports of his possible transfer to the rival
Mercedes team.
	   Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's honorary chairman, had strongly supported
a long-term agreement between Ferrari and Schumacher.
	   Ferrari also extended through 2001 the contract of team manager
Jean Todt. The contract of Ferrari's No.2 driver, Eddie Irvine,
expires at the end of this year and still must be re-negotiated.
	   Schumacher, who won his third consecutive Grand Prix this season
at Silverstone last Sunday, said this week that he felt confident
he would clinch the 1998 world drivers title as his Ferrari ``is
very competitive.''
	   His McLaren-Mercedes rival Mika Hakkinen leads Schumacher by
only two points going into the next race, in Austria on July 26.

 &UR; Political will lacking to pursue high-level corruption &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE MWANGI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Everyone knows who is involved in
high-level corruption in Kenya, but the political will and the
means are lacking to pursue it, politicians and businessmen said
Friday.
	   ``Those of us who know who the corrupt people are, are also the
ones sitting on that anti-corruption commission,'' legislator
Charity Ngilu, a 1997 presidential candidate, said during a
question and answer session after U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin spoke at the Kenya Institute of Monetary Studies.
	   ``The few big corrupt people have to be named and taken to
court,'' the opposition legislator said.
	   Attorney General Amos Wako told participants he lacks trained
personnel to investigate complex corruption cases and appealed to
the United States for technical expertise to train investigators.
	   To combat corruption and and attract investment, Rubin said in
his address, developing countries need clear laws and regulations
that are fairly and easily enforced, honest, well-trained
regulators and judges and anti-corruption units with real power to
crack down on corrupt practices.
	   ``Part of the problem we have is the capacity of our
investigation team to be able to investigate complex cases of
corruption adequately and prove it in court,'' Wako said.
	   He said President Daniel arap Moi's government was preparing new
legislation to deal with corruption because present laws were
outdated.
	   ``The disease (corruption) has gone very deep, and we must get
out of it, otherwise we will perish'' said Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae. ``The message the secretary (Rubin) is giving us is that,
it is not him who is going to deal with our corruption, it is up to
us to deal with our weaknesses.''
	   Kenya Manufacturers Association chairman Chris Kirubi said
corruption is often facilitated by outsiders.
	   ``America may have done something to discourage corruption, but
others have not,'' he said.
	   He disagreed with the policy of cutting off development aid to
punish a country like Kenya for corrupt practices.
	   ``Switching off the tap ... has not taught us to be
transparent,'' he said. ``It is not necessary to bring us to our
knees.''
	   Last year the International Monetary Fund froze a dlrs 220
million structural adjustment loan to Kenya, and the World Bank is
withholding other funds because of the government's failure to deal
with corruption.

surgery late Friday at a local hospital to remove his appendix and
was in stable condition, aides said.
	   There were no complications during the procedure at Calmette
Hospital, aides and diplomats said late Friday.
	   The Cambodian leader, who ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his
co-premier in a coup last year, is seen as the favorite in the

Ukraine's shipping industry in deep crisis, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine has lost nearly a third of its sea
fleet in the last six years, and urgent measures are needed to help
the country's ailing shipping industry recover, the government said
Friday.
	   Ukraine's state-owned shipping companies operated only 99 sea
vessels at the beginning of 1998, the Transport Ministry said. In
1992, when Ukraine was still a Soviet republic, it 291 ships.
	   Over 90 vessels were discarded due to age. About 80 became
privately owned and the rest were sold for debts.
	   At the same time, only two new ships were acquired this year,
and the state has paid little attention to the shipping industry
since independence in 1991, said Deputy Transport Minister
Volodymyr Sevryukov.
	   ``We have received no financing from the state since Ukraine
became independent,'' Sevryukov told a news conference. ``If the
situation does not improve, we'll soon be without ships at all.''
	   A large decrease in the volume of commodities shipped through
Ukrainian ports and the loss of many clients by the country's
shipping companies left them struggling with debts, he said.
	   Being unable to pay their debts on time, shipping companies
often have their ships seized in foreign ports, Sevryukov added.
	   A total of 17 Ukrainian ships are currently being held abroad,
and the country's four state-owned shipping companies had to sell
22 ships last year to pay off some of their debts.
	   However, shipping companies still collectively owe dlrs 123.5
million to their foreign clients, including ports and port service
companies, as of the beginning of 1998, the Transport Ministry
said.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has
called on Albania's parliament to play a positive role in helping
resolve the crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   In a letter to the parliament speaker, Namik Dokle, Solana said
that ``in the coming months, the Albanian parliament should play an
important role to help create the climate for peaceful negotiations
in order to solve the crisis in Kosovo.''
	   Solana's comment was reported without elaboration by the
Albanian government's ATA news agency. The rest of the letter was
not released.
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians have fled from Kosovo into
northern Albania to escape the fighting, which increased after
government forces cracked down on the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The KLA maintains bases in rugged mountains of northern Albania.

Angolan president accuses rebels of waging ``undeclared war''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angolan President Jose Eduardo said an
``undeclared war'' is being waged in his country, despite the
signing of a peace pact between the government and rebels four
years ago, according to news reports here Friday.
	   Dos Santos, addressing a meeting of Portuguese-speaking
countries in Cape Verde in West Africa on Thursday, said more than
200 civilians and government soldiers have been killed in attacks
over the past two months, the daily Diario de Noticias reported.
	   Dos Santos accused the former rebel movement UNITA of carrying
out the raids in remote areas of the vast southwest African nation
to further delay the implementation of the peace agreement, the
paper said.
	   He claimed UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola _ had not disarmed as it was
supposed to under the terms of the peace deal that ended a
two-decade civil war in the former Portuguese colony.
	   ``The political-military situation is worsening because of the
armed actions UNITA is carrying out in almost all provinces,'' Dos
Santos was quoted as saying.
	   He said the attacks had triggered a wave of 15,000 refugees into
neighboring countries and displaced 60,000 people inside Angola.
	   UNITA officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   The United Nations refugee agency said Friday that 22,000 people
had fled into Congo, on Angola's northern border, to escape the
fighting.
	   ``Medical surveys of the new arrivals show that the next days
are going to be crucial, especially for the children,'' U.N.
spokeswoman Judith Kumin said in Geneva.

German economic growth slows in second quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's economic growth slowed in the
second quarter of this year from a 3.8 percent year-on-year rise in
the first quarter, the Economics Ministry said Friday.
	   The ministry's preliminary report did not give a figure for
second-quarter growth, but it attributed part of the economic lag
to a late Easter that lowered the number of working days.
	   At the same time, the report said, the first quarter was boosted
by unusual circumstances _ good weather and additional consumer
purchasing ahead of an April 1 rise in value-added tax.
	   ``These factors mean that after strong growth in the first
quarter, manufacturing industry didn't show gains in April-May in
comparison with February-March,'' the ministry said.
	   Retail sales also fell after the VAT increase, as did
construction spending.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is trailing in voter polls, hopes
the economic upswing will help him get re-elected on Sept. 27. The
government expects gross domestic product to grow about 3 percent
this year.

Police begin probing Dutch child pornography case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A team of 15 investigators was
Friday scanning computer disks believed to contain thousands of
digital photographs and videos of child pornography as they sought
to trace members of a Dutch-based international pedophile ring.
	   The investigators, working together with police forces in
Germany and Belgium, were studying disks found in the apartment of
German-born Gerrit Ulrich who was murdered in Italy last month.
	   After his death, Ulrich's family led authorities to the shocking
material which includes ``a number of images of very serious sexual
abuse of children,'' police spokesman Hans Vos said.
	   Some of the victims are believed to be as young as 12 months.
Police suspect that the pornography was distributed to clients all
over the world via the Internet and from a computer store owned by
Ulrich.
	   A search of the store Thursday uncovered no pornography, police
said.
	   The computer disks from Ulrich's apartment in the seaside town
of Zandvoort also contain the names and addresses of gang members
around the world, Dutch press reported Friday.
	   A Belgian identified only as Rob van der P. is being held by
Italian authorities on suspicion of murdering 49-year-old Ulrich.
Ulrich reportedly was gunned down because he was threatening to
tell police about the pedophile ring's activities.
	   Reaction to the discovery of the ring was muted in the
Netherlands where politicians are in the closing stages of forming
a new government, but in Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl ordered a
nationwide offensive aimed at fighting child pornography in
cyberspace.
	   The government urged state police forces to appoint ``cyber
cops'' to scan the Internet for child pornography.

Winds taking toll at British Open

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE scores; Picks up 11th graf pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Now, this is more like the British
Open.
	   Cold rain, then high winds returned to the coast of the Irish
Sea Friday, making life difficult for the players in the second
round at Royal Birkdale.
	   Tiger Woods had the sole lead when he teed off but quickly gave
it back, hitting into a bunker to bogey the first hole and
three-putting the second hole for another bogey. That made playing
partner Nick Price, who parred the first two holes, the leader at 4
under.
	   Woods wasn't the only one having problems. John Daly took a 10
on the 18th hole for a 78, while Tom Lehman did even worse,
shooting a 79.
	   It was that kind of a day at Birkdale, which was tame a day
earlier when 41 players equaled or broke par in a first round
played in light winds and warm sun.
	   Fred Couples, after starting the round a stroke behind Woods and
Huston, faltered and needed a birdie on the 18th to finish 4 over
for the day and even for the tournament. Loren Roberts began the
day tied with Couples and finished with a 76, while Davis Love III
shot 73.
	   The leaderboard did contain one surprise. Brian Watts, who plays
on the Japanese PGA Tour and has missed the cut in three of his
previous five Opens, was one stroke off the lead after a 1-under 69
to go with the 68 he shot Thursday.
	   Among the early finishers Friday were Masters champion Mark
O'Meara, who shot a 68 to get to even par, and David Duval, who had
a 71 and was 1 over.
	   ``All day it was hard,'' Duval said. ``I made some good saves,
like everybody is doing. You have to right now.''
	   Woods, who grabbed a share of the opening-round lead with Huston
at 65, teed off with Price as the wind swirled.
	   Woods hit his second shot into the right bunker, then blasted
out about 20 feet (6 meters) past the hole. Woods missed the putt,
then on the second hole took three putts, starting from about 25
feet (7 1/2 meters).
	   The weather forced players and fans to bundle up _ Spaniard Jose
Maria Olazabal wore a wool hat pulled down low over his ears.

Belgian police seek to identify children in pornographic photos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Police have been trying for three weeks
to identify missing Belgian children from among 340 photographs
made from pornographic videos seized in a raid in northern Belgium,
officials confirmed Friday.
	   Authorities said the Belgian case was not related to another
international child pornography ring recently discovered in the
Netherlands.
	   More than 300 video cassettes, most of them depicting Portuguese
children on the island of Madeira, were seized from the home of a
pedophile in Tamise, north of Brussels, according to the local
prosecutor's office.
	   Christian Dufour, the state prosecutor in Dendermonde, confirmed
an investigation was underway but said it was not connected to a
raid on an apartment in Zandvoort, Netherlands.
	   Dutch police said on Thursday that they had uncovered computer
disks in the apartment that depicted sexual abuse of children.
	   The videos seized last month in Belgium date from 1992. Most are
believed to come from Portugal, with some from the Netherlands and
Belgium.
	   Dufour said he planned to file charges soon against at least one
person.

Russia's last czar laid to rest, Yeltsin calls for reconciliation

background on Yeltsin attitude toward monarchy &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ With the scent of incense hanging
in the air, Russia buried its last czar Friday in a somber ceremony
that Boris Yeltsin called an atonement for ``one of the most
shameful pages of our history.''
	   On the 80th anniversary of the executions of the Russian royal
family, nine wooden coffins with the bones of Czar Nicholas II, his
wife, daughters and servants were lowered into one large crypt
beneath the floor of the gilded, 18th-century, St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral.
	   ``We have long been silent about this monstrous crime,'' Yeltsin
said of the executions, carried out by Bolshevik revolutionaries at
the dawn of the communist era. ``Guilty are those who committed
this heinous crime, and those who have been justifying it for
decades, all of us.''
	   In a powerful speech, the Russian president said the burial
should serve as a catalyst for national reconciliation in a country
that's lurched from one upheaval to another during the 20th century
_ from revolution and civil war, to famine, political purges and
the collapse of the Soviet empire.
	   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Yeltsin has not advocated restoring the Russian monarchy,
although he has long spoken of the need for the country to reclaim
its long-suppressed history and condemn communist abuses.
	   The burial was officiated by a dozen bearded priests in
gold-and-white robes, with one gently swinging a censer that sent
small puffs of burning incense wafting over the coffins.
	   Dozens of the czar's relatives, diplomats from 50 countries, and
Prince Michael of Kent, a member of the British royal family, which
is related to Russian royalty, stood and held lit candles at the
cathedral on the banks of the Neva River.
	   The czar's family members tossed white sand, representing the
earth, onto the coffins before the crypt was covered. Outside on
the river bank, cannons boomed in a 19-shot salute _ two shy of the
customary 21 because the czar abdicated a year before he was
killed.
	   ``We must tell the truth _ the (czar's) massacre has become one
of the most shameful pages of our history,'' Yeltsin said. ``By
burying the remains of the innocent victims we want to expiate the
sins of our ancestors.''
	   As the ceremony drew to a close, Yeltsin clasped the hands of
Nicholas Romanov, the most prominent of the czar's relatives at the
service, and they spoke briefly.
	   With its understated dignity, the burial was in sharp contrast
to the months of controversy that preceded it.
	   Many leading Russian figures, including the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church, skipped the service due to multiple disputes it
generated. Yeltsin was planning to stay away as well, but changed
his mind and announced Thursday he would participate.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917, the Romanov dynasty, and the nature of national guilt and
contrition.
	   The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but Russia has not
previously held any major, formal ceremonies dealing with the
abuses committed during communist times. Friday's service brought
the issue to the fore.
	   ``This is not just a funeral, but a national repentance,'' said
Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the world's leading conductors and
cellists, who was exiled during the Soviet era.
	   ``It shows the entire world that Russia is changing and becoming
more humane,'' he said on Russian television.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   But the burial also raised controversies. The Orthodox Church,
as well as some ordinary Russians, have questioned the authenticity
of the remains despite extensive DNA testing in the United States,
Russia and Britain.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony was
relatively simple. When the coffins were interred, the priest did
not use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques
were on the walls of the chapel.
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for three centuries. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
his wife, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   Nine of the 11 bodies were recovered in 1991 from a desolate
forest outside the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. Two
skeletons have never been found _ Alexei, the czar's only son and a
daughter that scientists believe was Maria. Most investigators
believe their bodies were burned to ashes by their killers.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Key pillars of Japan's economic model are failing
and industries must make dramatic changes to boost productivity and
help lift the economy out of its recession, the government said
Friday.
	   In a grim yearly report, the Economic Planning Agency said
Japan's economy is ``stagnating'' and that time-honored practices
like lifetime employment and seniority-based promotion are no
longer suitable.
	   ``Japanese corporations are now suffering from system fatigue,''
Akira Furukawa, director of the agency's domestic economy research
bureau, said ahead of the report's release.
	   The agency also said the government must do its part by carrying
out further deregulation and implementing major financial and tax
reforms.
	   Agency Director General Koji Omi said the political turmoil,
caused by the ruling party's contentious search for a new prime
minister, won't affect government efforts to fix the economy.
	   The ruling party's disastrous showing at recent elections for
Parliament's upper house has forced Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to step down.
	   His Liberal Democratic Party continues to be the ruling party
because it controls the more powerful lower house, which chooses
the prime minister. The party is now trying to choose a new leader,
who will later be chosen prime minister by Parliament.
	   ``Members of the (ruling Liberal Democratic) Party agree that
whatever government is formed, it will make economic policies its
top priority,'' Omi told reporters.
	   Just a year ago, when the government was still trumpeting a
swift economic recovery, the assessment that Japanese industries
needed serious structural change might have sounded like blasphemy.
	   But as Japan's recession deepens and bankruptcies rise, an
increasing number of companies are heeding the need to restructure.
	   In Friday's report, Tokyo said companies need more flexibility
over hiring and firing, but also must learn to become more
accountable to shareholders.
	   Seniority-based promotion and cozy corporate ties between
related firms are no longer appropriate for promoting growth in
important new fields such as software development, the report said.
	   ``Japanese business relationships based on long-term, implicit
contracts functioned well in an age when the advance consensus
could be secured among parties concerned,'' it said.
	   The report marks an abrupt departure from last year's ``white
paper'' on the economy, which had confidently stated Japan was on
track for solid recovery and that injections of public spending
were no longer needed.
	   The much glummer assessment this year follows the government's
acknowledgement in June that the economy has slipped into recession
following several years of sluggish growth.
	   In addition to corporate structural problems, the report blamed
the economic malaise on a string of financial institution failures
and the spread of an economic crisis elsewhere in Asia.
	   Also weighing on the economy is a credit crunch caused by
massive bad loans held by banks and an ill-timed government
decision to raise sales taxes last year while phasing out income
tax cuts, it said.
	   The agency called for quicker action to write-off banks'
non-performing loans, along with increased efforts to shore up
Japan's piecemeal welfare programs and underfunded social security
system.
	   ``Although these reforms involve a certain degree of pain, they
are imperative for the future of Japan,'' the report said.

Fog hampers Atlantic search for plane carrying two Swedes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Thick fog hampered search crews
hunting Friday for two Swedes who disappeared during a
transatlantic flight to Newfoundland.
	   Three ships and two aircraft using radar were scouring an area
about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Newfoundland for the
man and woman, who were flying a single-engine, home-made plane
from the Azores.
	   Last radio contact was late Tuesday night. There was no distress
call from the pair, who had a life raft aboard the plane.
	   ``The trouble we're having now is the fog bank is forecast to
persist until late Sunday and possibly even Monday,'' said Capt.
David Cameron, an air controller at the Halifax search and rescue
center. ``Until we can get at least a good day of visual searching
done, we'll continue searching with just the radar coverage.''
	   Coast guard ships, as well as more than a dozen commercial
vessels passing through the area, have contributed to the search
effort.
	   The plane was carrying about 8{ hours worth of fuel for a flight
that should have taken six hours. It was headed for an air show in
the United States. The trip to Newfoundland was the first leg of
the flight.
	   The names of the missing were not released.

Polish farmer finds 700 land mines in backyard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ After digging a hole in his yard, a farmer
in southern Poland discovered nearly 700 World War II-era land
mines on his property.
	   The farmer found a few mines in the 50-centimeter (20-inch) deep
hole on his property in Latoszyn, some 300 kilometers (186 miles)
south from Warsaw. He then called mine-removal experts who
unearthed a total 698 land mines _ some underneath the stairs to
the farmer's house.
	   Each mine contained about 400 grams (14 ounces) of gunpowder,
said Col. Ryszard Lastowski, part of the military team of
detonating experts.
	   None of the mines had detonators. But if triggered by accident
the mines could pop out of the ground two meters (six feet) high
and explode.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said on
Friday that the government would act by decree to introduce its
austerity program after the parliament failed to approve many of
its segments.
	   The program, intended to boost the government's cash resources
amid financial crisis, included a series of bills that would bring
additional revenues totaling 102 billion rubles (dlrs 16.5
billion).
	   However, the parliament's lower house, the State Duma, has so
far approved bills that would bring only 28 billion rubles (dlrs
4.5 billion), Kiriyenko said in a speech before lawmakers.
	   And of those potential revenues, the federal budget is only
expected to receive 3 billion rubles (dlrs 483 million), with the
rest going to local budgets, he said.
	   During its session on Friday, the Duma rejected several bills
proposed by the government before recessing for a summer vacation
that is expected to last until the end of September,
	   ``Regrettably, we have failed to reach a comprehensive solution
on how to boost revenues,'' Kiriyenko said in a brief speech before
lawmakers. ``We can't stop with that and will now have to act
ourselves.''
	   He said that some bills turned down by the Duma will be
introduced by decree of President Boris Yeltsin while others could
be enacted by the cabinet in accordance with Russian law.
	   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have made it
clear they want the government austerity program passed before they
start delivering dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans this year and next
to help stabilize financial markets.
	   The Russian stock market, which has dropped by half so far this
year, shrugged off the Duma's failure to pass the package and
closed Friday with a gain of 4.8 percent following steady gains all
week, except Thursday.
	   Communists and other hardliners dominating the Duma have balked
at fiscal steps proposed by the government, saying they would
further exacerbate the nation's social woes.
	   The Duma has passed some of the government's bills, including a
key measure introducing an additional 5-percent sales tax which was
approved on Thursday.
	   But on Friday, lawmakers rejected an income tax bill along with
a document which would cut various social payments for this year, a
measure to increase cash collection for the state insurance and
pension funds and several other fiscal initiatives.
	   Speaking before parliament, Kiriyenko proposed a new bill which
would give the government the right to unilaterally change the tax
rate.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the lawmakers to his
proposal.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said that the house might hold an
emergency session next month to discuss some of the government's
proposals.
	   Seleznyov lashed out at the government, saying that new foreign
loans would boost Russia's debt to a dangerous level.
	   The government has hailed an agreement with the IMF and other
lenders for new loans as a major success that would save Russian
financial markets from collapse.
	   Russia's economy, which seemed on the way to recovery last year,
shrank again this year because of Asian financial crisis, a drop in
world oil prices and other factors. Russia's gross domestic product
dropped by .5 percent in the first half of 1998 from the same
period last year.
	   The stock market has dropped by half so far this year, and the
Central Bank has been fighting off a ruble devaluation.

Angolan president accuses rebels of waging ``undeclared war''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angolan President Jose Eduardo said an
``undeclared war'' is being waged in his country, despite the
signing of a peace pact between the government and rebels four
years ago, according to news reports here Friday.
	   Dos Santos, addressing a meeting of Portuguese-speaking
countries in Cape Verde in West Africa on Thursday, said more than
200 civilians and government soldiers have been killed in attacks
over the past two months, the daily Diario de Noticias reported.
	   Dos Santos accused the former rebel movement UNITA of carrying
out the raids in remote areas of the vast southwest African nation
to further delay the implementation of the peace agreement, the
paper said.
	   He claimed UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola _ had not disarmed as it was
supposed to under the terms of the peace deal that ended a
two-decade civil war in the former Portuguese colony.
	   ``The political-military situation is worsening because of the
armed actions UNITA is carrying out in almost all provinces,'' Dos
Santos was quoted as saying.
	   He said the attacks had triggered a wave of 15,000 refugees into
neighboring countries and displaced 60,000 people inside Angola.
	   UNITA officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   The United Nations refugee agency said Friday that 22,000 people
had fled into Congo, on Angola's northern border, to escape the
fighting.
	   ``Medical surveys of the new arrivals show that the next days
are going to be crucial, especially for the children,'' U.N.
spokeswoman Judith Kumin said in Geneva.

Shelling rocks Guinea-Bissau capital, new mediation effort prepared
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops and rebels exchanged
heavy artillery fire in the capital of Guinea-Bissau on Friday,
killing at least eight civilians as Portuguese-speaking nations
prepared a new mediation effort, news reports said.
	   Five young men taking cover near their house in Bissau were
killed by shrapnel from an artillery shell and three others were
killed by a shell which landed in a suburb, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   A shell also landed in the city's central market, setting it
ablaze, according to Lusa.
	   The capital of the former Portuguese colony has been under
sporadic fire since June 7, when a breakaway military faction
occupied the city's main military garrison and the international
airport where they are still entrenched.
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, have demanded that President Joao Bernardo Vieira step down.
Vieira is being supported by more than 1,000 troops from
neighboring Senegal.
	   No figures were available on the total number of people killed
in the fighting, which has also spread to inland areas.
	   The seven-member Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries,
which includes five former Portuguese colonies in Africa, announced
Friday that a ministerial delegation would seek to mediate an end
to the conflict, Lusa reported.
	   The organization, meeting in Cape Verde in West Africa, said it
would set up a contact group to pursue talks.
	   Previous mediation efforts by the foreign ministers of Portugal
and Angola failed because the two sides would not observe a
cease-fire.
	   The fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people who
require emergency food and medical aid, according to relief
agencies.
	   Senegal earlier this week said it would allow aid to pass over
its southern border into Guinea-Bissau.

Government withdraws controversial bill on teachers' wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ On the third day of a nationwide teachers'
protest, the government withdrew controversial draft legislation
Friday that would have retroactively wiped out wage increases they
won after a strike last year.
	   ``Following my press statement of June 13, and in order to
facilitate meaningful dialogue between the Kenya National Union of
Teachers (KNUT) and the government on the teachers wage bill, the
government has suspended the presentation of the Teachers' Service
Commission (TSC) amendment bill 1998 to parliament,'' Education
Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said in a brief statement.
	   Musyoka said the government expects all teachers to resume their
duties immediately.
	   Teachers walked off the job Wednesday, angered by the
government's failure to pay the raises they were promised last year
when they struck just before general elections.
	   President Daniel arap Moi's government agreed to 200 percent
increases over five years but says now it has no money. The bill
was drawn up to force the teachers to renegotiate the pay hikes.
	   There are some 260,000 teachers for seven million students in
primary and secondary schools in Kenya.
	   Musyoka said earlier this week that if the raises agreed on were
put into effect, 80 percent of his ministry's 1998-99 budget of 44
billion shillings (dlrs 733 million) would go to pay salaries.
	   On Tuesday, Moi's office announced that as an example, he would
take a 50 percent cut in pay, and his ministers would take 30
percent cuts. His official monthly salary was given as 40,733
shillings (dlrs 679 shillings).
	   The cuts did not affect generous allowances.

Veteran coach joins Scottish titlist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Scottish champion Celtic on Friday
hired former Slovan Bratislava and Aston Villa manager Jozef
Venglos as its new head coach.
	   The 62-year-old Slovak, a member of FIFA's technical commmitee
at the World Cup, will begin by operating as a consultant only
until the club gains a work permit for him.
	   In a surprise move following the resignation of Dutch coach Wim
Jansen at the end of last season, Celtic has taken on a man who was
a failure at Villa.
	   His appointment may not satisfy the fans.
	   During his brief spell at Villa Park, Venglos, then the first
foreign manager in top-flight English soccer, took over a team
which had finished runner-up in the league title race under Graham
Taylor and almost got the club relegated inside a year.
	   With only five days to go before Celtic starts its Champions Cup
challenge against Ireland's St. Patrick's Athletic, the Scottish
club wanted an appointment soon.
	   It had hoped to hire former France coach Gerard Houllier, who
decided to join Liverpool instead. Names such as Ruud Gullit and
Ron Atkinson were mentioned in the media as candidates for the job
and the Celtic owners may attract criticism from its supporters for
not taking on a well-known and successful manager.
	   Yet the Celtic owners are satisfied with his record.
	   ``Jozef Venglos has a wealth of experience and knowledge of
coaching which is difficult to match in world football,'' said
Celtic managing director Fergus McCann.
	   ``He knows what it takes to win at the highest level, winning
leagues and cups at national level and European Championships at
international level as well as taking Czechoslovakia to World Cup
finals in Italia 90.
	   ``The process we have gone through has involved talking to many
people,'' McCann said. ``It has been an in-depth search and at the
end of it we have an intelligent man with a mature attitude and a
knowledge of playing and coaching at the highest level.''
	   Venglos, who has also coached the national teams of Australia,
Malaysia, Oman, Slovakia and Czechoslovakia, says he's impressed by
Celtic's record too.
	   ``I could not resist the offer of the opportunity to coach a
club that is embedded in world soccer's history,'' he said.
	   ``The chance to work with 13 international players in one of
Europe's finest football arenas with 60,000 supporters and so much
potential still to achieve is an opportunity and challenge I
relish.''
	   Last season, Jansen, who also was a surprise choice, guided
Celtic to its first league title in 10 years, ending a long
domination by its Glasgow rival Rangers, which had won the
championship nine years in a row and was bidding to beat a record
it shared with Celtic.

Swiss fund to pay compensation to Ukrainian Gypsy Holocaust
</HEADLINE>
victims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Swiss fund helping needy victims of the
Holocaust will pay dlrs 1,000 to each surviving Ukrainian Gypsy who
suffered during World War II, Ukrainian media reported Friday.
	   The compensation would be paid to those Gypsies who stayed on
territories occupied by German Nazi forces in Ukraine, the site of
some of the heaviest World War II battles, or those who were born
in the ex-Soviet republic before 1944, according to Volodymyr
Zolotarenko, chairman of the Gypsy Association of Ukraine.
	   Ukrainian television said 60,000 Gypsies were registered in
Ukraine, but noted that Gypsy groups estimate their number at
300,000. The official 1989 census put the figure at close to
48,000.
	   Many nomadic Gypsies have no passports and would only be able to
receive compensations if they provide documents from Gypsy groups
certifying their background, the report said.
	   Zolotarenko told the ITAR-Tass news agency that there were no
official statistics on Holocaust victims among the Gypsies in
Ukraine.
	   During World War II, about 80 percent of Gypsies were killed in
Europe as Nazi Germans exterminated them along with Jews,
homosexuals and others they deemed undesirable. Among the first
victims were 600 Gypsies executed near the Ukrainian capital, Kiev,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Holocaust fund was set up early in 1997 by Swiss banks and
industry following a scandal over assets left behind by people
killed by the Nazis.
	   The aim of the 275-million-Swiss-franc (dlrs 190 million) fund
is to help aging victims of the Holocaust, mainly those who also
suffered for nearly half a century since World War II under
communist rule in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

 &UR; Saddam criticizes Arab states for lack of support

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab states should support Iraq in its
campaign against U.N. sanctions rather than uphold the embargo,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in his inaugural satellite
broadcast to the Arab world Friday.
	   In an apparent reference to the United States and Britain,
Saddam blamed ``enemies'' for the eight years of sanctions that the
U.N. Security Council first imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait.
	   ``My Arab brothers, the principled position should be that which
brings us to justice ... and not to seek the satisfaction of the
foreigner and the enemies of the (Arab) nation,'' Saddam said in a
speech marking the 30th anniversary of his Baath Party's seizure of
power.
	   Saddam referred to the suffering caused by the sanctions _
widespread malnutrition among children, inflation and shortages _
in a bid to play to Arab sympathy for Iraq's 22 million people.
	   ``Iraqis know that they are paying the price for their
sacrifices ... and their stance of righteousness ... but they do so
willingly because they are seeking the peaks and not the shallow
valleys,'' he said.
	   In recent months, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf have toured Arab states
in an attempt to persuade their leaders to defy the U.N. embargo
against Iraq.
	   ``Go back to justice, my (Arab) brothers so that justice will
come back to you,'' Saddam said.
	   The Iraqi president did not name any Arab state or leader, but
he indirectly criticized Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians when he
rebuked those Arab peoples that had made peace with Israel, which
he labeled ``the greedy enemy and the usurper of (Arab) land.''
	   He also ridiculed Arab leaders for their failure to convene an
Arab summit to forge a united stand against Israel on the
foundering peace process.
	   The speech marked the first time that Iraq has made use of its
recently rented channel on a new Egyptian satellite.
	   Last year, the Saudi-based operators of the ArabSat satellite,
which is owned by several Arab states, rejected Iraq's request for
a channel. Turkey has also refused Iraq permission to rent a slot
on its private satellites.
	   But Egypt agreed to lease a channel to Baghdad on its
French-built Nilesat 101, which was launched in May.
	   Iraqi diplomats said Friday the new service will initially
broadcast three hours of programs a day to the Middle East and
North Africa. They did not say how Iraq will pay for the channel.
	   Cairo's relations with Iraq have improved since Baghdad stepped
up its imports from Egypt under the oil-for-food program. The
program allows Iraq to bypass the sanctions and sell limited
amounts of oil in order to buy food, medicine and humanitarian
goods.

Greek UN ambassador: Invitation not part of Security Council bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's invitation for a visit to the
country extended to United Nations delegates is completely
unrelated to its candidacy for a seat on the UN Security Council,
Greece's ambassador to the UN said Friday.
	   ``There has been a misunderstanding which I would like to
clarify,'' Christos Zacharakis said. ``These two issues are
completely unrelated.''
	   Press reports have implied that the offer of a week-long visit
is part of Greece's lobbying in its bid for a two-year seat in the
Security Council.
	   Canada and the Netherlands are also vying for the two seats for
1999 and 2000. The UN General Assembly is due to vote on the bids
in October.
	   ``The invitations were extended by the Greek Olympic Committee
and concern the Olympic Truce only,'' Zacharakis said, adding that
the Committee took the initiative on the occasion of Athens'
successful bid to host the Olympic Games in 2004.
	   Greece's Deputy Foreign Minister, George Papandreou, has
proposed the establishment of an ``Olympic Truce'' under which
warring nations would cease hostilities during the Olympic Games.
	   The invitation ``is an initiative which aims at the general
promotion of Greece and does not concern the Security Council
bid,'' Zacharakis said.
	   A total of 110 out of more than 180 chief UN delegates have
accepted the invitation and are visiting Greece in two groups. The
first is due to leave the country on Sunday, while the second will
arrive on Monday, Zacharakis noted.
	   Greece has been a non-permanent member of the council once
before in 1993-5. It has applied for a seat twice since then, but
was unsuccessful one time and withdrew its bid the other. Canada
has held a seat five times, and the Netherlands four.

Cipollini wins 6th stage; Festina officials moved to Lille

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES WITH day's stage; Festina officials moved from Cholet
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHATEAUROUX, France (AP) _ Mario Cipollini won for the second
consecutive day by taking Friday's sixth stage as the Tour de
France tried to distance itself for the drug scandal that is
rocking the cycling race.
	   The sixth stage moved from La Chatre to Brive-La Gaillarde, 204
kilometers (127 miles). More than that, it is two days removed from
Cholet, where the drug drama accelerated when two Festina officials
were taken into police custody.
	   After being questioned in police custory since Wednesday
evening, Festina team director Bruno Roussel and team doctor Erik
Ryckaert were moved to Lille Friday. There, they were expected to
have a confrontation with Willy Voet, a Festina team massuer who
was arrested in a Festina car with performance-enhancing drurich
won by more than nine minutes over Richard Virenque, a member of
the Festina team.
	   Virenque had Voet as his personal trainer and won the top
climber award of the Tour the last four years.
	   Last week police found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO in
Voet's car with Festina emblems. Voet, a Belgian, has been in jail
near Lille since the discovery. At first Voet was reported to have
said the drugs were for his personal use. Then he changed his story
saying he was under team orders.
	   Roussel and Ryckaert were taken to Lille Friday, where a court
is investigating the case. They were to appear before a magistrate,
and likely would be placed under formal investigation, judicial
sources said on customary anonymity.
	   The daily Le Parisien reported Friday that Roussel and Ryckaert
were implicated in another doping case that came to light in
Belgium in December 1997.
	   It said the names of both officials came up in an investigation
that began when the Belgian Department of Social Security suspected
that a pharmacist was diverting the drug EPO.
	   EPO is a substance that allows the better transport of oxygen
within the blood stream.

John Huston uses magnetism at British Open

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ John Huston's magnets work on this
side of the Atlantic, too.
	   Huston started sleeping on a magnet-laced mattress cover six
months ago to relieve aching bursitis and tendinitis. He's played
some of his best golf since then, including a 5-under-65 Thursday
to share the first-round lead of the British Open with Tiger Woods.
	   ``Last year, pretty much every day, I would get up and wouldn't
feel very strong, kind of achey,'' the 37-year-old American said.
``I didn't look forward to going to the golf course, and it
showed.''
	   His played slipped Friday, however, as the wind picked up at
Royal Birkdale. He lost the lead after a bogey on the first hole
and a double bogey on No. 5.
	   Huston won his first tour event in four years this season _ the
Hawaiian Open _ and has five top-10 finishes to go with it. Now
he's doing well in the British Open, where he's missed the cut
twice and never finished better than 31st.

Haas stuns Bjorkman as Germany leads Sweden 1-0 in Davis Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Tommy Haas upset Jonas Bjorkman Friday
in straight sets to give a young German team a 1-0 lead over
defending champion Sweden in Davis Cup play.
	   The 20-year-old Haas, despite his inexperience, proved to be
cooler on the court from the start against the world's ninth-ranked
player in the quarterfinal matchup.
	   Haas fended off two set points in the final set and clinched the
easy 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 victory in two hours, 18 minutes when
Bjorkman's forehand sailed long.
	   ``He showed how good he can be. That was sensational of Haas,
beating the world No. 9 here,'' said German Davis Cup captain
Carl-Uwe Steeb of his promising player, ranked 39th.
	   Germany's Nicolas Kiefer faces Thomas Enqvist, the world No. 18,
in the second singles Friday of a matchup pitting two traditional
powers in Davis Cup.
	   Sweden is a six-time champion, while Germany has won three
trophies.
	   Bjorkman appeared to be on the verge of turning around the match
in the final set, but let a 5-4 lead and two set points slip away
against the German, who was backed up by 12,000 roaring fans.
	   After Haas broke back, the nervous-looking Bjorkman struggled in
the final game and set up match point with a double fault.
	   Haas, who ousted Andre Agassi at Wimbledon, said before the
match he had no fears of playing the favored Swedish Top 10 player.
	   ``The spectators are very, very important to me. And the public
will be on my side,'' said Haas.
	   Bjorkman will have to shake off the lopsided loss in time for
Saturday's doubles, when he and Nicklas Kulti team up against Boris
Becker and David Prinosil.

U.S. and Israeli authorities probe sale of church property
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli and U.S. police are investigating the
possibly fraudulent sale of Roman Catholic Church property worth
millions of dollars to an Israeli businessman, police said Friday.
	   The probe began after the custodian of church properties in the
Middle East, Father Joseph Lazaro, said his signature had been
forged on a sales contract involving 30 acres of olive groves owned
by the church in the central Israeli town of Ramle.
	   In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, lands sales
are much more than real estate transactions.
	   In the campaign to claim as much land as possible for a future
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Palestinian
Authority forbids the sale of land to Jews.
	   The Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, which have vast
land holdings both in Israel and the West Bank, have also been
careful not to violate that prohibition, in part because most of
their flock are Palestinians.
	   Israeli police are investigating the authenticity of a document
with Lazaro's signature which claims a Christian resident of Ramle
was authorized by a Franciscan group in Chicago to sell the
property, said Israeli police spokeswoman Leah Zohar.
	   Khoury would not say how much money was involved in the sale,
but said the land is worth several million dollars.

 &UR; Political will lacking to pursue high-level corruption
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with four final grafs on reaction from Rubin &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE MWANGI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Everyone knows who is involved in
high-level corruption in Kenya, but the political will and the
means are lacking to pursue it, politicians and business leaders
said Friday.
	   ``Those of us who know who the corrupt people are, are also the
ones sitting on that anti-corruption commission,'' legislator
Charity Ngilu, a 1997 presidential candidate, said during a
question and answer session after U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin spoke at the Kenya Institute of Monetary Studies.
	   ``The few big corrupt people have to be named and taken to
court,'' the opposition legislator said.
	   Attorney General Amos Wako told participants he lacks trained
personnel to investigate complex corruption cases and appealed to
the United States for technical expertise to train investigators.
	   To combat corruption and and attract investment, Rubin said in
his address, developing countries need clear laws and regulations
that are fairly and easily enforced, honest, well-trained
regulators and judges and anti-corruption units with real power to
crack down on corrupt practices.
	   ``Part of the problem we have is the capacity of our
investigation team to be able to investigate complex cases of
corruption adequately and prove it in court,'' Wako said.
	   He said President Daniel arap Moi's government was preparing new
legislation to deal with corruption because present laws were
outdated.
	   ``The disease (corruption) has gone very deep, and we must get
out of it, otherwise we will perish'' said Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae. ``The message the secretary (Rubin) is giving us is that,
it is not him who is going to deal with our corruption, it is up to
us to deal with our weaknesses.''
	   Kenya Manufacturers Association chairman Chris Kirubi said
corruption is often facilitated by outsiders.
	   ``America may have done something to discourage corruption, but
others have not,'' he said.
	   He disagreed with the policy of cutting off development aid to
punish a country like Kenya for corrupt practices.
	   ``Switching off the tap ... has not taught us to be
transparent,'' he said. ``It is not necessary to bring us to our
knees.''
	   Last year the International Monetary Fund froze a dlrs 220
million structural adjustment loan to Kenya, and the World Bank is
withholding other funds because of the government's failure to deal
with corruption.
	   Rubin later told reporters he had been impressed by the
commitment of top Kenyan officials and businessman to combating
corruption and said he was encouraged by an openness not seen
before in Kenya.
	   ``This (the question-and-answer session) was in many ways one of
my more remarkable experiences in the time I have been Secretary of
the Treasury,'' he said.
	   ``What we had was a very open, very lively and very candid
discussion of a subject that two or three years ago we would not
have discussed in a public forum. I think the way in which it was
received was remarkable. It seems to me that it provides real hope
for progress.''

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A Bulgarian air force MIG-21 lost power
and crashed while approaching a military airfield in northeastern
Bulgaria but the pilot bailed out safely, officials said Friday.
	   The accident happened during a routine training flight late

Kyrgyzstan set to join WTO as negotiations conclude
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan is set to
become the first former Soviet republic to join the World Trade
Organization once a set of formalities are completed, the WTO said
Friday.
	   Kyrgyzstan and the WTO agreed terms for the country's entry,
paving the way for it to become the WTO's 133rd member.
	   The decision is being passed on to the trade body's general
council for approval and must also be ratified by Kyrgyzstan, which
first applied for membership in early 1996.
	   The process was ``greatly accelerated'' by Kyrgyzstan's
``willingness ... to bring its economic and trade obligations into
conformity with WTO rules and obligations as rapidly as possible,''
by putting relevant legislation in place, the WTO said in a
statement. It did not give details.
	   Trade officials said Kyrgyzstan agreed to reduce import tariffs
on goods including some energy products, chemicals and paper.
	   It also committed itself to open international and long-distance
telephone services to foreign suppliers by Jan. 1, 2003, and to
lift a 49 percent equity limit for foreigners in insurance
companies by January 2002, they said.
	   Kyrgyzstan, with a population of some 4 1/2 million, borders
China, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan _ all of which are among 31 more
countries whose WTO applications are being considered _ and
Tajikistan.

Taliban &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD comment on poppy problem, TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ International aid organizations are
drafting a letter to Afghanistan's Taliban rulers explaining why
they cannot work effectively under the hard-line religious
government's growing list of edicts, sources said.
	   The draft, still in its early stages, was to be sent to Taliban
authorities before a Sunday deadline requiring aid workers to begin
moving into abandoned university dormitories on the outskirts of
Kabul, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   Twenty-one organizations were working on the draft, but it
wasn't known if all would approve it. Groups that work in
Afghanistan include Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders and Care
International.
	   Aid groups have protested the relocation order and some have
threatened to leave the capital, Kabul. The European Union,
Afghanistan's largest donor, funnels money through the aid groups
and has warned Taliban authorities against enforcing the edict.
	   The former seminarians have imposed a harsh version of Islamic
rule in the 85 percent of the country they control. The edicts bar
girls from schools and keep women from the workplace. Men are
beaten if they shave or refuse to wear a head covering.
	   The Taliban has said it wanted to relocate the aid workers to
the dormitories for their safety, but the aid organizations contend
that being housed together actually presents a security risk by
making them easy targets.
	   U.N. agencies are not subject to the relocation order, but the
chief U.N. envoy to the country, Lakhdar Brahimi, said Tuesday that
the United Nations was coming under increasing pressure from donors
to withdraw its 60 international workers from the country.
	   Despite strained relations, U.N. and Taliban officials began
talks this week on implementing some aspects of a May agreement on
humanitarian aid.
	   ``There has been no major change, but there has been progress in
that the Taliban has learned that they have to come to terms with
the international community,'' Alfredo Witschi-Cestari, the U.N.
coordinator for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, said in an
interview here.
	   The Taliban's U.S. representative, Noorullah Zadran, said the
Taliban was also growing impatient with the United Nations over a
crop substitution program to reduce poppy production in the
country.
	   Of a dlrs 16 million U.N. budget, only dlrs 1.8 was designated
for a program near Jalalabad and dlrs 3.8 for one near Helman. The
remaining dlrs 11 went for administrative costs, he said.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ The head of Ivory Coast's National
Treasury has been arrested, newspaper reports said Friday. No
reason was given for his arrest.
	   Julien Bouadou was arrested Thursday by special police, then
brought before a magistrate court for questioning, Le Jour
newspaper reported. He was later taken to Abidjan's central prison,
the paper said.
	   Le Jour said officials had linked Boadu to Lebanese businessman
Roger Nasra, who allegedly tried to defraud the Ivorian government
of millions of dollars. Seven other people have already been
arrested for ties to Nasra.
	   In May, Nasra, 36, was extradited from France where he had
sought refuge nearly two years after he escaped custody in Ivory
Coast in April 1996. On his arrival, he was immediately jailed in a
maximum security prison.
	   -----
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The head of the Organization of African
Unity is meeting with Nigeria's new military leader Friday to
appeal for the leader to seize the chance to better his country.
	   ``Despite the sad moment, we hope everyone, every Nigerian, will
make good use of this opportunity,'' Salim Ahmed Salim said in
Lagos on Thursday night, as he prepared to leave for Abuja, the
capital.
	   The head of the African body noted that as the most populous and
one of the wealthiest nations on the continent, Nigeria has a
special responsibility.
	   ``What affects Nigeria is not only the business of Nigeria.
Whatever happens here concerns all of Africa. We all have a stake
in this country.''
	   Abubakar took power in Nigeria last month after the death of
Gen. Sani Abacha, whose five-year rule was marked by brutality,
corruption and the collapse of the country's economy.
	   Last week, Nigeria was rocked with riots after the death of
Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of annulled presidential
elections in 1993 and the nation's best-known political prisoner.
	   -----
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria is to replace its Liberian-based
soldiers in the West African peacekeeping force with fresh troops,
the defense spokesman has announced.
	   Addressing reporters Thursday in the commercial capital Lagos,
Col. Godwin Ugbo said the country's three battalions stationed in
Liberia would return by the end of the month for immediate
replacement. The three thousand or so soldiers would be received by
their training commanders for briefing, Ugbo said.
	   Soldiers from the peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, were sent
to Liberia in 1990, a year after the country plunged into a bloody
civil war which lasted seven and a half years.
	   The Nigerian troops in question have served for three years in
Liberia and helped to oversee elections last year.
	   They remained in Liberia to help warlord-turned-President
Charles Taylor train a new army and police force.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A dispute over stolen mortars and sales
of weapons and equipment to the Democratic Republic of Congo that
weren't paid for have forced the state arms maker to start a
gardening and poultry project in its back yard.
	   Col. Tshinga Dube, chief executive of Zimbabwe Defense
Industries, said delayed payments left the arms maker with cash
flow problems and a shortage of raw materials.
	   Workers started gardening and raising chickens to generate
income and avoid retrenchments, he told the weekly Independent
newspaper.
	   The paper said ZDI was owed about 30 million Zimbabwe dollars
(dlrs 1.7 million) by Sri Lanka and the Congolese government.
	   Twelve containers of mortars were hijacked at sea on their way
to Sri Lanka last year, apparently by Tamil rebels. The ship has
never been traced.
	   The commerce ministry has urged Zimbabwean businesses to
continue trading with Congo-Kinshasa despite late payment of
accounts.
	   ------
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ A junior police officer has been
arrested for allegedly insulting President Bakili Muluzi, according
to a news report.
	   First Sergeant Ntawale was said to have uttered unspecified
``bad words'' about Muluzi in a radio message when he complained he
was shortchanged on extra duty allowances, The Daily Times
reported.
	   It said Ntawale received 1,100 kwacha (dlrs 44) instead of the
1,500 kwacha (dlrs 60) he was expecting for extra patrols to combat
a crime wave in Blantyre, the commercial capital.
	   The Daily Times said the arrest came after junior police
officers asked opposition Malawi Congress Party lawmakers raise
their grievances over poor pay and conditions in parliament.
	   They claimed subsistence, transfer and vacation grants were
outstanding since 1995.
	   Police spokesman Oliver Soko said ranking officers were
unsympathetic because the men should have pursued their demands
through official police channels.
	   A police constable in Malawi earns 1,430 kwacha (dlrs 57) a
month.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Mauritian Minister of Finance Vasant
Kumar Bunwaree said his government has approved a package to
finance Mauritian businessmen who want to invest in Mozambique.
	   Bunwaree, on a three-day visit to Mozambique, said Thursday that
during his stay he will study and discuss three areas of investment
- agriculture, industry and fisheries -- with the Maputo government
and Mozambican businessmen.
	   His discussions with the government of President Joaquim
Chissano will also focus on ways to facilitate air transport
between Mozambique and Mauritius.
	   -----
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Ling Letsie III attended a celebration
Friday marking his 35th birthday.
	   A 21-gun salute marked the start of the celebration at a stadium
where the king inspect the guard of honor before a crowd of about
25,000 people.
	   His arrival at the stadium was met with cheering and ululation.
However, a group of Basotho National Party supporters tried to
disrupt the celebration by chanting party slogans and calling the
prime minister a usurper.
	   Security force members at the celebrations ignored the protest.
	   -----
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Minister of Public Works and Housing
Roberto White says the gigantic Roads and Coastal Shipping project
largely funded by the World Bank is not sustainable.
	   Whie said Thursday that the project that began in 1992 has
already gone through two phases, spent hundreds of millions of
dollars and has not produced a sustainable trunk road network.
	   The minister, speaking before a Parliamentary committeee, blamed
the failure on policies imposed by donors and ruinous management by
building contractors.
	   Under pressure from insistent questioning by the
parliamentarians as to why key routes between provinces and between
districts remain impassable, White said the state has a very feeble
ability to supervise road building work, because it has so few
trained staff in this area.
	   -----
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Sweden has agreed to finance two rural
electrification projects in the northern province of Nampula.
	   The two governments signed an agreement on Thursday in Maputo
for the project that will cost dlrs 2 million.
	   The power for the rural electrification program countrywide
comes from the Cahora Bassa Hydro-electric dam in the northwestern
province of Tete.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ International aid organizations are
drafting a letter to Afghanistan's Taliban rulers explaining why
they cannot work effectively under the hard-line religious
government's growing list of edicts, sources said.
	   The draft, still in its early stages, was to be sent to Taliban
authorities before a Sunday deadline requiring aid workers to begin
moving into abandoned university dormitories on the outskirts of
Kabul, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   Twenty-one organizations were working on the draft, but it
wasn't known if all would approve it. Groups that work in
Afghanistan include Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders and Care
International.
	   Aid groups have protested the relocation order and some have
threatened to leave the capital, Kabul. The European Union,
Afghanistan's largest donor, funnels money through the aid groups
and has warned Taliban authorities against enforcing the edict.
	   The former seminarians have imposed a harsh version of Islamic
rule in the 85 percent of the country they control. The edicts bar
girls from schools and keep women from the workplace. Men are
beaten if they shave or refuse to wear a head covering.
	   The Taliban has said it wanted to relocate the aid workers to
the dormitories for their safety, but the aid organizations contend
that being housed together actually presents a security risk by
making them easy targets.
	   U.N. agencies are not subject to the relocation order, but the
chief U.N. envoy to the country, Lakhdar Brahimi, said Tuesday that
the United Nations was coming under increasing pressure from donors
to withdraw its 60 international workers from the country.
	   Despite strained relations, U.N. and Taliban officials began
talks this week on implementing some aspects of a May agreement on
humanitarian aid.
	   ``There has been no major change, but there has been progress in
that the Taliban has learned that they have to come to terms with
the international community,'' Alfredo Witschi-Cestari, the U.N.
coordinator for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, said in an
interview here.
	   The Taliban's U.S. representative, Noorullah Zadran, said the
Taliban was also growing impatient with the United Nations over a
crop substitution program to reduce poppy production in the
country.
	   Of a dlrs 16 million U.N. budget, only dlrs 1.8 was designated
for a program near Jalalabad and dlrs 3.8 for one near Helman. The
remaining dlrs 11 went for administrative costs, he said.

Death threats reported against chaplains urging end to march

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Death threats have been
reported against three chaplains who had appealed for an end to a
Protestant demonstration over a blocked march after three young
brothers died in a sectarian firebombing.
	   The Rev. Robert Coulter, one of the three clergy from the Orange
Order, a Protestant fraternal organization, said Friday that he had
reason to believe the threats were the work of cranks. But another,
the Rev. Warren Porter, said police were taking them seriously.
	   ``They came to tell us in the middle of the night, but I am not
particularly worried about it,'' Porter said. ``You just never
know. But there is one above all of us who will determine the day I
die.''
	   The third chaplain receiving threats was the Rev. William
Bingham, the first Orange Order member to declare that a march down
the Catholic Garvaghy Road in Portadown, about 25 miles (40 kms)
southwest of Belfast, would be a ``hollow victory'' in the shadow
of three coffins.
	   Bingham refused comment, and the police would provide no
information.
	   The Orange Order issued a statament saying it was ``deeply
shocked'' at reports of the threats, adding, ``We again condemn all
threats of violence and acts of intimidation against any person,
regardless of denomination or occupation.''
	   Tensions spilling over from the blocked march were blamed for
the Sunday morning firebombing that took the lives of Richard, Mark
and Jason Quinn in Ballymoney, 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of
Belfast.
	   On Friday, police arrested four more people in connection with
the deaths. Three other suspects remained in custody.
	   Authorities say they believe the Quinn household _ located in a
staunchly Protestant housing complex _ was targeted because the
boys' Catholic mother lived there with her Protestant boyfriend.

Chirac discusses joint peace efforts with Assad

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ There will never be peace in the Middle East
without active Syrian involvement _ and France wants to be
involved, too, President Jacques Chirac said Friday after talks
with Hafez Assad.
	   ``Our concern is peace,'' Chirac said after meeting the Syrian
president for a second time, terming the talks ``very positive.''
Assad is on an extremely rare visit to the West.
	   On another, more sticky issue for the two nations, Assad told
Chirac Friday that ``to his knowledge,'' Alois Brunner _ one of the
world's most-wanted Nazi war criminals _ is not in Syria, the
French president's spokeswoman said.
	   Brunner, a top Nazi operative who once was commandant of the
squalid French transit camp at Drancy, is the subject of a French
judicial investigation. Chirac asked that Syria finally respond
officially to the French investigation, and Assad said he would
``examine the issue,'' said French spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
	   Brunner has long been believed to be hiding out in Syria.
	   Leaving a second round of talks with the Syrian leader, Chirac
made clear the importance he places on Syria's role in the peace
process _ and how he wants France to have a role, too.
	   ``We know very well that there won't be peace in the region
without the active participation of Syria,'' Chirac said.
	   ``Consequently, we want to combine our efforts, France and
Syria, to attain our objective.''
	   He was referring to the objective of Mideast peace, but it's
also clear that France wants to be a player in the peace process,
and to counter-balance the heavy weight of the United States.
	   France has special leverage with Syria, partly because the Arab
nation was once a French-mandated territory, from 1920-1946.
	   Assad, too, seeks a partnership with another country that would
balance Israel's alliance with Washington.
	   The United States has accused Syria of sponsoring international
terrorism, a charge that Damascus denies.
	   Standing beside Chirac, Assad praised the efforts of ``France
and other countries'' toward peace, but said that up to now, ``they
haven't borne fruit.''
	   ``If there is a peaceful initiative Syria will be present, but
it has to be in accord with our fundamental demands,'' he said.
Assad refuses to negotiate with Israel unless it returns the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
	   It's been 22 years since Assad visited France, and he's been to
the West only a couple of times in the past decade.
	   The first round of talks Thursday between the two presidents
went on for two hours and 40 minutes _ considerably longer than
expected.
	   Among Arab nations, there is a growing interest in greater
European diplomacy. French intervention in the region has
occasionally advanced the process where American policy failed.
	   On Friday, following his talks with Chirac, Assad attended a
luncheon at the Foreign Ministry, where he was greeted by Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   In a speech, Jospin said ``the initial spirit (of the peace
process) must be recovered.''
	   He said France ``recognized Syria's right to see its sovereignty
fully restored over the Golan Heights.''
	   But he also said Israel's security concerns ``are legitimate,
and must be satisfied.''
	   Assad was to close his trip with a visit to the Institute of the
Arab World, in Paris, and was to leave France on Saturday morning.

Kyrgyzstan set to join WTO as negotiations conclude
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan is set to
become the first former Soviet republic to join the World Trade
Organization once formalities are completed, the WTO said Friday.
	   Kyrgyzstan and the WTO agreed on terms for the country's entry,
paving the way for it to become the WTO's 133rd member.
	   The decision goes on to the trade body's general council for
approval and must also be ratified by Kyrgyzstan, which applied for
membership in early 1996.
	   The process was ``greatly accelerated'' by Kyrgyzstan's
``willingness ... to bring its economic and trade obligations into
conformity with WTO rules and obligations as rapidly as possible,''
by putting relevant legislation in place, the WTO said in a
statement. It did not give details.
	   Trade officials said Kyrgyzstan agreed to reduce import tariffs
on goods including some energy products, chemicals and paper.
	   It also committed itself to open international and long-distance
telephone services to foreign suppliers by Jan. 1, 2003, and to
lift a 49 percent equity limit for foreigners in insurance
companies by January 2002, they said.
	   Kyrgyzstan, with a population of about 4.5 million, borders
China, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, which are among 31 other countries
which WHO is considering for membership, and Tajikistan.

Fog hampers Atlantic search for plane carrying two Swedes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to CORRECT that missing pair are Swiss, not

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Thick fog hampered search crews
hunting Friday for two Swiss people who disappeared during a
transatlantic flight to Newfoundland.
	   Three ships and two aircraft using radar were scouring an area
about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Newfoundland for the
man and woman, who were flying a single-engine, home-made plane
from the Azores.
	   Last radio contact was late Tuesday night. There was no distress
call from the pair, who had a life raft aboard the plane.
	   ``The trouble we're having now is the fog bank is forecast to
persist until late Sunday and possibly even Monday,'' said Capt.
David Cameron, an air controller at the Halifax search and rescue
center. ``Until we can get at least a good day of visual searching
done, we'll continue searching with just the radar coverage.''
	   Coast guard ships, as well as more than a dozen commercial
vessels passing through the area, have contributed to the search
effort.
	   The plane was carrying about 8{ hours worth of fuel for a flight
that should have taken six hours. It was headed for an air show in
the United States. The trip to Newfoundland was the first leg of
the flight.
	   The names of the missing were not released. Initial reports said
the pair were Swedish, but the rescue center said this was due to a
misunderstanding.

Draft treaty rebuffs key U.S. demands on permanent war crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Negotiators wrangling over the shape of the world's
first permanent war crimes tribunal mustered their forces Friday
for the final battle over the historic treaty.
	   Delegates from 160 countries faced a midnight (2200 GMT)
deadline to adopt the treaty, which was under heavy fire from the
United States.
	   As envisioned, the international criminal court would bring
individuals to justice for genocide, crimes against humanity, war
crimes and aggression. It would realize a dream born 50 years ago
with the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals.
	   ``I think this is a great, historic achievement,'' said Benjamin
Ferencz, 78, who was a prosecutor at Nuremberg and has worked ever
since for a permanent tribunal.
	   The carefully crafted compromise emerged early Friday morning
after weeks of tough negotiations and strenuous American
objections.
	   With U.S. troops deployed in hot spots around the world,
Washington fears they could become targets of politically motivated
charges.
	   As the deadline approached, the compromise appeared to be
gaining wide support, but behind-the-scenes maneuvering by all
sides to add _ or delete _ key provisions continued.
	   The draft was already full of concessions and proponents feared
any tinkering might unravel the whole deal.
	   The list of crimes, for example, was expanded to add aggression,
which the non-aligned nations had sought. In a nod to the five
nuclear powers on the U.N. Security Council, it omits any specific
mention of nuclear weapons. A proviso on war crimes addresses
French concerns.
	   The draft rebuffed many of Washington's demands _ demands that
many countries, including its closest allies, and human rights
groups said could cripple the court.
	   The United States failed to block the creation of an independent
prosecutor or insert a loophole that could exempt U.S. citizens and
soldiers.
	   The U.S. delegation expressed disappointment at the draft treaty
and it would continue negotiating down to the wire.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said he hoped U.S.
opposition would remain ``benign.''
	   ``We don't expect them to sign,'' he said, ``but at least if
they aren't aggressively opposed...''
	   The treaty includes ``safeguards upon safeguards upon
safeguards'' for American soldiers, he insisted.
	   Canada is a key player in the U.N. talks.
	   Another major player is a broad coalition of 800 citizen groups
from around the world, which said it would fight to the final
moments to revise the draft.
	   The coalition worked for an independent prosecutor, the
inclusion of crimes of sexual violence and internal conflicts,
victims' rights, and a host of other issues.
	   Despite their victories on these fronts, however, they found
plenty to criticize in the draft treaty about the scope of the
court's jurisdiction and a provision allowing countries to ``opt
out'' of the war crimes clauses for the first seven years.
	   ``This is a treaty that traveling tyrants will be very
comfortable with,'' said Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch.
	   Under the draft, a case could be triggered by the prosecutor, by
a country or by the U.N. Security Council.
	   The court would need the permission either of the nation where
the crime was committed or the suspect's home country. Human rights
and legal groups wanted to add the country where a ``traveling
tyrant'' might be hiding out to widen the court's reach.

Russia's last czar laid to rest, Yeltsin calls for reconciliation

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ With the scent of incense hanging
in the air, Russia buried its last czar Friday in a somber ceremony
that Boris Yeltsin called an atonement for ``one of the most
shameful pages of our history.''
	   On the 80th anniversary of the executions of the Russian royal
family, nine wooden coffins with the bones of Czar Nicholas II, his
wife, daughters and servants were lowered into one large crypt
beneath the floor of the gilded, 18th-century, St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral.
	   ``We have long been silent about this monstrous crime,'' Yeltsin
said of the executions, carried out by Bolshevik revolutionaries at
the dawn of the communist era. ``Guilty are those who committed
this heinous crime, and those who have been justifying it for
decades, all of us.''
	   In a powerful speech, the Russian president said the burial
should serve as a catalyst for national reconciliation in a country
that's lurched from one upheaval to another during the 20th century
_ from revolution and civil war, to famine, political purges and
the collapse of the Soviet empire.
	   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Yeltsin has not advocated restoring the Russian monarchy,
although he has long spoken of the need for the country to reclaim
its long-suppressed history and condemn communist abuses. He has
never publicly said what he believes the czar's fate should have
been.
	   The burial was officiated by a dozen bearded priests in
gold-and-white robes, with one gently swinging a censer that sent
small puffs of burning incense wafting over the coffins.
	   Dozens of the czar's relatives, diplomats from 50 countries, and
Prince Michael of Kent, a member of the British royal family, which
is related to Russian royalty, stood and held lit candles at the
cathedral on the banks of the Neva River.
	   The czar's family members tossed white sand, representing the
earth, onto the coffins before the crypt was covered. Outside on
the river bank, cannons boomed in a 19-shot salute _ two shy of the
customary 21 because the czar abdicated a year before he was
killed.
	   ``We must tell the truth _ the (czar's) massacre has become one
of the most shameful pages of our history,'' Yeltsin said. ``By
burying the remains of the innocent victims we want to expiate the
sins of our ancestors.''
	   As the ceremony drew to a close, Yeltsin clasped the hands of
Nicholas Romanov, the most prominent of the czar's relatives at the
service, and they spoke briefly.
	   With its understated dignity, the burial was in sharp contrast
to the months of controversy that preceded it.
	   Many leading Russian figures, including the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church, skipped the service due to multiple disputes it
generated. Yeltsin was planning to stay away as well, but changed
his mind and announced Thursday he would participate.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917, the Romanov dynasty, and the nature of national guilt and
contrition.
	   The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but Russia has not
previously held any major, formal ceremonies dealing with the
abuses committed during communist times. Friday's service brought
the issue to the fore.
	   ``This is not just a funeral, but a national repentance,'' said
Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the world's leading conductors and
cellists, who was exiled during the Soviet era.
	   ``It shows the entire world that Russia is changing and becoming
more humane,'' he said on Russian television.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   But the burial also raised controversies. The Orthodox Church,
as well as some ordinary Russians, have questioned the authenticity
of the remains despite extensive DNA testing in the United States,
Russia and Britain.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony was
relatively simple. When the coffins were interred, the priest did
not use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques
were on the walls of the chapel.
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for three centuries. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
his wife, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   Nine of the 11 bodies were recovered in 1991 from a desolate
forest outside the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. Two
skeletons have never been found _ Alexei, the czar's only son and a
daughter that scientists believe was Maria. Most investigators
believe their bodies were burned to ashes by their killers.

Gazza has words of comfort for sent-off star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) _ His own career scarred by wild
behavior on and off the field, England outcast Paul Gascoigne
Friday offered words of encouragement to disgraced star David
Beckham.
	   Manchester United midfielder Beckham has been widely blamed for
England's World Cup elimination because of his sending-off against
Argentina in a second-round game.
	   ``He knows more than anybody else that he made a mistake,''
Gascoigne said. ``He's got to take the flak that's coming his way,
get on with things and prove to everybody he is a quality player.''
	   Beckham's red card happened when England was tied 2-2 with
Argentina. The team was forced to play another 75 minutes with 10
men before losing in a penalty shootout.
	   ``I feel sorry for the young lad,'' said Gascoigne, who now
plays for Middlesbrough. ``He has just got to come back and I'm
sure he is capable of doing that.''
	   Gascoigne, dropped from the World Cup squad because coach Glenn
Hoddle considered him not fit enough, didn't comment on his own
chances of regaining a place on the team at age 31.
	   ``I don't think I've anything to prove to anybody. As far as I'm
concerned I was fit. There was no problem with that. He (Hoddle)
made his decision,'' he told Middlesbrough's ClubCall phoneline.
	   ``I'm over the disappointment of missing out on a place in the
World Cup squad. After a couple of weeks I was OK. I went on
holiday, which was good, and I just enjoyed myself.
	   ``I still watched the games and wished the lads all the best. I
was cheering them on.''

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Now, this is more like the British
Open.
	   Cold rain, then high winds returned to the coast of the Irish
Sea Friday, making life difficult for Tiger Woods and others in the
second round at Royal Birkdale.
	   As the weather took a turn for the worse, so did the games of
many of the first-round leaders, who faltered on the suddenly testy
seaside links.
	   Woods, who began the day with a share of the lead at 5-under 65,
bogeyed three of his first six holes, while first-round co-leader
John Huston was 4 over after 10 holes.
	   Nick Price, playing with Woods, dropped a shot to par after
seven holes and was tied for the lead at 3 under with Japanese tour
player Brian Watts.
	   But the low round of the day belonged to 17-year-old English
amateur Justin Rose, who shot a 66 and suddenly found himself in
contention at 2-under 138.
	   Woods quickly gave back his share of the lead, hitting into a
bunker to bogey the first hole and three-putting the second hole
for another bogey. He then missed the green on the par-4 sixth hole
and ended up with yet another bogey.
	   Woods wasn't the only one having problems. John Daly took a 10
on the 18th hole for a 78, while Tom Lehman did even worse,
shooting a 79. Both were virtually certain to miss the cut.
	   Defending champion Justin Leonard was at 6 over after two
rounds. If he were to miss the cut, too, the last three Open
champions would all have been eliminated from weekend play.
	   It was that kind of a day at Birkdale, which was tame a day
earlier when 41 players equaled or broke par in a first round
played in light winds and warm sun.
	   Fred Couples, after starting the round a stroke behind Woods and
Huston, faltered and needed a birdie on the 18th to finish 4 over
for the day and even for the tournament. Loren Roberts began the
day tied with Couples and finished with a 76, while Davis Love III
shot 73.
	   The leaderboard did contain one surprise. Watts, an American who
plays on the Japanese PGA Tour and has missed the cut in three of
his previous five Opens, shot a 1-under 69 to go with the 68 he had
Thursday.
	   ``I'm really not thinking about winning the golf tournament,''
Watts said.
	   Among the early finishers Friday were Masters champion Mark
O'Meara, who shot a 68 to get to even par, and David Duval, who had
a 71 and was 1 over.
	   ``All day it was hard,'' Duval said. ``I made some good saves,
like everybody is doing. You have to right now.''
	   The weather forced players and fans to bundle up _ Spaniard Jose
Maria Olazabal wore a wool hat pulled down low over his ears.
	   The wind cleared away the rain clouds and picked up strength as
the day went on, sending wayward shots into the deep meadow rye
lining the fairways and greens.
	   The conditions were in stark contrast to the opening round, when
light breezes and warm weather greeted golfers expecting the normal
wind and rain on the northwest coast of England.
	   One player who won't have to deal with the tough conditions is
1995 PGA champion Steve Elkington. The Australian withdrew from the
Open Friday because of a pinched nerve in his neck. He shot a
5-over 75 on Thursday.
	   With Woods and Huston leading the way, Americans dominated the
leaderboard in the opening round.
	   Players who make their living on the friendly courses of the PGA
Tour were right at home on the smooth fairways and soft greens, and
the scores showed it. Eight tour regulars were among the top 10
leaders, and the top five players all live in the United States.
	   In all, 27 golfers broke par and another 14 matched it on a
course that only days earlier generated predictions of U.S.
Open-type scores.
	   Those predictions came when the wind was blowing, however, and
only a breeze blew through the bushes and tall meadow rye Thursday
as Woods took his first lead in a major since winning the 1997
Masters.
	   The sun even came out by midmorning, about the same time that
Woods was making his run.
	   Woods, using a putter given to him by buddy O'Meara, broke out
of the putting slump that has bedeviled him in the majors since his
Masters win. He made four birdie putts on the front nine, and then
ran in a curling 35-footer (10 1/2-meter) on the 13th hole.
	   Woods would have had the lead all to himself but couldn't get
up-and-down from just off the 18th green, missing a 5-footer (1
1/2-meter) for a bogey 5.
	   ``Hopefully, if he continues to putt well I'll get a commission
on some of his rewards,'' said O'Meara, the Masters champion who
opened with a 72.
	   Huston didn't have any new clubs, but he had something even
better _ his magnets.
	   Since January, he has slept on a magnet-laced mattress cover to
try to alleviate bursitis and tendinitis, which forced him into a
deep slump last year and made it painful to play. It seems to be
working.
	   Huston was 2 under when he ran in a 40-foot (12-meter) eagle
putt on 17 and followed it with a spectacular 7-iron out of the
rough to within 3 feet (1 meter) on 18 for a final birdie.
	   European players are more used to playing in foul weather than
the Americans. Instead of trying to simply survive, they were
forced to try and shoot low scores to keep up in the opening round.
	   ``The tough thing was to change all your goals,'' said Swede
Jesper Parnevik, who shot a 68 and was three strokes back. ``From
thinking about a 71, you had to try and shoot a low score.''

Museveni: Uganda's army too small to defeat rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Ugandan army has failed to defeat
rebels operating in the north and the west because it has been
reduced by half, President Yoweri Museveni said Friday.
	   ``In the past, we defeated rebel forces ... by flooding areas of
insurgency with thousands of soldiers,'' Museveni told delegates at
conference of his Movement political organization. ``Now we cannot
do so because the army is small in numbers.''
	   The Movement, a successor to his rebel National Resistance
Movement and the only political group authorized to field
candidates in Uganda, elected Museveni as its leader Monday.
	   Uganda is fighting three separate rebellions in the north,
northwest and west along the border with the Democratic Republic of
the Congo.
	   Museveni seized power in 1986 after a five-year bush war. At its
peak, the army had more than 100,000 troops and went on to defeat
small rebel groups that mushroomed.
	   In early 1990s, donors urged Museveni to trim it down as part of
a reform package to rebuild the country's economy damaged by years
of civil strife.
	   Demobilization began in 1992, and the army is now 40,000 strong.
	   ``The transition from a former liberation force to a small
regular army reduced our capacity to outnumber the rebels,''
Museveni said.
	   He gave no indication whether he plans to make the army larger.
	   The Lord's Resistance Army, the largest rebel group with an
estimated 1,000 Sudan-based fighters, has laid waste to northern
Uganda. The rebels move in small groups, attacking soft targets,
including schools and hospitals.
	   Museveni also repeated the need for an East African government
to which Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania _ all ruled by Britain until
1962.
	   ``I want an East African government, not an East African
cooperation,'' Museveni said.
	   Upon independence, the three nations formed the East African
Community, which collapsed in 1977 due to ideological differences
and economic squabbles. Last year they signed a treaty setting up
the East African Cooperation.
	   Museveni said some of Africa's economic problems are due in
large part to the number of small nations whose economies are not
strong enough to attract foreign investment or provide attractive
markets.

 &UR; Saddam criticizes Arab states for lack of support

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab states should support Iraq in its
campaign against U.N. sanctions rather than uphold the embargo,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in his inaugural satellite
broadcast to the Arab world Friday.
	   In an apparent reference to the United States and Britain,
Saddam blamed ``enemies'' for the eight years of sanctions that the
U.N. Security Council first imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait.
	   ``My Arab brothers, the principled position should be that which
brings us to justice ... and not to seek the satisfaction of the
foreigner and the enemies of the (Arab) nation,'' Saddam said in a
speech marking the 30th anniversary of his Baath Party's seizure of
power.
	   Saddam referred to the suffering caused by the sanctions _
widespread malnutrition among children, inflation and shortages _
in a bid to play to Arab sympathy for Iraq's 22 million people.
	   ``Iraqis know that they are paying the price for their
sacrifices ... and their stance of righteousness ... but they do so
willingly because they are seeking the peaks and not the shallow
valleys,'' he said.
	   In recent months, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf have toured Arab states
in an attempt to persuade their leaders to defy the U.N. embargo
against Iraq.
	   ``Go back to justice, my (Arab) brothers so that justice will
come back to you,'' Saddam said.
	   The Iraqi president did not name any Arab state or leader, but
he indirectly criticized Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians when he
rebuked those Arab peoples that had made peace with Israel, which
he labeled ``the greedy enemy and the usurper of (Arab) land.''
	   He also ridiculed Arab leaders for their failure to convene an
Arab summit to forge a united stand against Israel on the
foundering peace process.
	   The speech marked the first time that Iraq has made use of its
recently rented channel on a new Egyptian satellite.
	   Last year, the Saudi-based operators of the ArabSat satellite,
which is owned by several Arab states, rejected Iraq's request for
a channel. Turkey has also refused Iraq permission to rent a slot
on its private satellites.
	   But Egypt agreed to lease a channel to Baghdad on its
French-built Nilesat 101, which was launched in May.
	   Iraqi diplomats said Friday the new service will initially
broadcast three hours of programs a day to the Middle East and
North Africa. They did not say how Iraq will pay for the channel.
	   Cairo's relations with Iraq have improved since Baghdad stepped
up its imports from Egypt under the oil-for-food program. The
program allows Iraq to bypass the sanctions and sell limited
amounts of oil in order to buy food, medicine and humanitarian
goods.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A team of 15 investigators was
Friday scanning computer disks believed to contain thousands of
digital photographs and videos of child pornography as they sought
to trace members of a Dutch-based international pedophile ring.
	   The investigators, working together with police forces in
Germany and Belgium, were studying disks found in the apartment of
German-born Gerrit Ulrich who was murdered in Italy last month.
	   After his death, Ulrich's family led authorities to the shocking
material which includes ``a number of images of very serious sexual
abuse of children,'' police spokesman Hans Vos said.
	   Some of the victims are believed to be as young as 12 months.
Police suspect that the pornography was distributed to clients all
over the world via the Internet and from a computer store owned by
Ulrich.
	   A search of the store Thursday uncovered no pornography, police
said.
	   Two years ago, the Dutch government increased the maximum
sentence for making or possessing child pornography to six years
imprisonment and is in the process of drafting a law outlining the
criminal liability of Internet providers for the dissemination of
child porn.

Investigation opened into victory night accident

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Paris prosecutors office Friday opened an
investigation into the car accident that killed one person and
injured scores of others during celebrations of France's World Cup
win, a judicial source said.
	   The source, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said
the investigation could lead to charges against a 44-year-old
school teacher for ``involuntary homicide and injury'' and driving
without insurance.
	   The accident occurred in the aftermath of France's 3-0 win over
Brazil in Sunday's World Cup final, when more than a million people
gathered on the famed Champs-Elysees avenue to celebrate.
	   The driver, not identified by name but reported to have been
receiving psychiatric treatment at the time, panicked at the wheel
when boisterous crowds hemmed her in as she left the area about 3
a.m., authorities have said. She simply plowed into the crowd,
injuring about 80 people.
	   One of the injured died Tuesday. Two others remain in critical
condition.
	   After running away from the scene, the driver spent the night
roaming the city, before turning herself into authorities on
Monday. She was placed in a police psychiatric unit.
	   Judicial officials will seek to establish the extent of her
responsibility for the accident before deciding whether to place
her under formal investigation -- a step short of being charged.
	   In another car accident on victory night, a drunken British
lawyer lost control of his car on the Champs-Elysees, slightly
injuring about 10 people.
	   The driver's blood-alcohol level was nearly twice the French
legal limit, police said. He was charged Wednesday with deliberate
violence.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The Paris prosecutors office Friday opened an
investigation into the car accident that killed one person and
injured scores of others during celebrations of France's World Cup
win, a judicial source said.
	   The source, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said
the investigation could lead to charges against a 44-year-old
school teacher for ``involuntary homicide and injury'' and driving
without insurance.
	   The accident occurred in the aftermath of France's 3-0 win over
Brazil in Sunday's World Cup final, when more than a million people
gathered on the famed Champs-Elysees avenue to celebrate.
	   The driver, not identified by name but reported to have been
receiving psychiatric treatment at the time, panicked at the wheel
when boisterous crowds hemmed her in as she left the area about 3
a.m., authorities have said. She simply plowed into the crowd,
injuring about 80 people.
	   One of the injured died Tuesday. Two others remain in critical
condition.
	   After running away from the scene, the driver spent the night
roaming the city, before turning herself into authorities on
Monday. She was placed in a police psychiatric unit.
	   Judicial officials will seek to establish the extent of her
responsibility for the accident before deciding whether to place
her under formal investigation -- a step short of being charged.
	   In another car accident on victory night, a drunken British
lawyer lost control of his car on the Champs-Elysees, slightly
injuring about 10 people.
	   The driver's blood-alcohol level was nearly twice the French
legal limit, police said. He was charged Wednesday with deliberate
violence.

Cipollini wins 6th stage; Festina officials moved to Lille
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES WITH more details on day's stage
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHATEAUROUX, France (AP) _ Mario Cipollini won for the second
consecutive day by taking Friday's sixth stage as the Tour de
France tried to distance itself for the drug scandal that is
rocking the cycling race.
	   The sixth stage moved from La Chatre to Brive-La Gaillarde, 204
kilometers (127 miles). More than that, it is two days removed from
Cholet, where the drug drama accelerated when two Festina officials
were taken into police custody.
	   After being questioned in police custory since Wednesday
evening, Festina team director Bruno Roussel and team doctor Erik
Ryckaert were moved to Lille Friday. There, they were expected to
have a confrontation with Willy Voet, a Festina team massuer who
was arrested in a Festina car with performance-enhancing drugs last
week.
	   Friday's stage was almost a repeat of Thursday with an early
attack followed by a final mass sprint that Cipollini ruled. Second
this time was Nicola Minali, another Italian, with Czech Jan
Svorada third.
	   Cipollini's time for the day was five hours, 5 minutes, 32
seconds but the real racing began in the final kilometers.
	   Stuart O'Grady of Australia held on to the leader's yellow
jersey wg in third in a bonus sprint. That moved him nine seconds
ahead of George Hincapie, the American champion who was hoping to
gain enough for at least one day in the yellow jersey before losing
in in the time trial.
	   He came in fourth in one sprint, just behind O'Grady.
	   ``I guess it wasn't in the cards,'' a disappointed Hincapie
said. ``It's pretty much over.''
	   Germany's Jan Ullrich, last year's champion, is expected to do
well enough to move to the top and re-establish himself as the
rider to beat in this year's event.
	   Last year Ullrich won by more than nine minutes over Richard
Virenque, a member of the Festina team.
	   Virenque had Voet as his personal trainer and won the top
climber award of the Tour the last four years.
	   Last week police found a stash of anabolicin jail near Lille
since the discovery. At first Voet was reported to have said the
drugs were for his personal use. Then he changed his story saying
he was under team orders.
	   Roussel and Ryckaert were taken to Lille Friday, where a court
is investigating the case. They were to appear before a magistrate,
and likely would be placed under formal investigation, judicial
sources said on customary anonymity.
	   The daily Le Parisien reported Friday that Roussel and Ryckaert
were implicated in another doping case that came to light in
Belgium in December 1997.
	   It said the names of both officials came up in an investigation
that began when the Belgian Department of Social Security suspected
that a pharmacist was diverting the drug EPO.
	   EPO is a substance that allows the better transport of oxygen
within the blood stream.

Britain's biggest soccer club shows Italian rivals how to make
</HEADLINE>
money

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Britain's biggest Premier League
soccer club, Manchester United, turns over almost as much money as
the top two Italian clubs combined, a survey revealed Friday.
	   A survey by accountancy firm Deloitte and Touche showed the Old
Trafford club had an annual revenue of 87.9 million pounds (dlrs
146 million), compared with the combined turnover of Inter Milan
and Juventus, estimated at 90 million pounds (dlrs 149.4).
	   The survey said merchandising accounted for the major difference
in revenue between Britain's best supported club and its rivals in
Serie A.
	   The survey said the average side in Serie A collected more in
gate receipts and television rights than British clubs, but only
raised 14 percent of revenue through other activities.
	   Manchester United, runners-up in the League last season, raises
39 percent of its revenue through means other than gate takings and
television rights.
	   The survey found the 18 Serie A clubs had a combined turnover of
376.8 million (dlrs 625.5 million), 21 percent lower than the 20
English Premier League teams' total of 455.5 million pounds (dlrs
756 million).
	   Serie A clubs pay about 58 percent of revenue in wages, much
higher than the Premier League clubs, which pay about 47 percent of
revenue in wages.

Benazir Bhutto's husband charged with money laundering
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs, ADDS details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Geneva judge said Friday he has formally
indicted the husband of former Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto on
money-laundering charges and is clearing up details before charging
Ms. Bhutto herself.
	   A few ``questions of procedure'' need to be cleared up before
the former prime minister can be charged, Judge Daniel Devaud said,
adding that he still was trying to determine whether she could
invoke immunity from prosecution because of her elective office.
	   He said the indictment against Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali
Zardari, was issued a few days ago and that he had yet to confirm
whether Pakistani officials had received it.
	   The charging of Zardari follows the indictment in June of three
Swiss citizens linked to the ex-premier, dismissed in November 1996
on charges of corruption and misrule, which she claims are
concocted by political opponents.
	   Zardari, widely blamed for his wife's downfall, has been jailed
since her dismissal.
	   The Swiss indictment came a day after a Pakistani court issued
an arrest warrant for Ms. Bhutto after she failed to appear in
court in Lahore on a charge of corruption.
	   Ms. Bhutto, who is in the United Arab Emirates, has been ordered
to appear in court on July 27. Ms. Bhutto is accused of failing to
declare some of her assets when she filed her election papers prior
to the February 1997 elections.
	   Indicted in Switzerland last month was Hans J. Fischer, former
senior executive vice-president at Geneva-based Societe Generale de
Surveillance SA, where he was responsible for the company's
government contracts division.
	   The other two indicted were Robert Massey, managing director for
SGS former subsidiary, Cotecna Inspection SA; and Jens
Schlegelmilch, whom Rehman described as a Geneva lawyer who served
as Ms. Bhutto's and her husband's agent in handling financial
transactions.
	   Devaud said bank documents relating to the case in Switzerland
will be handed over to Pakistan in the coming days, following a
Pakistani request for legal assistance.
	   Swiss authorities said last October that they had found about 20
million Swiss francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to
Ms. Bhutto, her mother, Nusrat Bhutto and Zardari frozen in seven
Geneva banks.
	   The Swiss investigation was launched last year.
	   Pakistan's anti-corruption investigator, Saif-ur Rehman, says he
expects to find another dlrs 250 million in banks in Britain and
the United States. Pakistan also is working with authorities in
France, the Netherlands and Spain in the Bhutto case, he said last
month.

Lawmaker demands probe of Russian fugitive's Greek citizenship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THANASSIS CAMBANIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A probe into police corruption took a new
turn Friday when a lawmaker accused officials of twice granting
citizenship to a Russian fugitive who was killed in a possible mob
hit.
	   The accusation comes as police forces and the public order
ministry are under investigation for allegedly accepting kickbacks
to push through residence permits to foreigners.
	   So far no formal charges have been filed. But senior police and
government officials admit there are signs suggesting widespread
corruption in the police forces.
	   The question is: how high in the government will the scandal
extend?
	   In parliament on Friday, a member of the conservative
opposition, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, demanded the government explain
how a known Russian criminal was able to twice obtain citizenship.
	   Pavlopoulos provided documents that show Alexander Solonik, a
Russian convict, received Greek citizenship documents under two
pseudonyms.
	   Solonik escaped in 1995 from a Moscow prison where he was
serving a life sentence for killing four Russian policemen.
	   He was found strangled in a forest outside Athens in February
1997. His slaying has not been solved, but police believe it could
have been a planned hit by a crime ring or by Russian secret
police.
	   Pavlopoulos claimed Solonik had links to the Soviet-era KGB and
worked as a contract killer.
	   ``We're not talking about a maid here,'' Pavlopoulos said.
``We're talking about a Russian mafioso who managed to obtain Greek
citizenship twice.''
	   The corruption probe, opened earlier this month, has focused on
police officers and interior ministry officials who allegedly
accepted bribes to issue residency permits.
	   But Pavlopoulos' question _ directed at the interior minister _
raises the charges to a much higher level.
	   ``It's obvious from the documents that the decisions were issued
at the very least after unforgivable omissions of the authorities
concerned, omissions that at best demonstrate the most serious
negligence,'' Pavlopoulos said.
	   ``I want to know why high officials signed these documents,'' he
added.
	   An interior ministry source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Athens prefecture _ not the ministry _ was
responsible for giving Solonik citizenship. An internal
investigation is under way, the source said.
	   Several other low-level probes have investigated police involved
in drug dealing and protection rackets. But the latest
investigation touches two sensitive issues: illegal immigration and
official corruption.
	   More than 500,000 illegal immigrants live in Greece, and have
been largely blamed for rising crime in the country. But statistics
show Greeks commit the vast majority of offenses.
	   Foreign crime rings from the former Eastern Bloc are believed to
operate throughout Greece, peddling drugs, counterfeit money,
smuggled goods and running prostitution rings.

Virgin Islands from Pakistani government contracts with SGS and
Cotecna.

Chartered Ukrainian plane crashes in Eritrea, 10 believed dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian Defense Ministry cargo plane
chartered by a Bulgarian air company crashed early Friday in the
African nation of Eritrea, and all 10 people on board were believed
dead, officials said.
	   The Il-78 went down near the airport of Asmera at about 4 a.m.
Kiev time (0200 GMT) as it approached the landing strip, a ministry
spokesman said.
	   The plane, flying from Bulgaria to Eritrea, had nine Ukrainian
crew members aboard and one person accompanying an unspecified
cargo, apparently a Bulgarian.
	   The Il-78 was chartered by Bulgaria's Air Sophia company in
February from the Ukrainian Aviation Transport Company, overseen by
the Defense Ministry, according to spokesman Dmytro Shkurko.
	   He had no further details.
	   It was the second crash this week involving a chartered
Ukrainian Defense Ministry plane.
	   On Tuesday, a four-engine Il-76 cargo airplane burst into flames
minutes after takeoff in the United Arab Emirates and crashed into
the sea, killing all eight people on board. That plane was
chartered from the Defense Ministry by the private Ukrainian
company A.T.I.
	   The Il-78 is a modification of the Il-76.
	   Air safety in the former Soviet Union has declined dramatically
in recent years as the new, but cash-strapped airlines have lacked
resources to provide adequate maintenance for their aging aircraft.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Geneva judge has charged the husband of former
Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto with money-laundering and is
likely to charge Ms. Bhutto herself.
	   A few ``questions of procedure'' need to be cleared up before
the former prime minister can be charged, Judge Daniel Devaud said
Friday, adding that he still was trying to determine whether she
could invoke immunity from prosecution because of her elective
office.
	   He said the indictment against Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali
Zardari, was issued a few days ago and that he had yet to confirm
whether Pakistani officials had received it.
	   The charging of Zardari follows the indictment in June of three
Swiss citizens linked to the ex-premier, dismissed in November 1996
on charges of corruption and misrule, which she claims are
concocted by political opponents.
	   Zardari, widely blamed for his wife's downfall, has been jailed
since her dismissal.
	   The Swiss indictment came a day after a Pakistani court issued
an arrest warrant for Ms. Bhutto after she failed to appear in
court in Lahore on a charge of corruption.
	   Ms. Bhutto, who is in the United Arab Emirates, has been ordered
to appear in court on July 27. Ms. Bhutto is accused of failing to
declare some of her assets when she filed her election papers prior
to the February 1997 elections.
	   Indicted in Switzerland last month was Hans J. Fischer, former
senior executive vice-president at Geneva-based Societe Generale de
Surveillance SA, where he was responsible for the company's
government contracts division.
	   The other two indicted were Robert Massey, managing director for
SGS former subsidiary, Cotecna Inspection SA; and Jens
Schlegelmilch, whom Rehman described as a Geneva lawyer who served
as Ms. Bhutto's and her husband's agent in handling financial
transactions.
	   Devaud said bank documents relating to the case in Switzerland
will be given to Pakistan in the coming days, following a Pakistani
request for legal assistance.
	   Swiss authorities said last October that they had found about 20
million Swiss francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to
Ms. Bhutto, her mother, Nusrat Bhutto and Zardari frozen in seven
Geneva banks.
	   The Swiss investigation was launched last year.
	   Pakistan's anti-corruption investigator, Saif-ur Rehman, says he
expects to find another dlrs 250 million in banks in Britain and
the United States. Pakistan also is working with authorities in
France, the Netherlands and Spain in the Bhutto case, he said last
month.

Egalitarian Norway launches affirmative action for men
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After two decades of affirmative action
programs to promote equal employment for women, Norway on Friday
announced new rules that would do the same for men.
	   Norway prides itself on being among the world's most egalitarian
nations. In 1978, it passed a law allowing employers to advertise
for women to fill jobs in traditionally male-dominated professions
in advertising, and to give preferential treatment in hiring.
	   The government Friday amended equal rights regulations to allow
the same treatment for men in the female-dominated professions of
child care, preschool and primary school teaching and child welfare
institutions.
	   ``Equality will be strengthened by a more even proportion of
sexes in education and child care,'' Minister of Families and
Children Valgerd Svarstad Haugland said.
	   A greater number of men working with children would help change
children's views of gender roles, and provide boys male role models
in their schools or care centers, she said.
	   The new regulations also allow for setting limited quotas of men
in those professions, in the same way as some jobs are reserved for
women in male-dominated fields, a news release said. The law also
allows employers to use gender as a criteria in choosing between
equally qualified candidates to increase the number of men or women
represented in a profession dominated by the opposite sex.

Kosovo's president pledges to continue building self-styled

government
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with purported KLA statement &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying Serb authorities, Kosovo's
leading Albanian politician pledged Friday to continue building
governmental institutions in this rebellious province despite a
police crackdown on his unauthorized parliament.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's self-styled president, made his pledge
as an international fact-finding team met with Serb officials here
in the latest diplomatic bid to end the fighting and start peace
talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   Hansjoerg Eiff, the German leader of the team from the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said he found
a ``positive reaction'' from Serb officials in Kosovo to the OSCE's
desire to establish a permanent monitoring mission here.
	   But another diplomat, speaking on condition he not be named,
said the deal could falter if President Slobodan Milosevic sticks
by his demand that Yugoslavia first be readmitted to the OSCE, from
which it was suspended in 1992 after ethnic wars in Croatia and
Bosnia.
	   The 11-member OSCE team _ including diplomats from the United
States, Germany, Russia, Austria, Denmark, Britain and other
countries _ meets later Friday with pro-independence hardliner Adem
Demaci.
	   Team members meet with Rugova on Saturday. He is the ethnic
Albanian politician whom the Americans and Europeans want to lead a
delegation in talks with Milosevic.
	   But Yugoslavia's bloody, five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash not
only against the government but also against Rugova, whose
commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the bloodshed or win
self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA, which is fighting for
independence from Serbia. Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo
9-to-1.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected in March but
never authorized by the Belgrade government.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   There were no arrests, but police said charges could be filed
because of the ``attempt to constitute'' the illegal parliament.
	   Nevertheless, Rugova told reporters Friday ``after convening
parliament, we will continue to build other bodies of government in
Kosovo'' and would invite ethnic Serbs in the province to take
part.
	   But in an interview published Friday by the Albanian language
weekly Zeri, a purported KLA spokesman, Jakup Krasniqi, scoffed at
Rugova's move and said ``the forming of all national and state
institutions will in the future be directed by the KLA by
liberating territories in Kosovo.''
	   Krasniqi said the major powers were now acknowledging the KLA's
role in the struggle and he accused Rugova's followers of trying
``to project rifts within the political leadership into the KLA.''

Swiss charge husband of Benazir Bhutto with money laundering

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss judge said Friday he has charged the
husband of former Pakistani Premier Benazir Bhutto with money
laundering and is clearing up details before charging Ms. Bhutto
herself.
	   A few ``questions of procedure'' need to be cleared up before
the former prime minister can be indicted, Judge Daniel Devaud
said.
	   The charging of Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, follows
the indictment in June of three Swiss citizens linked to Ms.
Bhutto, who was dismissed in November 1996 on charges of corruption
and misrule.
	   She has denied the charges, which she claims are concocted by
political opponents.
	   Ms. Bhutto was in the United Arab Emirates Friday visiting her
children and could not be reached for comment immediately on the
latest action.
	   Since Ms. Bhutto's dismissal, Zardari, widely blamed for his
wife's downfall, has been jailed in Pakistan on various charges,
including murder and corruption.
	   Devaud said bank documents relating to the case in Switzerland
will be handed over to Pakistan in the coming days.
	   The Swiss indictment came a day after a Pakistani court issued
an arrest warrant for Ms. Bhutto after she failed to appear in
court in Lahore on a charge of corruption. She is accused of
failing to declare some of her assets when she filed her election
papers before February 1997 elections.
	   Swiss authorities said last October that they had found about
dlrs 13.8 million in accounts linked to the Bhutto family frozen in
seven Geneva banks.
	   Pakistan's anti-corruption investigator Saif-ur Rehman says he
expects to find another dlrs 250 million in banks in Britain and
the United States. Pakistan also is working with authorities in
France, the Netherlands and Spain in the Bhutto case, he said.

Wide range of parties bid for spot in German election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ An anarchist party promising its voters
free beer got preliminary approval Friday to compete in Germany's
September elections.
	   More than 30 other fringe groups were left in the running after
federal election officials vetted applications, including a party
of fundamentalist Christians, a motorists' party and the tiny
Communist Party.
	   The Anarchist Pogo Party, which says it represents ``rabble and
welfare cheats,'' told election officials its goal is to win more
than 0.5 percent of the national vote in order to qualify for
federal campaign funding _ ``which we would blow entirely on a free
beer party.''
	   Nine established parties were given automatic spots in the Sept.
27 parliamentary election, including the extreme right German
People's Union and Republicans, the federal election commission
said.
	   The other 34 parties still have to submit lists of signatures
demonstrating voter support to the commission. A final decision on
the field of candidates is due Aug. 10.
	   Criteria for taking part in the election include the number of
party members and wider than local support.

Now Moroccan star aims for 2,000 mark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GATESHEAD, England (AP) _ On Tuesday in Rome, he broke the world
1,500-meter record. Two days later in Nice, he missed the mile mark
by two-tenths of a second.
	   On Sunday in England, in his third race in six days,
middle-distance star Hachim El Guerrouj goes for the 2,000-meter
record.
	   The 23-year-old Moroccan is reportedly bound for next week's
Goodwill Games in New York. He hopes by then to have taken two
marks owned by his great Algerian rival, Nourredine Morceli.
	   In Rome, El Guerrouj trimmed almost a second off Morceli's 1,500
record by running 3 minutes 26.00 seconds.
	   At Nice, he was .21 off Morceli's mile mark of 3:44.39 and, at
Gateshead on Sunday, he goes for the Algerian's 2,000-meter time of
4:47.88, set in Paris in July 1995.
	   Race organizers say two Kenyans and two Algerians will set the
pace for El Guerrouj, who also has two world indoor records. If he
breaks the 2,000 mark, he will collect a dlrs 50,000 bonus from the
meet organizers.
	   El Guerrouj admitted in Nice that he was a little tired after
his record run in Rome. He flew into Britain Friday evening to
prepare for Sunday's race and organizers had to cancel a news
conference which had been scheduled earlier in the day.
	   ``The 1,500 and mile records may be a little tougher to beat
than the 2,000,'' said Jon Ridgeon, a former British Olympic
athlete who is a spokesman for the BUPA meet at Gateshead.
	   ``But any record set by Morceli has to be tough.''

	   TILBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch police were Friday
investigating an apparent multiple murder after discovering four
bodies in a forest near the Belgian border.
	   Authorities refused to give any details of the victims or how
they died but a police spokesman told the evening daily NRC
Handelsblad that the deaths were being treated as suspicious.
	   The bodies were found lying in woods outside this town 100
kilometers (63 miles) south of Dutch capital Amsterdam. Television
news showed footage of two bullet-riddled cars found near the
bodies.
	   Two Dutch nationals, a 37-year-old man and a woman aged 28 were
arrested in connection with the killing but were not immediately
charged.

Russian joins UNSCOM, to visit Baghdad next month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A Russian political advisor has begun
working with U.N. arms inspectors trying to certify that Iraq has
destroyed its long-range missiles and biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons, a U.N. official said Friday.
	   Nikita Zhukov's appointment was seen as increasing Moscow's
influence in the U.N. Special Commission, which carries out the
inspections and must determine Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons before the Security Council will lift harsh sanctions
imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Russia, along with France and China, has pushed for the
7-year-old inspections to finish up and has generally taken a more
sympathetic line toward Baghdad in Security Council discussions on
the issue.
	   Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov in April recommended a Russian
join the political advisory team after failing to get a Russian
named deputy chairman. Currently, an American holds that post.
	   Zhukov, who has worked in the Russian Foreign Ministry, began
work at U.N. headquarters on Thursday, said Ewen Buchanan,
spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission, which carries out the
inspections.
	   He joins a Frenchman and an Argentine in advising chief weapons
inspector Richard Bulter of Australia on the political and legal
aspects of carrying out the inspections, Buchanan said.
	   Zhukov was expected to accompany Butler to Baghdad next month
for a review of a work schedule charting the course of inspections,
Buchanan said.
	   Baghdad has said it has destroyed all its banned weapons. On
Friday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein vowed in a nationally
broadcast speech to have sanctions lifted by the end of the year.
The sanctions are up for review in October.

Russian navy to deliver missiles to Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian navy is preparing two of its biggest
ships to make the delivery of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to
Cyprus, according to a Russian newspaper.
	   Russia is selling the S-300 missiles to the government of
Glafcos Clerides Clerides, which controls the Greek side of the
divided Mediterranean island nation.
	   Turkey, which supports the Turkish side of Cyprus, is angered by
the deal since the missiles have the range to reach southern
Turkey. It has threatened military action to prevent the weapons
from being deployed.
	   It was decided to use Russian naval vessels to deliver the
missiles as a precaution against attack, the daily Russian
Telegraph said Thursday.
	   The battle cruiser Peter the Great and the Admiral Kuznetsov,
Russia's only aircraft, are being prepared for the journey to
Cyprus, the report said.
	   The proposed route to Cyprus route is being kept secret, and
military officials have refused to comment on anything related to
either future military exercises or the missile contract, the
newspaper said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Clerides earlier this week
reiterated their support for the deal that will place the
Russian-made missiles on Cyprus, but did not set a date for the
delivery.
	   Russian officials had planned to deliver the missiles in August,
but Cyprus reportedly asked that delivery be postponed until the
fall.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish communities since
1974, when Turkish troops invaded following an abortive coup by
ethnic Greeks who supported union with Greece.

Assad visit: little comment, but more symbolism
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS _ Syrian President Hafez Assad didn't make many public
statements during his visit to France, but maybe his biggest
statement was simply coming at all.
	   The image of the Syrian leader standing next to a smiling
Jacques Chirac, who spoke of ``very positive'' talks, seemed to
reflect how Syria's image has improved in recent months as the
deadlock persists in U.S.-mediated Arab-Israeli negotiations.
	   And for Chirac, the meeting was a clear indication of how much
France still wants to play a role in the Mideast peace process _
and sees Syria as a good partner.
	   ``We know very well that there won't be peace in the region
without the active participation of Syria,'' Chirac said Friday,
after their second meeting in two days.
	   ``Consequently, we want to combine our efforts, France and
Syria, to attain our objective.''
	   He was referring to the objective of Mideast peace, but it's
also clear that France wants to be a player in the peace process,
and a counterweight to the United States.
	   Assad, too, seeks a partnership with another country to balance
against Israel's strong alliance with Washington.
	   Among Arab nations, there is a growing interest in greater
European diplomacy. And, though Syria is one of the Arab world's
more isolated countries, a sense that its hardline position against
Israel is gaining more support.
	   It's been 22 years since Assad visited France, and he's been to
the West only a couple of times in the past decade.
	   So the symbolism of his being received in the elegant Elysee
palace and feted by a band of the Republican Guard, with their
gilded helmets and long red plumes, was significant.
	   France has special leverage with Syria, partly because the Arab
nation was once a French-mandated territory, from 1920-1946.
	   But there is an uncomfortable issue between the two nations: the
whereabouts of Alois Brunner, one of the world's most-wanted Nazi
war criminals, long believed to be hiding out in Syria.
	   Assad told Chirac Friday that ``to his knowledge,'' Brunner is
not in Syria, the French president's spokeswoman said.
	   Brunner, who once was commandant of the squalid French transit
camp at Drancy, is the subject of a French judicial investigation.
Chirac asked that Syria finally respond officially to the French
investigation, and Assad said he would ``examine the issue,'' said
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
	   In public, Assad made few comments during his trip, the official
part of which ended Friday afternoon. There was no joint news
conference.
	   In a toast at Thursday's state dinner, he castigated Israel for
``reducing to zero'' the peace process.
	   On Friday, standing beside Chirac after their talks, he praised
the efforts of ``France and other countries'' toward peace, but
said that up to now, ``they haven't borne fruit.''
	   Of France's suggestion, along with Egypt, that an international
peace conference be convened to relaunch the process, Assad said
only that ``there is nothing concrete.
	   ``If there is a peaceful initiative Syria will be present, but
it has to be in accord with our fundamental demands,'' he said.
Assad refuses to negotiate with Israel unless it returns the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
	   The United States has accused Syria of sponsoring international
terrorism, a charge that Damascus denies.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Russia's first president buried
Russia's last emperor Friday in a simple and solemn ceremony that
many hoped would help the country make peace with the past.
	   ``We want to expiate the sins of our ancestors,'' President
Boris Yeltsin said, standing near the coffins of the murdered czar
Nicholas II and his family. ``Guilty are those who committed this
heinous crime, and those who have been justifying it for decades _
all of us.''
	   Yeltsin's strong words echoed through the St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral, filled with gold-robed priests and black-suited
descendants of the exiled Romanov dynasty, who held thin candles
during a service they had awaited for decades.
	   Indeed, Yeltsin's words echoed farther, through the rest of the
country, which has been bitterly divided over whether and how to
bury the most prominent victims of Russia's bloody revolution _ a
chapter of history many Russians still hold sacred.
	   Yeltsin insisted that it is time for his countrymen to let go of
their ideologies and historical grievances.
	   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's last-minute decision to attend the ceremonies brought
new force and drama to the event, which had been scaled down after
the Russian Orthodox Church hierarchy decided not to take part.
	   In the end, the ceremony was anything but austere. A choir sang
the long and melodic Orthodox requiem for the dead, priests filled
the pink-and-blue cathedral with clouds of incense, and dozens of
ambassadors and other dignitaries held lighted candles, symbolizing
prayers for the eternal life of the departing souls.
	   About a dozen Romanov descendants followed the coffins into a
small side chapel, and threw handfuls of white sand into the crypt.
Among them was Prince Michael of Kent, representing the British
royal family, which is closely related to the Romanovs and has been
accused of doing too little to prevent their deaths.
	   Nicholas' coffin was the last. When it was lowered in, cannons
roared into a 10-minute salute that rattled the earth, reverberated
off the palaces across the Neva River and startled swallows from
their nests in the golden-spired belfry.
	   The czar was honored with 19 shots _ two less than the
traditional 21 because he abdicated the throne.
	   Rostislav Romanov, whose grandmother was the czar's sister,
called the ceremonies ``beautiful.''
	   ``It's an end and it's a beginning,'' he said. ``It means the
unfinished business is ended and we can go forward.''
	   The burial came 80 years to the day after Nicholas II, his
family and four attendants were gunned down by Bolshevik zealots
who mutilated their bodies and tried to destroy what was left.
	   In fact, even though the revolutionaries bungled the job, two
bodies have never been found _ those of the heir to the throne,
Alexei, and his sister Maria.
	   The church, deeply split over its role in post-Soviet Russia,
has cited the missing corpses and other concerns for its decision
to postpone a decision on the bones' identification. They also
decided to leave the job of performing the rites to a local priest.
	   The priest, a respected church leader in St. Petersburg, had to
walk a careful line in the services: he said a requiem for the
whole family, including those whose bodies are missing, but he did
not say their names when they were lowered into the crypt, even
though name plates adorned the coffins and the dark gray walls of
the chapel.
	   Yeltsin's call for atonement had a personal element. He was
Communist Party chief in Yekaterinburg in 1977 when he ordered
officials to raze the Ipatiev House _ the czar's last refuge and
the house in which he and his family were murdered. In his
autobiography, Yeltsin said he was acting on orders from Moscow,
and condemned the act as ``a piece of barbarism.''
	   In July 1991, the same month he took office as Russia's first
elected president, he ordered officials to exhume the bones,
located in a roadside pit outside the city.
	   For Yeltsin, Friday's burial brought such events full circle.
	   ``I could not fail to come here,'' he said. ``I must be here
both as an individual and as the president.''
	   Outside the Peter and Paul Fortress, which surrounds the
cathedral, a group of about 40 protesters held posters of Nicholas
II and banners protesting the ceremonies. Some cited the church's
concerns, others the country's deep economic and political
troubles.
	   ``Factories are closed. People aren't getting their pay. What's
the deal with this funeral?'' asked Vyacheslav Marichev, a former
politician who helped organize the protests.
	   But at least on this day and in this place, such views were in
the minority. Most of the few thousand Russians who gathered
outside the fortress said they would respond to Yeltsin's call for
atonement.
	   ``I went to church today and prayed for the souls of the royal
family,'' said Svetlana Gorovaya, a 43-year-old mechanic who came
from her home in southern Russia to say goodbye to the czar.
``There must be peace now.''

Chartered Ukrainian plane crashes in Eritrea, 10 believed dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details on airplane, Ukrainian company, fixes name of
Bulgarian company in 4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian Defense Ministry cargo plane
chartered by a Bulgarian air company crashed early Friday in the
African nation of Eritrea, and all 10 people on board are believed
dead, officials said.
	   The Il-78 went down near the airport of Asmera at about 4 a.m.
Kiev time (0200 GMT) as it approached the landing strip, a ministry
spokesman said.
	   The plane, flying from Bulgaria to Eritrea, had nine Ukrainian
crew members aboard and one person accompanying an unspecified
cargo, apparently a Bulgarian.
	   The Il-78 was chartered by Bulgaria's Air Sofia company in
February from the state-run Ukrainian Aviation Transport Company,
overseen by the Defense Ministry, according to spokesman Dmytro
Shkurko.
	   He had no further details.
	   It was the second crash this week involving a chartered
Ukrainian Defense Ministry plane.
	   On Tuesday, a four-engine Il-76 cargo airplane burst into flames
minutes after takeoff in the United Arab Emirates and crashed into
the sea, killing all eight people on board. That plane was
chartered from the Defense Ministry by the private Ukrainian
company A.T.I.
	   The Il-78 is a modification of the Il-76 once used as a fuel
carrier for strategic air forces of the former Soviet Union. Many
such planes since have been remodeled to serve as international
cargo carriers.
	   Air safety in the former Soviet Union has declined dramatically
in recent years as the new, but cash-strapped airlines have lacked
resources to provide adequate maintenance for their aging aircraft.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A new tropical storm was gaining strength off
Mexico's southwestern Pacific coast Friday, bringing heavy rains to
the coastal region.
	   Tropical Storm Celia was located about 150 miles (240
kilometers) south-southwest of Manzanillo and moving west-northwest
at 16 mph (25 kph), the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
	   Celia had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph) and was
expected to gradually strengthen through Saturday, until it moved
over cooler waters, the center said.
	   Radar and satellite images showed bands of heavy showers
approaching the coast of Mexico west of Zihuatanejo, a resort city
about 125 miles (200 kilometers) northwest of Acapulco, the center
said.
	   Maritime authorities closed the port of Acapulco to fishing and
recreation boats Thursday. Larger vessels were urged to sail with
caution, the government news agency Notimex said.

Arab journalists call for democracy to underpin press freedom

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Arab journalists concluded a conference
here Friday by calling for greater democracy to ensure press
freedom.
	   Winding-up two days of discussions in the Lebanese capital, the
journalists expressed solidarity with colleagues who face death,
imprisonment and assault in their work.
	   The General Federation of Arab Journalists also expressed its
``deep concern'' about the deterioration of ``freedom of opinion
and speech'' in some Arab states, caused by political and
legislative restrictions on the press.
	   In a final statement, the Cairo-based federation's Freedom
Committee said press freedom required a ``sound democratic climate
that guarantees the foundations of freedom and responsibility.''
	   The federation called for a review of press laws in the Arab
world ``so as to guarantee more freedom and cancel clauses related
to imprisonment.''
	   The federation had decided to set up a special task team, with
an independent fund, to work for press freedom, said the body's
president, Ibrahim Nafie, the editor-in-chief and chairman of the
board of directors of Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper.
	   Nafie said Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri had donated dlrs
250,000 to the fund.
	   The conference cited several instances of harassment of
journalists.
	   Editors and reporters were subject to ``assassination'' and
prevented from doing their job in Algeria, where the government is
at war with Muslim extremists.
	   The federation expressed support for Mohammed Jassim al-Saqar,
the editor of the opposition Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas, and for
``Egyptian journalists who are still in jail.''
	   Last month, a Kuwaiti court sentenced al-Saqar to six months in
jail for publishing a cartoon it considered insulting to Islam. The
cartoon showed a teacher asking his students: ``why did God kick
out Adam and Eve from heaven?'' A student answers: ``Because they
hadn't paid the rent.''
	   Four Egyptian journalists have been imprisoned for libel this
year. Two were released on appeal.
	   The conference said it was ``deeply concerned'' about the case
of Lebanese President Elias Hrawi who slapped Hassan Sabra,
publisher of Ash-Shiraa magazine, during an argument last month.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ After digging a hole in his yard, a farmer
in southern Poland discovered nearly 700 World War II-era land
mines on his property.
	   The farmer found a few mines in the 50-centimeter (20-inch) deep
hole on his property in Latoszyn, some 300 kilometers (186 miles)
south from Warsaw. He then called mine-removal experts who
unearthed a total 698 lariggered by accident
the mines could pop out of the ground two meters (six feet) high
and explode.
	   Mines and ammunition from World War II are often discovered in
Poland, sometimes with lethal outcome. Three teenage boys have been
killed since May while playing with mines they found in a forest in
northeastern Poland.

Saudi executed for murder

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man convicted of murdering
an Egyptian was beheaded Friday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Khaled bin Saad al-Dosary was found guilty of fatally stabbing
Sadek Ahmed Sadek and was executed in the capital Riyadh, a
ministry statement said.
	   Al-Dosary and some friends had kidnapped Sadek with the aim of
robbing a jewelry shop where he worked, the statement said.
	   The ministry did not give the number of accomplices, but said
they received prison terms and lashes.
	   Al-Dosary's execution brings to 16 the number of people beheaded
in the kingdom this year. Last year, 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword and in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

Shelling rocks Guinea-Bissau capital, new mediation effort
</HEADLINE>
prepared &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops and rebels exchanged
artillery fire in the capital of Guinea-Bissau on Friday, killing
at least eight civilians as Portuguese-speaking nations prepared a
new mediation effort, news reports said.
	   Five young men taking cover near their house in Bissau were
killed by shrapnel from an artillery shell and three others were
killed by a shell which landed in a suburb, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   A shell also landed in the city's central market, setting it
ablaze, the report said.
	   The capital of the former Portuguese colony has been under
sporadic fire since June 7, when a breakaway military faction
occupied the city's main military garrison and the international
airport where they are still entrenched.
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, have demanded that President Joao Bernardo Vieira step down.
Vieira is being supported by more than 1,000 troops from
neighboring Senegal.
	   No figures were available on the total number of people killed
in the fighting, which has also spread to inland areas.
	   The seven-member Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries,
which includes five former Portuguese colonies in Africa, announced
Friday that a ministerial delegation would seek to mediate an end
to the conflict, Lusa reported.
	   The organization, meeting in Cape Verde in West Africa, said it
would set up a contact group to pursue talks. Previous mediation
efforts by the foreign ministers of Portugal and Angola failed.
	   The fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people who
require emergency food and medical aid, according to relief
agencies.

Kiriyenko says government austerity program to be introduced by

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW _ Russia's parliament recessed for the summer Friday
without passing key elements of the government's economic austerity
plan demanded by international lenders.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko told the lawmakers the
government would enact the rejected measures anyway _ by decree.
	   ``Regrettably, we have failed to reach a comprehensive solution
on how to boost revenues,'' Kiriyenko said. ``We can't stop with
that and will now have to act ourselves.''
	   ``We must implement a series of measures which would allow us to
balance the budget, to raise revenues to balance spending,'' he
said.
	   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have made it
clear they want the austerity plan in place before they start
delivering dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans this year and next to
help stabilize financial markets.
	   The State Duma, parliament's lower house, approved bills that
would bring only 28 billion rubles (dlrs 4.5 billion), Kiriyenko
said in a brief speech to lawmakers at the end of a special session
called to debate the government's plan.
	   The program, intended to boost cash resources amid a financial
crisis, included a series of bills that would have brought
additional revenues totaling 102 billion rubles (dlrs 16.5
billion).
	   The Duma rejected several bills proposed by the government
before recessing for a summer vacation that is expected to last
until the end of September,
	   Kiriyenko said that rejected bills will be enacted by decree of
President Boris Yeltsin or the Cabinet in accordance with Russian
law.
	   The stock market, which has dropped by half so far this year,
shrugged off the failure to pass the package and closed 4.8 percent
higher Friday following steady gains all week, except Thursday.
	   Communists and other hardliners dominating the Duma have balked
at fiscal reforms proposed by the government, saying they would
further worsen the nation's social woes.
	   The Duma did pass some government bills, including a key measure
introducing an additional 5-percent sales tax, which was approved
on Thursday. But on Friday, lawmakers rejected an income tax bill
and a measure that would cut various social payments for this year.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said the house might hold an
emergency session next month to reconsider some of the government's
proposals.
	   The government has hailed an agreement with the IMF and other
lenders for new loans as a major success that would save Russian
financial markets from collapse. But Seleznyov warned that new
foreign loans would boost Russia's debt to a dangerous level.
	   Russia's economy, which seemed on the way to recovery last year,
shrank again this year because of the Asian financial crisis, a
drop in world oil prices and other factors. Russia's gross domestic
product dropped by .5 percent in the first half of 1998 from the
same period last year.
	   Yeltsin ordered his government on Friday to submit the 1999
budget to the Duma by Aug. 26, the Kremlin press service said. He
told the Cabinet to produce a document that meets the austerity
requirements of the IMF and other lenders.

Benazir Bhutto's husband charged with money laundering

 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Geneva judge said Friday he has formally
indicted the husband of former Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto on
money-laundering charges and is clearing up details before charging
Ms. Bhutto herself.
	   A few ``questions of procedure'' need to be cleared up before
the former prime minister can be charged, Judge Daniel Devaud told
The Associated Press. He said he still was trying to determine
whether she could invoke immunity from prosecution because of her
elective office.
	   The indictment against Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari,
was issued a few days ago, Devaud said. Pakistan's anti-corruption
investigator Saif-ur Rehman said he received the notice of the
indictment by fax.
	   Rehman said the indictment substantiated the government's
allegation of massive corruption against Zardari, in jail since Ms.
Bhutto's government was dismissed in 1996.
	   ``Our position has been vindicated,'' Rehman told the AP in a
telephone interview in Islamabad. ``We have always said that
Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari have taken away 1.5 billion dollars
from the country.''
	   Zardari, currently is in jail in the southern port city of
Karachi, will be handed the indictment papers ``in the next two or
three days,'' Rehman added.
	   The charging of Zardari follows Devaud's indictment in June of
three Swiss citizens _ two who were executives of companies that
did business with Pakistan and a lawyer who served as Bhutto's and
Zardari's agent in Switzerland.
	   Ms. Bhutto was ousted in November 1996 on charges of corruption
and misrule, which she claims are concocted by political opponents.
Zardari was widely blamed for her downfall.
	   The Swiss indictment came a day after a Pakistani court issued
an arrest warrant for Ms. Bhutto after she failed to appear in
court in Lahore on a charge of corruption.
	   Ms. Bhutto, who is in the United Arab Emirates visiting her
children, has been ordered to appear in Lahore court on July 27.
Ms. Bhutto is accused of failing to declare some of her assets when
she filed her election papers prior to the February 1997 elections.
	   Rehman said Ms. Bhutto will be arrested when she returns to
Pakistan, although it's not immediately known when that will be.
	   He also said that Pakistan too would consider filing similar
charges based on the investigation conducted by the Swiss
authorities.
	   Devaud said bank documents relating to the case in Switzerland
will be handed over to Pakistan in the coming days.
	   Swiss authorities say they have found about 20 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to Ms. Bhutto, her
mother, Nusrat Bhutto and Zardari frozen in seven Geneva banks.
	   During a visit to Geneva last month, Rehman said he expects to
find another dlrs 250 million in banks in Britain and the United
States. Pakistan also is working with authorities in France, the
Netherlands and Spain in the Bhutto case, he said.
	   Rehman showed reporters documents he gave Devaud. He said they
indicated kickbacks flowed to Ms. Bhutto and Zardari through
companies based in the British Virgin Islands from Pakistani
government contracts.

	   A CORUNA, Spain (AP) _ Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja won
straight-set matches Friday to give Spain a 2-0 lead over
Switzerland in a Davis Cup World Group quarterfinal tie.
	   Moya, the French Open champion and world's No. 4 ranked player,
beat 142nd-ranked Ivo Heuberger 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in the opening
singles.
	   Corretja, ranked No. 7, downed Marc Rosset 6-1, 6-2, 6-2.
	   Moya barely worked up a sweat in his first match on clay since
he won the French Open just over a month ago. He dropped the first
game, but then went on to win nine straight.
	   Corretja, who lost to Moya in the French Open final, endured a
hot sun and blazing serves from Rosset, the 1992 Olympic champion.
	   One serve was clocked at 213 kilometers per hour (133 mph).
Another broke the tape at the top of the net, halting play for 20
minutes.
	   Spain is trying to reach the Davis Cup semifinals for the first
time in 11 years.
	   On Saturday, Spaniards Julian Alonso and Javier Sanchez Vicario
will team up in doubles against Rosset and Lorenzo Manta.
	   Moya will take on Rosset and Corretja meets Heuberger in the
reverse singles Sunday.
	   Switzerland reached the quarterfinals with a victory over the
Czech Republic, while Spain eliminated Brazil.
	   The winner will face either Germany or defending champion
Sweden.

U.S. autoworkers' strike idles GM plants in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-GM Strikes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The strike by General Motors workers in the
United States has idled thousands of workers in Mexico because
there are not enough U.S.-made parts for them to assemble.
	   In Mexico, GM is one of the largest private employers, with more
than 83,600 workers.
	   Most GM plants in Mexico are in charge of assembling the latest
models. But since parts largely come from the United States, the
strike has forced most Mexican plants to either close or slow down
operations.
	   Jesus Alvarez Lopez, who works for GM in Siloa, 170 miles (275
kilometers) northwest of Mexico City, is hopeful that the strike
can be resolved soon. His wife fears that if it's not, the family
will have to find another source of income.
	   ``If there are no more possibilities to go on and if the
situation does not improve after waiting for a long time, then we
have to scrape a living in another way. And if we can't find it
here before long, then it will be better to go somewhere else,''
Georgina Suarez de Alvarez said Wednesday at their home in
Guanajuato state.
	   GM workers in Mexico can get up to 80 percent of their salaries
while they're idled. Still, Alvarez, who earns about dlrs 20 a day,
said the workers are being hurt by the length of the strike.
	   ``We can see desperation among General Motors' workers,'' he
said, noting that they had expected the strike to last only 15
days.
	   GM, which now is relying more on its Mexican plants to deliver
the company's 1999 models on time, has urged them to continue
operating as best they can.
	   GM, the world's largest automaker, wants to continue trimming
its U.S. workforce to become as lean as its competitors, while the
United Auto Workers is intent on preserving as many jobs as
possible.
	   The UAW strikes at plants in Flint, Michigan, have idled about
179,000 workers at 25 assembly plants and more than 100 parts
plants across the United States, Canada and Mexico. The walkouts,
which began on June 5 and 11, have cost the automaker more than
dlrs 1.2 billion.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Now, this is more like the British
Open.
	   Cold rain, then high winds returned to the coast of the Irish
Sea Friday and forced play to be suspended in the late afternoon as
players had trouble keeping their balls from moving on the greens.
	   As the weather took a turn for the worse, so did the games of
Tiger Woods and many of the first-round leaders, who faltered on
the suddenly testy seaside links.
	   Woods had dropped four strokes to par and was on the 11th green
when playing partner Per-Ulrik Johansson had to ask for a ruling
when his ball moved as he stood over it on the green. A few minutes
later, a horn sounded to suspend play.
	   Woods, who began the day with a share of the lead at 5-under 65,
was 1 under when play was suspended, while first-round co-leader
John Huston was 6 over for the day and 1 over for the tournament.
	   Nick Price, playing with Woods, was 3 over and 1 under for the
tournament.
	   Japanese PGA Tour player Brian Watts, who played in rain but
fairly light winds, was the surprise leader after a 69 put him at 3
under at the midway point.

WTO talks on technology products suspended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Countries negotiating a pact to remove tariffs on
more than 300 technology products on Friday suspended talks until
later this year, officials at the World Trade Organization said.
	   The suspension followed disagreements among the 44 countries
over the list of products to be included in the proposed pact. It
came hours before a Friday midnight deadline.
	   Some Asian nations, among them Malaysia, wanted electronic items
such as television sets included. But other countries, including
India, are concerned about the impact of tariff-free imports of
such items on their own industries and have objected to their
inclusion.
	   The aim was an agreement to remove all tariffs, in stages, by
the year 2003, with a few extensions for some developing countries.
The annual trade value of the products being considered for
tariff-free treatment was estimated at dlrs 50 billion.
	   The proposed pact follows last year's agreement of a larger
international technology agreement.
	   Technology products with an annual trade value of some dlrs 500
billion were earmarked for tariff-free treatment by the year 2000
under that agreement. There were a few exceptions allowing extra
time.
	   Trade officials said negotiators would seek to resume the
suspended talks if consultations in September proved promising.

Commission rules three ministers be tried in AIDS-tainted blood
</HEADLINE>
scandal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The investigative commission of a special court
ruled Friday that former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and two
former ministers be tried for allowing AIDS-tainted blood to be
used in transfusions that contaminated 1,300 people, mainly
hemophiliacs.
	   The three-judge commission of the Court of Justice of the
Republic, rarely called upon to act, said the three should be
judged for involuntary homicide and involuntarily compromising the
well-being of others.
	   There was no immediate comment on the ruling from Fabius or
former Social Affairs Minister Georgina Dufoix and former Health
Minister Edmond Herve. All three served in the Socialist government
from 1984-86, and all have been under investigation since 1994 for
complicity in poisoning.
	   Fabius and his former colleagues all claim they never knowingly
approved the use of contaminated blood.
	   The commission, in deciding the three should be judged, did not
heed the request last month by Prosecutor Jean-Francois Burgelin
who asked that the case be dropped. The prosecutor, however, based
his case on the poisoning charge.
	   The Court of Justice of the Republic, made up of a dozen
lawmakers and three judges, acts only in cases involving potential
crimes committed by government officials while in office.
	   Four former health officials have already been convicted by
regular courts, including the doctor who headed the National Center
for Blood Transfusion in 1985.
	   The tainted-blood scandal broke in 1992 with proof that blood
tainted with the HIV virus had knowingly been used in transfusions
in the mid-1980s.
	   Of about 1,300 hemophiliacs infected with the virus, more than
500, many of them children, have died.
	   Convictions and ongoing legal action are based on evidence
revealing the failure at the time to import more expensive
heat-treated blood products or use an American AIDS detecting test
while a French one was being perfected. There was also evidence of
a decision somewhere in the chain of command to use up old blood
stocks.

	   BRIVE-LA GAILLARDE, France (AP) - A quick look at Friday's stage
of the 85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE: Friday's sixth stage was from La Chatre to Brive-La
Gaillarde, 204 kilometers (127 miles) mostly south in central
France.
	   WINNER: Mario Cipollini of Italy won for the second day in a row
over Nicola Minali, another Italian. Jan Svorada of the Czech
Republic was third.
	   YELLOW JERSEY: Stuart O'Grady of Australia held on to the lead
for the third day in a row and added two seconds by getting third
in a bonus sprint. George Hincapie of the United States was second,
nine seconds behind.
	   HOW THE OTHERS FARED: Last year's Tour champ, Germany's Jan
Ullrich, finished in the main pack and is 22nd overall at 1 minute,
24 seconds behind. Telekom teammate Erik Zabel is in ninth at 43
seconds back with the help of bonus seconds along the way. Bjarne
Riis, the 1996 Tour winner from Denmark is 31st, 1:31 back.
	   TOUR TIDBIT: Last year, Jan Ullrich demolished the field by
winning by more than three minutes in the first time trial which
essentially won the Tour for him. He coasted in from there.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``The encouragements that I have seen today
have comforted me after these last difficult days,'' Richard
Virenque, on the numerous signs and banners that have sprung up
supporting him and his team after the drug clouds over the Tour.
	   THE NEXT STAGE: The seventh stage, an individual time trial from
Meyrignac-L'Eglise to Correze, 58 kilometers (36 miles) which
should shake up the standings.

44 couples take part in group wedding in Jordan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo available

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ No less than 44 couples tied the knot here
Friday in the biggest collective wedding that Jordan has ever seen.
	   Thousands of guests attended the mass ceremony which featured
music, singing, folk dances and a cleric reading verses from the
Koran, the Moslem holy book.
	   ``The number of participants _ 44 happy couples _ exceeded all
expectations and we are glad because this system of marriage saves
time and expense,'' said Mofid Sarhan, the director of the Moslem
Virtue Charitable Society, which organized the event in al-Ittihad
School for Girls in Amman.
	   Sociologists have said the high cost of weddings contributes the
large number of unmarried young men and women in Jordan.
	   The brides and grooms came from all parts of Jordan.
	   More than fifty companies donated money, food and gifts to the
ceremony.

Polish farmer finds 700 land mines in backyard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A farmer in southern Poland has discovered
nearly 700 World War II-era land mines on his property.
	   The farmer found a few mines as he dug a 50-centimeter (20-inch)
deep hole on his property in Latoszyn, some 300 kilometers (186
miles) south from Warsaw.
	   When he called mine-removal experts they unearthed 698 mines _
some underneath the stairs to the farmer's house.
	   Each mine contained about 400 grams (14 ounces) of gunpowder,
said Col. Ryszard Lastowski, part of the military team of
detonating experts.
	   None of the mines had detonators but if accidentally exploded
they could have caused severe damage, he said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In one of Russia's holiest cathedrals, a service
was held Friday to mourn the deaths of Czar Nicholas II and his
family. The mourners included members of Russia's former ruling
family, the Romanovs. One of the country's most powerful leaders
spoke.
	   This was not, however, the burial service in St. Petersburg that
was electrified by an eloquent speech by President Boris Yeltsin.
This was the alternative memorial service, held in the monastic
town of Sergiev Posad and presided over the the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II.
	   It had many of the elements of a funeral, chiefly lacking one:
the remains of the deceased.
	   This was as Alexy had wanted it.
	   The patriarch had long said he wouldn't take part in the burial,
citing doubts about the authenticity of the remains of Nicholas,
his family and servants.
	   There may have been church politics involved as well, stemming
from the complicated relations between the Russian Orthodox Church
and a branch that was established in exile after the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution.
	   The exiled church has canonized Nicholas II and would have been
deeply offended if the Russian Orthodox Church buried the royal
remains without treating them as those of a saint.
	   The church in Moscow isn't yet ready to decide on canonization.
So it relegated the burial service in St. Petersburg to a local
priest, while Alexy led a memorial requiem that was supposed to
have been conducted in every Orthodox church in the country.
	   Officially, the occasion was not the burial of the czar, but the
80th anniversary of his execution by a Bolshevik firing squad on
July 17, 1918.
	   Among those joining the patriarch were Grand Duchess Maria
Vladimirovna Romanov and her 17-year-old son, Georgy, whom she
claims is heir to the throne.
	   Most other Romanovs attended the burial in St. Petersburg. Maria
and Georgy, who live in Madrid, Spain, declined after being told
they were welcome as members of the Romanov family but not as
claimants to the throne.
	   Georgy's claim, supported by some monarchist groups inside
Russia, is spurned by other Romanovs and disputed by the
authoritative Almanac de Gotha on European royal families.
	   In the service at the Assumption Cathedral, Alexy once again
expressed doubts that the bones found in a pit near the Ural
Mountains city of Yekaterinburg were those of the czar and other
members of the royal family.
	   But, he added, requiems for Nicholas II and other victims of the
Communist rule were being recited in all Orthodox churches
throughout the nation on Friday to ``help reconciliation, peace and
accord that the people need so much.''
	   In words that sounded remarkably like those spoken by Yeltsin in
St. Petersburg, he said: ``A long time has passed since this
heinous crime, but the people have a living memory of this lawless
act, feel their guilt and the need to repent.''
	   Despite elaborate DNA and other tests carried out in Britain,
United States and Russia which scientists believe have conclusively
proven the remains' authenticity, the church has refused to
recognize them and kept its role at the St. Petersburg burial to a
minimum.

Families spend precious dollars brought on direct flight to Cuba

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cubans on the first U.S. commercial flight to the
island in two years arrived with many precious things: basic
medicines, video games _ and lots of U.S. dollars.
	   So after the hugs, the kisses, the big family meals, Cuban
emigres visiting from South Florida got down to the serious
business of shopping.
	   Armed with coveted U.S. greenbacks, the visitors bought their
loved ones shampoo, soap, vegetable oil _ basic things many Cubans
often must do without because they do not have American dollars.
	   ``I feel happy to be able to help my family, and to see them,''
said Daisy Dominguez, who works at a supermarket cafeteria in
Hollywood, Florida.
	   Sending and bringing U.S. dollars to loved ones in Cuba _ and
taking relatives shopping at dollar-only stores during family
visits _ has become an increasingly important act for emigres now
living 90 miles (140 kilometers) to the north in the Miami area.
	   Even the most basic foodstuffs are in short supply at
government-run markets, where items are sold in Cuban pesos, now
traded at about 19 to the dollar at official exchange houses.
	   Without dollars, families cannot buy bath soap and other
personal care items.
	   Dominguez was among many passengers bringing dollars to their
families when they traveled Wednesday on the first nonstop
commercial flight from the United States to Cuba since 1996.
	   Within 24 hours after arriving, she and six others crowded into
a tiny Soviet-made Moskvich sedan to buy her ex-husband and the
father of her 9-year-old son four rolls of American-made toilet
paper at a dollar-only store.
	   At dlrs 1.19 each, the two-ply rolls are prohibitively expensive
for her former husband, Alberto Yuri Alvarez, 37, whose monthly
salary at a government bakery is equivalent to about dlrs 7.
	   They returned to Alvarez's modest three-bedroom apartment with
armloads of other items: six large bottles of soda, two boxes of
soap and a dozen jars of Heinz baby food made in Ontario, Canada.
	   ``If you don't have dollars here, you can't buy any of that,''
said Dominguez's aunt, Zenaida Cardentey, motioning to the plastic
bags on the kitchen table.
	   Dominguez and her mother, Gladys Cardentey, also bought bread,
butter, cookies and blue jeans with more than dlrs 1,500 they
brought to share with relatives during their two-week stay.
	   ``There are many things that aren't easy to find here,''
Dominguez said. ``We bought them the most necessary things, the
things they can use. What they always need most are things like
toilet paper, oil, tomato paste, meat, chicken.''
	   Despite U.S. government restrictions on how much cash can be
taken to Cuba, many emigres want to help relatives as much as
possible.
	   ``They treated us like criminals,'' a woman cried at Miami
International Airport shortly before the flight took off Wednesday.
	   The woman, who declined to give her name, said American
authorities confiscated dlrs 3,500 she planned to take her family.
	   Earlier this year, the U.S. government dropped the ban on family
remittances and set a ceiling of dlrs 1,200 annually.
	   But under the U.S. trade embargo against the communist nation,
passengers traveling there to see relatives may not take more than
dlrs 100 for each day of their stay in Cuba.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton lifted the remittance ban in March
to ``help prepare the Cuban people for a democratic transition''
after Pope John Paul II visited the island in January.
	   Clinton also reinstated the direct flights, which were canceled
in 1996 to punish Fidel Castro's government for shooting down two
civilian aircraft flown by anti-Castro exiles.
	   Gladys Cardentey, of Boston, brought one nephew a special gift:
a SEGA game system. But in Havana, the family could not find the
adapter needed to plug it into the television set.
	   ``He was dying to have one,'' Gladys Cardentey said. Still, he
couldn't play with it.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A new tropical storm was gaining strength off
Mexico's southwestern Pacific coast Friday, bringing heavy rains to
the coastal region.
	   Tropical Storm Celia was located about 150 miles (240
kilometers) south-southwest of Manzanillo and moving west-northwest
at 16 mph (25 kph), the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
	   Celia had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph) and was
expected to gradually strengthen through Saturday, until it moved
over cooler waters, the center said.
	   Radar and satellite images showed bands of heavy showers
approaching the coast of Mexico west of Zihuatanejo, a resort city
about 125 miles (200 kilometers) northwest of Acapulco, the center
said.
	   Maritime authorities closed the port of Acapulco to fishing and
recreation boats Thursday. Larger vessels were urged to sail with
caution, the government news agency Notimex said.

 &UR; Cipollini wins again, Ullrich poised to strike &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: For AMS, adds quotes, details, Changes dateline
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIVE-LA GAILLARDE, France (AP) _ It almost seemed like a normal
day on the Tour de Frrance.
	   Mario Cipollini held off a bunch of sprinters for his second
stage victory in a row, as he did last year. Defending champion Jan
Ullrich is set to strike to stake his claim as the top rider of the
Tour.
	   And two Festina officials went across France in police custody
for more questioning.
	   Well, almost a normal day for the cycling race.
	   The sixth stage moved from La Chatre to Brive-La Gaillarde, 204
kilometers (127 miles) as it tried to distance itself from the
growing drug drama. It is two days removed from Cholet, where Bruno
Roussel and Erik Ryckaert were taken in for questioning by the
police.
	   After being questioned in police custory since Wednesday
evening, Festina team director Roussel and team doctor Ryckaert
were moved to Lille Friday. There, they were expected to have a
confrontation with Willy Voet, a Festina team trainer who was
arrested in a Festina car with performance-enhancing drugs last
week.
	   Friday's stage was almost a repeat of Thursday with an early
attack followed by a final mass sprint that Cipollini ruled. Second
this time was Nicola Minali, another Italian, with Czech Jan
Svorada third.
	   Three more top sprinters -- Frederic Moncassin of France, Erik
Zabel of Germany and Tom Steels of Belgium were right behind.
	   It was the eighth stage victory for Cipollini in the Tour. Last
year he won the first and second stages.
	   Cipollini's time for the day was five hours, 5 minutes, 32
seconds but the real racing began in the final kilometers.
	   Stuart O'Grady of Australia held on to the leader's yellow
jersey with the riders preparing for Saturday's 58-kilometer
(36-mile) time trial from Meyrignac-L'Eglise to Correze.
	   He gained two seconds on the field by coming in third in a bonus
sprint. That moved him nine seconds ahead of George Hincapie, the
American champion who was hoping to gain enough for at least one
day in the yellow jersey before losing in the time trial.
	   He came in fourth in one sprint, just behind O'Grady.
	   ``I guess it wasn't in the cards,'' a disappointed Hincapie
said. ``It's pretty much over.''
	   Germany's Ullrich, last year's champion, is expected to do well
enough to move to the top and re-establish himself as the rider to
beat in this year's event.
	   Last year Ullrich won by more than nine minutes over Richard
Virenque, a member of the Festina team.
	   In the time trial at St. Etienne, he gained more than three
minutes on Virenque.
	   He doesn't believe it will happen again.
	   ``That won't happen because the conditions are different. Last
year, it was a mountain race, this time there are constant curves
and hills,'' Ullrich said. ``Last year everybody felt the Pyrenees
n their legs, this year everybody's still fresh. It will be a lot
closer.''
	   The Pyrenees are yet to come and Virenque hopes that he can
close the gap on Ullrich this year.
	   Virenque has won the top climber award of the Tour the last four
years with Voet as his personal trainer.
	   Last week police found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO in
Voet's car with Festina emblems. Voet, a Belgian, has been in jail
near Lille since the discovery. At first Voet was reported to have
said the drugs were for his personal use. Then he changed his story
saying he was under team orders.
	   Roussel and Ryckaert were taken to Lille Friday, where a court
is investigating the case. They were to appear before a magistrate,
and likely would be placed under formal investigation, judicial
sources said on customary anonymity.
	   The daily Le Parisien reported Friday that Roussel and Ryckaert
were implicated in another doping case that came to light in
Belgium in December 1997.
	   It said the names of both officials came up in an investigation
that began when the Belgian Department of Social Security suspected
that a pharmacist was diverting the drug EPO.
	   EPO is a substance that allows the better transport of oxygen
within the blood stream.

Chechen president extends state of emergency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov extended a state
of emergency Friday to give security forces time to complete
operations against a wave of violent crime and kidnapping, a news
agency reported.
	   The state of emergency, imposed by Maskhadov on June 23, was to
have expired Friday. He extended it for 10 days.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tulpar Atgeriyev told the Interfax news
agency that the extra time was needed to allow security forces to
round up of ``groups engaging in kidnapping, illicit oil business
and other serious crimes.''
	   Chechnya remains a center of violent crime and frequent
kidnappings despite the end of its independence war against Russia
two years ago.
	   The state of emergency so far has led to a reduction in crime,
Security Minister Aslanbek Arsayev told Interfax. ``Crime has gone
down considerably, and the proportion of crimes being solved has
reached 80 percent,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, in the city of Gudermes, seven people were reported
killed and more than 50 wounded in a clash between security forces
and a radical religious sect, the prosecutor's office said,
according to Interfax.
	   The fighting broke out Tuesday and Wednesday between an armed
group of Wahhabites and security forces trying to eject them from
the city, Prosecutor Khavazh Serbiyev said.
	   ``It was established that that seven people were killed during
the operation,'' Serbiyev said. ``Fifty-one people requested
hospital treatment.''
	   He said the operation to expel the Wahhabites from Gudermes was
successful.
	   Hundreds of Wahhabite families settled in Chechnya after many of
the Islamic fundamentalists living in the neighboring republics of
Dagestan aided Chechen guerrillas during the 1994-96 war with
Russia.
	   Dagestan's border police were put on alert Friday to prevent any
groups of armed Wahhabites from returning to the republic, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

German driver signs with Ferrari through 2002
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Schumacher comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARANELLO, Italy (AP) _ Michael Schumacher, saying that his
policy is to never change a winning team, on Friday extended his
contract with Ferrari for three years to stay with the Italian auto
racing company through 2002.
	   The 29-year-old German driver said he rejected identical or
better financial offers by other teams to continue his career with
the Formula One company whose red cars with the prancing horse
symbol have won more Grand Prix races than any other team since
1950.
	   Ferrari, which also manufactures luxury cars, announced the deal
with a brief announcement from the company headquarters, near
Modena.
	   Schumacher confirmed it hours later, at a news conference in
Frankfurt.
	   No financial details were announced, but Ferrari officials said
that Schumacher negotiated new financial terms for the three-year
extension.
	   According to published reports in Germany Schumacher would get
about dlrs 42 million a year under the new contract which would
make him one of the highest paid sportsmen in the world.
	   Schumacher's current contract, granting him more than 40 billion
lire (dlrs 22 million) a year, expires in 1999.
	   Schumacher said the figures reported were not correct but
declined to go into details.
	   ``I believe in the team, which is giving me extreme support ...
I feel very well at Ferrari ... I'm sure we are going to be
successful,'' he said.
	   ``The option of staying with Ferrari was better than anything
else for my well-being and for my sporting career. Never change a
winning team,'' Schumacher said.
	   Earlier Ferrari said in a brief announcement that the two-time
world champion, in addition to the contract extension, also agreed
on acting as ``ambassador'' of the Fiat trademark.
	   Italy's auto giant Fiat is Ferrari's parent company and is
expected to use Schumacher as a consultant for new technologies and
for advertising the trademark of the Turin-based group.
	   Friday's announcement ended weeks of rumors about Schumacher's
future, including reports of his possible transfer to the rival
Mercedes team.
	   Schumacher, who has 31 Grand Prix wins, said that
McLaren-Marcedes was one of the teams which actually negotiated his
possible transfer from Ferrari.
	   Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's honorary chairman, had strongly supported
a long-term agreement between Ferrari and Schumacher, who could set
a record of seven seasons with the Italian team _ one more than
Gerhard Berger, Clay Regazzoni, Gilles Villeneuve and Lorenzo
Bandini.
	   Ferrari also extended through 2001 the contract of team manager
Jean Todt. The contract of Ferrari's No. 2 driver, Eddie Irvine,
expires at the end of this year and still must be renegotiated.
	   Schumacher, who won his third consecutive Grand Prix this season
at Silverstone last Sunday, said this week that he felt confident
he would clinch the 1998 world drivers title as his Ferrari ``is
very competitive.''
	   ``We have broken the dominance of McLaren-Mercedes, which at the
start of the year did not look possible,'' he said.
	   McLaren-Mercedes' Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen leads Schumacher
by only two points going into the next race, in Austria on July 26.

McLaren driver fastest in Monza tests, expects Ferrari challenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Formula One World Championship leader Mika
Hakkinen said Friday that he expects a tough challenge from his
Ferrari rival Michael Schumacher in the next Grand Prix of Austria.
	   ``I'm not losing my sleep, but on a circuit like Zeltweg Ferrari
can cause us some problems,'' said the Finnish driver of the
McLaren-Mercedes team.
	   ``We still are superior on fast circuits but we no longer have
the advantage of early season races. Ferrari has grown,'' he added.
	   Hakkinen, who enters next Sunday's race in Austria with a
two-point advantage over Schumacher in the drivers standings,
completed tests of his McLaren-Mercedes at the Monza circuit,
setting the fastest lap in one minute, 23.7 seconds.
	   Hakkinen improved his own fastest lap of 1:24.8 set during the
Italian Grand Prix last year.

U.S. autoworkers' strike idles GM plants in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS final graf to UPDATE number of workers affected by strike
to 186,400 from 179,000. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-GM Strikes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The strike by General Motors workers in the
United States has idled thousands of workers in Mexico because
there are not enough U.S.-made parts for them to assemble.
	   In Mexico, GM is one of the largest private employers, with more
than 83,600 workers.
	   Most GM plants in Mexico are in charge of assembling the latest
models. But since parts largely come from the United States, the
strike has forced most Mexican plants to either close or slow down
operations.
	   Jesus Alvarez Lopez, who works for GM in Siloa, 170 miles (275
kilometers) northwest of Mexico City, is hopeful that the strike
can be resolved soon. His wife fears that if it's not, the family
will have to find another source of income.
	   ``If there are no more possibilities to go on and if the
situation does not improve after waiting for a long time, then we
have to scrape a living in another way. And if we can't find it
here before long, then it will be better to go somewhere else,''
Georgina Suarez de Alvarez said Wednesday at their home in
Guanajuato state.
	   GM workers in Mexico can get up to 80 percent of their salaries
while they're idled. Still, Alvarez, who earns about dlrs 20 a day,
said the workers are being hurt by the length of the strike.
	   ``We can see desperation among General Motors' workers,'' he
said, noting that they had expected the strike to last only 15
days.
	   GM, which now is relying more on its Mexican plants to deliver
the company's 1999 models on time, has urged them to continue
operating as best they can.
	   GM, the world's largest automaker, wants to continue trimming
its U.S. workforce to become as lean as its competitors, while the
United Auto Workers is intent on preserving as many jobs as
possible.
	   The UAW strikes at plants in Flint, Michigan, have idled about
186,400 workers at 25 assembly plants and more than 100 parts
plants across the United States, Canada and Mexico. The walkouts,
which began on June 5 and 11, have cost the automaker more than
dlrs 1.2 billion.

	   TILBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch police were Friday
investigating an apparent multiple murder after discovering four
bodies in a forest near the Belgian border.
	   A police spokesman told the evening daily NRC Handelsblad that
the deaths were being treated as suspicious and two Dutch
nationals, a 37-year-old man and a woman aged 28 were arrested but
not immediately charged.
	   The bodies were found lying in woods outside this town 100
kilometers (63 miles) south of Dutch capital Amsterdam. Television
news showed footage of two bullet-riddled cars nearby.

Saudi Arabia denies Yemeni accusations of land-grabbing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia denied Friday the
Yemeni allegation that it was occupying disputed areas on the
border between the two countries.
	   ``The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia insists that it has not violated
Yemeni territories in any way or form and Saudi Arabia continues to
respect agreements between the two nations,'' the official Saudi
Press Agency quoted an official as saying.
	   On Thursday, a Yemeni government statement accused Saudi Arabia
of occupying Yemeni lands ``in a policy of ... putting pressure on
Yemen.''
	   The Saudi official criticized the statement, saying it
``complicates matters and does not help in resolving the dispute.''
	   Large swaths of the 2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile) frontier
between the two countries remain undefined. The decades-old dispute
over the boundary has often flared into armed conflict.
	   The Yemeni statement had also criticized Saudi Arabia for
protesting a border accord between Oman and Yemen. It said such a
reaction will only hurt ongoing negotiations between Yemen and
Saudi Arabia.
	   Saudi Arabia lodged a formal protest over the Omani-Yemeni
accord with the Cairo-based Arab League. The Saudis said the pact
seeks to incorporate their territory.
	   On Friday, the Saudi official defended his country's action,
saying the kingdom ``wanted only to protect and secure its rights
and interests since it has joint borders with both Yemen and
Oman.''
	   Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to parts of the
Rub al-Khali, a vast desert region believed to be rich in oil. It
accuses Saudi Arabia of building roads and constructing military
posts on its land, and of occupying tiny islands in the Red Sea.
	   Yemen has been frustrated by the lack of progress in border
talks and has said it will consider seeking international
arbitration.

 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government Friday
rejected opposition charges that it is quashing a report on child
poverty until after Sept. 27 elections.
	   Family minister Claudia Nolte blamed the delay in publication on
the authors of the study, saying they handed it in six months late.
She called accusations of government meddling ``a malicious
twisting of the facts.''
	   But in apparent response to the criticism, Nolte promised to
have the report ready for official publication in early September.
	   The Social Democrats immediately called for a parliamentary
debate on the report before the election.
	   ``We will take the minister at her word because this secrecy
must have an end,'' lawmaker Edith Niehuis said.

Sweden and Germany battle to 1-1 split in Davis Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS throughout with Enqvist-Kiefer match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Tommy Haas upset Jonas Bjorkman Friday
as Germany gained an unexpected split in singles against defending
champion Sweden on the opening day of their Davis Cup matchup.
	   The 20-year-old Haas, despite his inexperience, proved steadier
than the world's ninth-ranked player in a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5
victory.
	   Thomas Enqvist then evened the quarterfinal matchup between two
traditional Davis Cup powers by sweeping past Nicolas Kiefer, 6-3,
6-3, 7-5 as expected in two hours, eight minutes.
	   ``It's what we wanted from the singles _ it leaves everything
open,'' said Boris Becker, now head of the German Davis Cup.
	   Haas, ranked 39th in the world, fended off two set points in the
final set, clinching the match in front of 10,200 roaring
spectators when Bjorkman's forehand sailed long.
	   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Bjorkman. ``I was certain I was going
to win this match.''
	   ``I think he underestimated me,'' said Haas, who ousted Andre
Agassi at Wimbledon on center court.
	   ``I love playing under pressure in front of big crowds.''
	   Sweden will send Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti up against Boris
Becker and David Prinosil in Saturday's key doubles.
	   Bjorkman let a 5-4 lead slip away in the final set against Haas,
then appeared nervous as the contest slipped away. His double fault
set up match point.
	   By piling up forehand winners, Enqvist easily swept past Kiefer,
who played erratically and hit 12 double faults.
	   The match's only dramatic moments came when the German, who has
yet to lift a set from Enqvist in three career meetings, broke back
to even at 4-4 in the final set.
	   That brought the roaring German crowd back in the match, but
Enqvist seized control again by whipping a cross-court return that
gave him a 6-5 break.
	   Becker, now in semi-retirement, had threatened earlier in the
week to play Sunday's reverse singles. But Friday, he said he
wouldn't.
	   Becker led Germany to Davis Cup titles in 1988 and 1989, while
Sweden has rung up six titles.

Leftist rebels kill two village officials in Peru
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Dozens of Maoist Shining Path rebels assembled
residents of a village in Peru's central jungle and executed two
local officials in front of them, authorities said Friday.
	   Village Mayor Walter Campos and municipal official Felix
Gonzalez were shot twice in the head Thursday in the village of
Pena Alta in the province of Huanuco, 215 miles (340 kms) northeast
of Lima, an army spokesman said.
	   The men were kidnapped by the guerrillas on Tuesday. Two days
later they were dragged into the square with their hands tied and
executed, witnesses said.
	   It was not known why the guerrillas killed the men, but in the
past they have executed officials in rebel-occupied territory after
accusing them of cooperating with the government.
	   Peru will hold municipal elections in October.
	   Political violence in Peru has fallen sharply in the five years
since the capture of top guerrilla leaders. But intelligence
sources say guerrilla columns still operate in remote parts of
Peru's central and northern jungle.
	   Peru's war against leftist rebels has left more than 30,000 dead
since 1980.

Premier introduces economic program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The government plans to introduce a
stricter fiscal policy and speed up privatization as conditions for
signing a medium-term financial agreement with the International
Monetary Fund, the premier said Friday.
	   Introducing an economic program in parliament that would run
through 2001, Premier Ivan Kostov said support from the IMF is
necessary in order to make the country's economic transition
``painless.''
	   Last month, Bulgaria and the IMF agreed in principle to a
three-year financial package, but negotiations in areas such as
investment programs, social service reforms, health care and
agriculture were not completed because of a time crunch.
	   The IMF package would be worth about dlrs 1 billion, and
Bulgaria also would receive dlrs 550 million in loans from
organizations such as the World Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
	   After one year in office, Kostov's reformist government has
achieved relative financial stability, primarily due to the
creation of a currency board in July 1997 to prevent the central
bank from printing money to cover deficits.
	   But the country's main challenge over the next three years will
be continuing the transition to a market economy through structural
reforms.
	   The government expects gross domestic product to grow by 4.5
percent to 5 percent each of the next three years by keeping the
budget deficit below 2 percent. Last year, the economy shrunk 7.4
percent.
	   The cabinet is resolved to limit tax concessions and improve
compliance with tax laws, which could allow the government to
reduce tax rates.
	   In January, the value added tax will be cut from 22 percent to
20 percent, Kostov announced.
	   In 2001, foreign debt will be less than 60 percent of gross
domestic product, compared to 113.5 percent last year, and
inflation will not exceed 4 percent, he predicted.
	   The post-communist country is struggling to overcome the burden
of decades of operating under a centrally planned economy, which
crashed in 1989 leaving a foreign debt of more than dlrs 10
billion.
	   In 1997, inflation soared to 578.6 percent, primarily due to the
deep economic and political crises that gripped the country in the
first months of the year.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Forty-four couples were married in a mass
wedding in Amman on Friday, the biggest such marriage ceremony that
Jordan has ever seen.
	   Thousands of guests attended the mass ceremony which featured
music, singing, folk dances and a cleric reading verses from the
Koran, the Moslem holy book.
	   ``The number of participants _ 44 happy couples _ exceeded all

Ethnic militants protest killing of activists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Militants of an ethnic party set cars
on fire and shut down an eastern neighborhood of this troubled port
city on Friday to protest the killing of several of their
activists.
	   A shopkeeper was killed when activists of the Haqiqi faction of
the Mohajir Qami Movement opened fire in Korangi district demanding
police arrest members of a rival faction they say is killing their
members, according to eyewitnesses in the area.
	   They set fire to several cars causing the police and
paramilitary Rangers to cordon off the area.
	   Elsewhere in the city a grenade was thrown at the car of a
senior provincial government employee, seriously injuring him,
police said.
	   It wasn't clear who was behind the grenade attack on Iqbal
Qadir, the deputy solicitor general, but police officials said it
was linked to the relentless violence between rival factions of the
movement, an organization representing Indian Muslims who settled
in Pakistan after the British left in 1947.
	   More than 200 people have been killed since June 1 in Karachi in
the bloodletting that has pitted heavily armed militants against
each other.
	   The movement split apart several years ago and their members
routinely clash.
	   In recent days the government has given sweeping powers of
arrest and detention to the Rangers in an attempt to quell the
violence, but it appears to be continuing unabated.

Indian soldiers' assaults on journalists protested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Two Indian journalists injured by
soldiers are the latest victims of increasing attacks on reporters
by security forces in India's northeast, an international
journalists' organization alleged in a letter to Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee Friday.
	   Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontiers said Puyam Theiba's house
in the remote hilly state of Manipur was raided by Indian Army
soldiers on July 12. The soldiers said Theiba, who works for the
local newspaper Panthungfam, was ``involved in anti-Indian
activities,'' RSF said in the letter, a copy of which was faxed to
news agencies in New Delhi.
	   Several states in India's northeast are in the grip of
separatist violence unleashed by groups fighting India's military
in an attempt to break free from Delhi.
	   In the Assam state neighboring Manipur, Arup Kumar Sarma, editor
of the regional magazine Chitranjalee, was attacked in the small
town of Nalbari by soldiers, who gave no explanation for their
action, the statement said. It did not say when the attack
occurred.
	   ``More and more journalists are assaulted in the northeast of
India by the police and the army,'' RSF said in the statement.
	   No immediate reaction was available from provincial authorities
in Manipur and Assam.
	   The All Assam Journalists Union met in the state capital of
Gauhati this week and condemned the attack, members of the union
said.

Commission rules three ministers be tried in AIDS-tainted blood
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to show three officials must answer for seven deaths;
reaction of one minister's lawyer, hemophiliacs; ADDS new
background; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The investigative commission of a special court
ruled Friday that former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and two
former ministers be tried for allowing AIDS-tainted blood to be
used in transfusions that contaminated some 1,300 people, mainly
hemophiliacs.
	   The three-judge commission of the Court of Justice of the
Republic, rarely called upon to act, said the former officials must
be judged for involuntary homicide and involuntarily compromising
the well-being of others.
	   While some 500 deaths are linked to the contaminated blood, the
ministers could be held accountable for only seven, the others
proscribed with the passage of time.
	   There was no immediate comment on the ruling from Fabius or
former Social Affairs Minister Georgina Dufoix and former Health
Minister Edmond Herve. All three served in the Socialist government
from 1984-86, and all have been under investigation since 1994 for
complicity in poisoning.
	   But the lawyer of Dufoix, Bernard Cahen, was optimistic. ``We
will win ...,'' he said, adding that it appeared unlikely the
commission's decision would be appealed.
	   Fabius and his former colleagues all claim they never knowingly
approved the use of contaminated blood.
	   The commission, in deciding the three should be judged, did not
heed the request last month by Prosecutor Jean-Francois Burgelin
who asked that the case be dropped. The prosecutor based his demand
on the poisoning charge.
	   The lesser charges brought Friday carry a maximum of five years
in prison and a total of 800,000 francs (dlrs 133.300) in fines.
	   The head of the Association for the Transfused of France said he
felt relief at the decision, despite the lesser charges against the
officials.
	   ``Now we can publicly show the faults that were committed and
that ended in this unprecedent health drama,'' said Edmond-Luc
Henry on a French television interview.
	   ``This is not vengeance,'' he added, ``It is that the truth be
known so that something like this doesn't happen again.''
	   The Court of Justice of the Republic, made up of a dozen
lawmakers and three judges, acts only in cases involving potential
crimes committed by government officials while in office.
	   Four former health officials have already been convicted by
regular courts, including the doctor who headed the National Center
for Blood Transfusion in 1985.
	   The tainted-blood scandal broke in 1992 with proof that blood
tainted with the HIV virus had knowingly been used in transfusions
in 1984-85.
	   Convictions and ongoing legal action are based on evidence
revealing the failure at the time to import more expensive
heat-treated blood products or use an American AIDS detecting test
while a French one was being perfected by the Pastuer Institute.
	   There was also evidence of a decision somewhere in the chain of
command to use up old blood stocks.

Havel names Social Democrat premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Updates with Havel naming premier, quotes, recasts throughout
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ In the first change of government
in eight years, President Vaclav Havel on Friday appointed Social
Democrat Milos Zeman prime minister.
	   The appointment opens the door for Zeman's one-party minority
Cabinet of Social Democrats, scheduled for official nomination on
Wednesday.
	   ''Mr. prime minister, I sincerely wish you success in creating a
hard-working team,'' Havel said after the brief televised ceremony.
	   Havel also thanked the caretaker government of Josef Tosovsky
and asked it to continue fulfilling government duties until a new
Cabinet is named.
	   ''I want this government not to be a government of arrogant
power, but a government that is here to serve the people,'' Zeman
said.
	   Zeman's party came first in June elections, garnering 74 seats
in the 200-seat legislature.
	   After failing to create a majority coalition, he was forced into
a power-sharing deal with his archrival, ex-Prime Minister Vaclav
Klaus.
	   Klaus promised tacit support for Zeman's minority government in
exchange for key parliamentary posts.
	   Havel is scheduled to formally name Zeman's Cabinet before
undergoing abdominal surgery that will likely keep him out of
political action for several weeks.
	   Klaus orchestrated the country's economic program based on swift
privatization and free-market policies after he became finance
minister in 1990 and Premier in 1992.
	   Zeman built his popularity on sharp opposition to Klaus'
government, blasting economic crime and corruption in the
privatization process.
	   The two leaders agree on the country's main priorities, such as
joining NATO and the European Union but differ on the pace of
economic reform.
	   The center-left Social Democrats are expected to seek deficit
budget spending to protect low-income segments of the population
from the effect of austerity measures needed to revitalize the
economy.
	   Klaus's center-right Civic Democratic Party is likely to push
for further privatization and tight fiscal policies, keeping
inflation under control.
	   The pragmatic compromise between Zeman and Klaus was criticized
by Havel and two small parliamentary parties, the Christian
Democrats and the Freedom Union as an attempt to obliterate their
influence.
	   The two men control 137 seats, enough for constitutional change.
	   Havel and the two parties were vital in toppling Klaus'
government in the fall of 1997, accusing the ex-premier of illegal
campaign financing.
	   Zeman's relations with the president also have soured over
Havel's alleged dislike of several ministers proposed by Zeman.

Saudi executed for murder

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man convicted of murdering
an Egyptian was beheaded Friday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Khaled bin Saad al-Dosary was found guilty of fatally stabbing
Sadek Ahmed Sadek and was executed in the capital Riyadh, a
ministry statement said.
	   Al-Dosary and some friends had kidnapped Sadek with the aim of
robbing a jewelry shop where he worked, the statement said.
	   The ministry said several accomplices received prison terms and
were whipped.
	   Al-Dosary's execution brings to 16 the number of people beheaded
in the kingdom this year. Last year, 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword and in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

Bulgarian premier introduces economic program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The Bulgarian government plans to
introduce a stricter fiscal policy and speed up privatization to
meet conditions for aid from the International Monetary Fund, the
premier said Friday.
	   Introducing to parliament an economic program that would run
through 2001, Premier Ivan Kostov said support from the IMF is
necessary in order to make the country's economic transition
``painless.''
	   Last month, Bulgaria and the IMF agreed in principle to a
three-year financial package, but negotiations in areas such as
investment programs, social service reforms, health care and
agriculture were not completed because of a time crunch.
	   The IMF package would be worth about dlrs 1 billion, and

Indictment of Bhutto's husband vindicates government: Investigator
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Switzerland-Bhutto &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Swiss court's indictment of former
prime minister Benazir Bhutto's husband on money-laundering charges
validated a two-year government investigation of the former first
family, its chief investigator said Friday.
	   ``Our position has been vindicated,'' said Saif-ur Rehman, the
government's chief corruption investigator. ``We have always said
that Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari have taken away 1.5 billion
dollars from the country.''
	   The Swiss court formally indicted Zardari on money-laundering
charges and said it was clearing up details before charging Ms.
Bhutto.
	   Ms. Bhutto is visiting her children in the United Arab Emirates.
She has denied the charges and accused Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's government of conducting a witch hunt against her and her
family.
	   Rehman's has involved other countries to minimize accusations of
political victimization. He has supplied documents of the former
first family's alleged corruption to governments, like Switzerland,
France and Britain, initially to have her accounts frozen and then
to have charges laid.
	   Zardari, who has been in jailed since Nov. 5, 1996, the day his
wife's government was dismissed on corruption charges, will be
notified of the indictment within the next three days, Rehman said.
	   In Pakistan Zardari faces charges of corruption and murder in
connection with the shooting death of Ms. Bhutto's estranged
brother, Murtaza.
	   Sharif, who won two-thirds of votes in February 1997 elections,
rode to power promising to tackle graft and prove Ms. Bhutto and
her husband took millions of dollars from the public exchequer in
kickbacks.
	   Zardari, who has been widely blamed for the downfall of his
wife's government for a second time, was referred to as Mr. 10
percent, a reference to the bribes he allegedly demanded from
companies in Pakistan.
	   Ms. Bhutto's government was dismissed in 1990, again on
corruption charges.
	   Sharif moved quickly to establish anti-corruption legislation
that brings with it a jail term and automatic disqualification from
office. It also carries a fine that can be equivalent to the amount
of money the accused is convicted of stealing.
	   The Swiss authorities say they found dlrs 13.8 million in seven
accounts belonging to Ms. Bhutto, her mother, Nusrat Bhutto and
Zardari.
	   Documents supplied by the Pakistan government alleged that
Zardari and Ms. Bhutto obtained commissions from companies doing
business in Pakistan and that the money was filtered into Swiss
bank accounts.
	   ``What they were doing was collecting the kickbacks and
commissions and depositing them in Swiss banks,'' said Sohail
Rashid, an assistant to Rehman in the Ehtasab Cell.
	   Rehman said the authorities here will likely arrest Ms. Bhutto
when she returns to Pakistan, although it's not known when that
will be.
	   An arrest warrant was issued earlier this week by a Lahore High
Court after Ms. Bhutto failed to appear in court to answer another
charge of corruption.
	   ``This is a non-bailable warrant. We will have to carry it out
and arrest her,'' he said.
	   Rehman said the Pakistan government will likely file further
corruption charges based on the Swiss Court indictment.
	   If found guilty Ms. Bhutto could be disqualified from holding
office for at least seven years, jailed and fined.
	   ``Every time we announced the real truth she always contradicted
it . . . but what we gave was correct,'' he said.

Death threats reported against chaplains urging end to march
</HEADLINE>
protest
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new graf 10 with police charging two in connection
with march protests; more explosives found

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Death threats have been
reported against three chaplains who had appealed for an end to a
Protestant demonstration over a blocked march after three young
brothers died in a sectarian firebombing.
	   The Rev. Robert Coulter, one of the three clergy from the Orange
Order, a Protestant fraternal organization, said Friday that he had
reason to believe the threats were the work of cranks. But another,
the Rev. Warren Porter, said police were taking them seriously.
	   ``They came to tell us in the middle of the night, but I am not
particularly worried about it,'' Porter said. ``You just never
know. But there is one above all of us who will determine the day I
die.''
	   The third chaplain receiving threats was the Rev. William
Bingham, the first Orange Order member to declare that a march down
the Catholic Garvaghy Road in Portadown, about 25 miles (40 kms)
southwest of Belfast, would be a ``hollow victory'' in the shadow
of three coffins.
	   Bingham refused comment, and the police would provide no
information.
	   The Orange Order issued a statament saying it was ``deeply
shocked'' at reports of the threats, adding, ``We again condemn all
threats of violence and acts of intimidation against any person,
regardless of denomination or occupation.''
	   Tensions spilling over from the blocked march were blamed for
the Sunday morning firebombing that took the lives of Richard, Mark
and Jason Quinn in Ballymoney, 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of
Belfast.
	   On Friday, police arrested four more people in connection with
the deaths. Three other suspects remained in custody.
	   Authorities say they believe the Quinn household _ located in a
staunchly Protestant housing complex _ was targeted because the
boys' Catholic mother lived there with her Protestant boyfriend.
	   Meanwhile, police on Friday charged a 32-year-old east Belfast
woman, Pauline Gilmore, and an unnamed man, 40, with explosives
offenses relating to protests around the failed march. Police also
said they had uncovered a blast bomb, 200 shotgun cartridges and
some petrol bombs in a Protestant area of Portadown.

Lagos police forbid prayer service for Abiola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Lagos police said Friday that they will
not allow the family of the late opposition leader Moshood Abiola
to go ahead with a prayer service they'd planned to hold at the
expansive grounds of a Lagos race track.
	   Officials said that the family must hold the Muslim seventh-day
prayers Saturday on the estate of the family's Lagos home, fearing
the larger service could spark renewed violence.
	   ``Security reports at my disposal show some students and youth
organizations are planning to take over the prayers and immediately
after the occasion go into the city to attack government
installations,'' Police Chief Abubakar Tsav told reporters.
	   Many Muslims traditionally hold prayers seven days after someone
is buried. The city's public markets are also expected to remain
closed Saturday in honor of Abiola.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993's annulled presidential
elections, was imprisoned in 1994 after declaring himself
president.
	   His death July 7 triggered several days of rioting in Lagos and
a number of other Nigerian cities, killing dozens of people and
leaving many homes and vehicles destroyed.
	   Nigerian authorities, as well as a team of independent
pathologists, say Abiola apparently died of a heart attack. One
group involved in the latter autopsy, the U.S.-based Physicians for
Human Rights, said he did not receive proper medical care for his
heart condition during his imprisonment.
	   Some members of Abiola's family, and many of his supporters, say
he was poisoned.

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The director of the Festina cycling team
was placed under investigation Friday for importing prohibited

the Tour de France, judicial officials said.
	   Bruno Roussel had been transferred to this northern French town
earlier Friday along with the team's doctor, Eric Ryckaert.
	   Both have been in custody since Wednesday evening, after police
found a stash of performance-enhancing drugs in the team masseur's
car.
	   The masseur was placed under investigation -- a step short of

importing and circulation of prohibited merchandise as well as
administering, facilitating and inciting the use of doping
substances and infraction of drug laws.

Mexico's Bancomer defends venture with U.S. Postal Service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A Mexican bank which fell under scrutiny
after it was caught in a money-laundering sting defended a deal it
has with the U.S. Postal Service, saying no illegal operations were
uncovered in their money order program.
	   A spokesman for Grupo Financiero Bancomer, Vicente Rodriguez,
said Thursday that the Dinero Seguro or ``Safe Money'' joint
venture ``is completely isolated from the operations that led to
money-laundering accusations'' against Bancomer.
	   U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley asked the U.S. Postal Service on
Wednesday to ``consider suspending the partnership with Bancomer''
until there is a resolution to the U.S. case against the Mexican
bank.
	   In late May U.S. authorities charged Mexican banks Bancomer,
Serfin and Confia, as well as 26 Mexican bank officials, with
laundering millions of dollars for Colombia's Cali and Mexico's
Juarez drug cartels.
	   Rodriguez said the Postal Service's inspection department
already implemented a probe of the money order program and found no
illegal operations.
	   ``Since this program was implemented more than two years ago,
some processes were established and these are monitored on a
periodic basis in order to meet U.S. anti-money laundering
requirements,'' Rodriguez said in an interview.
	   The Dinero Seguro program allows people in the United States to
transfer money electronically to relatives in Mexico through any of
900 post offices in Texas, California and Illinois.
	   Up to dlrs 2,999 can be sent in a transaction, though the
average is about dlrs 300, Rodriguez said.
	   Dinero Seguro posted revenues of dlrs 14.5 million during 1997,
Rodriguez said.

 &UR; Saddam criticizes Arab states for lack of support
 &UR; Eds: ADDS grafs 10-12 on Saddam urging Arab summit without him; no
pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab states should support Iraq in its
campaign against U.N. sanctions rather than uphold the embargo,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in his inaugural satellite
broadcast to the Arab world Friday.
	   In an apparent reference to the United States and Britain,
Saddam blamed ``enemies'' for the eight years of sanctions that the
U.N. Security Council first imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait.
	   ``My Arab brothers, the principled position should be that which
brings us to justice ... and not to seek the satisfaction of the
foreigner and the enemies of the (Arab) nation,'' Saddam said in a
speech marking the 30th anniversary of his Baath Party's seizure of
power.
	   Saddam referred to the suffering caused by the sanctions _
widespread malnutrition among children, inflation and shortages _
in a bid to play to Arab sympathy for Iraq's 22 million people.
	   ``Iraqis know that they are paying the price for their
sacrifices ... and their stance of righteousness ... but they do so
willingly because they are seeking the peaks and not the shallow
valleys,'' he said.
	   In recent months, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf have toured Arab states
in an attempt to persuade their leaders to defy the U.N. embargo
against Iraq.
	   ``Go back to justice, my (Arab) brothers so that justice will
come back to you,'' Saddam said.
	   The Iraqi president did not name any Arab state or leader, but
he indirectly criticized Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians when he
rebuked those Arab peoples that had made peace with Israel, which
he labeled ``the greedy enemy and the usurper of (Arab) land.''
	   He also ridiculed Arab leaders for their failure to convene an
Arab summit to forge a united stand against Israel on the
foundering peace process.
	   Aware of his unpopularity in certain Arab quarters, Saddam said
he would not mind if such a summit was convened without him.
	   ``Baghdad .. does not want to be a cause, a shield or an excuse
to impede a serious Arab meeting at summit level to adopt decisions
to improve the nation's situation.'' he said.
	   ``The important thing is that you (Arab leaders) meet with a aim
and that the meeting should be serious.''
	   The speech marked the first time that Iraq has made use of its
recently rented channel on a new Egyptian satellite.
	   Last year, the Saudi-based operators of the ArabSat satellite,
which is owned by several Arab states, rejected Iraq's request for
a channel. Turkey has also refused Iraq permission to rent a slot
on its private satellites.
	   But Egypt agreed to lease a channel to Baghdad on its
French-built Nilesat 101, which was launched in May.
	   Iraqi diplomats said Friday the new service will initially
broadcast three hours of programs a day to the Middle East and
North Africa. They did not say how Iraq will pay for the channel.
	   Cairo's relations with Iraq have improved since Baghdad stepped
up its imports from Egypt under the oil-for-food program. The
program allows Iraq to bypass the sanctions and sell limited
amounts of oil in order to buy food, medicine and humanitarian
goods.

Ex-wife claims she blackmail victim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci admitted
Friday she threatened the former fashion mogul in angry outbursts
and repeatedly asked servants and others to find a killer.
	   But Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, winding up three days on the
witness stand before a summer break, denied going ahead with the
plan, saying she was a victim of blackmail.
	   Reggiani Martinelli is on trial with four alleged accomplices in
the March 27, 1995 slaying. She is accused of planning the killing
to gain control over Gucci's multimillion-dollar estate.
	   Prosecutor Carlo Nocerino read aloud the transcript of an angry
monologue Reggiani Martinelli had taped and sent her ex-husband via
cassette shortly after she underwent a brain tumor operation in
1992. She accused him of turning his back on her and their
daughters when they needed him most.
	   ``Maurizio, you are a monster ... I won't give you a minute of
peace... You tried to crush me ... but I have looked death in the
face ... You've said you went through a nightmare when you were
accused of falsifying your father's signature, but you were wrong,
Maurizio, for you the nightmare has only just begun.''
	   ``It was an angry outburst,'' Reggiani Martinelli testified,
``the same kind of outburst that prompted me to say I wanted to
find a killer for him.''
	   She rebutted the accusations against her, saying the initial 150
million lire (dlrs 84,000) payment made to a codefendant, Pina
Auriemma, was a loan to a friend in need, rather than a downpayment
for the murder.
	   But her composure diminished as the prosecutor grilled her on a
series of phone calls between her and Auriemma intercepted by
police. The conversations appeared friendly and even intimate, as
the two women discussed the weather, their health and clothing.
	   When Nocerino pointed out that the relaxed tone of the
conversations didn't appear in line with her tale of blackmail,
Reggiani Martinelli said that Auriemma had told her to feign
normalcy because her phone was probably bugged.
	   When he asked her why she didn't go to the police herself, she
said she was afraid for her daughters and wanted to avoid a scandal
``which has since happened anyway.''
	   The trial will resume with defense witnesses in September.

Lome becomes `dead city' in protest against Togo president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ The streets of Togo's capital were deserted
Friday as thousands of merchants and workers observed a general
strike aimed at forcing the ouster of Togo's president.
	   President Gnassigbe Eyadema, who was declared winner of widely
disputed elections last month, had banned the strike and other
officials had threatened unspecified punishment to civilians who
observed the protest, which was declared by opposition activists a
``dead city day.''
	   Doors of shops and businesses in Lome were barred shut and only
a few government offices were open in response to the strike call
by Gilchrist Olympio, the popular opposition leader who officially
came in second in the June 21 presidential elections.
	   The strike appeared to be less effective in several cities and
towns in the country's northern interior, where most of Eyadema's
supporters are from.
	   Eyadema, who has ruled this tiny French-speaking country for 31
years since taker power as a military dictator, was declared winner
after vote-counting was interrupted and the chief electoral officer
resigned complaining of harassment. The country's constitutional
court later ratified that decision.
	   Olympio's supporters had earlier claimed a majority.
	   In a statement released Wednesday, Minister of Interior and
Security Seyi Memene said soldiers had seized 640 slingshots at
Togo's border with Benin. The weapons had been bound for
``troublemakers'' intending to throw stones against police during
the planned Friday protest, Memene said.
	   The elections sparked three days of violent protests in which
security forces used batons and teargas against protesters, and
stormed the offices of an opposition candidate and attacked one of
his aides. Demonstrators burned vehicles and garbage and attacked
government property.

	   Answers to common questions concerning the remains of Russia's
last royal family _ Nicholas II, Alexandra and their five children:
	   Q: How did they die?
	   A: The entire family along with their doctor and three
attendants were lined up against a wall in the basement of a house
in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. A firing squad burst
into the room and opened fire, emptying the barrels of their guns.
Jewels sewn into the womens' corsets caused some of the bullets to
ricochet off. The squad used bayonets to finish them off.
	   Q: What happened to the bodies?
	   A: First they were stripped of clothes and jewels and then
dumped in a mine shaft outside town. Grenades were thrown into the
pit to try to destroy them. Rumors quickly circulated in town
identifying the site, so the following day the bodies were
retrieved and the squad set off for another site. When their truck
broke down, they decided to try to destroy the bodies by burning
them. They set fire to two of the smallest corpses _ the eldest son
Alexei and one of his sisters _ but it took a long time to burn
them. The revolutionaries were growing nervous and decided to bury
the rest of the bodies by the side of the road. They poured barrels
of sulfuric acid into the pit in the hope it would destroy the
remains.
	   Q: How were they found?
	   A: In the late 1970s, a local geologist and an interested
filmmaker pooled their resources, eventually obtaining an account
of the botched burial written by the leader of the squad in which
he identified the site. They found the site, dug into the pit, and
retrieved three skulls. Afraid of discovery, however, they later
replaced them and held onto their secret until Mikhail Gorbachev's
glasnost. In 1989, the filmmaker announced he had discovered the
bodies. In July 1991, the same month Boris Yeltsin became Russia's
first president, the bodies were exhumed.
	   Q: How were they identified?
	   A: Russian officials sent samples of the bones to Britain and
the United States for DNA testing. Those tests definitively
concluded that five of the skeletons were members of one family,
and four were unrelated. Of the five, three were the children of
the two parents. The mother was determined to be related to the
British royal family, as was Alexandra. The father was determined
to be related to several other Romanovs. Scientists have said the
accuracy of the identification is greater than 99 percent.
	   Q: Which are the two missing skeletons?
	   A: The body of Alexei, the hemophiliac heir to the throne, is
missing, as is one of his sisters, either Maria or Anastasia. One
American scientist using bone measurement techniques concluded that
the missing sister was Anastasia. But all other tests, including
facial reconstructions, have led investigators to conclude that the
missing skeleton is Maria. One of the coffins buried Friday was
engraved with Anastasia's name.
	   Q: What about stories that Alexei or Anastasia escaped?
	   A: Hundreds of people have come forward over the years claiming
to be an escaped member of the royal family. None of the claims
have ever been proven, and claimants who have submitted to DNA
testing have been unrelated to the Romanovs. Perhaps the most
famous pretender, Anna Anderson, was determined by genetic testing
to be a Polish peasant named Franziska Schanzkowska.
	   Q: Why is the Russian Orthodox Church refusing to recognize the
bones as belonging to the czar and his family?
	   A: The debate is tied to larger battles within the church and
with Orthodox believers who have been living in exile since the
revolution. The exiled church has canonized the czar and has made
canonization by the Moscow patriarchate a precondition for
reunification _ which would significantly boost the church's
standing both within Russia and among other branches of Orthodoxy.
The Moscow-based church has started canonization proceedings, but
they are likely to take several more years. In the interim, if they
were to bury the czar without treating his remains as the holy
relics of a saint, the exiled church would take deep offense. Until
the Moscow patriarchate resolves the issue of canonization and
comes to an understanding on reunification with the exiled church,
it is unlikely to be able to move forward on identifying the bones.
	   Q: What will happen if the Russian Orthodox Church canonizes
Nicholas and the rest of the family?
	   A: According to Orthodox tradition, they will be exhumed,
ritually washed and dressed in sacred garments. After canonization
rites, they will be interred in special above-ground boxes known as
reliquaries, and their bones will be objects of veneration.

Spanish police nab drug dealers near Rolling Stones concert

<TEXT>
	   MALAGA, Spain (AP) _ Spanish police caught drug runners trying
to bring 800 kilos (1,760 pounds) of hashish ashore in the
Mediterranean town of Malaga near a Rolling Stones concert.
	   Three men unloaded the drugs from a small boat into a car on a
nearby beach as nearly 50,000 fans converged on the city's port
area for Thursday night's concert. Authorities had been staking out
the beach for 12 hours, the state-run news agency Efe reported.
	   The Rolling Stones were kicking off the Spanish leg of their
``Bridges to Babylon'' world tour.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police arrested another member of an illegal
opposition party Friday and released a laid-off textile worker held
for three days, apparently for organizing a discussion group on
China's domestic problems, a rights group reported.
	   The detentions come amid one of the most concerted police sweeps
against China's beleaguered dissidents in several years.
	   Police took away Mao Guoliang as he showed up at the home of his
mother, who died Wednesday, in Anji city in eastern Zhejiang
province Friday morning, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   It was unknown where Mao _ a veteran of the 1989 democracy
movement centered on Tiananmen Square _ was being held, the group
said. He is the 11th member of the China Democracy Party rounded up
in eight days and the sixth still in custody.
	   In Xiangtan city, Hunan province, 700 kilometers (400 miles) to
the south, police freed Feng Jianru on Friday, the group said.
	   Feng was taken into custody Tuesday, three days after he and 13
others met to discuss ``hot-button domestic issues,'' the group
said.
	   The Information Center did not say what police questioned Feng
about. Although the 14 were described as dissidents, the group did
not elaborate on what they discussed at their July 11 meeting.
	   Feng, however, spent three months in prison after the 1989
democracy movement was crushed and more recently was laid off from
the Xiangtan Printing and Dying Factory, the group said.
	   Mounting layoffs from state industries and repeated outbursts of
worker unrest present one of the most worrisome challenges to the
ruling Communist Party. Chinese leaders are emphasizing the need
for stability as they engineer market-style reforms.
	   Police in Zhejiang province began their crackdown on July 11,
rounding up dissidents who tried to organize and register the China
Democracy Party in a direct challenge to the Communist Party's
political monopoly.
	   Police on Thursday took books and other personal effects from
the home of one of those still detained, Lin Hui, and questioned
the wife and mother of another, Zhu Yufu, the Information Center
said.
	   China Democracy Party organizers contend they were trying to
assert their legal rights and register the party as required by
law. Their detentions have drawn appeals from sympathizers in China
and abroad.
	   One hundred dissidents from across China petitioned President
Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji this week to release the five.
	   Exiled dissidents in Boston have called on the U.S. city's mayor
to halt all official visits and cultural and economic exchanges
with Hangzhou, the Zhejiang provincial capital, until the China
Democracy Party organizers are freed, the Information Center said.
	   The petition's 10 signers include many student leaders from the
1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, among them Wang Dan who
was released from a Chinese prison in April and now student at
Harvard University.

Yugoslav president meets Montenegrin rival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a surprise meeting, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and a powerful political rival
coordinated positions on Friday on Kosovo and other issues.
	   Friday's meeting between Milosevic and Milo Djukanovic, the
pro-Western president of the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, was
also attended by Milosevic backer Milan Milutinovic, president of
Serbia, the other Yugoslav republic.
	   A brief statement carried by Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency
said the two agreed that any agreement on the future of Kosovo
should respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of both
Serbia and Yugoslavia. Kosovo, where independence-seeking Albanians
forming the majority are battling Serbian police, is a Serbian
province.
	   The three also agreed to coordinate the Yugoslav, Serbian and
Montenegrin constitutions and work together on a joint program for
Yugoslav radio and television.
	   Milosevic, who became the Yugoslav president last year, wants to
fully dominate Montenegro but is opposed by Djukanovic, who is
critical of Milosevic' authoritarianism and economic policies.

Italy leads 2-0 on wins by Gaudenzi and Sanguinetti
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sanguinetti victory in second singles &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRATO, Italy (AP) _ Italy piled up a 2-0 lead over Zimbabwe in
their World Group Davis Cup quarterfinal tie as Andrea Gaudenzi and
Davide Sanguinetti scored straight-set wins against the bothers
Wayne and Byron Black in the opening singles Friday.
	   Gaudenzi, Italy's No.1 player who's ranked 35th in the world
lists, downed Wayne Black 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in the first match of the
day.
	   Sanguinetti, a quarterfinalist at Wimbledon making his second
appearance on the Italian Davis Cup team, defeated the elder Black,
Byron, 6-3, 6-3, 6-0.
	   It was sweet revenge for Sanguinetti, who had been bitterly
criticized for his disappointing Davis Cup debut in the previous
round against India.
	   The young Italian player, the No. 56 in the ATP ranking, served
17 aces and played a powerful and aggressive tennis to overcome the
opponent in one hour and 37 minutes.
	   Sanguinetti lost his serve in the very first game of the match
but broke the opponent six times for a much applauded victory on
clay in this Tuscan city, near Florence.
	   In the previous singles Gaudenzi capitalized on his better
baseline play and on several unforced errors of his opponent to win
the match in two hours and seven minutes.
	   The Black brothers, who had caused a sensation in the Davis Cup
second round by taking Zimbabwe past favored Australia playing on
grass, appeared in trouble on the slower clay.
	   Gaudenzi lost his serve in the opening game of the first and
third set but fought back quickly breaking the opponent six times
in the match.
	   The last and decisive break came in the 10th game of the third
set when Gaudenzi converted his second match point.
	   ``I was lucky to end the match quickly, because I'm suffering
from a bad cold and I could hardly breath following long-lasting
exchanges,'' Gaudenzi said.
	   ''I played good tennis, despite heat and humidity,'' he added.
	   Sanguinetti said he played an almost perfect match.
	   ``I played very well. For me, this victory is as important as
the quarterfinal berth at Wimbledon,'' Sanguinetti said.
	   Gaudenzi will team with Diego Nargiso in Saturday's doubles in
which the Black brothers start as the favored pair.
	   Italy, which downed India in the previous round, is seeking its
third consecutive semifinal.

Floods in China kill 1,000 as Red Cross prepares appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with death toll rising above
1,000 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Some seasonal flooding has killed more than a
1,000 people, the Chinese government said Friday as the Red Cross
drafted an appeal for emergency aid.
	   The Ministry of Civil Affairs, in a report by the state-run
Xinhua News Agency, said flooding has destroyed 2.9 million houses,
swamped 9 million hectares (22 million acres) of crops and caused
more than 84 billion yuan (dlrs 10 billion) in economic losses
across China since the spring.
	   News of the sharply higher death toll and wider damage came as a
team of Red Cross experts called for urgent shipments of food,
medicine and water purification equipment for the flood victims.
	   The experts, who toured flooded areas of southern China,
estimated that hundreds of thousands of families were left
destitute and many of them are living in flimsy shelters with
little food and drinking water.
	   In one part of Jiangxi province, the experts found families
living atop dikes in shelters made from straw and plastic bags.
Their crops, nearly ready for harvest, were inundated.
	   ``They basically lack everything. Hopes were washed away,'' said
Helge Kvam, a team member based in Geneva for the Red Cross.
``People sought refuge in the mountains or on dikes, but they
couldn't take food or belongings.''
	   Clean water is hard to find, and colds, respiratory infections
and other minor illnesses are spreading, said Kvam who arrived in
Beijing from southern China on Friday.
	   China's Civil Affairs Ministry said medical teams have prevented
an outbreak of epidemics. It said the majority of deaths came from
drowning, collapsing homes, lightning and landslides.
	   Beijing has allocated 320 million yuan (dlrs 40 million) in
relief funds with local governments contributing nearly that much,
Xinhua said.
	   The Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies is drafting a worldwide appeal for dlrs 4
million to buy food, medicine and water purification supplies.
	   Aid would go to the worst-off families in the five worst-hit
areas _ Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, Hunan and Sichuan. The aid will
be distributed by the Red Cross' China chapter.
	   Although seasonal floods afflict much of China every summer,
rains began earlier and have been heavier than usual. In some
Jiangxi counties, the floods were the worst on record, and in
Fujian waters had not been so high in 150 years, the Red Cross
said.
	   ``This year's floods have been extraordinarily violent,'' said
Kvam. ``They came suddenly and the waters rose quickly.''
	   Kvam said damage to villages in Fujian where flooding has
receded reminded him of the destruction he saw visiting north China
communities devastated by an earthquake in January. Video footage
he provided showed people digging through a crush of boulders and
beams where their homes once stood.
	   ``They are poor people who didn't have much and now they have
even less of the little they had,'' said Kvam.

Seeking peace, Russia buries its last czar

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Russia's first president buried
Russia's last emperor Friday in a solemn ceremony that many hoped
would help the country make peace with the past.
	   ``We want to expiate the sins of our ancestors,'' President
Boris Yeltsin said, standing near the coffins of the murdered czar
Nicholas II and his family. ``Guilty are those who committed this
heinous crime, and those who have been justifying it for decades _
all of us.''
	   Yeltsin's strong words echoed through the St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral, filled with gold-robed priests and black-suited
descendants of the exiled Romanov dynasty, who held thin candles
during a service they had awaited for decades.
	   Indeed, Yeltsin's words echoed farther, through the rest of the
country, which has been bitterly divided over whether and how to
bury the most prominent victims of Russia's bloody revolution _ a
chapter of history many Russians still hold sacred.
	   Yeltsin insisted that it is time for his countrymen to let go of
their ideologies and historical grievances.
	   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's last-minute decision to attend the ceremonies brought
new force and drama to the event, which had been scaled down after
the Russian Orthodox Church hierarchy decided not to take part.
	   In the end, the ceremony was anything but austere. A choir sang
the long and melodic Orthodox requiem for the dead, priests filled
the pink-and-blue cathedral with clouds of incense, and dozens of
ambassadors and other dignitaries held lighted candles, symbolizing
prayers for the eternal life of the departing souls.
	   About a dozen Romanov descendants followed the coffins into a
small side chapel, and threw handfuls of white sand into the crypt.
Among them was Prince Michael of Kent, representing the British
royal family, which is closely related to the Romanovs and has been
accused of doing too little to prevent their deaths.
	   Nicholas' coffin was the last. When it was lowered in, cannons
roared into a 10-minute salute that rattled the earth, reverberated
off the palaces across the Neva River and startled swallows from
their nests in the golden-spired belfry.
	   The czar was honored with 19 shots _ two less than the
traditional 21 because he abdicated the throne.
	   Rostislav Romanov, whose grandmother was the czar's sister,
called the ceremonies ``beautiful.''
	   ``It's an end and it's a beginning,'' he said. ``It means the
unfinished business is ended and we can go forward.''
	   The burial came 80 years to the day after Nicholas II, his
family and four attendants were gunned down by Bolshevik zealots
who mutilated their bodies and tried to destroy what was left.
	   In fact, even though the revolutionaries bungled the job, two
bodies have never been found _ those of the heir to the throne,
Alexei, and his sister Maria.
	   The church, deeply split over its role in post-Soviet Russia,
has cited the missing corpses and other concerns for its decision
to postpone a decision on the bones' identification. They also
decided to leave the job of performing the rites to a local priest.
	   The priest, a respected church leader in St. Petersburg, had to
walk a careful line in the services: he said a requiem for the
whole family, including those whose bodies are missing, but he did
not say their names when they were lowered into the crypt, even
though name plates adorned the coffins and the dark gray walls of
the chapel.
	   Yeltsin's call for atonement had a personal element. He was
Communist Party chief in Yekaterinburg in 1977 when he ordered
officials to raze the Ipatiev House _ the czar's last refuge and
the house in which he and his family were murdered. In his
autobiography, Yeltsin said he was acting on orders from Moscow,
and condemned the act as ``a piece of barbarism.''
	   In July 1991, the same month he took office as Russia's first
elected president, he ordered officials to exhume the bones,
located in a roadside pit outside the city.
	   For Yeltsin, Friday's burial brought such events full circle.
	   ``I could not fail to come here,'' he said. ``I must be here
both as an individual and as the president.''
	   Outside the Peter and Paul Fortress, which surrounds the
cathedral, a group of about 40 protesters held posters of Nicholas
II and banners protesting the ceremonies. Some cited the church's
concerns, others the country's deep economic and political
troubles.
	   ``Factories are closed. People aren't getting their pay. What's
the deal with this funeral?'' asked Vyacheslav Marichev, a former
politician who helped organize the protests.
	   But at least on this day and in this place, such views were in
the minority. Most of the few thousand Russians who gathered
outside the fortress said they would respond to Yeltsin's call for
atonement.
	   ``I went to church today and prayed for the souls of the royal
family,'' said Svetlana Gorovaya, a 43-year-old mechanic who came
from her home in southern Russia to say goodbye to the czar.
``There must be peace now.''

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The director and the doctor of the Festina
cycling team were placed under formal investigation Friday in
connection with a drug scandal rocking the Tour de France. The
director admitted to a ``concerted'' practice of providing the team
with peformance-enhancing drugs.
	   Bruno Roussel said in a statement read by his lawyer that there
was an organized practice of providing drugs to cyclists that
touched the chain of command within the team.
	   Roussel and team doctor Eric Ryckaert have been in custody since
Wednesday evening after police found a stash of
performance-enhancing drugs in the team masseur's car.
	   The masseur was placed under investigation -- a step short of
being charged -- earlier this week.
	   Officials said Roussel and Ryckaert were placed under
investigation for importing and circulation of prohibited
merchandise as well as administering, facilitating and inciting the
use of doping substances and infraction of drug laws.
	   In a statement read by Roussel's lawyer, Thibault de Montbrial,
the team director admitted to a ``concerted'' practice of providing
cyclists with doping products organized between the direction,
doctors, masseurs and cyclists.''
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control,'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves under conditions
that could be bad for their health.''

Mexican strengthening strategy to protect workers in the United
</HEADLINE>
States &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican government intends to
aggressively protect its workers in the United States by strongly
responding to abuse by authorities and employers, a report said
Friday.
	   Mexico is forming ``a new, aggressive and energetic strategy''
to increasingly use litigation in the United States to dissuade
private employers and authorities from continuing abuse of
Mexicans, Foreign Ministry officer Ruben Beltran said in a report
in the daily Reforma.
	   The first step under the new protection strategy was taken in
May when the government backed a class-action lawsuit against the
former DeCoster Egg Farms of Maine, claiming Mexican workers' civil
rights were violated
	   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Portland, Maine,
contends the company gave preferential treatment to white workers
while forcing Mexicans to live in squalor and work harder.
	   DeCoster, which was divided last year into two companies, was
Maine's largest egg producer when it was hit with a dlrs 2 million
fine in 1996 for violating U.S. workplace health and safety laws.
	   Beltran, speaking to reporters Thursday, also criticized the
U.S. government for failing to punish authorities who violate
Mexicans' human rights. The Foreign Ministry plans to develop a
network among its consular offices to fight rights violations, he
said.
	   He also criticized U.S. prosecutors for announcing last month
that they would not pursue criminal charges against two former
Riverside County sheriff's deputies who were televised clubbing
illegal immigrants in California.
	   Prosecutors said they would have been unable to prove the
deputies intended to use force to punish the two Mexicans, Enrique
Funes and Alicia Sotero.
	   In a civil complaint, the victims shared an award of dlrs
740,000 for the 1996 beating.
	   Despite the award, testimony from 50 witnesses, and videotape of
the beating, ``The Department of Justice said it didn't have the
elements to pursue a criminal investigation because the intention
of these barbarians to violate the human rights of the Mexicans was
not evident,'' Beltran said.

Saddam criticizes Arab states for lack of support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS grafs 10-12 on Saddam urging Arab summit without him. No
pickup &QL; 
 &UR; With Iraq-Saddam

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab states should support Iraq in its
campaign against United Nations sanctions rather than uphold the
embargo, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in his inaugural
satellite broadcast to the Arab world Friday.
	   In an apparent reference to the United States and Britain,
Saddam blamed ``enemies'' for the eight years of sanctions that the
U.N. Security Council first imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait. The speech marked the first time that Iraq has made use of
its recently rented channel on a new Egyptian satellite.
	   ``My Arab brothers, the principled position should be that which
brings us to justice ... and not to seek the satisfaction of the
foreigner and the enemies of the (Arab) nation,'' Saddam said in a
speech marking the 30th anniversary of his Baath Party's seizure of
power.
	   Saddam referred to the suffering caused by the sanctions _
widespread malnutrition among children, inflation and shortages _
in a bid to play to Arab sympathy for Iraq's 22 million people.
	   ``Iraqis know that they are paying the price for their
sacrifices ... and their stance of righteousness ... but they do so
willingly because they are seeking the peaks and not the shallow
valleys,'' he said.
	   In recent months, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf have toured Arab states
in an attempt to persuade their leaders to defy the U.N. embargo
against Iraq.
	   ``Go back to justice, my (Arab) brothers so that justice will
come back to you,'' Saddam said.
	   The Iraqi president did not name any Arab state or leader, but
he indirectly criticized Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians when he
rebuked those Arab peoples that had made peace with Israel, which
he labeled ``the greedy enemy and the usurper of (Arab) land.''
	   He also ridiculed Arab leaders for their failure to convene an
Arab summit to forge a united stand against Israel on the
foundering peace process.
	   Aware of his unpopularity in certain Arab quarters, Saddam said
he would not mind if such a summit was convened without him.
	   ``Baghdad .. does not want to be a cause, a shield or an excuse
to impede a serious Arab meeting at summit level to adopt decisions
to improve the nation's situation.'' he said.
	   ``The important thing is that you (Arab leaders) meet with a aim
and that the meeting should be serious.''
	   Last year, the Saudi-based operators of the ArabSat satellite,
which is owned by several Arab states, rejected Iraq's request for
a channel. Turkey has also refused Iraq permission to rent a slot
on its private satellites.
	   But Egypt agreed to lease a channel to Baghdad on its
French-built Nilesat 101, which was launched in May.
	   Iraqi diplomats said Friday the new service will initially
broadcast three hours of programs a day to the Middle East and
North Africa. They did not say how Iraq will pay for the channel.
	   Cairo's relations with Iraq have improved since Baghdad stepped
up its imports from Egypt under the oil-for-food program. The
program allows Iraq to bypass the sanctions and sell limited
amounts of oil in order to buy food, medicine and humanitarian
goods.

Havel names Social Democrat premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Updates with Havel naming premier, quotes, recasts throughout
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ In the first change of government
in eight years, President Vaclav Havel on Friday appointed Social
Democrat Milos Zeman prime minister.
	   The appointment opens the door for Zeman's one-party minority
Cabinet of Social Democrats, scheduled for official nomination
Wednesday.
	   ``Mr. prime minister, I sincerely wish you success in creating a
hard-working team,'' Havel said after the brief televised ceremony.
	   Havel also thanked the caretaker government of Josef Tosovsky
and asked it to continue fulfilling government duties until a new
Cabinet is named.
	   ``I want this government not to be a government of arrogant
power, but a government that is here to serve the people,'' Zeman
said.
	   Zeman's party came first in June elections, garnering 74 seats
in the 200-seat legislature.
	   After failing to create a majority coalition, he was forced into
a power-sharing deal with his archrival, ex-Prime Minister Vaclav
Klaus.
	   Klaus promised tacit support for Zeman's minority government in
exchange for key parliamentary posts.
	   Havel is scheduled to formally name Zeman's Cabinet before
undergoing abdominal surgery that will likely keep him out of
political action for several weeks.
	   Klaus orchestrated the country's economic program based on swift
privatization and free-market policies after he became finance
minister in 1990 and premier in 1992.
	   Zeman built his popularity on sharp opposition to Klaus'
government, blasting economic crime and corruption in the
privatization process.
	   The two leaders agree on the country's main priorities, such as
joining NATO and the European Union but differ on the pace of
economic reform.
	   The center-left Social Democrats are expected to seek deficit
budget spending to protect low-income segments of the population
from the effect of austerity measures needed to revitalize the
economy.
	   Klaus's center-right Civic Democratic Party is likely to push
for further privatization and tight fiscal policies, keeping
inflation under control.
	   The pragmatic compromise between Zeman and Klaus was criticized
by Havel and two small parliamentary parties, the Christian
Democrats and the Freedom Union as an attempt to obliterate their
influence.
	   The two men control 137 seats, enough for constitutional change.
	   Havel and the two parties were vital in toppling Klaus'
government in the fall of 1997, accusing the ex-premier of illegal
campaign financing.
	   Zeman's relations with the president also have soured over
Havel's alleged dislike of several ministers proposed by Zeman.

Thousands join victims' families to remember 1994 blast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Thousands of people on Friday
joined the families of the 86 victims who died in a 1994 Jewish
community center bombing to mark its fourth anniversary.
	   Sirens blared as nearly 6,000 people filled the streets of
downtown Buenos Aires at the site of the Jewish Mutual Association
building.
	   To remember the victims, the multitude responded by saying
``present'' after each of the names of the 86 persons was read out
loud. Afterward, the crowd called for the government to solve the
case.
	   The gathering capped off a week of activities, which began
Monday when the families and human rights groups convened at a
square facing the Buenos Aires courts to demand justice in the
unresolved case.
	   No arrests have been made while four police officers and a
civilian have been indicted in supplying a van that investigators
believe was used by a suicide bomber.
	   Iran is suspected by Argentina, Israel and the United States of
being involved in the bombing, the second directed at the country's
Jewish community after a 1992 blast at the Israeli embassy.
	   The case has had an impact on diplomatic relations between
Argentina and Iran, which were downgraded after an Iranian
businessman and his wife were detained in May.
	   Only a few of the Iranian diplomatic staff remain in Buenos
Aires.

Kosovo's president pledges to continue building self-styled
</HEADLINE>
government
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new reports of fighting; trims outdated material.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying Serb authorities, Kosovo's
leading Albanian politician pledged Friday to continue building
governmental institutions in rebellious Kosovo province despite a
police crackdown on his unauthorized parliament.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's self-styled president, made his pledge
as an international fact-finding team met with Serb officials here
in the latest diplomatic bid to end the fighting and start peace
talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   Hansjoerg Eiff, the German leader of the team from the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said he found
a ``positive reaction'' from Serb officials in Kosovo to the OSCE's
desire to establish a permanent monitoring mission here.
	   But another diplomat, speaking on condition he not be named,
said the deal could falter if President Slobodan Milosevic sticks
by his demand that Yugoslavia first be readmitted to the OSCE, from
which it was suspended in 1992 after ethnic wars in Croatia and
Bosnia.
	   The 11-member OSCE team _ including diplomats from the United
States, Germany, Russia, Austria, Denmark, Britain and other
countries _ also planned to meet with pro-independence hardliner
Adem Demaci.
	   Team members meet with Rugova on Saturday. He is the ethnic
Albanian politician whom the Americans and Europeans want to lead a
delegation in talks with Milosevic.
	   But Yugoslavia's bloody, five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash not
only against the government but also against Rugova, whose
commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the bloodshed or win
self-rule.
	   That result has been converts to the KLA, which is fighting for
independence from Serbia. Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo
9-to-1.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected in March but
never authorized by the Belgrade government.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   There were no arrests, but police said charges could be filed
because of the ``attempt to constitute'' the illegal parliament.
	   Nevertheless, Rugova told reporters Friday ``after convening
parliament, we will continue to build other bodies of government in
Kosovo'' and would invite ethnic Serbs in the province to take
part.
	   But in an interview published Friday by the Albanian language
weekly Zeri, a purported KLA spokesman, Jakup Krasniqi, scoffed at
Rugova's move and said ``the forming of all national and state
institutions will in the future be directed by the KLA by
liberating territories in Kosovo.''
	   Krasniqi said the major powers were now acknowledging the KLA's
role in the struggle and he accused Rugova's followers of trying
``to project rifts within the political leadership into the KLA.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
raid Thursday was part of a ``repressive'' strategy that is driving
ethnic Albanians into the extremists' camp.
	   Like the KLA, Rugova also supports independence but his
opposition to violence has won him international support. In the
Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, a senior aide to Milosevic was willing
to negotiate autonomy, which the government rescinded in 1989.
	   But the aide, Gorica Gajevic, said the government would never
agree to an independent Kosovo established ``through terrorism and
banditry.''
	   Meanwhile, both Serb and Albanian sources reported scattered
clashes in the province, which is part of Serbia. Serbia and
Montenegro constitute the Yugoslav federation.
	   Serb sources said a policeman was shot and killed late Thursday
in the town of Kosovska Mitrovica, about 30 kilometers (19 miles)
northwest of Pristina. The Kosovo Information Center, close to
Rugova, said an ethnic Albanian was killed Thursday in the village
of Jezerce, near Urosevac, while approaching a police check-point.
	   In fighting Friday, the Kosovo Information Center reported three
Kosovo Albanians wounded after the Serbs shelled Grape, near Klina,
45 kilometers (28 miles) west of the provincial capital and Serb
forces firing on a village near Belacevac. Skirmishing was reported
near Djakovica, close to the Albanian border.
	   The Albanians also said police attacked a village Friday near
Malisevo, which is under KLA control.

Body of Russian cyclist identified in Colombia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A bullet-riddled corpse exhumed last
year is that of a Russian bicyclist who disappeared in early 1996
in a war-torn region while trying to bike around the world,
authorities have reported.
	   DNA tests requested by the People's Defender office confirmed
the death of Vassili Lozhkini, who was last seen on an ocean-bound
highway in the northeastern Uraba region, a conflictive area
populated by leftist guerrillas and rightist paramilitary groups.
	   The body identified as Lozhkini's was exhumed in March 1997 from
a cemetery in the Caribbean coast port of Barranquilla, about 435
miles (700 km) north of Bogota. He had been shot in the head and
other parts of his body.
	   The killers were never found. But the Colombian army says it
found Lozhkini's passport and other personal belongings after an
armed clash with leftist rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia.

Court of arbitration suspends UEFA multiple-ownership rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The Court of Arbitration for Sport
said Friday it has provisionally suspended UEFA regulations to
prevent two or more clubs owned by the same company taking part in
the same European club competition.
	   The court's ruling came in response to an arbitration request
from Greek club AEK Athens and Czech club Slavia Prague, both
controlled by British company ENIC, it said in a statement.
	   It ruled that UEFA could not put the ownership rule into effect
``for the duration of this arbitration or for the duration of the
1998/99 season of the UEFA Cup, whichever is shorter,'' and that
AEK Athens must be admitted to the new season's UEFA Cup.
	   The two clubs both qualified for the competition in their
domestic championships. But UEFA decided to admit only Slavia
Prague, unless the Greek club could show it was no longer
controlled by ENIC.
	   That decision was ``applying the new provisions, but on the
basis of sporting criteria unknown so far,'' the court said.
	   European soccer's governing body announced the new rule in May,
citing the ``fundamental importance that the sporting integrity of
the UEFA club competitions be protected.''
	   UEFA expressed ``surprise and concern'' at the court's measure.
	   The decision ``gives precedence to the defense of the economic
interests of major investors seeking to control several football
clubs, over UEFA's sporting interest in safeguarding the integrity
of its competitions,'' UEFA said in a statement.
	   The court said it concluded ``UEFA had not given the clubs
sufficient time to adjust to the new provisions.''
	   It will now consider the validity of the ownership rule, which
it said remains open. No date was given for the final decision.
	   UEFA said it is ``fully confident of the outcome of the
procedure.''

Israel and Palestinians working to arrange top-level meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Netanyahu, other details. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians tried to arrange
their first top-level contacts in months, with Sunday cited as a
tentative date for talks between Israel's defense minister and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy.
	   The United States has urged the two sides to hold two or three
meetings over the period of a week in an attempt to resolve their
differences over an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank and
the procedures for amending the PLO Covenant.
	   The United States has proposed _ as part of a broader peace
initiative _ that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that a smaller forum, the PLO Executive Committee, annul parts of
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposals. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at handing
over 13 percent and insists that the covenant be rescinded by the
Palestine National Council, a larger body whose members are
dispersed over the Middle East.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Friday that the
Palestinians suspected the proposed meetings were another attempt
by Israel to gain time and wriggle out of its commitments.
	   ``We will go because the Americans want us to,'' Abourdeneh told
The Associated Press. ``Netanyahu just wants to waste time, and he
found those (the Americans) who will make this easy for him by
calling for direct talks.''
	   Abourdeneh said the meeting between Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas
and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai would likely take
place Sunday, but that the date had not been finalized.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, also said there was a good
chance a meeting would take place Sunday. The Israelis want the
Palestinians to be represented by Arafat, but it appears likely the
Palestinian leader will send Abbas instead.
	   In a meeting of the so-called Kitchen Cabinet earlier this week,
Mordechai and Netanyahu argued over how the defense minister should
handle the talks. Netanyahu told Mordechai he should listen to what
the Palestinians have to say on the scope of the withdrawal and the
PLO Covenant, then report back to him.
	   Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot said Netanyahu had no intention of
giving Mordechai room to maneuver independently. ``What rope''
Yediot quoted Netanyahu as jokingly saying when asked if Mordechai
would be given a long enough rope, or leash, to enable him to
operate. ``A rope to hang himself with?''
	   Israel's Channel 1 TV reported Mordechai was furious with what
he perceived as the prime minister's attempt to undermine his
authority, and was demanding a free hand in the negotiations.
	   Channel 1 further said that at the meeting with Abbas, Mordechai
planned to suggest the setting up of joint Palestinian _ Israeli
committees to discuss redeployment, the PLO charter and security
issues. Mordechai would propose that the committees conclude their
work within a week.
	   Mordechai and Abbas last met in February, during a two-hour tour
of the Palestinian airport under construction in the Gaza Strip.

Festina officials put under investigation; Cipollini wins again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds Roussel being put under investigation and jailed;
Lawyer's statement saying drugs Fixes typos
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIVE-LA GAILLARDE, France (AP) _ It almost seemed like a normal
day on the Tour de France.
	   Mario Cipollini held off a bunch of sprinters for his second
stage victory in a row, as he did last year. Defending champion Jan
Ullrich is set to strike to stake his claim as the top rider of the
Tour.
	   And Festina officials were placed under investigation and
admitted drug use among his riders.
	   Well, almost a normal day for the cycling race.
	   The sixth stage moved from La Chatre to Brive-La Gaillarde, 204
kilometers (127 miles) as it tried to distance itself from the
growing drug drama.
	   But now the drug focus shifted to Lille where Festina team
director Bruno Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were taken in
for questioning by the police.
	   After being questioned in police custory since Wednesday
evening, Roussel and Ryckaert were moved to Lille Friday.
	   Friday evening, Roussel was placed under investigation Friday
for imorting prohibited substances and other counts connected to
the drug scandal rocking the Tour de Fto have a confrontation with
Willy Voet, a Festina team trainer who was arrested in a Festina
car with performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Roussel said in a statement read by his lawyer that there was an
organized practice of providing drugs to cyclists that touched the
chain of command within the team.
	   Last week police found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO in
Voet's car with Festina emblems. Voet, a Belgian, has been in jail
near Lille since the discovery. At first Voet was reported to have
said the drugs were for his personal use. Then he changed his story
saying he was under team orders.
	   Officials said Roussel was placed under investigation for
importing and circulation of prohibited merchandise as well as
administering, facilitating and inciting the use of doping
substaThibault de Montbrial, the team director admitted to a
``concerted'' practice of providing cyclists with doping products
organized between the direction, doctors, masseurs and cyclists.''
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control,'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves under conditions
that could be bad for their health.''
	   A rider denied the charges.
	   `I never took any EPO or any other prohibitive products. I only
took products for recuperation, '' said Pascal Herve, a member of
the Festina team in Varetz, where the team was stayng Friday night.
	   The daily Le Parisien reported Friday that Roussel and Ryckaert
were implicated in another doping case that came to light in
Belgium in December 1997.
	   It said the names of both officials came up in an investigation
that began when the Belgian Department of Social Security suspected
that a pharmacist was diverting the drug EPO.
	   EPO is a substance that allows the better transport of oxygen
within the blood stream.
	   Friday's stage was almost a repeat of Thursday with an early
attack followed by a final mass sprint that Cipollini ruled. Second
this time was Nicola Minali, another Italian, with Czech Jan
Svorada third.
	   Three more top sprinters -- Frederic Moncassin of France, Erik
Zabel of Germany and Tom Steels of Belgium were right behind.
	   It was the eighth stage victory for Cipollini in the Tour. Last
year he won the first and second stages.
	   Cipollini's time for the day was five hours, 5 minutes, 32
seconds but the real racing began in the final kilometers.
	   Stuart O'Grady of Australia held on to the leader's yellow
jersey with the riders preparing for Saturday's 58-kilometer
(36-mile) time trial from Meyrignac-L'Eglise to Correze.
	   He gained two seconds on the field by coming in third in a bonus
sprint. That moved him nine seconds ahead of George Hincapie, the
American champion who was hoping to gain enough for at least one
day in the yellow jersey before losing in the time trial.
	   He came in fourth in one sprint, just behind O'Grady.
	   ``I guess it wasn't in the cards,'' a disappointed Hincapie
said. ``It's pretty much over.''
	   Germany's Ullrich, last year's champion, is expected to do well
enough to move to the top ad re-establish himself as the rider to
beat in this year's event.
	   Last year Ullrich won by more than nine minutes over Richard
Virenque, a member of the Festina team.
	   In the time trial at St. Etienne, he gained more than three
minutes on Virenque.
	   He doesn't believe it will happen again.
	   ``That won't happen because the conditions are different. Last
year, it was a mountain race, this time there are constant curves
and hills,'' Ullrich said. ``Last year everybody felt the Pyrenees
n their legs, this year everybody's still fresh. It will be a lot
closer.''
	   The Pyrenees are yet to come and Virenque hopes that he can
close the gap on Ullrich this year.
	   Virenque has won the top climber award of the Tour the last four
years with Voet as his personal trainer.

	   ROME (AP) _ A treaty creating the world's first permanent war
crimes tribunal won preliminary approval Friday over strenuous U.S.
objections. A final vote was expected later in the evening.
	   An American bid to undermine the package deal was beaten back by
a vote of 113-17, with 25 nations abstaining. The applause was
thunderous. India suffered a similar fate when it, too, tried to
torpedo the deal.

	   The showdown created strange alliances.
	   Joining the United States in denouncing provisions of the treaty
were nations like Libya, Algeria, China, Qatar and Yemen.
Traditionally close U.S. allies, meanwhile, mustered to the
treaty's defense.
	   The treaty would create an international criminal court that
would bring individuals to justice for genocide, crimes against
humanity, war crimes and aggression. The court, to be based in The
Hague, Netherlands would realize a dream born 50 years ago with the
Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals.
	   ``I think this is a great, historic achievement,'' said Benjamin
Ferencz, 78, who was a prosecutor at Nuremberg and has worked ever
since for a permanent tribunal.
	   The carefully crafted compromise emerged early Friday morning
after weeks of tough negotiations and vociferous American
objections.

Kosovo's president pledges to continue building self-styled

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new reports of fighting; trims outdated material.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying Serb authorities, Kosovo's
leading Albanian politician pledged Friday to continue building
governmental institutions in the separatist province despite a
police crackdown on his unauthorized parliament.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's self-styled president, made his pledge
as an international fact-finding team met with Serb officials in
the provincial capital Pirstinia in the latest diplomatic bid to
end the fighting and start peace talks with the Yugoslav
government.
	   Hansjoerg Eiff, the German leader of the team from the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said he found
a ``positive reaction'' from Serb officials in Kosovo to the OSCE's
desire to establish a permanent monitoring mission here.
	   But another diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the deal could falter if President Slobodan Milosevic sticks by his
demand that Yugoslavia first be readmitted to the OSCE, from which
it was suspended in 1992 after ethnic wars in Croatia and Bosnia.
	   The 11-member OSCE team _ including diplomats from the United
States, Germany, Russia, Austria, Denmark, Britain and other
countries _ also planned to meet with pro-independence hard-liner
Adem Demaci.
	   Team members are scheduled to meet Saturday with Rugova, the
ethnic Albanian politician whom the Americans and Europeans want to
lead a delegation in talks with Milosevic.
	   But Yugoslavia's bloody, five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash not
only against the government but also against Rugova, whose
commitment to nonviolence has failed to end the bloodshed or win
self-rule.
	   As a rsult, more ethnic Albanians have been siding with the KLA,
which is fighting for independence from Serbia. Ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected in March but
never authorized by the Belgrade government.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   There were no arrests, but police said charges could be filed
because of the ``attempt to constitute'' the illegal parliament.
	   Nevertheless, Rugova told reporters Friday ``after convening
parliament, we will continue to build other bodies of government in
Kosovo'' and would invite ethnic Serbs in the province to take
part.
	   But in an interview published Friday by the Albanian language
weekly Zeri, a purported KLA spokesman, Jakup Krasniqi, scoffed at
Rugova's move and said ``the forming of all national and state
institutions will in the future be directed by the KLA by
liberating territories in Kosovo.''
	   Krasniqi said the major powers were now acknowledging the KLA's
role in the struggle and he accused Rugova's followers of trying
``to project rifts within the political leadership into the KLA.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
raid Thursday was part of a ``repressive'' strategy that is driving
ethnic Albanians into the extremists' camp.
	   Like the KLA, Rugova also supports independence but his
opposition to violence has won him international support. In the
Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, a senior aide to Milosevic was willing
to negotiate autonomy, which the government rescinded in 1989.
	   But the aide, Gorica Gajevic, said the government would never
agree to an independent Kosovo established ``through terrorism and
banditry.''
	   Meanwhile, both Serb and Albanian sources reported scattered
clashes in the province. Serbia and Montenegro constitute the
Yugoslav federation.

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The director and the doctor of the Festina
cycling team were placed under formal investigation Friday in
connection with a drug scandal rocking the Tour de France. The
director admitted to a ``concerted'' practice of providing the team
with performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Bruno Roussel said in a statement read by his lawyer that there
was an organized practice of providing drugs to cyclists that
touched the chain of command within the team.
	   Roussel and team doctor Eric Ryckaert have been in custody since
Wednesday evening after police found a stash of
performance-enhancing drugs in the team masseur's car. They were
returned to jail.
	   The masseur was placed under investigation -- a step short of
being charged -- earlier this week.
	   Officials said Roussel was placed under investigation for
importing and circulation of prohibited merchandise as well as
administering, facilitating and inciting the use of doping
substances and infraction of drug laws. Ryckaert was placed under
investigation for importing and circulating prohibited merchandise.
	   In a statement read by Roussel's lawyer, Thibault de Montbrial,
the team director admitted to a ``concerted'' practice of providing
cyclists with doping products organized between the direction,
doctors, masseurs and cyclists.''
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control,'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves under conditions
that could be bad for their health.''
	   Prosecutor Jean-Philippe Joubert said Festina cyclists would be
questioned as witnesses in the case after the Tour de France ends
Aug. 2.
	   Michel Gros, who replaced Roussel, said that ``within the entire
team, it (doping) exists.''
	   But one Festina cyclist, Pascal Herve, of France, said he has
``never used EPO or other things.'' He was referring to the
difficult-to-detect substance EPO that helps pump oxygen into the
bloodstream.
	   Speaking in the central French town of Varetz, Herve said he
``only takes products for recovering.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In one of Russia's holiest cathedrals, a service
was held Friday to mourn the deaths of Czar Nicholas II and his
family. The mourners included members of Russia's former ruling
family, the Romanovs. One of the country's most powerful leaders
spoke.
	   This was not, however, the burial service in St. Petersburg that
was electrified by an eloquent speech by President Boris Yeltsin.
This was the alternative memorial service, held in the monastic
town of Sergiev Posad and presided over the the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II.
	   It had many of the elements of a funeral, chiefly lacking one:
the remains of the deceased.
	   This was as Alexy had wanted it.
	   The patriarch had long said he wouldn't take part in the burial,
citing doubts about the authenticity of the remains of Nicholas,
his family and servants.
	   There may have been church politics involved as well, stemming
from the complicated relations between the Russian Orthodox Church
and a branch that was established in exile after the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution.
	   The exiled church has canonized Nicholas II and would have been
deeply offended if the Russian Orthodox Church buried the royal
remains without treating them as those of a saint.
	   The church in Moscow isn't yet ready to decide on canonization.
So it relegated the burial service in St. Petersburg to a local
priest, while Alexy led a memorial requiem that was supposed to
have been conducted in every Orthodox church in the country.
	   Officially, the occasion was not the burial of the czar, but the
80th anniversary of his execution by a Bolshevik firing squad on
July 17, 1918.
	   Among those joining the patriarch were Grand Duchess Maria
Vladimirovna Romanov and her 17-year-old son, Georgy, who she
claims is heir to the throne.
	   Most other Romanovs attended the burial in St. Petersburg. Maria
and Georgy, who live in Madrid, Spain, declined after being told
they were welcome as members of the Romanov family but not as
claimants to the throne.
	   A Russian news agency, Interfax, quoted Maria Romanov as saying
she regretted that ``the sad jubilee lacked a genuinely repentant
and bright ceremony of burying the ashes of the royal martyrs.''
	   Like Alexy, she believes that the burial was premature, and
should have waited for the church to declare the bones authentic
and the royal family to have been martyrs.
	   Georgy's claim, supported by some monarchist groups inside
Russia, is spurned by other Romanovs and disputed by the
authoritative Almanac de Gotha on European royal families.
	   In the service at the Assumption Cathedral, Alexy once again
expressed doubts that the bones found in a pit near the Ural
Mountains city of Yekaterinburg were those of the czar and other
members of the royal family.
	   But, he added, requiems for Nicholas II and other victims of the
Communist rule were being recited in all Orthodox churches
throughout the nation on Friday to ``help reconciliation, peace and
accord that the people need so much.''
	   In words that sounded remarkably like those spoken by Yeltsin in
St. Petersburg, he said: ``A long time has passed since this
heinous crime, but the people have a living memory of this lawless
act, feel their guilt and the need to repent.''
	   Despite elaborate DNA and other tests carried out in Britain,
United States and Russia which scientists believe have conclusively
proven the remains' authenticity, the church has refused to
recognize them and kept its role at the St. Petersburg burial to a
minimum.

	   ROME (AP) _ A treaty creating the world's first permanent war
crimes tribunal won preliminary approval Friday over strenuous U.S.
objections. A final vote was expected later in the evening.
	   An American bid to undermine the deal was beaten back by a vote
of 113-17, with 25 nations abstaining. The applause was thunderous.
India suffered a similar fate when it, too, tried to torpedo the

spots could become targets of politicaly motivated charges under
the treaty.
	   Concessions in the treaty draft include, for example, an
expansion of the crimes to inclyde aggression, which the
non-aligned nations had sought. In a nod to the five nuclear powers
on the U.N. Security Council, it omits any specific mention of
nuclear weapons. A proviso on war crimes addresses French concerns.
	   The draft rebuffed many of Washington's demands _ demands that
many countries, including its closest allies, and human rights
groups said could cripple the court.
	   The United States failed to block the creation of an independent
prosecutor or insert a loophole that could exempt U.S. citizens and
soldiers.
	   A major player at the conference is a broad coalition of 800
citizen groups from around the world. The coalition worked for an
independent prosecutor, the inclusion of crimes of sexual violence
and internal conflicts, victims' rights, and a host of other
issues.
	   Despite their victories on these fronts, however, they found
plenty to criticize in the draft treaty about the scope of the
court's jurisdiction and a provision allowing countries to ``opt
out'' of the war crimes clauses for the first seven years.
	   ``This is a treaty that traveling tyrants will be very
comfortable with,'' said Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch.
	   Under the draft, a case could be triggered by the prosecutor, by
a country or by the U.N. Security Council.
	   The court would need the permission either of the nation where
the crime was committed or the suspect's home country. Human rights
and legal groups wanted to add the country where a ``traveling
tyrant'' might be hiding out to widen the court's reach.

U.S. drug czar focuses on treatment for addicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey said
Friday he wanted to broaden the use of methadone for heroin addicts
as part of a shift in U.S. policy focus from drug prevention to
treatment.
	   McCaffrey, speaking on the penultimate leg of an eight-day tour
of Europe to study drug policies, said that efforts to prevent drug
use were already underway through a massive media campaign in the
United States and now he wanted to boost treatment programs.
	   During his tour of five European nations, McCaffrey said he
witnessed the effectiveness of methadone treatment and intended to
push for broader and better use of it in the United States.
	   ``One of our major objectives on this trip was to look at ways
of building effective treatment programs'' for addicts, McCaffrey
told The Associated Press.
	   ``We need to increase the total capability (of methadone
treatment) considerably,'' he said.
	   There are 455,000 heroin addicts in the U.S. and 115,000 are in
methadone treatment at 800 clinics.
	   McCaffrey said his aim was to get 250,000 inmates out of the
prison system and into methadone treatment, combined with ``stiff
law enforcement.''
	   He said he wanted the 4 million Americans chronically addicted
to illegal drugs, including heroin, to be provided with tailor-made
treatment that is controled by doctors instead of general policy
guidelines.
	   McCaffrey met here with representatives of the Lisbon-based
European Drug Monitoring Center.
	   He pledged ``direct, constant linkage'' in the exchange of drug
information between the U.S. and European nations so that countries
could gauge the effectiveness of their measures.
	   He said the U.S. remained ``adamantly opposed'' to copying the
Dutch model of liberalizing some soft drugs.
	   ``That would be bad for the prevention message,'' he said.
	   McCaffrey was due to meet with British officials in London on
Saturday before returning to the U.S.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin begins his annual summer
vacation Saturday at a lakeside resort in the northern Russian
region of Karelia where he spent part of last summer, the Kremlin
announced.
	   The 67-year-old president, whose health is a constant concern,
appeared tired Friday at the burial ceremony for Russia's last
czar, Alexander II. Although he delivered a strong and stirring
speech, he was the only person in the cathedral who sat during
portions of the service.
	   Yeltsin intends to fly to the northern city of Petrozavodsk on
Saturday and drive from there to a resort in Suiskaya Chupa, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The report did not say how long he intended to be gone. Last
summer, he spent a month on vacation in Karelia and along the Volga
River.

Central American summit to forge closer ties with Mexico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH BELTRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Seven Central American
countries worked Friday at a one-day conference to forge closer
trade and political ties with Mexico aimed at strengthening the
region's war-battered economies.
	   At least 50 accords on immigration, fighting drugs, education,
technical exchanges, health, transportation and cultural
development are expected to be signed at the Tuxtla III conference.
	   Delegates from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador also
intensified negotiations to a joint free trade agreement with
Mexico which, Mexican Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco said he
expects will be signed before the end of this year.
	   Costa Rica signed such a free trade agreement with Mexico four
years ago and Nicaragua earlier this year.
	   Central American had a thriving little common market from 1960
until 1969, when it was broken up by a 100-hour ``Soccer War''
between Honduras and El Salvador in June 1969.
	   Prolonged leftist guerrilla and anti-guerrilla wars in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala _ often involving the United
States which provided military aid to governments _ further wrecked
the region's economy until it all ended in December 1996.
	   Damage amounted to billions of dollars. An estimated 325,000
people were killed in fighting and acts of terrorism in the region
_ mostly in the three countries.
	   Mexico, which had a big diplomatic hand in negotiating peace,
sought to foster closer ties and economic recovery with the first
Tuxtla conference in 1991 in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of the
Mexican state of Chiapas.
	   Panama, which used to consider itself part of South America, and
Belize that considered itself part of the English-speaking
Caribbean, decided the join the Central American community.
	   A Tuxtla II conference in 1996 covered a lot of diplomatic
ground but proved largely inconclusive.
	   For Mexico, the expanded Central American region with its
population of nearly 40 million can turn into a highly lucrative
market _ especially for its manufactured goods like automobiles,
household items such as refrigerators and washing machines,
fertilizers and petroleum products.
	   At meetings here Thursday and Friday, Central American business
leaders complained about Mexico's reluctance to immediately slash
tariffs on bananas, beef, coffee and other agricultural products,
which the region produces cheaply and abundantly.
	   Eventually, they would compete with identical products which
Mexico produces at greater cost.
	   However, a draft of a final joined communique called for
``greater integration'' of the region with Mexico _ above and
beyond free trade.
	   Attending the summit were Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador,
Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Alvaro Arzu of Guatemala, Carlos Flores
Facusse of Honduras, Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua and Miguel Angel
Rodriguez of Costa Rica.
	   Belize was represented by Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel;
Panama's Ernesto Perez Balladares sent a special representative.

Fiat honorary chairman comments on Schumacher, soccer stars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian auto tycoon Gianni Agnelli, whose family
indirectly controls the Ferrari F-1 team and the Juventus soccer
club, said Friday that the extension of Michael Schumacher's
contract ``was a good investment for the made-in-Italy.''
	   Schumacher, considered by Agnelli the best world driver, signed
with the Ferrari team through 2002 and also agreed to advertise for
the Fiat trademark.
	   Fiat, Italy's auto giant which is owned by the Agnelli family,
is Ferrari's parent company.
	   ``Without doubt Schumacher is the best driver ... I would say he
has 5-6 horse power more (than any other driver) in his foot,''
Agnelli said in an interview with the Italian state-controlled
television network RAI.
	   About the lackluster performances of Juventus star Alessandro
Del Piero in the World Cup, and Ronaldo's problems before the World
Cup final, Agnelli said ``soccer stars are like thoroughbred
horses, who can crack under stress and fatigue.''
	   About Zinedine Zidane, the Juventus midfielder who led France to
the World title, Agnelli said he was ``exceptional.''
	   France upset Brazil 3-0 in the World Cup final on two goals by
Zidane.
	   ``The first goal caused the knock-down (of Brazil), the second
the knock-out,'' Agnelli said.

Festina officials put under investigation; Cipollini wins again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds Ryckaert being put under investigation; more quotes; team
to be questioned after Tour
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIVE-LA GAILLARDE, France (AP) _ It almost seemed like a normal
day on the Tour de France.
	   Mario Cipollini held off a bunch of sprinters for his second
stage victory in a row, as he did last year. Defending champion Jan
Ullrich is set to strike to stake his claim as the top rider of the
Tour.
	   And Festina officials were placed under investigation and
admitted drug use among the riders.
	   Well, almost a normal day for the cycling race.
	   The sixth stage moved from La Chatre to Brive-La Gaillarde, 204
kilometers (127 miles) as it tried to distance itself from the
growing drug drama.
	   But now the drug focus shifted to Lille where Festina team
director Bruno Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were placed
under investigation Friday for importing prohibited substances and
other counts connected to the drug scandal rocking the Tour de
France, judicial officials said.
	   The director admitted to a ``concerted'' practice of providing
the team with peformance-enhancing drugs.
	   In Lille, the two were expected to have a confrontation with
Willy Voet, a Festina team trainer who was arrested in a Last week
police found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO in Voet's car
with Festina emblems. Voet, a Belgian, has been in jail near Lille
since the discovery. At first Voet was reported to have said the
drugs were for his personal use. Then he changed his story saying
he was under team orders.
	   The masseur was placed under investigation -- a step short of
being charged -- earlier this week.
	   Officials said Roussel was placed under investigation for
importing and circulation of prohibited merchandise as well as
administering, facilitating and inciting the use of doping
substances and infraction of drug laws.
	   Ryckaert was placed under investigation for importing and
circulating prohibited merchandise, according to officials.
	   In a statement read by Roussith doping products organized
between the direction, doctors, masseurs and cyclists.''
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control,'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves under conditions
that could be bad for their health.''
	   Prosecutor Jean-Philippe Joubert said Festina cyclists would be
questioned as witnesses in the case after the Tour de France ends
Aug. 2.
	   Michel Gros, who replaced Roussel, said that ``within the entire
pack, it (doping) exists.''
	   A rider denied the charges.
	   `I never took any EPO or any other prohibitive products. I only
took products for recuperation, '' said Pascal Herve, a member of
he Festina team in Varetz, where the team was stayng Friday
night.that came to light in Belgium in December 1997.
	   It said the names of both officials came up in an investigation
that began when the Belgian Department of Social Security suspected
that a pharmacist was diverting the drug EPO.
	   EPO is a substance that allows the better transport of oxygen
within the blood stream.
	   Friday's stage was almost a repeat of Thursday with an early
attack followed by a final mass sprint that Cipollini ruled. Second
this time was Nicola Minali, another Italian, with Czech Jan
Svorada third.
	   Three more top sprinters -- Frederic Moncassin of France, Erik
Zabel of Germany and Tom Steels of Belgium were right behind.
	   It was the eighth stage victory for Cipollini in the Tour. Last
year he won the first and second stages.
	   Cipollini's time for the day was five hours, 5 minutes, 32
seconds but the real racing began in the final kilometers.
	   Stuart O'Grady of Australia held on to the leader's yellow
jersey with the riders preparing for Saturday's 58-kilometer
(36-mile) time trial from Meyrignac-L'Eglise to Correze.
	   He gained two seconds on the field by coming in third in a bonus
sprint. That moved him nine seconds ahead of George Hincapie, the
American champion who was hoping to gain enough for at least one
day in the yellow jersey before losing in the time trial.
	   He came in fourth in one sprint, just behind O'Grady.
	   ``I guess it wasn't in the cards,'' a disappointed Hincapie
said. ``It's pretty much over.''
	   Germany's Ullrich, last year's champion, is expected to do well
enough to move to the top and re-establish himself as the rider to
beat in this year's event.
	   Last year Ullrich won by more than nine minutes over Richard
Virenque, a member of the Festina team.
	   In the time trial at St. Etienne, he gained more than three
minutes on Virenque.
	   He doesn't believe it will happen again.
	   ``That won't happen because the conditions are different. Last
year, it was a mountain race, this time there are constant curves
and hills,'' Ullrich said. ``Last year everybody felt the Pyrenees
n their legs, this year everybody's still fresh. It will be a lot
closer.''
	   The Pyrenees are yet to come and Virenque hopes that he can
close the gap on Ullrich this year.
	   Virenque has won the top climber award of the Tour the last four
years with Voet as his personal trainer.

66 on Friday in the second round of his first British Open.
	   That matched the best amateur score ever at the tournament _
Woods also tied it in 1996 _ and left him one shot behind leader
Brian Watts.
	   It also had the young Englishman talking about turning pro
before his 18th birthday in two weeks.
	   ``I'm being tempted into it at the moment,'' he said. ``I
haven't made my final decision as of yet. I was going to use this
week as a guide. Now I think I could be well tempted.''
	   Last year, Rose was the youngest player ever in the Walker Cup,
golf's most prestigious amateur event. And while he had already
made a name for himself there, such a strong showing in the Open
shocked his family.
	   ``It's almost a surreal state of mind,'' said his father, Ken,
who moved his family from South Africa when Justin was 5 because it
wasn't ``quite the environment to bring up kids in.''
	   ``I'm still sitting here trying to believe this is all
happening. I mean, your kid ending up with Tiger Woods, Nick Price.
I can't quite believe it.''
	   Sitting with the elder Rose in the media center was David
Ledbetter, golf's best-known teacher. He tutored Rose for a week in
Florida a few months ago.
	   ``It's amazing to see him because the changes we worked on have
started to take place already,'' Ledbetter said. ``It's amazing for
a man _ a child of such tender years. He's really well ahead of his
years in his maturity and his golf game.''
	   Ledbetter, who also has taught Spain's Sergio Garcia _ dubbed
the next Seve Ballesteros _ called Rose one of the best
17-year-olds he's ever seen.
	   ``Justin's right up there and has a fantastic future,'' he said.
	   The future is now for Rose, who said he had plastic clubs at 11
months and began playing with real clubs at 5.
	   The 6-foot (1.82 meter), slender teen-ager clinched his 66 with
a 10-foot (3 meter) birdie putt on No. 17 and another from 20 feet
(6 meters) on No. 18 on a rainy, windy day at Royal Birkdale.
	   ``I'm still sort of taking it in,'' said Rose, who left school
at 16 to play golf full time. ``It's probably the best I've ever
played.''
	   The last amateur to win the British Open was Bobby Jones in
1930. But putting Rose in that class is premature.
	   He was knocked out of the British Amateur in the first round
last month in a tournament the 18-year-old Garcia eventually won.
And Rose is not as highly rated as the Spaniard or U.S. amateur
Matt Kuchar.
	   ``He's made the cut,'' Ledbetter said. ``Now he's got to set
some new goals and go out there the next two days and enjoy himself
and not put too much pressure on.''

Weather drives grain, soybean futures sharply higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The prospect of scorching temperatures moving
into the Midwest sent grain and soybean futures prices sharply
higher Friday at the Chicago Board of Trade.
	   Some forecasts put the temperatures in the high 90s F (30s C)
and above, a level that reduces corn pollination. The Midwest crop
is in the midst of the key pollination stage.
	   ``Traders see all that heat in Texas and the Far West, and
they're fearful of the dome moving to the east,'' said Don Roose,
president of U.S. Commodities Inc., in West Des Moines, Iowa.
	   Forecasts also call for little or no moisture for the next 10
days in the Great Plains and the western Corn Belt, adding another
stress factor to the corn and soybean crops, even though beans are
a few weeks away from their critical flowering stage.
	   Wheat futures also advanced, supported by the rally in soybeans
and by a USDA estimate of a reduced wheat crop in China because of
weather and disease damage.
	   Wheat for delivery in September settled 4 cents higher at dlrs
2.73 3-4 a bushel; September corn was 6 1-4 cents higher at dlrs
2.37 a bushel; September oats were 2 3-4 cents higher at dlrs 1.21
3-4 a bushel; and August soybeans were 12 1-2 cents higher at dlrs
6.42 1-4 a bushel.

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ Jennifer Capriati failed in the attempt
to noticeably improve her WTA rankings as she was eliminated by
unseeded German Barbara Rittner in the quarterfinals of the Palermo
Grand Prix women's tennis tournament.
	   The American player won the first set of Friday's match 6-2 but
then lost the next 4-6, 2-6 to miss the chance of a semifinal berth
in the dlrs 107,500 competition on clay.
	   Rittner, No. 95 in the WTA rankings compared with Capriati's
133, takes on in Saturday's semifinal fourth-seeded Austrian
Barbara Schett who struggled to a 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 victory
against Czech Radka Bobkova.
	   Sixth-seeded Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands also advanced
into the semifinals, breezing past Germany's Elena Wagner 6-0, 6-2.
	   Top-seeded Patty Schnyder of Switzerland played Italian
qualifier Maria Paola Zavagli in the last match of the day.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Russia's first president buried
Russia's last emperor Friday in a solemn ceremony that many hoped
would help the country make peace with the past.
	   ``We want to expiate the sins of our ancestors,'' President
Boris Yeltsin said, standing near the coffins of the murdered czar
Nicholas II and his family. ``Guilty are those who committed this
heinous crime, and those who have been justifying it for decades _
all of us.''
	   Yeltsin's strong words echoed through the St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral, filled with gold-robed priests and black-suited
descendants of the exiled Romanov dynasty, who held thin candles
during a service they had awaited for decades.
	   Indeed, Yeltsin's words echoed farther, through the rest of the
country, which has been bitterly divided over whether and how to
bury the most prominent victims of Russia's bloody revolution _ a
chapter of history many Russians still hold sacred.
	   Yeltsin insisted that it is time for his countrymen to let go of
their ideologies and historical grievances.
	   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation,'' he said.
	   For the better part of the century, Russia's Communist leaders
held that the czar and his family deserved the fate that history
had dealt them, and sought a complete break with the country's
royal past. Yeltsin's statement was aimed at mending the break.
	   Yeltsin's last-minute decision to attend the ceremonies brought
new force and drama to the event, which had been scaled down after
the Russian Orthodox Church hierarchy decided not to take part.
	   In the end, the ceremony was anything but austere. A choir sang
the long and melodic Orthodox requiem for the dead, priests filled
the pink-and-blue cathedral with clouds of incense, and dozens of
ambassadors and other dignitaries held lighted candles, symbolizing
prayers for the eternal life of the departing souls.
	   At one point, Yeltsin could be seen, hand over his chest, bowing
over the coffins.
	   About a dozen Romanov descendants followed the coffins into a
small side chapel, and threw handfuls of white sand into the crypt.
Among them was Prince Michael of Kent, representing the British
royal family, which is closely related to the Romanovs and has been
accused of doing too little to prevent their deaths.
	   Nicholas' coffin was the last. When it was lowered in, cannons
roared into a 10-minute salute that rattled the earth, reverberated
off the palaces across the Neva River and startled swallows from
their nests in the golden-spired belfry.
	   The czar was honored with 19 shots _ two less than the
traditional 21 because he abdicated the throne.
	   Rostislav Romanov, whose grandmother was the czar's sister,
called the ceremonies ``beautiful.''
	   ``It's an end and it's a beginning,'' he said. ``It means the
unfinished business is ended and we can go forward.''
	   The burial came 80 years to the day after Nicholas II, his
family and four attendants were gunned down by Bolshevik zealots
who mutilated their bodies and tried to destroy what was left.
	   In fact, even though the revolutionaries bungled the job, two
bodies have never been found _ those of the heir to the throne,
Alexei, and his sister Maria.
	   The church, deeply split over its role in post-Soviet Russia,
has cited the missing corpses and other concerns for its decision
to postpone a decision on the bones' identification. They also
decided to leave the job of performing the rites to a local priest.
	   The priest, a respected church leader in St. Petersburg, had to
walk a careful line in the services: he said a requiem for the
whole family, including those whose bodies are missing, but he did
not say their names when they were lowered into the crypt, even
though name plates adorned the coffins and the dark gray walls of
the chapel.
	   For the better part of the century, Russia's Communist leaders
held that the czar and his family deserved the fate that history
had dealt them, and sought a complete break with the country's
royal past. Yeltsin's statement was aimed at mending the break.
	   Yeltsin's call for atonement also had a personal element. He was
Communist Party chief in Yekaterinburg in 1977 when he ordered
officials to raze the Ipatiev House _ the czar's last refuge and
the house in which he and his family were murdered. In his
autobiography, Yeltsin said he was acting on orders from Moscow,
and condemned the act as ``a piece of barbarism.''
	   In July 1991, the same month he took office as Russia's first
elected president, he ordered officials to exhume the bones,
located in a roadside pit outside the city.
	   For Yeltsin, Friday's burial brought such events full circle.
	   ``I could not fail to come here,'' he said. ``I must be here
both as an individual and as the president.''
	   Outside the Peter and Paul Fortress, which surrounds the
cathedral, a group of about 40 protesters held posters of Nicholas
II and banners protesting the ceremonies. Some cited the church's
concerns, others the country's deep economic and political
troubles.
	   ``Factories are closed. People aren't getting their pay. What's
the deal with this funeral?'' asked Vyacheslav Marichev, a former
politician who helped organize the protests.
	   But at least on this day and in this place, such views were in
the minority. Most of the few thousand Russians who gathered
outside the fortress said they would respond to Yeltsin's call for
atonement.
	   ``I went to church today and prayed for the souls of the royal
family,'' said Svetlana Gorovaya, a 43-year-old mechanic who came
from her home in southern Russia to say goodbye to the czar.
``There must be peace now.''

Swiss banks say their offer stands despite reports of doubling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from World Jewish Restitution
Organization in final grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The two largest Swiss banks said Friday their
final offer to settle Holocaust claims in the United States remains
dlrs 600 million, despite reports that the amount could be doubled.
	   United Bank of Switzerland spokesman Christoph Meier in Basel
denied reports in the Financial Times of London and Germany's
Handelsblatt that the banks were considering doubling their offer.
	   Meier and Paul Rhyn, a Zurich-based spokesman for Credit Suisse
Group, said the banks' dlrs 600 million offer, made June 19, was
still valid and that there was no possibility of raising it.
	   That is ``the highest possible `rough justice' amount that can
be justified,'' Rhyn said, referring to the U.S.-sponsored efforts
to find a fair settlement based on estimates of what is owed from
Holocaust accounts.
	   Jewish groups say tens of thousands of Holocaust victims
deposited money in Swiss banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe.
But victims' relatives say bank officials stonewalled survivors and
their heirs after World War II.
	   Jewish leaders said the banks should be paying more than dlrs 1
billion.
	   The Financial Times, citing ``sources close to the
negotiations,'' said that after months of wrangling ``the World
Jewish Congress and some lawyers for Holocaust victims seem
prepared to reach a deal.''
	   The Duesseldorf-based daily Handelsblatt reported that the Swiss
banks ``apparently'' were ready to improve their offer. ``In
knowledgeable circles, a sum in the order of up to dlrs 1.2 billion
is being discussed,'' it said.
	   The Financial Times article said the latest proposal _ it did
not say which side made it _ was ``understood to be that the banks
should guarantee'' that a U.S.-led search would produce an
additional dlrs 600 million in dormant accounts that may have been
left by victims of the Nazis.
	   The proposed guarantee would be more than 10 times as much as
the dormant accounts already found by all Swiss banks, not just the
two largest involved in the New York-based negotiations.
	   There is no indication what proportion of the total sum found so
far _ 67 million Swiss francs (dlrs 46 million) _ is linked to
Holocaust victims.
	   An audit headed by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the U.S.
Federal Reserve, has employed a large team of international experts
to search every bank for dormant Holocaust-era accounts. There have
been no indications it they are finding any more funds.
	   Some U.S. cities and states have threatened to impose sanctions
on the two major banks _ which have extensive operations in the
United States _ if they do not agree an acceptable package of
compensation.
	   Later Friday in Jerusalem, the World Jewish Restitution
Organization said its chairman, Avraham Burg, ``has instructed his
legal councils to speed up the submission of the class-action suits
against the Swiss system in every place possible in the world.''
	   The WJRO statement didn't specify what was meant by ``the Swiss
system.'' It said Jewish groups ``will continue to fight with all
means possible'' for the return of Holocaust heirs' assets.

	    &UR; Old Shoes Found in Cave
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ There were no spiked heels, wing-tip dress
shoes or cross-trainer athletic shoes. But footwear crafted by
American cave dwellers thousands of years ago was fashionable,
tough and well-made.
	   ``My guess is that these shoes were very stylish for the time,''
said Michael J. O'Brien, an anthropologist who analyzed 35
specimens of sandals, moccasins and slip-ons unearthed in a
Missouri cave that was a popular campsite some 9,000 years ago.
	   The shoes were also very durable, he said. Of 35 samples
recovered, 20 were complete or nearly complete. This enabled
O'Brien and co-researchers from Louisiana State University to
analyze and date the footgear for the first time, he said. A report
on the study is being published in the Science journal.
	   The oldest specimen was a sandal made from a woven, fibrous
material that dated from about 9,400 years before the present. The
most recent, about 1,000 years old, was a classic deerskin
moccasin, probably made for a child.
	   Only the moccasins were made of leather, and the researcher said
it is likely that the cave dwellers did not use leather for shoes
much earlier than that.
	   All of the other shoes were made with fibrous plants that could
be woven into a tough fabric used for the top, bottom and sides of
the footwear. O'Brien said the most common material was from a
yucca-like plant called rattlesnake master. The leaves were dried
and plaited into cording that was then woven.
	   Footwear got hard use among the prehistoric Americans. The
people had to walk most places, since there were no horses. They
had to hunt or gather all of their food and to haul water back to
the cave, all jobs that took much walking.
	   There is no way to tell if wearers of the ancient shoes were
male or female. Foot size, he said, appears to be much like that of
modern humans.
	   ``That suggests that these people fell within the size range of
people today,'' he said.
	   The cave, which is in a bluff not far from the Missouri River,
was a spectacular home, by the standards of the time.
	   ``The cave is so dry and has been for the last 10,000 years that
all this stuff is preserved,'' he said.
	   The shoes, and other artifacts, were unearthed some 40 years ago
from cave deposits. Only recently, however, have researchers be
able to precisely date each of the footwear specimens.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use information from the story to answer the following
questions:
	   1. What does Michael J. O'Brien do for a living?
	   2. What artifacts (manmade objects) have O'Brien recently
studied and dated?
	   3. Where were the ancient shoes discovered? How long ago were
they unearthed (dug up)?
	   4. Which words in the first paragraph describe the cave
dweller's shoes?
	   5. How old is the deerskin moccasin? Who probably wore the
ancient shoe?
	   6. How were fibrous plants used to make sturdy (strong) sandals?
	   7. Why did American cave dwellers need durable footgear?
	   8. Why do you think that researches are unable to tell whether
the shoes were worn by males or females?
	   9. If the cave had been damp, what might have happened to the
old footwear?
	   10. Why do you think that spiked heels were not crafted (made)
by cave dwellers thousands of years ago?
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Answer Key: (Wording may vary)
	   1. Michael J. O'Brien is an anthropologist (scientist who
studies human beings).
	   2. O'Brien has analyzed 35 samples of ancient sandals.
	   3. The prehistoric shoes were found in a Missouri cave. They
were recovered 40 years ago.
	   4. The words fashionable, tough and well-made are used to
describe the old shoes.
	   5. The leather moccasin is thought to be 1,000 years old. It was
probably made for a child.
	   6. Cave dwellers wove fibrous material into a tough fabric that
was used to make the long-lasting footwear.
	   7. Prehistoric Americans needed durable shoes because the jobs
they did, such as hunting for food and hauling water back to their
homes, required a lot of walking.

Wind taking toll at British Open; Watts holds lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Woods, Price finishing &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Now, this is more like the British
Open.
	   Cold rain, then high winds returned to the coast of the Irish
Sea on Friday and forced play to be suspended at Royal Birkdale for
half an hour in the late afternoon.
	   As the weather took a turn for the worse, so did the games of
Tiger Woods and many of the first-round leaders, who faltered on
the suddenly testy links.
	   Through it all emerged Japanese PGA Tour player Brian Watts, the
improbable leader at 3 under. Watts, never able to stick on the
American tour, used five birdies to post his 69 early before the
weather turned even uglier.
	   Woods, who began the day with a share of the lead at 5-under 65,
struggled all day before a birdie-birdie finish gave him a 73 that
brought him back to 2 under for the tournament, a stroke behind
Watts. Tied with him was playing partner Nick Price, who used an
eagle on the 17th for a round of 72.
	   Woods had already dropped four strokes to par and was on the
11th green when wind moved the ball of playing partner Per-Ulrik
Johansson as he stood over it. A few minutes later, a horn sounded
to suspend play because of severe weather.
	   When play resumed, Johansson returned the ball to its original
position after conferring with a rules official.
	   The low round of the day belonged to 17-year-old English amateur
Justin Rose, who shot a 66 and suddenly found himself in contention
at 2-under 138.
	   On just his first hole of the day, Woods gave back his share of
the lead, hitting into a bunker for a bogey. He then three-putted
the second hole for another bogey and missed the green on the sixth
hole to end up with yet another bogey. He bogeyed the ninth after
hitting a bad tee shot and slamming his driver in disgust.
	   Woods wasn't the only one having problems. John Daly took a 10
on the 18th hole for a 78, while Tom Lehman did even worse,
shooting a 79. Both missed the cut.
	   Defending champion Justin Leonard was at 6 over after two
rounds. If he were to miss the cut, too, the last three Open
champions would all have been eliminated from weekend play.
	   It was that kind of a day at Birkdale, which was tame a day
earlier when 41 players equaled or broke par in a first round
played in light winds and warm sun.
	   Fred Couples, after starting the round a stroke behind Woods and
John Huston, faltered and needed a birdie on the 18th to finish 4
over for the day and even for the tournament. Loren Roberts began
the day tied with Couples and finished with a 76, while Davis Love
III shot 73.
	   Huston shot 77 and was at 142.
	   The leaderboard did contain one surprise. Watts has missed the
cut in three of his previous five Opens, shot a 1-under 69 to go
with the 68 he had Thursday.
	   ``I'm really not thinking about winning the golf tournament,''
Watts said.
	   Among the early finishers today were Masters champion Mark
O'Meara, who shot a 68 to get to even par, and David Duval, who had
a 71 and was 1 over.
	   ``All day it was hard,'' Duval said. ``I made some good saves,
like everybody is doing. You have to right now.''
	   The weather forced players and fans to bundle up _ Spaniard Jose
Maria Olazabal wore a wool hat pulled down low over his ears.
	   The wind cleared away the rain clouds and picked up strength as
the day went on, sending wayward shots into the deep meadow rye
lining the fairways and greens.
	   The conditions were in stark contrast to the opening round, when
light breezes and warm weather greeted golfers expecting the normal
wind and rain on the northwest coast of England.
	   One player who won't have to deal with the tough conditions is
1995 PGA champion Steve Elkington. The Australian withdrew from the
Open today because of a pinched nerve in his neck. He shot a 5-over
75 on Thursday.
	   With Woods and Huston leading the way, Americans dominated the
leaderboard in the opening round.
	   Players who make their living on the friendly courses of the PGA
Tour were right at home on the smooth fairways and soft greens, and
the scores showed it. Eight tour regulars were among the top 10
leaders, and the top five players all live in the United States.
	   In all, 27 golfers broke par and another 14 matched it on a
course that only days earlier generated predictions of U.S.
Open-type scores.
	   Those predictions came when the wind was blowing, however, and
only a breeze blew through the bushes and tall meadow rye Thursday
as Woods took his first lead in a major since winning the 1997
Masters.
	   The sun even came out by midmorning, about the same time that
Woods was making his run.
	   Woods, using a putter given to him by buddy O'Meara, broke out
of the putting slump that has bedeviled him in the majors since his
Masters win. He made four birdie putts on the front nine, and then
ran in a curling 35-footer (11 meters) on the 13th hole.
	   Woods would have had the lead all to himself but couldn't get
up-and-down from just off the 18th green, missing a 5-footer (1.5
meters) for a bogey 5.
	   The top five players and eight of the top 10 were all either
Americans or live in the United States, while Britain's top golfers
could not break par. Colin Montgomerie continued his streak of
over-par first rounds in the Open with a 73, while rising English
star Lee Westwood shot 71.

Russian oil exports up, revenues down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian oil exports were up during the first five
months of this year, but revenues were sharply down in comparison
with last year, the Interfax news agency reported Friday.
	   The Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations said
Russia's oil export revenues for January through May fell 22
percent from the same months last year, to dlrs 4.8 billion.
	   The volume of exports rose 8.6 percent, to 387 million barrels
(55.4 million metric tons), between the same periods.
	   Russia's oil revenues have plunged this year because of a sharp
drop in world prices brought on by the Asian financial crisis.
	   The Russian government has repeatedly promised to cut oil
exports to help bring on a recovery in the world prices. But
Russian producers' hunger for cash has hampered any efforts to
stabilize the prices.

Israel and Palestinians to hold top-level meeting Sunday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with confirmation of meeting, UPDATES with Erekat quotes
in grafs 7-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister will meet with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Sunday, in the first
top-level contact between the sides in months.
	   The United States has urged the two sides to hold two or three
meetings over the period of a week in an attempt to resolve their
differences over an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank and
the procedures for amending the PLO Covenant.
	   The United States has proposed _ as part of a broader peace
initiative _ that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that a smaller forum, the PLO Executive Committee, annul parts of
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposals. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at handing
over 13 percent and insists that the covenant be rescinded by the
Palestine National Council, a larger body whose members are
dispersed all over the Middle East.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Friday the
Palestinians suspected the upcoming meetings were another attempt
by Israel to gain time and wriggle out of its commitments.
	   ``We will go because the Americans want us to,'' Abourdeneh told
The Associated Press. ``Netanyahu just wants to waste time, and he
found those (the Americans) who will make this easy for him by
calling for direct talks.''
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat confirmed that a
meeting between Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai would take place Sunday evening. He
stressed that the Palestinians hoped Mordechai would come to the
meetings with a mandate to accept the U.S. proposals.
	   ``The U.S. proposals are not up for negotiations. We hope that
this (holding the meeting) will be the last extra mile the U.S.
administration asks us to go,'' said Erekat.
	   Israel had wanted the Palestinians to be represented at the
meeting by Arafat, but Erekat said the Palestinian leader would not
attend the meetings _ sending Abbas instead.
	   In a meeting of the so-called Kitchen Cabinet earlier this week,
Mordechai and Netanyahu argued over how the defense minister should
handle the talks. Netanyahu told Mordechai he should listen to what
the Palestinians have to say on the scope of the withdrawal and the
PLO Covenant, then report back to him.
	   Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot said Netanyahu had no intention of
giving Mordechai room to maneuver independently. ``What rope''
Yediot quoted Netanyahu as jokingly saying when asked if Mordechai
would be given a long enough rope, or leash, to enable him to
operate. ``A rope to hang himself with?''
	   Israel's Channel 1 TV reported that Mordechai was furious with
what he perceived as the prime minister's attempt to undermine his
authority, and was demanding a free hand in the negotiations.
	   Channel 1 further said that at the meeting with Abbas, Mordechai
planned to suggest the setting up of joint Palestinian _ Israeli
committees to discuss redeployment, the PLO charter and security
issues. The committees would conclude their work within a week.
	   Mordechai and Abbas last met in February, during a two-hour tour
of the Palestinian airport under construction in the Gaza Strip.

Opposition keeps lead over Kohl's government in latest election
</HEADLINE>
poll &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats hold a
clear lead over Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government some 10 weeks
before parliamentary elections, a poll showed Friday.
	   Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats received 37 percent
voter support, compared to 42 percent for the Social Democrats, the
Forschungsgruppe Wahlen poll said. The Greens party, seen as a
junior governing partner for the Social Democrats, polled seven
percent.
	   The survey, compiled monthly for a German public television
current affairs program, did not give a margin of error. Similar
polls usually have a margin of about plus or minus 3 percent.
	   The latest figures were largely unchanged from the June poll.
	   The Christian Democrats have trailed in the polls for months,
though Kohl has recently narrowed the gap a bit. He is running for
a record fifth term in the Sept. 27 election.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ A day after four English hooligans were
sentenced to jail terms for rioting during the World Cup, four of
their countrymen received the same fate Friday, with two of them
forbidden to return to France.
	   Two Tunisians and an Algerian also received terms Friday for the
same rioting.
	   English fans battled local residents, many of them North
Africans, in this southern city for three days surrounding the June
15 England-Tunisia game.
	   Along with violence by German thugs in the northern city of
Lens, which left a French policeman in a coma, the brawls were
among the worst disturbances of the tournament.
	   On Friday, Philip Bryan, a Royal Air Force fireman based in
Germany, was sentenced to a four-month prison term and a two-year
ban from entering France. He also was ordered to reimburse 110,000
francs (dlrs 18,300) to the Corner Cafe in Marseille's Old Port
that he and other hooligans tore apart.
	   Peter Bray, 29, of Nuneaton, and Benjamin Sharp, 28, of
Petersborough, each received one-month prison terms, already
served.
	   Thomas Rodney, 29, of Liverpool, was given a one-month sentence
and a one-year ban from French territory for throwing objects at
police and inciting others to fight.
	   Also Friday, two Tunisians, Emim Abdesstar, 24, and Fetmi
Bergachi, 19, were sentenced to one-month terms _ which they had
already served. They were immediately freed.
	   A third, Algerian Farid Michtaoui, 30, was sentenced to three
months, and banned from France for a year.
	   On Thursday, four British hooligans received jail terms.

Daly shoots himself out the British Open with a 10
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Ten. Count 'em.
	   John Daly took a sextuple-bogey 10 on the 18th hole Friday at
the British Open and needed help keeping track of the carnage.
	   Payne Stewart, who was marking Daly's card, lost track of the
count and had to be aided by the other member of the threesome,
Bernhard Langer.
	   Daly finished with an 8-over 78 _ 11 over for two rounds _ and
took himself out of a tournament he won three years ago.
	   Daly drove hit a fairway bunker on his drive. He blasted out but
landed in another fairway trap. Then, in Stewart's words, ``took
five swishes at the ball'' to escape _ only to land in a greenside
bunker. He blasted out again and two-putted from 10 feet (3
meters).
	   ``When you hit those bunkers, you just have to take your
medicine,'' Stewart said. ``He was not a happy camper when he left
here.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NIEKRO BROTHERS? &LR;  Tiger Woods was explaining how difficult it is
to get spin on a ball hit from the rough at Royal Birkdale.
``Niekro would be proud of some of the shots you can to hit to get
out of this rough.''
	   British reporters were baffled by the baseball reference. So was
the stenographer transcribing the interview. She reproduced the
following.
	   ``A negro would be proud...'' The mistake was quickly corrected.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BYE, BYE MONTIE: &LR;  Colin Montgomerie, Europe's best the last five
seasons, missed the cut Friday for the fifth time in the last seven
years with a 7-over 73-74-146.
	   Even an eagle-birdie finish couldn't keep him from missing out.
	   ``I wish I knew the answer,'' said Montgomerie. ``If I did, I'd
have worked it out six years ago when my Open form went south.''
	   Montgomerie continues as the best active player never to have
won a major and now aims at the 1999 Open in Carnoustie.
	   ``I suppose I can look forward to next year. I hold the course
record with 64 at Carnoustie,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WEATHER REPORT: &LR;  All day sunshine is expected to return Saturday
with winds kicking up to 20-25 mph (30-40 kph). Sunday could bring
heavy rain for a time, but should clear off in the afternoon with
sun and scattered showers. Winds could reach 30 mph (50 kph) in the
final.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WILDLIFE GUIDE: &LR;  Where else but a British Open would reporters
be given a guide _ not just to the course _ but to the abundant
flora and fauna just off the Royal Birkdale fairways.
	   ``The wildlife changes as you walk around the golf course,''
explains a guide produced by English Nature, the conservancy
council for England. ``The dunes inland have been colonized by
plants that are different from those by the seashore.''
	   A small sampling hole by hole: mute swan (1st hole), wild
asparagus (3rd), water mint (5th), oyster catcher (8th), gray
partridge (13th), gray heron (14th), sand lizard (17th).
	   Only in the British Open.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHIP SHOTS: &LR;  The 1996 Open champion Tom Lehman, who strained his
right shoulder doing a handstand Tuesday while playing with his
three children, went out Friday with a 9-over 79 after a 71
Thursday. ``I just didn't feel right,'' he said. ``I wasn't 100
percent or even close.'' And the shoulder? ``Just tightness and
stiffness and soreness.''
	   Last year's champion Justin Leonard shot 6-over 73-73 and said
``this is probably the toughest pill I have had to swallow in my
career.''
	   ``I'm disappointed. It may take a couple of days but I'll look
back on it as a good week.''
	   Australian Steve Elkington, the 1995 PGA champion, withdrew with
a pinched nerve in his neck after opening with a 5-over 75. Francis
Howley of Ireland also dropped out with a tendon injury after an
opening 78.
	   A total of 355 shots found bunkers in the first round. Royal
Birkdale has 117 bunkers... Ernie Els was asked what makes a good
caddy... ``Someone who turns up at the first tee on time and
sober... English 17-year-old amateur Justin Rose on hitting a shot
15 rows up into the grandstand in the first round: ``I thought they
were falling asleep.''

How ill is he? Brazil obsessed with Ronaldo's health

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ What's wrong with Ronaldo?
	   Was it epilepsy, nerves or, as Ronaldo now says, nothing at all
that caused him to play what many considered to be a lackluster
game in the World Cup championship?
	   Crushed by their team's improbable defeat, Brazilian soccer fans
are searching for an explanation for the 3-0 loss to France and
have become obsessed about the health of the team's young star, who
was reportedly ill just before the game but played anyway.
	   Exactly what happened in the hours before the championship game
has fans in an uproar, the team's doctor before a review board and
Ronaldo defending his mental health. At issue are reports that the
21-year-old went into convulsions for about 30 seconds just a few
hours before taking the field for Sunday's title game.
	   Team officials first reported that Ronaldo suffered from an
ankle injury, but within hours after the game, a new story emerged.
	   Teammates said Roberto Carlos, Ronaldo's roommate during the
World Cup, saw Ronaldo having convulsions and rushed out of the
room yelling that Ronaldo was sick. Carlos has since refused to
comment on what he saw.
	   Team physician Lidio Toledo examined Ronaldo, allowed him to
play and later said he might suffer from epilepsy, a diagnosis that
Ronaldo strongly rejects.
	   ``I underwent exams before the game and everything was all
right, so I asked to play,'' said Ronaldo, quoted in a Brazilian
newspaper.
	   But team coordinator Zico told TV Globo News on Friday that
coach Mario Zagallo should not have allowed Ronaldo to play.
	   ``He looked sleepy and groggy,'' Zico said.
	   Now Toledo faces an inquiry from the Rio de Janeiro State
Regional Medical Council to explain exactly what happened and why
he cleared Ronaldo to play.
	   Ronaldo was unavailable for comment on Friday, but Brazilian
newspapers quoted the star striker as saying that he never suffered
from convulsions.
	   ``That never happened. The problem was that the team played
poorly and they found an excuse in me for the defeat,'' he was
quoted as saying in Jornal dos Sports.
	   Ronaldo, twice voted the best player in the world by FIFA, said
he was just overworked.
	   ``The problem happened because of stress. I am tired of the
number of false news reports. They even say I had a nervous
breakdown. ... It was just stress,'' he said in the interview with
Jornal do Brasil.
	   Toledo reacted angrily to Ronaldo's denial that he suffered
convulsions.
	   ``If he says that, he must be ill even now. I want to see if he
repeats that to my face,'' he said in the same newspaper.
	   Toledo will address the review board sometime next week, said
council president Mauro Brandao.
	   ``It will be a technical analysis. ... The important thing is to
bring the truth to the public to end this avalanche of layman's
opinions that only reduce the credibility of our medical system,''
Brandao was quoted as saying in the sports daily Lance.
	   Since the loss to France, Brazilian television and newspaper
reports have been filled with speculation about what exactly
happened to Ronaldo _ and whether his ailment was ultimately
responsible for the team's loss.
	   Adding to the controversy have been rumors of a nervous
breakdown or a sinister conspiracy. One theory states that the cook
poisoned Ronaldo in the hours before the game.
	   Ronaldo denies that he suffered a breakdown and insists that
since there is nothing wrong with him he will not undergo further
tests. He only asked that journalists dogging him to leave him in
peace so that he can rest.

Festina team excluded from Tour de France in doping scandal
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The Festina cycling team was expelled from
the Tour de France on Friday, hours after the team director and
doctor were placed under formal investigation in a doping scandal
that has rocked the cycling world.
	   Director Bruno Roussel admitted to a ``concerted'' practice of
providing the team with performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, director of the Tour de France, which ends
Aug. 2 in Paris, said the team was being excluded in part to ``end
the unhealthy climate'' that has pervaded the competition since it
got underway in Dublin, Ireland, July 11.
	   ``It seems to me that the sports ethic, the morality of the Tour
are the most important things .... We have taken the decision to
exclude the Festina team starting on this day,'' Leblanc told a
news conference in Brive-La-Gaillarde, the town in central France
where the sixth stage ended Friday.
	   Leblanc said the decision was ``difficult'' but
``indispensable'' for the Tour and for the sport.
	   Earlier, in Lille, Roussel said in a statement read by his
lawyer that there was a ``concerted'' practice of providing drugs
to Festina cyclists that ran the chain of command within the team,
from director to cyclists.
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control,'' said the statement read by Thibault de Montbrial, ``in
order to avoid cyclists personally and uncontrollably supplying
themselves under conditions that could be bad for their health.''
	   Roussel and team doctor Eric Ryckaert have been in custody since
Wednesday evening after police found a stash of
performance-enhancing drugs in the team masseur's car. They were
returned to jail.
	   The masseur was placed under investigation -- a step short of
being charged -- earlier this week.
	   Officials said Roussel is under investigation for importing and
circulating prohibited merchandise as well as administering,
facilitating and inciting the use of doping substances and
infraction of drug laws. Ryckaert is under investigation for
importing and circulating prohibited merchandise.
	   Prosecutor Jean-Philippe Joubert said earlier that Festina
cyclists would be questioned as witnesses in the case after the
Tour de France ends. They now may be questioned earlier.
	   Michel Gros, who replaced Roussel, said Festina is a scapegoat
in the cycling world where doping, he claimed, is common practice.
	   ``Within the entire pack, it (doping) exists,'' Gros said in
Varetz, where the team was spending the night.
	   But one Festina cyclist, Pascal Herve, of France, said he has
``never used EPO or other things.'' He was referring to the
difficult-to-detect substance EPO that helps pump oxygen into the
bloodstream.
	   Festina's masseur, Belgian Willy Voet, was arrested by customs
officials July 9 at the French-Belgian border, his Festina team car
stocked with some 400 doses of EPO and other drugs.
	   As controversy grew, Jean-Paul Escande, former president of a
national commission against doping, said the affair is unfairly
targeting the Festina team.
	   Escande said the use of such drugs is widespread in sports.
	   ``There is more and more of it,'' he said on France 2
television.
	   Ryckaert told the L'Equipe newspaper Thursday he was ``broken''
by the allegations, and staunchly denied any involvement in doping.
	   ``My wife knows me, and she knows that everything they are
saying about me is a serious lie,'' he said.
	   Festina's main sponsor, the Spanish watch company Festina, has
threatening to break the team contract if there is evidence of drug
use among riders.

wants to step down by April 30, 1999.
	   The WTO, based in Geneva, has said it wants to choose a new
leader by Oct. 1. Officials from several other nations are also
expected to seek the post.

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ A look at the second round of the
British Open on Friday at the 7,018-yard (6,386-meter), par-70
Royal Birkdale Golf Club:
	    &UR; Leader: &LR;  Brian Watts at 3-under 137.
	    &UR; In the hunt: &LR;  Nick Price, Tiger Woods and British amateur
Justin Rose at 138.
	    &UR; Quotable:: &LR;  ``That's one of my best rounds and to play it in
these circumstances is fantastic.''_ 17-year-old Justin Rose.
	    &UR; Weatherwise: &LR;  It's not the British Open until the wind blows
and the rain comes down in sheets. It did both Friday, with the
weather changing hourly. Things got so bad in the late afternoon
that play was suspended for 30 minutes because balls were being
blown on the greens.
	    &UR; Low Amateur: &LR;  Rose, by a long shot. Spanish teen-age sensation
Sergio Garcia shot a 75 to also make it to weekend play.
	    &UR; Defending Champion: &LR;  Justin Leonard made the cut, but barely.
He shot a second straight 73 to make it to the weekend by one shot.
	    &UR; Shot of the day: &LR;  Nick Price blasted out of the bunker at No. 7
to within 4 feet (1.2 meters) to save par. His ball was barely
visible in the sand and was just 8 inches (20.3 cms) from the steep
lip.
	    &UR; Key Statistic: &LR;  Only seven rounds under par on Friday.
	    &UR; Key Pairings (Saturday):  &LR;  Tiger Woods and Nick Price, 1400
GMT; Brian Watts and Justin Rose, 1410 GMT.

Secret Service: Starr wins but public opinion in Clinton's court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Its Secret Service appeal scorned by the
courts, the White House is left clinging to an argument that drew
little legal sympathy and defending a position that hinted the
president had something to hide.
	   Yet President Bill Clinton's defenders _ and some political
analysts _ say Americans probably will side with Secret Service
agents who are willing to risk their lives for the president rather
than a special prosecutor who is out for his scalp.
	   ``This is one of those cases where the law moves in one
direction and the public moves in another,'' said Thomas Mann,
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
	   The months-long legal battle between the administration and
Kenneth Starr came to a showdown end on Friday when Chief Justice
William Rehnquist declared there was insufficient evidence that
compelling Secret Service agents to testify would cause
``irreparable harm.''
	   Secret Service agents, including the head of the president's
security detail, reported to the courthouse to testify. Their
bosses had warned that forcing agents to testify would ruin
confidences, cause presidents to push away their protectors and
increase the risk of assassination.
	   The courts were not moved. All the way up the line, judges found
that there is no history in federal law of a protective function
privilege for the Secret Service.
	   ``The court is not ultimately persuaded that a president would
put his life at risk for fear that a Secret Service agent might be
called to testify before a grand jury about observed conduct or
overheard statements,'' U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson
wrote. All the way up the appeals chain, her colleagues agreed.
	   The president refused to comment on the legal struggle, saying
he had an opinion but that it would be inappropriate to express it.
But Clinton was clear about his feelings May 22 when a lower court
judge ruled agents have no privilege against testifying.
	   ``At least it will have a chilling effect perhaps on the
conversations presidents have and the work that they do and the way
they do it,'' Clinton said then. He acknowledged there was no law
on the matter but added, ``It never occurred to anybody that anyone
would ever be so insensitive to the responsibility of the Secret
Service that this kind of legal question would arise.''
	   The Secret Service was sufficiently disturbed to take Clinton's
lead agent, Larry Cockell, off his post for the time being.
	   It is unprecedented for a Secret Service agent to be forced to
testify in a criminal investigation of the president. Clinton
defender James Carville says Starr's pursuit of Secret Service
agents proves he is out of control.
	   ``I think all this does is confirm everything that people
already think about Starr,'' said Carville. ``He's obsessed with
getting the president. ... They're trying to glean political
information out of these (agents) so they can give it to their
people on Capitol Hill. They want to know where he (Clinton) was
every night for two years.''
	   Mann said there is merit both to Starr's legal argument and
Carville's political assessment.
	   ``Starr is probably right, and he's being supported by the bench
in his legal arguments,'' Mann said. ``But most Americans think
what he's doing is highly inappropriate, that he is engaged in a
very aggressive prosecutorial effort that seems out of balance with
the severity of the charges being investigated.
	   ``It's one more case where Americans are much more interested in
protecting the safety of the president than in establishing the
legal right of the independent counsel to compel grand jury
testimony by his Secret Service protectors,'' Mann said.
	   Clinton's popularity ratings _ in the mid to high 60s _ have
weathered more difficult challenges and there's little reason to
suspect he will be hurt by the Secret Service case. ``It's
summertime. I think peoples' minds are on other things,'' said
Vanderbilt University political scientist Erwin Hargrove.
	   But the president definitely has lost in terms of the shrinking
of the boundaries of confidentiality and privilege. With the forced
testimony of Secret Service agents, virtually everyone in the White
House can be compelled to report on seemingly private matters _
from a president blowing off steam to talking in the back seat of
his limousine.

Argentine government announces only small dip in unemployment rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES (AP) _ Argentina's jobless rate fell to 13.2
percent in May, dipping just slightly from 13.7 percent when
figures were last reported in October 1997, the government
announced Friday.
	   The pall cast by Asia's economic crisis was partly to blame for
only slight improvement in the rate, independent analysts said.
Nonetheless, May joblessness was down sharply from 17.3 percent in
May 1997.
	   Economists said job creation has stalled, given that key
employment indicators, including industrial production and
construction-sector growth, have slowed recently due to the Asian
crisis.
	   ``I don't think we could seriously have expected any change
worth mentioning,'' said analyst Roberto Frenkel of the State and
Society Studies Center, a think tank.
	   ``Manufacturing and production growth pretty much slowed to a
halt during the period and, with it, the government's plans to
reduce unemployment,'' he added.
	   Unemployment hit a record 18.4 percent in May 1995, triggered by
a Mexican peso devaluation. The jobless rate has remained
stubbornly high ever since, squelching the most hopeful official
forecasts that unemployment could be dropped to 11 percent come
October.

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Brian Watts was born in Canada, grew
up in Dallas, makes his home in Oklahoma and plays golf for a
living in Japan.
	   So it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that he's leading the
British Open. His father is English, after all.
	   Feeling right at home on a rainy, windy day at Royal Birkdale,
Watts put up an early 69 Friday, then went someplace warm and dry
to wait as the first-round leaders made their way back onto the
course.
	   By the time they finished struggling through the howling winds
and driving, late-afternoon rain, Watts' name was all alone atop
the leaderboard.
	   ``I really had no expectations whatsoever, which is probably a
good thing,'' Watts said.
	   Neither did anyone else, especially those wondering just who
Watts was as he took the lead. Unlike Japan, where he can walk down
a street and hear people say, ``Oh, Brian Watts,'' few fans at
Birkdale seemed to know him.
	   They may find out, though, if he can keep up the pace. He
followed his opening-round 68 with a 69 that put him at 3-under 137
after 36 holes on the links course on the Irish Sea.
	   Watts made some mistakes early, with a bogey on the first hole
and a double bogey on the par-3 fourth. But he made up for them
with five birdies, including a final one on the 17th on a day when
par was an accomplishment.
	   Not bad, considering Watts struggled during practice rounds
trying to keep the ball in play.
	   ``Sunday, Monday and Tuesday didn't give me my belief in the
world that I could even make a birdie on this golf course,'' he
said.
	   The 32-year-old Watts, playing in his sixth Open, has taken a
circuitous route to the top of the leaderboard. After turning pro
in 1988 out of Oklahoma State, he struggled at first trying to
qualify for the PGA Tour and then trying to stay on it.
	   Finally giving up, he began playing in Japan in 1993 and has
since become a star on the Japanese PGA Tour, with 10 wins.
	   Watts commutes from his Oklahoma home to the Japanese tour,
flying back and forth six or seven times a year and staying at
hotels while playing there. The conditions are tougher than on the
American tour, but the competition isn't, allowing Watts to make a
good living.
	   ``Depending on the exchange rate, the best year I had was 1994
when I won five times and I made 139 million yen, which at the time
was about dlrs 1.4 million,'' Watts said.
	   He has played an occasional tournament in the United States on
sponsor exemptions, and has climbed into the top 50 in the world
rankings because of his strong showings in Japan.
	   Watts caused some consternation in Japan in May when he hit two
balls toward the ocean in the second round of the Fujisankei
Classic in a deliberate attempt to miss the cut. He did, by three
strokes.
	   He was fined for that, and also banned from the Japan Open as
part of his penalty.
	   ``I made a mistake,'' Watts said, declining to discuss it
further.
	   By contrast, he didn't make many Friday while the leaders went
backward. Still, Watts was trying to put out of his mind any
thoughts of a victory that could give him an exemption on the PGA
Tour and eliminate some long trips to Japan.
	   ``I'm really not thinking about winning the golf tournament
today,'' Watts said.

Mexican stocks, peso close higher

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican stocks endured a bout of
profit-taking and closed a notch higher Friday in active trading.
	   The key IPC index closed up 19.11 points, or 0.4 percent, to
4,674.53 points. At the end of 1997, the IPC stood at 5,229.35.
	   Turnover was a healthy 1.07 billion pesos on 57.1 million shares
traded, compared to Thursday's volume of 85.5 million shares worth
1.72 billion.
	   The market looked solid, even though it lost some of Friday's
early gains to profit-taking.
	   The peso strengthened further against the U.S. dollar Friday
after appreciating a nominal 1.4 percent during the week,
continuing the trend set by positive stock performances and the
absence of negative news on the international front.
	   On 48-hour spot markets in Mexico City, banking leader Banamex
quoted the closing midrate at 8.806 to the dollar, stronger from
its open of 8.814 and also stronger from its close Thursday of
8.826.
	   Friday's gains were fueled by market participants placing dollar
sell orders ahead of the weekend.
	   Next week, traders said the peso trend will be a bit more
difficult to forecast because investors will be keeping a close eye
on developments in Russia and Japan.
	   In futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, September
1998 contracts closed at 9.0273 after closing Thursday at 9.0580.
December 1998 deliveries moved to 9.4007 from 9.4340. March 1999
contracts moved to 9.7680 from 9.8039, June 1999 futures moved to
10.1420 from 10.1833 and September 1999 contracts moved to 10.5485
from 10.5708.

Secret Service: Starr wins but public opinion in Clinton's court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUB 8th graf pvs to CLARIFY that Clinton was speaking of
Johnson's ruling &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Its Secret Service appeal scorned by the
courts, the White House is left clinging to an argument that drew
little legal sympathy and defending a position that hinted the
president had something to hide.
	   Yet President Bill Clinton's defenders _ and some political
analysts _ say Americans probably will side with Secret Service
agents who are willing to risk their lives for the president rather
than a special prosecutor who is out for his scalp.
	   ``This is one of those cases where the law moves in one
direction and the public moves in another,'' said Thomas Mann,
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
	   The months-long legal battle between the administration and
Kenneth Starr came to a showdown end on Friday when Chief Justice
William Rehnquist declared there was insufficient evidence that
compelling Secret Service agents to testify would cause
``irreparable harm.''
	   Secret Service agents, including the head of the president's
security detail, reported to the courthouse to testify. Their
bosses had warned that forcing agents to testify would ruin
confidences, cause presidents to push away their protectors and
increase the risk of assassination.
	   The courts were not moved. All the way up the line, judges found
that there is no history in federal law of a protective function
privilege for the Secret Service.
	   ``The court is not ultimately persuaded that a president would
put his life at risk for fear that a Secret Service agent might be
called to testify before a grand jury about observed conduct or
overheard statements,'' U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson
wrote. All the way up the appeals chain, her colleagues agreed.
	   The president refused to comment on the legal struggle, saying
he had an opinion but that it would be inappropriate to express it.
But Clinton was clear about his feelings May 22 when Johnson ruled.

Death threats reported against chaplains urging end to march
</HEADLINE>
protest
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Orangemen staging protest in Portadown graf 12

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Death threats have been
reported against three chaplains who had appealed for an end to a
Protestant demonstration over a blocked march after three young
brothers died in a sectarian firebombing.
	   The Rev. Robert Coulter, one of the three clergy from the Orange
Order, a Protestant fraternal organization, said Friday that he had
reason to believe the threats were the work of cranks. But another,
the Rev. Warren Porter, said police were taking them seriously.
	   ``They came to tell us in the middle of the night, but I am not
particularly worried about it,'' Porter said. ``You just never
know. But there is one above all of us who will determine the day I
die.''
	   The third chaplain receiving threats was the Rev. William
Bingham, the first Orange Order member to declare that a march down
the Catholic Garvaghy Road in Portadown, about 25 miles (40 kms)
southwest of Belfast, would be a ``hollow victory'' in the shadow
of three coffins.
	   Bingham refused comment, and the police would provide no
information.
	   The Orange Order issued a statement saying it was ``deeply
shocked'' at reports of the threats, adding, ``We again condemn all
threats of violence and acts of intimidation against any person,
regardless of denomination or occupation.''
	   Tensions spilling over from the blocked march were blamed for
the Sunday morning firebombing that took the lives of Richard, Mark
and Jason Quinn in Ballymoney, 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of
Belfast.
	   On Friday, police arrested four more people in connection with
the deaths. Three other suspects remained in custody.
	   Authorities say they believe the Quinn household _ located in a
staunchly Protestant housing complex _ was targeted because the
boys' Catholic mother lived there with her Protestant boyfriend.
	   Meanwhile, police on Friday charged a 32-year-old east Belfast
woman, Pauline Gilmore, and an unnamed man, 40, with explosives
offenses relating to protests around the failed march. Police also
said they had uncovered a blast bomb, 200 shotgun cartridges and
some petrol bombs in a Protestant area of Portadown.

walk down Garvaghy Road went ahead Friday night, with senior
leaders of the fraternal order pledging to continue their protest.
Police said the protest was peaceful.

Tyson applies for boxing license in New Jersey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS MARTELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Mike Tyson, who hasn't fought since
Nevada revoked his license for biting Evander Holyfield's ears
during a championship bout last year, has applied for a boxing
license in New Jersey.
	   Tyson's attorney, Anthony Fusco Jr., said the former heavyweight
champion has strong ties to the state, where he once lived and made
Atlantic City one of his favorite fighting venues. The state
Athletic Control Board has scheduled a July 29 hearing in Trenton
to consider the license application. Fusco said Tyson will attend
the hearing.
	   Nevada officials said they expect New Jersey and other states to
continue to abide by their 1997 decision to revoke Tyson's license
and fine him dlrs 3 million. Tyson became eligible to apply for a
new Nevada license on July 9, but has not.
	   ``We expect all states to honor our revocation,'' said Marc
Ratner, executive director of the Nevada Athletic Commission.
Ratner said his commission would consider the boxer's license
revoked until Tyson reapplies in Nevada.
	   Fusco, however, said that although other states have abided by
the revocation, they are not bound by it.
	   ``Mike Tyson, as any other fighter, makes the decision as to
where he or she wants to fight and wants to be licensed,'' Fusco
said. ``He has strong ties to New Jersey. He had some good fights
there. At this point, Mike's only intention is to be licensed in
New Jersey.''
	   New Jersey officials say the state has never revoked Tyson's
boxing license. However, state boxing licenses expire after one
year. Tyson has not applied for a new license in many years,
according to Rhonda Utley-Herring, a spokeswoman for the state
Athletic Control Board.
	   Roger Shatzkin, a spokesman for state Attorney General Peter
Verniero, acknowledged there is no federal law binding states to
honor boxing license revocations in other states.
	   ``But we are not licensing him at this point,'' Shatzkin said.
``We're holding a hearing.''
	   Fusco said Tyson, who once lived in Bernardsville, still owns
property in New Jersey. Among locations at which Tyson owns homes
are Las Vegas and Southington Township, Ohio.
	   Although most boxing applications are evaluated without a formal
hearing, Verniero suggested such a hearing to develop a legal
record to determine if Tyson satisfied the criteria.
	   A decision would be made within 45 days of the hearing, Shatzkin
said.
	   Fusco said Tyson regrets biting Holyfield.
	   ``You have to look at all of Mike's fights, and you'll never see
a foul,'' said Fusco. ``It's one moment we obviously regret. Mike
Tyson has taken the necessary steps and wants to move forward.''
	   Shelly Finkel, an adviser to Tyson, said the boxer simply hasn't
fought in New Jersey in a long time and wants to fight in the
state. When asked what would happen if New Jersey turns Tyson down,
Finkel said: ``I'll worry about that then.''
	   More than one-quarter of Tyson's 48 professional fights have
been in New Jersey. But he hasn't fought in the state since Dec. 8,
1990, when he beat Alex Stewart in Atlantic City in a non-title
bout. In addition, Tyson fought in New Jersey eight times prior to
winning the heavyweight championship in 1986, and made four title
defenses in Atlantic City, against Tyrell Biggs, Larry Holmes,
Michael Spinks and Carl Williams.
	   In 1995, Tyson was to fight Buster Mathis Jr. in Atlantic City,
but the bout was moved to Philadelphia after the state Casino
Control Commission upheld a ban prohibiting his promoter, Don King,
from doing business with casinos.
	   Regulators instituted the ban in 1994 because of a pending wire
fraud indictment against King. The promoter was recently cleared of
the charges, and can reapply for his license in New Jersey,
regulators say. But Tyson in the last year has split from King,
claiming he and his former co-managers took millions of dollars
from him. He is suing King.

	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cubans on the first U.S. commercial flight to the
island in two years arrived with many precious things: basic
medicines, video games _ and lots of U.S. dollars.
	   So after the hugs, the kisses, the big family meals, Cuban
emigres visiting from South Florida got down to the serious
business of shopping.
	   Armed with coveted U.S. greenbacks, the visitors bought their
loved ones shampoo, soap, vegetable oil _ basic things many Cubans
often must do without because they do not have American dollars.
	   ``I feel happy to be able to help my family, and to see them,''
said Daisy Dominguez, who works at a supermarket cafeteria in
Hollywood, Florida.
	   Sending and bringing U.S. dollars to loved ones in Cuba _ and
taking relatives shopping at dollar-only stores during family
visits _ has become an increasingly important act for emigres now
living 200 miles (320 kilometers) to the north in the Miami area.

 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIVE-LA GAILLARDE, France (AP) _ It almost seemed like a normal
day on the Tour de France.
	   Mario Cipollini held off a bunch of sprinters for his second
stage victory in a row, as he did last year. Defending champion Jan
Ullrich is set to strike to stake his claim as the top rider of the
Tour.
	   Then Festina officials were placed under investigation after
admitting its cyclists were supplied with performance-enhancing
drugs.
	   Then, the team was expelled.
	   The news, a bombshell to the cycling world, was certain to shock
riders competing in Saturday's seventh stage -- without their
Festina colleagues.
	   The sixth stage moved from La Chatre to Brive-La Gaillarde, 204
kilometers (127 miles) trying to distance itself from the growing
drug drama.
	   But then the focus shifted to Lille, in the north, where Festina
team director Bruno Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were
placed under investigation Friday for importing prohibited
substances and other counts connected to the drug scandal.
	   Roussel admitted to a ``concerted'' practice of providing the
team with drugs.
	   The two joined Willy Voet, a Festina team trainer jailed July 9
after customs officers found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems.
	   EPO, among the drugs found in Voet's car, is a substance that
aids the transport of oxygen within the blood stream and is
difficult to detect.
	   Roussel was placed under investigation for importing and
circulation of prohibited merchandise as well as administering,
facilitating and inciting the use of doping substances and
infraction of drug laws.
	   Ryckaert was placed under investigation for importing and
circulating prohibited merchandise, according to officials.
	   Hours later, at a news conference in Brive, Tour de France
Director Jean-Marie Leblanc announced that Festina was being
excluded immediately from the Tour -- a ``difficult'' but
``indispensable'' decision.
	   ``It seems to me that the sports ethic, the morality of the Tour
are the most important things ....,'' Leblanc said, saying he hoped
the decision would end the unhealthy climate with the race since it
started in Dublin July 11.
	   A statement earlier by Roussel said the Festina direction,
doctors, masseurs and cyclists were involved in the scheme to
supply riders with drugs.
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control,'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves under conditions
that could be bad for their health.''
	   Prosecutor Jean-Philippe Joubert said Festina cyclists would be
questioned as witnesses in the case.
	   Michel Gros, who replaced Roussel, said that ``within the entire
pack, it (doping) exists.''
	   A rider denied the charges.
	   `I never took any EPO or any other prohibitive products. I only
took products for recuperation, '' said Pascal Herve, a member of
he Festina team in Varetz, where the team was staying Friday night.
	   Friday's stage was almost a repeat of Thursday with an early
attack followed by a final mass sprint that Cipollini ruled. Second
this time was Nicola Minali, another Italian, with Czech Jan
Svorada third.
	   Three more top sprinters -- Frederic Moncassin of France, Erik
Zabel of Germany and Tom Steels of Belgium -- were right behind.
	   Cipollini's time for the day was five hours, 5 minutes, 32
seconds but the real racing began in the final kilometers.
	   Stuart O'Grady of Australia held on to the leader's yellow
jersey with the riders preparing for Saturday's 58-kilometer
(36-mile) time trial from Meyrignac-L'Eglise to Correze.
	   He gained two seconds on the field by coming in third in a bonus
sprint. That moved him nine seconds ahead of George Hincapie, the
American champion who was hoping to gain enough for at least one
day in the yellow jersey before losing in the time trial.
	   He came in fourth in one sprint, just behind O'Grady.
	   ``I guess it wasn't in the cards,'' a disappointed Hincapie
said. ``It's pretty much over.''
	   Germany's Ullrich, last year's champion, is expected to do well
enough to move to the top and re-establish himself as the rider to
beat in this year's event.
	   Last year Ullrich won by more than nine minutes over Richard
Virenque, a Festina team member.
	   In the time trial at St. Etienne, he gained more than three
minutes on Virenque, now out of the race.
	   Virenque has won the top climber award of the Tour the last four
years with Voet as his personal trainer.

Irwin takes lead in Ameritech Senior Open, breaks course record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONG GROVE, Illinois (AP) _ Hale Irwin birdied the 18th hole to
finish a 10-under 62 Friday, setting a course record and tying the
Ameritech Senior Open tournament record.
	   Riding a hot putter to nine birdies through the first 12 holes,
it wasn't a matter of if Irwin would break the record at Kemper
Lakes Golf Club, but only by how much.
	   ``I would take today's putting round over just about anything
I've had in a long time,'' said Irwin, whose shaky putter cost him
the Senior Players Championship last weekend.
	   ``Maybe the moons and stars were in the right alignment,'' he
said. ``Maybe tomorrow they'll be all mixed up, I don't know. It
was kind of a serene environment to play in, and you're not always
in that state of mind.''
	   Joe Inman, who qualified for the Senior PGA Tour last year after
11 years away from competitive golf, was three strokes behind Irwin
with a 65. Hugh Baiocchi was at 66, and Al Geiberger, David
Lundstrom, Mike McCullough and Bruce Summerhays shot 68s.
	   Defending champion Gil Morgan, who beat Irwin by three strokes
last weekend, was seven back Friday at 69.
	   Irwin, who has already won three events this season, could tell
early on he had a special round going. His putter carried him the
entire day, starting with a 12-foot (3 1/2-meter) birdie putt on
the par-4 No. 1.
	   He birdied Nos. 3-6 and No. 8, and then flirted with a bogey on
the ninth. Irwin put his second shot in the right-hand bunker, but
he blasted out to within six feet of the hole, sinking his putt to
save par.
	   After birdies on the first three holes of the back nine, Irwin
couldn't help but get a little excited. He's shot 62 two other
times on the senior tour _ and a 61 on the PGA Tour _ and he
wondered if maybe, just maybe, this would be the day he broke 60.
	   It wasn't to be. His putt on No. 15 stopped just short of the
hole, and a 10-footer (3 meters) on No. 17 rolled about six inches
(15 cms) past the cup.
	   On No. 18, Irwin's second shot went straight at the pin and
looked as if it might even drop in before rolling about six feet
by. He smiled as the putt dropped in to put him 10-under, and the
gallery broke out in a loud cheer.
	   Irwin's only real mishap of the day was on the second hole, when
he missed a 6-foot (1.8-meter) birdie putt.
	   Inman, becoming more comfortable with every tournament he plays,
came on strong on the back nine. After sinking a 20-foot (6-meter)
putt to birdie No. 10, he had birdies on Nos. 12, 13, 15 and 16. He
finished with a birdie on No. 18.
	   ``All the putts I had been missing lately went in on the back
nine,'' Inman said. ``I've been putting great, but they haven't
gone in lately.''
	   Despite his solid round, Inman said he's not even thinking of
winning the tournament. That's for guys like Irwin and Morgan to
worry about, he said.
	   ``They're playing one tournament and we're all playing
another,'' Inman said.

Jones wants be heavyweight champion, period!

 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Roy Jones Jr. wants to be a heavyweight _ once.
	   ``One time for the heavyweight championship and that's it,''
said the man considered by many the world's best pound-for-pound
fighter.
	   Until that happens, however, the 29-year-old will continue to
campaign as a heavyweight.
	   The WBC champion will fight WBA champion Lou Del Valle in a
light heavyweight title unification match Saturday night in The
Theater at Madison Square Garden.
	   There have been angry words between the two men, who once had an
employer-employee relationship. The 30-year-old Del Valle sparred
38 rounds with Jones in 1995 when Jones was preparing for a
first-round knockout of Antoine Byrd in defense of the IBF super
middleweight title. Jones also has been the IBF middleweight
champion.
	   ``Now he knows what to look for, what to run from,'' Jones said.
``But he can't get away.''
	   ``I might not be a great fighter, but I have the style to beat
Roy Jones,'' said Del Valle, a left-handed counterpuncher. Jones
also likes to counterpunch, but Del Valle said he expects Jones to
come out on the attack.
	   ``He's a good counterpuncher and he's left-handed,'' Jones said.
``I have to give him that, but he can't keep me off of him.''
	   Jones weighed in Friday at 175 pounds (79 kgs) for the 12-round
bout. On the undercard is a 10-round featherweight bout between
Kevin Kelley of New York and Derrick ``Smoke'' Gainer of Pensacola,
Florida.
	   Del Valle, a 175-pound (79-kg) New Yorker, will be making his
first defense of the WBA title he won by stopping Eddy Smulders in
the eighth round last Sept. 20. His record is 27-1 with 19
knockouts.
	   Jones has twice held the WBC light heavyweight title. He lost it
when he was disqualified in the ninth round on March 21, 1997, for
twice hitting Montell Griffin while he was down.
	   Jones regained the title by knocking out Griffin in the first
round Aug. 7. Jones' record is 36-1 with 31 knockouts.

Courier, Agassi give U.S. 2-0 advantage over Belgium

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The United States picked the surface and
Belgium paid the price in the opening singles matches of a Davis
Cup quarterfinal match Friday.
	   Andre Agassi became the third-winningest Davis Cup player in
U.S. history and Jim Courier also won to give the United States a
2-0 advantage in the best-of-5 series.
	   Agassi broke a tie with Bill Tilden and moved to within one
victory of tying the late Arthur Ashe for second on the U.S. list
by topping Christophe Van Garsse 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.
	   Agassi, who is 19th in the ATP rankings after falling to 141st
last fall, improved his Davis Cup record to 26-5.
	   In the opening match at the Indianapolis Tennis Center, Courier
beat Filip Dewulf 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 2-7, 6-3.
	   The United States can extend its home winning streak to 18
series with a doubles victory by Richey Reneberg and Todd Martin on
Saturday. The singles pairings will be reversed when the best-of-5
series ends on Sunday. The United States-Belgium winner plays Italy
or Zimbabwe in the semifinals Sept. 25-27. Italy leads that series
2-0 and would travel to the United States if both teams advance.
	   Dewulf, who climbed past Courier to 43rd by reaching the
semifinals of the Swiss Open last week, looked lost on the hard
surface against Courier.
	   ``I didn't feel really comfortable on this kind of surface,''
said Dewulf, whose best success on the tour has come on clay where
he learned the game.
	   Dewulf hit more winners (42) that Courier (20), but unforced
errors produced his undoing. He had 54 to Courier's 36.
	   ``This is just not my kind of surface,'' he said. ``I don't feel
at ease on this surface. A lot depends on your return and serve.
Those are not my favoite strokes of my game.
	   ``I made a lot of unforced errors, especially on the service
returns at important points.''
	   The match between Courier, who has never played on a losing Cup
team in 11 previous times on the U.S. team, and Dewulf was much
closer than the score indicated. Courier had only a 123-117
advantage in points won.
	   ``I played solidly,'' said Courier, who came back from a 2-1
deficit in sets to win the decisive fifth match against Russia in
the opening Davis Cup round to get the United States into this
series.
	   Courier, who had lost seven of his last eight matches this year,
needed just 37 minutes to win the opening set as he overcame a 3-1
deficit when Dewulf had 20 unforced errors.
	   Van Garsse never got into the match against Agassi, who lost
only one point while jumping to a 3-0 lead in the opening set and
needed just 93 minutes to complete the match.
	   ``He's not a hundred times stronger than me, not a thousand
times, but a million times too strong for me,'' the 24-year-old Van
Garsse said. ``I couldn't imagine that somebody could play so fast
on the ball and put so much pressure on me.
	   ``It's tough to say if I played well or not, but I was really
impressed.''
	   ``I felt like I was having to just kind of stay on top of him,
stay controlled, stay inside of myself,'' said Agassi, who had only
16 unforced errors, compared to 37 by Van Garsse.
	   The United States has won more Davis Cup titles (31) and more
Davis Cup matches (187) than any other country. It is 2-0 against
Belgium, having prevailed 4-1 in 1953 and 3-2 in 1957.
	   In other quarterfinals, Germany and Sweden split their opening
singles, as did Mexico and the Bahamas, while Spain leads
Switzerland 2-0 and Italy leads Zimbabwe 2-0.
	   At Hamburg, Germany, Tommy Haas upset Jonas Bjorkman 6-3, 7-6
(7-4), 7-5 before Sweden's Thomas Enqvist evened the quarterfinal
by sweeping Nicolas Kiefer 6-3, 6-3, 7-5.
	   ``It's what we wanted from the singles,'' said Boris Becker,
head of Germany's Davis Cup team. ``It leaves everything open.''
	   At Guadalajara, Mexico, Alejandro Hernandez beat Roger Smith of
the Bahamas, 6-3, 6-1, 6-3, and Mark Knowles of the Bahamas beat
Luis Enrique Herrera 6-3, 1-6, 6-2, 6-2.
	   At La Coruna Spain, Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja won for Spain
on clay courts. Moya, the French Open champion, beat 142nd-ranked
Ivo Heuberger 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 and Corretja downed Marc Rosset 6-1,
6-2, 6-2.
	   At Prato, Italy, Andrea Gaudenzi and Davide Sanguinetti defeated
Zimbabwe's Black brothers. Gaudenzi downed Wayne Black 6-3, 6-3,
6-4, then Sanguinetti took Byron Black 6-3, 6-3, 6-0.

Grodas signs with Schalke 04
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After an unsuccessful stay in Tottenham,
Norwegian national team goalkeeper Frode Grodas signed a contract
Friday with the German club Schalke 04.
	   The 33-year-old played all the games for Norway in the World
Cup, but he has not played club soccer since he won the 1997 FA Cup
final against Middlesbrough with Chelsea.
	   In Chelsea, Grodas was behind Ed de Goey and Dimitri Kharine in
the Stamford Bridge pecking order. Grodas did not get along with
manager Ruud Gullit and transferred to Tottenham hoping for better
luck.
	   In Tottenham, Grodas was the third pick again behind Ian Walker
and fellow Norwegian Espen Baardsen.
	   Baardsen was also in the Norwegian World Cup squad, but he was a
substitute for Grodas. However, Grodas was Norwegian coach Egil
``Drillo'' Olsen's trusted goalie for four years even if he did not
play club soccer, an exception to Olsen's policies.
	   ``It's going to be good to play club soccer again. I got to know
about this two days ago, but when things happen, they happen
fast,'' Grodas told Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   When Grodas comes to Schalke on Monday, he will have to battle
for a spot again. Earlier this season, Werder Bremen's Oliver Reck,
33, transferred to Schalke. He had been with Werder Bremen since
the 1987-88 season.
	   It is not known what Schalke paid for Grodas.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Leaders from seven Central
American nations and Mexico agreed Friday to join forces on areas
of common political and economic interest, but remained far from
reviving the common market they had in the 1960s.
	   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo agreed to support Central
American countries in their efforts to get preferential trade
status with the United States, and the eight countries agreed to
act as partners in commerce, services and investments.
	   The 69-point agreement signed at the end of the two-day Tuxtla
III conference included articles on immigration, fighting drugs,
education, technical exchanges, health, transportation and cultural
development.
	   Delegates from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador intensified
negotiations for a joint free trade agreement with Mexico. Mexican
Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco said he expects the agreement
will be signed before the end of this year.
	   Costa Rica signed such a free trade agreement with Mexico four
years ago and Nicaragua earlier this year.
	   Central America had a common market from 1960 until 1969, but it
collapsed after a brief war between Honduras and El Salvador.
	   Prolonged leftist guerrilla and anti-guerrilla wars in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala further damaged the region's
economy.
	   The first Tuxtla conference, concentrating on economic recovery
and closer ties, was organized by Mexico and took place in 1991 in
Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of the Mexican state of Chiapas.
	   Mexico views the expanded Central American region with its

Greene, Boldon put brakes on talk of record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Losing can be humbling, as Maurice
Greene and Ato Boldon are discovering.
	   That's why they have stopped talking about breaking the
100-meter world record, as they were earlier in the year, and are
just concentrating on winning.
	   That's after Greene, the 1997 world champion, was beaten by
Namibia's Frankie Fredericks at Oslo, Norway, last week, and both
Greene and Boldon, the 1998 world leader in the 100, lost to
Fredericks at Rome this week.
	   ``We've decided that we've put too much emphasis on the world
record,'' Greene said Friday. ``Now, I just want to run the best I
can, and if the world record comes, it comes.''
	   ``Maybe we've been getting too caught up in running against the
clock,'' Boldon said.
	   Greene and Boldon will be competing in the Goodwill Games, in
which competition begins Sunday and the 100 final is Tuesday.
	   Although Fredericks will not be there, Greene and Boldon will be
facing Canada's Donovan Bailey, the 1995 world champion, 1996
Olympic gold medalist and world record-holder.
	   Bailey did not enamor himself to Greene and Boldon after
downgrading Greene's victory at the world championships in Greece
last year and questioning his fast times early this year.
	   Bailey, the runner-up at the worlds, said he was beaten because
he was slowed by food poisoning before the meet, causing him to
lose 14 pounds. As Greene crossed the finish line, he looked at
Bailey and stuck his tongue out.
	   The rivalry continued early this year, when Greene beat Bailey
in Australia. In the first race, Greene ran 10.06 seconds, Bailey
10.36. In the second race, Greene ran 9.99, Bailey dropped out with
a bruised heel.
	   Later, after Greene set the 60-meter world indoor record of
6.39, Bailey said all athletes should be subjected to an
independent blood test beside the urine sample they now must
submit.
	   ``I never want to imply that anyone is taking anything
(illegal),'' Bailey said, adding he was not targeting Greene.
	   Greene was not convinced and took offense to Bailey's
insinuation.
	   On Friday, Greene and Boldon were more contrite.
	   ``Donovan's a great athlete,'' said Boldon, a native of Trindad
&AMP; Tobago. ``He's tough.
	   ``But we've set the standard this year. He's running now what we
were running at the beginning of the year. We just want to finish
1-2 or 1-2-3 if Jon (Drummond, also a teammate) is running.''
	   ``I love running against Donovan,'' Greene said. ``He's a tough
competitor. He brings out the best in me.''
	   Boldon's best time this year is 9.86, which he has run twice,
first at Walnut, California April 19, then at Athens June 17.
	   The Athens race was run into a headwind and that might have cost
Boldon the chance to break Bailey's world record of 9.84, set at
the Atlanta Games in 1996.
	   Before the race, ``the wind was blowing the right way,'' Boldon
said. ``I said, `Here we go.' I had set myself up to break the
world record. Then, the wind changed and we ran into a headwind of
0.4 meters per second.''
	   ``When you crunch the numbers, that's the fastest race ever
run,'' Boldon said, ``but the wind was against me.''
	   Greene's fastest time this year is 9.96, which he also has run
twice, first in the semifinals of the USA Championships last month
at New Orleans (he withdrew from the final with stomach cramps),
then at Oslo in losing to Fredericks by .01 of a second after
leading most of the way.
	   ``I've been talking too much about the world record, so I
haven't been able to run my best technique,'' Greene said. ``I
haven't had the right reaction time, I've cut my drive phase off
and I haven't had the acceleration.''
	   Bailey's best time this year is 10.07, once in Qatar on May 7,
then in Germany on July 11.
	   His world record probably will be safe at the Goodwill Games
because Boldon said the runners again will be running into a
headwind at the Mitchel Field Athletic Complex.
	   ``I know what that's going to do to the runners,'' he said.
``Anything coming into your face is going to affect the time.''

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Mississippi (AP) _ Paul Goydos and Doug Tewell matched
opening-round 66s on Friday to share the lead midway through the
Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic.
	   Goydos and Tewell took advantage of prime scoring conditions
Thursday morning _ before 15-20 mph (24-32 kmph) wind gusts _ to
move to within a stroke of the lead. The top five first-round
scores were all during the morning round.
	   But the wind wasn't as testing Friday afternoon, when Goydos and
Tewell played their second rounds. After each again posted 66, they
were at 12-under-par 132, a stroke ahead of Fred Funk.
	   ``The guys late today definitely got an easier course,'' Tewell
said. ``The greens were still bumpy, but I didn't miss a putt that
I thought got knocked off line.''
	   The lift, clean and place rule remained in effect for shots in
the fairways. There has been no more rain, but the Annandale Golf
Club fairways were still soggy and the greens soft, although
firming slightly, after six straight days of rain prior to the
tournament.
	   ``I assume it was better this afternoon than Thursday. It was
just hot,'' Goydos said. ``The course was dryer and playing
shorter.''
	   Funk, the former Maryland golf coach who has won four
tournaments and more than dlrs 4 million in 10 full PGA Tour
seasons, had the low round of the day. He was 7-under through 10
holes and finished with a 64.
	   Chris Smith had a second-round 68 and was a 10-under 134.
Franklin Langham was also at 10-under after a 66 that included two
eagles in a three-hole stretch.
	   First-round leader Curt Byrum followed a bogey-free opening
round with a 73 Friday and, at 138, was six strokes off the pace.
	   Goydos had made just two cuts in his previous seven tournaments,
but now has six straight sub-70 rounds. A 13th-place finish in last
week's Quad City Classic was his best finish this season.
	   ``I'm in this mode where I'm not too concerned about the past or
future,'' Goydos said. ``But in the back of my mind, I feel I am
playing good right now.''
	   Goydos had birdies on the first three par-3s, including one on
the 12th hole after he parred the first two. The 15th began a
stretch of four birdies in six holes.
	   Funk, who has three top-five finishes his last four tournaments,
was thinking about a course record after 10 holes Friday.
	   After a birdie at No. 10 dropped him to 10-under for the
tournament, Funk reeled off five straight pars.
	   Brian Henninger, the 1994 Deposit Guaranty champion, followed
his opening 66 with a 70, and was four strokes behind the leaders.

Frazier wins USTA Challenger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAHWAH, New Jersey (AP) _ Second-seeded Amy Frazier was declared
the winner by walkover in the final of the USTA Women's Challenger
on Friday when top-seeded Fang Li of China did not show up on time.
	   Frazier, in turn, turned down her automatic bid into the A and P
Classic semifinals.
	   Li, the world's 42nd-ranked women's player, was scheduled to
play Frazier in the 11:30 a.m. final, but did not arrive at the
Crossroads Corporate Center until 1 p.m., because she thought the
match was supposed to start at 2:30.
	   ``I don't know what happened today,'' said Li, who lives in
Queens. ``I don't know if it was I didn't understand them or they
didn't understand me. Maybe I made the mistake. Maybe my English is
not good. I don't know who made the mistake.''
	   According to USTA Tour supervisor Billie Lipp, by tour rules, Li
is allowed an extra 15 minutes after the match's scheduled starting
time to show up before she is disqualified. But, because the match
was supposed to be taped for television, Li was allowed an extra 15
minutes before Frazier was declared the winner.
	   As winner of the USTA Challenger, Frazier, who is ranked 60th,
earned a spot in the A and P Classic semifinals against the winner
of Friday night's quarterfinal between Steffi Graf and Mashona
Washington.
	   But Frazier, who won the A and P Classic in 1996, doesn't want
to play in the Classic this year because she wants to concentrate
on doubles in the USTA Challenger, which conclude Sunday.
	   In fact, Frazier, 25, said she never knew about the Challenger's
link to the Classic until after she arrived at the event.
	   ``No one asked me,'' she said. ``But it goes beyond that. I've
played for two weeks in a row, my hands hurt, I have four
tournaments this summer. There's a lot going on, but I had no idea
when I entered.''
	   According to tournament director John Korff and Lipp, however,
all the players in the Challenger were notified by mail when they
entered that the winner of the tournament would then play in the A
and P Classic. Korff said he also called the agents of all the top
players in the Challenger to make sure they were aware of what was
going on.
	   In addition to the dlrs 8,800 she earned by winning the
Challenger, Frazier would have also received between dlrs 4,000 and
dlrs 5,000 for playing in the semifinals, Korff said. Li, who
earned dlrs 4,400 for finishing second in the Challenger, agreed to
take Frazier's place in the A and P Classic semifinal.
	   Anna Kournikova, the No. 16 player in the world, was forced to
pull out of the A and P Classic on Wednesday becuase of torn
ligaments in her right thumb. Mirjana Lucic withdrew Thursday
because of a high fever related to a case of the chicken pox she
had earlier this year.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Strong profit reports by Microsoft and Sun
Microsystems fueled another strong day for technology stocks,
leading most market measures farther into record terrain Friday.
The Dow Jones industrial average never strayed as much as 30 points
all day, but finished 9 points higher at nearly 9,338, padding
Thursday's record. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index,
which on Thursday crossed 2,000 for the first time, rose to an
eighth straight record close. Smaller-company shares lagged the
blue-chip advance again, with decliners outnumbering advancers on
the broad market. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW _ Russia's parliament recessed for the summer Friday
without passing key elements of the government's economic austerity
plan demanded by international lenders. Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko told the lawmakers the government would enact the
rejected measures anyway _ by decree. The State Duma, parliament's
lower house, approved bills that would bring only 28 billion rubles
(dlrs 4.5 billion), Kiriyenko said in a brief speech to lawmakers
at the end of a special session called to debate the government's
plan. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ World Bank President James Wolfensohn called
allegations of internal corruption in his institution unfair and
rejected complaints that senior Treasury officials failed to keep
Congress informed of investigations. In a two-page letter Friday to
Sen. Mitch McConnell, who heads a Senate committee that approves
funding for the bank, Wolfensohn said, ``I am committed to pursue
the fight for corruption everywhere, inside and outside the bank,
and whatever we find here, will be fully and transparently
disclosed.'' He also urged McConnell, who chairs the Senate
Appropriations Committee subcommittee on foreign operations, not to
hold up a dlrs 800 million U.S. contribution to a bank fund that
makes low interest loans to the world's poorest nations. (US-WORLD
BANK-AUDIT)
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Lockheed Martin's decision to call off its
proposed dlrs 8.3 billion acquisition of Northrop Grumman Corp. in
the face of government opposition could signal the end of
megamergers in the U.S. defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corp.
announced its decision late Thursday, citing the companies' failure
to overcome government opposition to the move because of concerns
that it would crimp competition. American defense companies may
also start seeing greater competition from Europe. Earlier this
year, the top civilian aircraft makers of France, Spain, Germany
and Britain announced plans to hammer out a merger that would
create a single European aerospace and defense company. Such a
European powerhouse could compete with U.S. rivals such as Lockheed
Martin and Boeing. (LOCKHEED-NORTHROP)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Using the brute force of a single,
custom-built computer costing less than dlrs 250,000, experts took
less than three days to crack a widely used method for scrambling
sensitive data, they announced Friday. The breakthrough attempt
tested 88 billion possible combinations every second for 56 hours
until it unlocked a message that had been scrambled using a
government-approved method, called the Data Encryption Standard.
The contest was sponsored by RSA Data Security Inc. of San Mateo,
California, which has fought U.S. export restrictions on virtually
unbreakable data-scrambling products stronger than 56 bits, meaning
its unlocking key is a sequence of 56 1s and 0s. The Clinton
administration prohibits encryption products stronger than 40 bits
to be exported, although there are no limits on data-scrambling
software used domestically. The message unscrambled: ``It's time
for those 128-, 192- and 256-bit keys.'' (US-COMPUTER CODES)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Everyone knows who is involved in
high-level corruption in Kenya, but there's no political will to
tackle it, politicians and business leaders said Friday. ``Those of
us who know who the corrupt people are, are also the ones sitting
on that anti-corruption commission,'' legislator Charity Ngilu, a
1997 presidential candidate, said after U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin spoke at the Kenya Institute of Monetary Studies.
Attorney General Amos Wako told participants he lacks trained
personnel to investigate complex corruption cases and appealed to
the United States for technical expertise. He said the government
was preparing new legislation to deal with corruption because
present laws were outdated. Rubin said later that he was impressed
by the commitment of top Kenyan officials and business people to
combating corruption and that he was encouraged by an openness not
seen before in Kenya. (KENYA-CORRUPTION)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ROME (AP) _ Delegates from more than 100 countries
overwhelmingly approved a historic treaty Friday creating the
world's first permanent war crimes tribunal _ ignoring strenuous
U.S. objections. The delegates erupted into cheers and applause
when the treaty won final approval by a vote of 120-7, with 21
abstaining. An American bid to undermine the package deal was beat
back by a vote of 113-17, with 25 nations abstaining. The showdown
at the U.N. talks attended by 160 nations created strange
alliances. Meanwhile, its closest allies, countries like Canada and
Britain, mustered to the treaty's defense. The vote was a victory
for an idea, one born with the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war
criminals, put in the deep freeze by the Cold war, then revived in
the ethnic bloodbaths of Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
(UN-INTERNATIONAL COURT)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Chief Justice William Rehnquist refused Friday
to spare President Bill Clinton's protectors from testifying in the
Monica Lewinsky case, declaring there would be no ``irreparable
harm.'' Prosecutors then proceeded to begin questionning Secret
Service personnel, a defense attorney said. The first witness
called was a retired Secret Service officer, according to John
Kotelly, attorney for Special Agent Larry Cockell, the head of
Clinton's security detail. Kotelly said his client would initially
decline to answer questions involving national security and the
president's attorney-client privilege. Clinton supporters had been
seeking to create a new legal privilege that would allow Secret
Service agents to avoid testifying about what they saw and heard
while guarding the president. (US-CLINTON-INVESTIGATION)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The investigative commission of a special court
ruled Friday that former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and two
former ministers be tried for allowing AIDS-tainted blood to be
used in transfusions that contaminated some 1,300 people, mainly
hemophiliacs. The three-judge commission of the Court of Justice of
the Republic, rarely called upon to act, said the former officials
must be judged for involuntary homicide and involuntarily
compromising the well-being of others. While some 500 deaths are
linked to the contaminated blood, the ministers could be held
accountable for only seven, the others proscribed with the passage
of time. (FRANCE-TAINTED BLOOD)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister will meet with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Sunday, in the first
top-level contact between the sides in months. The United States
has urged the two sides to hold two or three meetings over the
period of a week in an attempt to resolve their differences over an
Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank and the procedures for
amending the PLO Covenant. The United States has proposed _ as part
of a broader peace initiative _ that Israel withdraw from 13
percent of the land and that a smaller forum, the PLO Executive
Committee, annul parts of the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destruction. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Russia's first president buried
Russia's last emperor Friday in a ceremony that many hoped would
reach across eight decades to help the country make peace with its
past. ``We want to expiate the sins of our ancestors,'' President
Boris Yeltsin said, standing amid incense and gold near the coffins
of the slain czar Nicholas II and his family. ``Guilty are those
who committed this heinous crime, and those who have been
justifying it for decades _ all of us.'' Yeltsin's strong words
echoed through the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral, filled with
gold-robed priests and black-suited descendants of the exiled
Romanov dynasty, who held thin candles during a service they had
awaited for many years. The president's message also reverberated
farther, through the rest of the country, which has been bitterly
divided over whether and how to bury the most prominent victims of
Russia's bloody 1917 revolution _ a chapter of history many
Russians still hold sacred. (RUSSIA-CZAR'S BURIAL)

	   SOUFRIERE, St. Lucia (AP) _ Travelers pondering a Caribbean
vacation can grow weary choosing among the islands purporting to be
``paradise on Earth.''
	   But for those looking for more than just sun and surf, St. Lucia
may fit the bill.
	   On this lush island in the Lesser Antilles, you can hike to a
rain forest waterfall, ride horses on black sand beaches, view a
smoking volcano or simply wade in indigo bays framed by
jaw-dropping scenery.
	   ``There's the 'been there, done that' crowd that is not content
to just relax on the beach anymore,'' says Steve Loucks, spokesman
for the American Society of Travel Agents in Alexandria, Virginia.
``Times are changing. People want something that's a little bit
different. People want to be challenged when they are traveling.''
	   Some of the most spectacular scenery on St. Lucia and the center
of activity is Soufriere. The island's second-largest town, facing
the Caribbean Sea, is home to the Pitons, two large peaks that are
the cone remnants of long-dormant volcanos.
	   The landscape around the Pitons and Soufriere includes countless
varieties of fruit and spice trees _ from the exotic calabash to
nutmeg and cinnamon. The grapefruits are the size of soccer balls.
	   ``We may lack for money, but we never want for food and water,''
says Jones Abraham, our main guide and driver for the four-day
trip. ``We have so much fruit, we don't know what to do with it. It
just rots.''
	   St. Lucia sits northwest of Barbados and during colonial times
was considered a strategic outpost. It changed hands between
England and France 14 times, and each left its mark in food, town
names (decidedly French) and architecture (quaintly British).
	   Flights from North America and England fly into International
Airport on the island's southern tip. It is strongly recommended to
use taxis _ both land and water are available _ for the roads on
St. Lucia are veritable moonscapes with blind switchbacks.
	   If you do rent a vehicle for Eastern Caribbean dollars 768-1,060
(dlrs 290- dlrs 400 a week), driving is on the left, British style.
A temporary license is required _ for about dlrs EC 29 (dlrs 11) _
one of many small fees that quickly add up. Botanical gardens,
hiking trails and even beach cabana huts cost between dlrs EC 13
(dlrs 5) and dlrs EC 53 (dlrs 20).
	   St. Lucia is a bargain in one respect: lodging. Quaint seaside
inns can be found around Soufriere for less than dlrs EC 265 (dlrs
100) a night. We chose the Hummingbird Resort, a nine-room hotel on
the site of an old colonial-style mansion.
	   The rooms are spacious with outside porches and four-poster beds
with mosquito netting. Summer rates range from dlrs EC 80 (dlrs 30)
to dlrs EC 278 (dlrs 105) a night depending on view and whether a
bathroom is shared with another room. There's no air conditioning,
but the sea breeze keeps the heat at bay.
	   If a luxury suite is ordained, then there is the Hilton's
Jalousie Plantation Resort for dlrs EC 795 (dlrs 300) or Ladera
Resort for dlrs EC 517 (dlrs 195). There are also all-inclusive
resorts on the island, especially on the north end.
	   Our flight arrived at night, so the trip to the Hummingbird
turned into an olfactory bacchanal of sea spray, Creole cooking and
sulfur from the volcano.
	   In the morning, we woke to a spectacular view from our porch:
the 2,461-foot (750-meter) high Petit Piton surrounded by a dark
Caribbean sea, colored by the volcanic black sand.
	   The peak nearly made us overlook the luscious landscaping of the
hotel where hibiscus, pomegranate and bread fruit trees flourish.
Darting, colorful Hummingbirds were everywhere.
	   It was a bit overcast, so we ruled out the beach and flagged
down Jones outside the hotel for a rain forest tromp (a well-spent
dlrs EC 265, dlrs US 100 to our knowledgeable guide). After a
short, harrowing cab ride in a downpour _ that's why they call it a
rain forest right? _ we launched on a hike down the Enbas Saut
trail.
	   St. Lucia's 19,000 acres (7,700 hectares) of rain forest is full
of giant mahogany trees, orchids, birds of paradise and hot-pink
anthuriums. Jones pointed out a tree the locals use for
sweet-smelling incense and the red and black waswe seed that local
Rastafarians make into necklaces and bracelets.
	   We encountered a territorial land crab, noisy wild pigeons and
in the distance an endangered St. Lucia parrot flew over the
foothills of 3,117-foot (950-meter) Mount Gimie. After a 45 minute
hike, the rain stopped and we came to a small creek that quickly
turned into a 20-foot (6-meter) waterfall.
	   At the foot of the waterfall, we swam and got back massages from
the torrents coming off the rocks above our heads. St. Lucia is
full of waterfalls. Diamond Falls in a botanical garden (yes,
there's a dlrs EC 19 or dlrs US 7 fee) just outside of Soufriere is
where King Louis XVI had bathhouses built for his troops.

Colin Montgomerie misses cut again in British Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie, Europe's best the
last five seasons, missed the cut in the British Open for the fifth
time in the last seven years with a 7-over 73-74-147.
	   Even an eagle-birdie finish Friday couldn't keep him from
missing out.
	   ``I wish I knew the answer,'' said Montgomerie. ``If I did, I'd
have worked it out six years ago when my Open form went south.''
	   Montgomerie continues as the best active player never to have
won a major and now aims at the 1999 Open in Carnoustie.
	   ``I suppose I can look forward to next year. I hold the course
record with 64 at Carnoustie,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TEN AND COUNTING: &LR;  Ten. Count 'em.
	   John Daly took a sextuple-bogey 10 on the 18th hole Friday at
the British Open and needed help keeping track of the carnage.
	   Payne Stewart, who was marking Daly's card, lost track of the
count and had to be aided by the other member of the threesome,
Bernhard Langer.
	   Daly finished with an 8-over 78 _ 11 over for two rounds _ and
took himself out of a tournament he won three years ago.
	   Daly drove hit a fairway bunker on his drive. He blasted out but
landed in another fairway trap. Then, in Stewart's words, ``took
five swishes at the ball'' to escape _ only to land in a greenside
bunker. He blasted out again and two-putted from 10 feet (3
meters).
	   ``When you hit those bunkers, you just have to take your
medicine,'' Stewart said. ``He was not a happy camper when he left
here.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MASTER ROSE: &LR;  Justin Rose's father, Ken, had to pinch himself.
	   His 17-year-old son had just shot a 4-under 66 to match the best
amateur score ever in the British Open.
	   ``It's almost a surreal state of mind,'' said Ken Rose, who
moved his family from South Africa when Justin was 5 because it
wasn't ``quite the environment to bring up kids in.''
	   ``I'm still sitting here trying to believe this is all
happening. I mean, your kid ending up with Tiger Woods, Nick Price.
I can't quite believe it.''
	   The young Englishman was just one stroke off the lead after two
rounds with a 10-foot (3 meter) birdie putt on No. 17 and another
from 20 feet (6 meters) on No. 18 on a rainy, windy day at Royal
Birkdale.
	   ``I'm still sort of taking it in,'' said Rose, who left school
at 16 to play golf full time. ``It's probably the best I've ever
played.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHIP SHOTS: &LR;  Gary Player, 62, played his 43rd consecutive Open,
having won in 1959, '68 and '74. He got 5,500 (dlrs 9,020) pounds
for winning in 1974. This year's winner gets 300,000 pounds (dlrs
492,000).
	   Player missed the cut with a 77-74-151.
	   After the second round, Tiger Woods was still the 11-4 favorite
by British bookmakers to win the Open. English 17-year-old Justin
Rose, who was tied with Woods and Nick Price one stroke behind
leader Brian Watts, was 50-1. He was 500-1 when play began but
dropped after his 4-under 66 on Friday.
	   Nick Price on making a crucial bogey on the 10th Friday that may
have saved his round: ``The 6-foot putt there, I really think I was
leaking oil, bleeding, whatever you want to call it. That stopped
everything.''

SOUFRIERE: his troops.

<TEXT>
	   The water here is mineral rich from the underground sulfur
springs stemming from the ``world's only drive-in volcano'' where
skunky smoke spews from fissures, creating an alien landscape. You
used to be allowed to walk among the craters until a guide fell
into a steaming hot sinkhole a dozen years ago.
	   Once back at the Hummingbird, we were famished. Food is
expensive on St. Lucia and since prices are in Eastern Caribbean
dollars (exchanged at about 2.65 to the U.S. dollar), it is easy to
get confused. If dlrs 90 EC (dlrs US 34) seems expensive for a dish
of freshwater shrimp (crawfish), it is.
	   The upside is the food is excellent, fresh seafood done in a
variety of styles _ though Creole is the preferred way. Make sure
you try some of the local vegetables, such as the potato-like
dasheene.
	   In Soufriere alone, there are several outstanding restaurants.
The Hummingbird's outdoor dining area is a must stop for its West
Indian menu. The Dasheene Restaurant at Ladera offers a
mountainside seat 1,000 feet (300 meters) above sea level with
American-style gourmet fare.
	   You can also venture out into the town for food, but beware of
people offering tours. It's best to go with those organized by your
hotel.
	   Even with all the activities available on St. Lucia, seaside is
where most tourists spend their time. And the beaches are
spectacular and all are open to the public _ an advantage not found
on many other Caribbean islands.
	   One of the best is at the Anse Chastanet Hotel. The sand is
volcanic with a black sheen, giving the water a deep blue color.
Cabana huts and hammocks dot the beach. The hotel is also a great
place for lunch. Don't forget to try a rum punch or one of their
tropical drinks.
	   As for snorkeling and diving, St. Lucia is adequate. Anse
Chastanet and Jalousie offer small reefs and any water taxi _ the
preferred method of travel from beach to beach _ will take you to a
designated marine reserve area.
	   If swimming with the fish is the main activity planned for your
trip, though, then St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands or the
Cayman Islands may be a better choice.
	   Pulling yourself from the beaches may be near impossible, but if
you do there are a number of beautiful banana plantations around
Soufriere and some offer horseback riding.
	   There is also great shopping in Castries, the capital of St.
Lucia. Batik art abounds and the jewelry is unique. On the plane
back, many women wore necklaces of polished volcanic rock.
	   If you have the time, visit picturesque Marigot Bay, a yacht
haven where ``Dr. Doolittle'' was filmed in 1966.
	   And if you're on the north side of the island, visit Gros Islet
on a Friday night for a ``Jump Up,'' a colorful street festival.
	   On the way out, the last of the cash is expended through a dlrs
42 EC departure tax ( dlrs 16 each and credit cards are not
accepted). By this time, the little fees have gotten annoying and
any lengthy stay on St. Lucia could quickly get expensive.
	   Still, St. Lucia was perfect for this short little trip to
celebrate a fifth wedding anniversary. An island that fits the bill
for the 1990s go-go tourist who puts as much emphasis on recreation
as rest.

World's first permanent war crimes tribunal wins approval
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. ADDS comment from member of Lawyers Committee for
Human Rights &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Delegates from more than 100 countries erupted into
cheers and applause as a historic treaty creating the world's first
permanent war crimes tribunal was approved despite strenuous U.S.
objections.
	   A formal signing ceremony for the treaty was scheduled for
Saturday.
	   The treaty won final approval Friday by a vote of 120-7, with 21
abstaining. An American bid to block the package deal was beat back
by a vote of 113-17, with 25 nations abstaining. India also tried
to torpedo the deal.
	   The showdown at the U.N. talks attended by 160 nations created
strange bedfellows: Joining the United States in denouncing treaty
provisos were nations like Libya, Algeria, China, Qatar and Yemen.
Meanwhile, its closest allies, countries like Canada and Britain,
mustered to the treaty's defense.
	   But more than a defeat for a superpower, the vote was a victory
for an idea, one born with the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war
criminals, put in the deep freeze by the Cold War, then revived in
the ethnic bloodbaths of Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
	   ``I think this is a great, historic achievement,'' said Benjamin
Ferencz, 78, a Nuremberg prosecutor who's worked ever since for a
permanent tribunal.
	   The new international criminal court, which will operate out of
The Hague, Netherlands, will bring individuals to justice for
genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression.
	   Independent of the United Nations, it will be able to act even
when the international community is divided, as it was in the
Balkans and in Africa.
	   A temporary war crimes tribunal, also in The Hague, was
established in 1993 by the U.N. Security Council to prosecute war
crimes in the former Yugoslavia. It has indicted 75 people.
	   Another U.N. court, based in Arusha, Tanzania, is pursuing
atrocities committed in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
	   Friday's carefully crafted compromise treaty emerged after weeks
of difficult talks in Rome and years of preliminary negotiations.
	   ``The adoption of this treaty is an histoic step towar ending
impunity,'' said Jelena Pejic, an attorney with the New York-based
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and head of the group's Rome
delegation. ``The text is not all we hoped for. But the framework
is there for the creation of an independent, effective and fair
court.''
	   Last minute compromises would allow states to opt out of
jurisdiction for war crimes for seven years and would curtail the
circumstances under which the court can excercise its jurisdiction.
	   The United States wanted the option to veto the prosecution of
any American citizen. With U.S. troops deployed in hot spots around
the world, Washington fears they could become targets of
politically motivated charges.
	   But the escape hatch wouldn't have been exclusive; many feared
the Pol Pots of the world could also jump through it. A wide
coalition of nations, including America's best allies, fought
vehemently to block it.
	   Despite weeks of arm-twisting, U.S. diplomats failed to win the
day. Their bid to prevent the creation of an independent prosecutor
also met with defeat.
	   ``We don't expect them to sign the treaty,'' Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy said of the Americans. ``But at least if
they aren't aggressively opposed ...''
	   The American pressure was intense and its delegation wielded
virtually every carrot _ and stick _ at its disposal. It threatened
poor nations with a loss of aid and allies like Germany with the
rupture of key military alliances.
	   In the final hours of the grueling, five-week conference, the
behind-the-scenes maneuvering reached a fever pitch.
	   The draft was already full of concessions; proponents feared any
tinkering might unravel the whole deal.
	   The list of crimes, for example, was expanded to add aggression,
which the nonaligned nations had sought. In a nod to the five
nuclear powers on the U.N. Security Council, the treaty omits any
specific mention of nuclear weapons. A proviso on war crimes
addressed French concerns.
	   The negotiations split the conference into two opposing camps:
one lobbying for the strongest, most independent court possible and
the other hoping to curb its scope.
	   A major force was a broad coalition of 800 citizen groups from
around the world, which worked closely with a group of about 60
nations, many of them America's best allies and fellow democracies.
	   The citizen groups lobbied hard for an independent prosecutor,
the inclusion of crimes of sexual violence and internal conflicts,
victims' rights, and a host of other issues.
	   William Pace, the coalition's coordinator, praised the treaty as
``one of the greatest victories for peace in the last 100 years.''
	   ``This is the rule of law prevailing over the rule of brute
force,'' he said.

Israel, Palestinians to hold top-level meeting Sunday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. officials hope Israeli differences can be
resolved when the Israeli defense minister meets with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's deputy on Sunday, in the first top-level
contact between the sides in months.
	   The United States has urged the sides to hold two or three
meetings within a week to try to resolve their differences over an
Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank and the procedures for
amending the PLO Covenant.
	   The United States has proposed, as part of a broader peace
initiative, that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the land and
that the PLO Executive Committee annul parts of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposals. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at handing
over 13 percent and insists that the covenant be rescinded by the
much larger Palestine National Council, whose members are dispersed
all over the Middle East.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Friday that the
Palestinians suspect Israel will try to use the upcoming meetings
to gain time and wriggle out of its commitments.
	   ``We will go because the Americans want us to,'' Abourdeneh said
in an interview. ``Netanyahu just wants to waste time, and he found
(the Americans) will make this easy for him by calling for direct
talks.''
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat confirmed a meeting
between Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai would take place Sunday evening. He stressed the
Palestinians hoped Mordechai would come to the meetings with a
mandate to accept the U.S. proposals.
	   ``The U.S. proposals are not up for negotiations. We hope that
this (meeting) will be the last extra mile the U.S. administration
asks us to go,'' Erekat said.
	   Israel had wanted Arafat to attend the session, but Erekat said
the Palestinian leader would send Abbas instead.
	   Mordechai and Abbas last met in February, during a two-hour tour
of the Palestinian airport under construction in the Gaza Strip
	   Earlier this week, Mordechai and Netanyahu argued over how the
defense minister should handle the talks. Netanyahu told Mordechai
he should listen to what the Palestinians have to say, then report
back to him.
	   The Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot said Netanyahu had no
intention of giving Mordechai room to maneuver independently.
``What rope?'' Yediot quoted Netanyahu as saying jokingly when
asked if Mordechai would have a long enough rope to maneuver with.
``A rope to hang himself with?''
	   Israel's Channel 1 TV reported that Mordechai was furious with
what he perceived as the prime minister's attempt to undermine his
authority, and was demanding a free hand in the negotiations.
	   The report said that during the meeting Sunday, Mordechai
planned to suggest setting up joint Palestinian-Israeli committees
to discuss redeployment, the PLO charter and security issues. The
committees would conclude their work within a week.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ With the scent of incense hanging
in the air, Russia buried its last czar in a somber ceremony that
President Boris Yeltsin called an atonement for ``one of the most
shameful pages of our history.''
	   On the 80th anniversary of the executions of the Russian royal
family, nine coffins with the bones of Czar Nicholas II, his wife,
daughters and servants were lowered Friday into one large crypt
beneath the floor of the gilded, 18th-century St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral.
	   ``We have long been silent about this monstrous crime,'' Yeltsin
said of the executions, carried out by Bolshevik revolutionaries at
the dawn of the communist era. ``Guilty are those who committed
this heinous crime, and those who have been justifying it for
decades, all of us.''
	   Yeltsin said the burial should serve as a catalyst for national
reconciliation in a country that has lurched from one upheaval to
another during the 20th century _ from revolution and civil war, to
famine, political purges and the collapse of the Soviet empire.
	   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation,'' said Yeltsin, who abruptly changed his mind
Thursday and announced that he would attend the ceremony.
	   Yeltsin, who has not advocated restoring the Russian monarchy,
has never publicly said what he believes the czar's fate should
have been. However, he has long spoken of the need for the country
to reclaim its long-suppressed history and condemn communist
abuses.
	   The burial was officiated by a dozen bearded priests in
gold-and-white robes, with one gently swinging a censer that sent
small puffs of burning incense wafting over the coffins.
	   Dozens of the czar's relatives, diplomats from 50 countries, and
Prince Michael of Kent, a member of the British royal family, which
is related to Russian royalty, stood holding candles at the
cathedral on the banks of the Neva River.
	   The czar's family members tossed white sand, representing the
earth, onto the coffins before the crypt was covered. Outside on
the river bank, cannons boomed in a 19-shot salute _ two shy of the
customary 21 because the czar abdicated a year before he was
killed.
	   ``We must tell the truth _ the (czar's) massacre has become one
of the most shameful pages of our history,'' Yeltsin said. ``By
burying the remains of the innocent victims we want to expiate the
sins of our ancestors.''
	   The house where Nicholas and his family were executed was torn
down two decades ago under the supervision of Yeltsin, the local
Communist Party boss at the time.
	   As the ceremony drew to a close, Yeltsin clasped the hands of
Nicholas Romanov, the most prominent of the czar's relatives at the
service, and they spoke briefly.
	   With its understated dignity, the burial was in sharp contrast
to the months of controversy that preceded it.
	   Many leading Russian figures, including the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church, skipped the service due to multiple disputes it
generated.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917, the Romanov dynasty, and the nature of national guilt and
contrition.
	   The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but Russia has not held any
major, formal ceremonies dealing with the abuses committed during
communist times. Friday's service brought the issue to the fore.
	   ``This is not just a funeral, but a national repentance,'' said
Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the world's leading conductors and
cellists, who was exiled during the Soviet era.
	   ``It shows the entire world that Russia is changing and becoming
more humane,'' he said on Russian television.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   But the burial also raised controversies. The Orthodox Church,
as well as some ordinary Russians, have questioned the authenticity
of the remains despite extensive DNA testing in the United States,
Russia and Britain.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony was
relatively simple. When the coffins were interred, the priest did
not use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques
were on the walls of the chapel.
	   About 1,500 people gathered outside the fortress. A few dozen
were there to protest.
	   ``Factories are closed. People aren't getting their pay _ what's
going on with this funeral?'' said Vyacheslav Marichev, a former
politician.
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for three centuries. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was killed on July 17, 1918, along with his
wife, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   Nine of the 11 bodies were recovered in 1991 from a desolate
forest outside the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. Two
skeletons have never been found _ Alexei, the czar's only son and a
daughter that scientists believe was Maria. Scientific tests
indicate the bones of Anastasia, one daughter some believe survived
the shooting, were among the remains buried.

Czar's burial ends exile for many Romanovs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Czar's Burial &QL; 
 &UR; By ALICE LAGNADO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ They had heard the stories for
decades, stories of pain and death and exile. For many, Russia was
a place of bloodshed and horror.
	   That was put to rest Friday for descendants of the Romanov
dynasty. Eight decades after their parents and grandparents fled
the Bolshevik Revolution, about 60 Romanovs returned to Russia to
take part in the burial of their forebear _ Nicholas II, Russia's
last Romanov czar.
	   ``I'm very proud of Russia, and I'm very proud of my family,''
said Rostislav Romanov, a 58-year-old banker based in London. ``It
means the unfinished business is ended and we can go forward.''
	   Many of the clan expressed gratitude to President Boris Yeltsin
for changing his mind at the last minute and attending the burial
service, lending the gravity of his office to the event.
	   ``When the Russian president went in and bowed over to the
grave, it was a very great day for Russian history,'' said Paul
Ilyinsky, the mayor of Palm Beach, Florida, whose father was the
czar's first cousin. ``We pour our hearts out to him and thank him
because he made the occasion a historical event by being there.''
	   The fate of the last czar and his family has haunted the
Romanovs ever since they disappeared in 1918.
	   Rostislav, whose mother was 17 when she fled the Bolsheviks,
said he made a decision to honor her pain by not visiting Russia
until the czar was about to be buried. And now he's looking forward
to more trips here with his children.
	   ``It's closure,'' he said after the service. ``And a
beginning.''
	   Some of his cousins have been visiting Russia ever since the
collapse of the Soviet Union. But even for them, the burial means
that the family's exile is officially over, that they can leave the
past in peace.
	   Nicholas Romanov, the head of the Romanov Family Association,
said he would like the family to get to know contemporary Russia
better, and start concentrating on current projects, like charity
work.
	   ``Today was a moment of satisfaction, and even content,'' he
said. ``We've done our duty. Russia has done its duty. The
president has done his duty as a president and as he himself said,
as a man.''
	   '' We've laid them to rest forever.''

Russian parliament takes vacation without passing austerity plan

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government would enact by decree
economic measures rejected by lawmakers, Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko said.
	   Russia's parliament recessed for the summer Friday without
passing key elements of the government's economic austerity plan
demanded by international lenders.
	   ``Regrettably, we have failed to reach a comprehensive solution
on how to boost revenues,'' Kiriyenko said. ``We can't stop with
that and will now have to act ourselves.''
	   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have made it
clear they want the austerity plan in place before they start
delivering dlrs 17 billion in new loans over the next two years to
help stabilize financial markets.
	   The State Duma, parliament's lower house, approved bills that
would bring only dlrs 4.5 billion, Kiriyenko said in a brief speech
to lawmakers at the end of a special session called to debate the
government's plan.
	   The program, intended to raise cash resources amid a financial
crisis, included a series of bills that would have brought
additional revenues totaling dlrs 16.5 billion.
	   The Duma rejected several bills proposed by the government
before recessing for a summer vacation that is expected to last
until the end of September.
	   Kiriyenko said that rejected bills will be enacted by decree of
President Boris Yeltsin or the Cabinet in accordance with Russian
law.
	   The stock market, which has dropped by half so far this year,
shrugged off the failure to pass the package and closed 4.8 percent
higher Friday following steady gains all week, except Thursday.
	   Communists and other hard-liners dominating the Duma have balked
at fiscal reforms proposed by the government, saying they would
further worsen the nation's social woes.
	   The Duma did pass some government bills, including a key measure
introducing an additional 5 percent sales tax, which was approved
on Thursday. But on Friday, lawmakers rejected an income tax bill
and a measure that would cut various social payments for this year.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said the house might hold an
emergency session next month to reconsider some of the government's
proposals.
	   The government has hailed the agreement with the IMF and other
lenders for new loans as a major success that would save Russian
financial markets from collapse. But Seleznyov warned that new
foreign loans would boost Russia's debt to a dangerous level.
	   Russia's economy, which seemed on the way to recovery last year,
shrank again this year because of the Asian financial crisis, a
drop in world oil prices and other factors. Russia's gross domestic
product dropped by .5 percent in the first half of 1998 from the
same period last year.
	   Yeltsin ordered his government on Friday to submit the 1999
budget to the Duma by Aug. 26, the Kremlin press service said. He
told the Cabinet to produce a document that meets the austerity
requirements of the IMF and other lenders.

<TEXT>
	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   TRAVEL: St. Lucia, a Caribbean island in the Lesser Antilles, is
serviced by several airlines, but most prominently American
Airlines, which receives a dlrs EC 3.975 million (dlrs 1.5 million)
subsidy to fly there.
	   American frequently runs specials to the Caribbean but often
with heavy restrictions. You shouldn't have to pay more than dlrs
EC 795 (dlrs 300) for a round-trip flight from Miami.
	   LODGING: Small inns dot the islands with rooms going for less
than dlrs EC 265 (dlrs 100) a night. Add dlrs EC 66 (dlrs 25)
during the peak winter season. There are also more expensive luxury
and inclusive resorts throughout St. Lucia, including Sandals.
	   TRANSPORTATION: It is highly recommended not to rent a car. It
may be a bit more expensive to travel by land or water taxi, but it
is worth it. The roads of St. Lucia are potholed, steep and not
easily navigated. Strike a price for your taxi ride in advance. A
water taxi to one of the nicer beaches is about dlrs EC 66 (dlrs
25) round trip for a couple.
	   If you do rent a car (dlrs EC 768-1,060) ( dlrs 290- dlrs 400
week), you'll need a temporary license for dlrs EC 29 (dlrs 11).
	   CURRENCY: The island deals in the Eastern Caribbean dollar.
American dollars, however, are accepted throughout St. Lucia, but
the exchange rate can vary. It is about dlrs 1 U.S. to dlrs 2.65
Eastern Caribbean dollars.
	   LOCALS: Unemployment in St. Lucia is 25 percent, so the
competition for the tourist dollar is stiff. Be polite, but
practice a firm ``No, thank you'' beforehand and arrange tours and
transportation through your hotel if possible.
	   TOURS: A good guide can take you to the rain forest, the sulphur
springs and the tour of the volcano _ about 5 hours _ for dlrs EC
265 (dlrs 100). It's well worth it for most St. Lucians love to
explain the horticulture and the wildlife.
	   INFORMATION: For more information about St. Lucia, call
1-758-452-4094 and 1-800-456-3984, or visit the official St. Lucia
Website at http://www.st-lucia.com.

Assad visit: little comment, but more symbolism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos PAR102-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Although Syrian President Hafez Assad didn't make
many public statements during his visit to France, his mere
presence was statement enough for the leader of a country long
diplomatically isolated.
	   The sight of Assad standing next to a smiling President Jacques
Chirac, who spoke of ``very positive'' talks between the two,
seemed to reflect how Syria's image has improved in recent months,
as the deadlock persists in the Arab-Israeli negotiations mediated
by the United States.
	   For Chirac, the meeting was a clear indication of how much
France still wants to play a role in Mideast peacemaking _ and sees
Syria as a good partner.
	   ``We know very well that there won't be peace in the region
without the active participation of Syria,'' Chirac said Friday,
after their second meeting in two days.
	   ``Consequently, we want to combine our efforts, France and
Syria, to attain our objective.''
	   He was referring to the goal of Mideast peace, but it's also
clear that France wants to be a player in the process, and a
counterweight to the United States.
	   Assad, too, seeks a partnership with another country to balance
Israel's strong alliance with Washington.
	   Syria is one of the Arab world's more isolated countries. Its
good relations with Iran's Islamic government have alienated Iraq
and Gulf nations while its support for radical Palestinian groups
makes others uncomfortable. The United States accuses Syria of
sponsoring international terrorism.
	   But some Arab nations have begun listening to Syria's
long-standing call to isolate Israel, both economically and
politically. They have expressed admiration, too, for Assad's
refusal to negotiate with Israel unless it returns the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
	   It has been 22 years since Assad visited France, and he has been
to the West only a couple of times in the past decade. So the
symbolism of his being received in the elegant Elysee palace and
feted by a band of the Republican Guard, with their gilded helmets
and long red plumes, was considerable.
	   France has special leverage with Syria, partly because the Arab
nation was once a French-mandated territory, from 1920-1946.
	   But there is an uncomfortable issue between the two nations: the
whereabouts of Alois Brunner, one of the world's most-wanted Nazi
war criminals, long believed to be hiding out in Syria.
	   Assad told Chirac on Friday that ``to his knowledge,'' Brunner
is not in Syria, the French president's spokeswoman said.
	   Brunner, who once was commandant of the squalid French transit
camp at Drancy, is the subject of a French judicial investigation.
Chirac asked that Syria finally respond officially to the French
investigation, and Assad said he would ``examine the issue,'' said
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
	   In public, Assad made few comments during his trip, the official
part of which ended Friday afternoon. There was no joint news
conference.
	   In a toast at Thursday's state dinner, he castigated Israel for
``reducing to zero'' the peace process.
	   On Friday, standing beside Chirac after their talks, he praised
the efforts of France ``and other countries'' toward peace, but
said that up to now, ``they haven't borne fruit.''
	   Of France's suggestion, along with Egypt, that an international
peace conference be convened to relaunch the process, Assad said
only that ``there is nothing concrete.''
	   ``If there is a peaceful initiative Syria will be present, but
it has to be in accord with our fundamental demands,'' he said.

Sudanese trading post into major relief base for war victims
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOKICHOKIO, Kenya (AP) _ As the hub for aid operations into
war-torn southern Sudan, this barren trading post in neighboring
Kenya has been transformed into the United Nations' largest air
relief base.
	   But the benefits haven't spilled over into its dusty streets.
	   ``The money hasn't reached us,'' said Father John, a local Roman
Catholic priest, pointing to Lokichokio's crumbling mud-walled
buildings with rusty tin roofs.
	   As he spoke, the roar of a C-130 transport plane shattered the
stillness in the cluster of grass-and-mud huts and a few brick
shops that make up Lokichokio _ along with the aid agency's huge
canvas warehouses that dwarf them.
	   The plane was one of 18 chartered by the U.N. World Food Program
to drop relief food into southern Sudan, where up to 2.6 million
people face starvation brought on by war and drought.
	   So far, an estimated 1.5 million people have died in the
fighting and accompanying famines.
	   Since 1983, the predominantly Christian, African and animist
southerners have been fighting for autonomy in the south,
traditionally dominated by the Muslim north.
	   Besides the World Food Program, 42 private relief agencies and
UNICEF operate out of Loki _ as it's known in the aid world. Of
these, 39 operate under the auspices of Operation Lifeline Sudan, a
nine-year-old U.N. umbrella organization, which also has an office
in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
	   It took the deaths in 1988 of an estimated 250,000 Sudanese in a
war-induced famine to bring aid agencies en masse to Lokichokio,
where 100-degree Fahrenheit temperatures (38-degree Celsius
temperatures) are common. Loki is 15 miles (24 kilometers)
southeast of the Sudanese border and about 60 miles (95 kilometers)
from the closest fighting.
	   It costs the United Nations dlrs 3.2 million a year to maintain
the base, which is the heart of the southern Sudan relief
operation, flying 175 to 220 tons of food supplies a day into
southern Sudan.
	   Armed with laptops, clipboards and walkie-talkies, Loki-based
aid workers determine how much food and relief supplies will be
needed on the other side of the border. With this information, U.N
and other agencies solicit funds from donors.
	   But they are often frustrated when their requests are not met
and their delivery plans fall behind.
	   At least 200 aid workers are based in Lokichokio and another 360
to 400 in the field in southern Sudan.
	   At Lokichokio camp, there is little to do but work, eat and
sleep. World Food Program coordinator, American Jason Matus, is
blunt: ``There is no quality of life here.''
	   It's the same on Lokichokio's dirt streets.
	   Only a few of the local Samburu people, nomadic herders with
little education, have managed to secure even the most menial jobs
with the aid agencies.
	   ``These people are not happy to see all this food going to
Sudan, when they themselves have little to eat,'' said Father John.
``But they understand it is not meant for them.''
	   But, he said, when the World Food Program buried contaminated
food last year, hungry locals dug it up.

Sorenstam takes halfway lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ROCHELLE, New York (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam birdied three of
the last four holes _ the last two after a 94-minute weather delay
_ and shot a 5-under-par 66 Friday to take a one-stroke lead after
two rounds of the JAL Big Apple Classic.
	   Meg Mallon, who eagled the same hole for the second straight
day, also had a 66 and was second alone at 8-under 134, one shot
ahead of first-round leader Penny Hammel, who followed a 64 with a
71.
	   Sorenstam, a two-time winner this year and the LPGA player of
the year two of the last three seasons, returned from the weather
delay to make a six-foot (1.8-meter) birdie putt to tie Mallon, who
had played in the morning, then took the lead with a 6-foot
(1.8-meter) birdie putt on the par-5 18th.
	   ``It wasn't that long,'' she said of the late afternoon delay,
during which she kept score as her husband bowled in the clubhouse
at Wykagyl Country Club. ``There was lots of time to warm up and
when I got back out I only had 1 1/2 holes left.''
	   Chris Johnson and Jenny Lidback both had 68s and were at 136,
one shot ahead of eight players.
	   Se Ri Pak, who set an LPGA record with a 61 in the second round
of last week's tournament, had a 69 and was at 141. Nancy Lopez had
a 75 Friday and was at 1-over 143, four strokes ahead of the cut.
	   Pak and Lopez came into the tournament on streaks.
	   Pak was trying to become the first player in 16 years to win
three straight events, while Lopez had missed three straight cuts,
the longest such streak of her Hall of Fame career.
	   Sorenstam finished second in this tournament last year when she
set an LPGA record with more than dlrs 1.2 million.
	   ``It's good to play a course where you have done well,'' she
said. ``You remember a birdie putt you made or know what club to
hit off the tee and know the slope of the greens.''
	   All but one of Sorenstam's birdie putts were from seven feet or
less.
	   ``I never felt I was going to make a bogey,'' she said. ``I had
a lot of tap-ins for par.''
	   Mallon also has had success on the 6,161-yard (5,607-meter)
layout, finishing third last year and in the top 10 two other
times. She has had unbelieveable success on the 432-yard
(393-meter), par-5 15th, getting an eagle there both days although
in very different ways.
	   In Thursday's opening round she dropped a 15-foot (4 1/2 meters)
putt for a 3, while she chipped in from about 20 yards (18 meters)
on Friday.
	   ``I had almost the same yardage as yesterday and I hit the
5-wood again,'' Mallon said. ``Today, the 5-wood landed in the
rough after an unlucky bounce and I chipped it in.''
	   Mallon had four birdies, all on putts of 15 feet (4 1/2 meters)
or less, and one bogey, that a three-putt on 18.
	   ``It was a solid round,'' Mallon said. ``Twenty-nine putts. I'll
take that every round and have a lot of trophies.''
	   Hammel, who started on No. 10, got to as low 9-under, but
bogeyed Nos. 5 and 6, then left a 12-foot (3.5-meter) birdie putt
on the lip on No. 9.
	   ``I hit it a lot closer today but left them short,'' said
Hammel, who made three birdie putts of 20 feet (6 meters) or more
on Thursday in her career-best round. ``I couldn't get the ball
going fast enough. The greens were the same.''
	   Pak, who started on No. 10, was on her way to a good round but
she double-bogeyed the par-4 eighth.
	   ``I drive left into trees then lay up with 5-iron on right side
but that goes into trees and was against a rock,'' she said. ``I
cannot hit with the rock but I try and I dent my sand wedge and hit
into bunker then two-putt.
	   ``Still, today was better than yesterday. I know course
better.''

Aid agencies struggle to find compromise with Taliban

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ For Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, the
issue is simple: ``They should observe our laws.''
	   For the United Nations and other aid agencies trying to do
everything from feed Afghanistan's hungry to renovate the national
museum, working under laws based on a radical brand of Islam is
increasingly difficult.
	   The Taliban army has shut down their home schools, closed their
vocational programs and ordered aid workers to move into
dormitories battered by civil war bombings. Some aid workers even
have reported physical attacks and threats.
	   Now, the United Nations is among aid groups threatening to pack
up and leave. Twenty-one organizations are composing a letter to be
sent to the Taliban this weekend explaining why they cannot work
effectively under its edicts.
	   Relations between the United Nations and the Taliban have been
shaky since 1996, when the militia captured Kabul, pulled former
communist President Najibullah from his refuge in a U.N. compound
and hanged him.
	   Within days of taking control of the capital, the Taliban closed
schools for girls and forced women to stop working outside the
home, further alienating the world body.
	   Since then, the United Nations and the Taliban have tried a
variety of approaches to live and work together, including
negotiations and threats.
	   In the southern town of Kandahar, the Taliban governor slapped a
U.N. worker across the face, threatened to heave a small table at
another and told two aid workers _ both Muslim women _ to leave
Afghanistan because they were not accompanied by a close male
relative.
	   The United Nations pulled its 14 international employees from
the area and demanded an apology and a promise of protection. After
receiving both, the staff returned. The two women, however, remain
in neighboring Pakistan.
	   A brief respite to the crisis in relations came in May in the
form of a 24-point agreement. It promised education for young
girls, equal access to health care for women and addressed other
issues never made public.
	   It appeared the relationship was improving, and the Taliban
promised to seek other Islamic opinions on whether foreign Muslim
women can work in Afghanistan unaccompanied by a close male
relative.
	   But for reasons still unclear to the United Nations, the
situation began to deteriorate last month.
	   The Taliban shut down more than 100 home schools that were
quietly educating thousands of children, including girls. The
Taliban said the schools were teaching girls older than 8, which
remains forbidden.
	   They also closed vocational training programs being run in homes
that allowed some of Kabul's poorest to earn a living.
	   Then the Taliban ordered most international aid workers into
abandoned student dormitories. Originally, aid workers were told
they had one month to pack their belongings and move into the
crumbling buildings.
	   Qaridin Mohammed, the Taliban planning minister, now says the
dormitories will be repaired first.
	   The United Nations and other international aid organizations are
scrambling to figure out what to do if the Taliban ignores their
demands to abide by the May agreement and to keep their present
homes.
	   Representatives of several groups, speaking on condition of
anonymity, have said they may leave Kabul over the relocation
issue.
	   To the United Nations, which for now is not subject to the
relocation edict, closing the home schools amounted to a breach of
the May agreement.
	   ``The U.N. wants to see positive movement on the provisions for
improving access for education and health care,'' said Sarah
Russell, a U.N. spokeswoman in Pakistan. ``We want those words put
into action.''
	   ``We have absolutely no desire to abandon the people of
Afghanistan,'' Russell said, but added that choices will be
difficult without conditions.
	   One option, Russell said, is to withdraw all but ``life-saving''
assistance to Afghanistan _ a broad term likely to protect programs
such as food aid for widows, inoculations for children and bakeries
that provide subsidized bread to the poor.
	   The Taliban, despite its hard-line approach, says it wants the
international aid groups to stay.
	   ``We know how the (aid groups) are helping Kabul citizens and we
don't want them to leave Kabul,'' said Mohammed, the planning
minister. But, he said, ``they should observe our laws.''
	   So, for now anyway, both sides are still looking for a solution
that will neither offend nor leave the many hungry to fend for
themselves.
	   ``Ninety percent of Kabul residents survive because of this
outside aid,'' said Ghulam Ali, whose family counts on the World
Food Program. ``If we lose even this bread, we will stare hunger in
the face.''

U.S. on sidelines as treaty on war crimes tribunal signed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with comment from Ambassador David Scheffer.
Trims. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The United States has been relegated to the
sidelines as delegates from more than 100 nations gather Saturday
to sign a treaty creating the world's first permanent war crimes
tribunal.
	   The historic treaty won overwhelming approval Friday at a
marathon U.N. conference, but over vehement U.S. opposition.
	   It was a stunning defeat for hardball American diplomacy. When
it finally came down to a vote after nearly five weeks of
negotiations, only seven countries voted against the pact. Chief
among them was the United States, which failed to get a loophole
into the treaty that would exempt American citizens from the
court's reach.
	   The tribunal will be the world's first permanent court to
prosecute the most heinous crimes: genocide, crimes against
humanity, war crimes and aggression.
	   It was a bitter defeat for the United States, which has been a
leading force behind all of the court's precursors.
	   ``It is truely tragic that we have reached a juncture today
where our desire to be in the leadership, our desire to be an
engine of this court has been derailed,'' the head of the U.S.
delegation, Ambassador David Scheffer said later in an interview.
	   The showdown at the U.N. talks attended by 160 nations created
strange bedfellows.
	   Joining the United States in denouncing treaty provisos were
nations like Libya, Algeria, China, Qatar and Yemen. Meanwhile, it
closest allies, countries like Canada and Britain, mustered to the
treaty's defense.
	   When the final vote came, 120 nations endorsed the treaty, seven
voted ``no,'' and 21 abstained.
	   The vote was more than a defeat for a superpower. It was a
victory for an idea born with the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war
criminals, put on hold by the Cold war, then revived in the ethnic
bloodbaths of Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
	   ``I think this is a great, historic achievement,'' said Benjamin
Ferencz, 78, a Nuremberg prosecutor who's worked ever since for a
permanent tribunal.
	   The United States went into the talks driven by the Pentagon's
desire to protect troops abroad from frivolous, politically
motivated prosecutions.
	   Safeguards weren't enough; the United States wanted a loophole
effectively putting Americans out of the court's reach.
	   But many feared the Pol Pots of the world could also jump
through the loophole and a wide coalition of nations, including
America's best allies, fought tooth and nail to block it.
	   Despite weeks of arm-twisting, U.S. diplomats failed to win the
day.
	   It was too early to say if the United States would continue its
campaign against the court, perhaps by trying to dissuade other
countries from ratifying the treaty.
	   ``We don't expect them to sign''the treaty, Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy said of the Americans, ``but at least if
they aren't aggressively opposed...''
	   The United States negotiated hard; its delegates wielded
virtually every carrot _ and stick _ at their disposal. Poor
nations were threatened with the loss of aid, allies like Germany
with the rupture of key military alliances.
	   The negotiations split the conference into two opposing camps:
one lobbying for the strongest, most independent court possible and
the other hoping to curb its scope.
	   A major force was a broad coalition of 800 citizen groups from
around the world, which worked closely with a group of about 60
nations, many of them America's best allies and fellow democracies.
	   William Pace, the coalition's coordinator, praised the treaty as
``one of the greatest victories for peace in the last 100 years.''
	   ``This is the rule of law prevailing over the rule of brute
force,'' he said.

	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A bored policeman gestured obscenely
toward ethnic Albanian guerrillas taking pot shots at his bunker,
swallowed another sip of brandy and didn't bother to shoot back.
	   ``Why are we here?'' the 32-year-old Serb asked as the shooting
faded and the snipers disappeared into the trees. He'd left a wife
and child in Belgrade in April for the sandbagged bunker in western
Kosovo. Like his comrades, he refused to give his name.
	   As the ethnic conflict in Kosovo drags on, morale is waning
among Serb police who are bored, homesick and untrained to combat
hit-and-run raids by rebels who move about familiar mountain trails
under cover of darkness.
	   The rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile, are showing
signs of increasing confidence, if only because they are holding
their own in their fight for independence.
	   Kosovo is located in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics that make up the remainder of Yugoslavia.
	   Signs of tumbling Serb morale are apparent at many police
bunkers and roadblocks, where liquor bottles are scattered among
empty bullet casings.
	   According to Belgrade media, dozens of Serb police have refused
to go to Kosovo since fighting escalated in February. Those who go
complain of constraints placed on their actions and that they lack
proper equipment: flak jackets, bulletproof vehicles and maps.
	   Serb forces tend to be unfamiliar with the terrain, while many
guerrillas are fighting around their home villages. Police and the
army have dealt few serious blows to the poorly armed but highly
mobile guerrillas since the crackdown began in late February.
	   ``The police feel they are sitting ducks,'' said Dejan
Anastasijevic, a military specialist who writes for the
Belgrade-based weekly, Vreme.
	   ``They're not trained for this kind of fighting and they're in a
situation they know they can't win,'' Anastasijevic said.
	   Some police have complained to journalists that they have been
reined in by the government since a March sweep through the village
of Drenica killed dozens of ethnic Albanian civilians.
	   That operation brought international condemnation and threats of
NATO military intervention. Since then, police say they have been
ordered to shoot only in self-defense.
	   Anastasijevic said boasts by police that they could crush the
KLA if given more firepower reflect the need to blame someone for
losses in a province where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Even Kosovo Serbs frequently lambaste police for failing to
provide them with weapons to defend themselves. Meanwhile, the
KLA's numbers have swollen and the guerrillas control up to 30
percent of the province.
	   Their commitment, too, appears strong.
	   ``We will die to the last man,'' vowed Abi Beleim Berisha, a KLA
commander in Kosovo's northwestern mountains.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A new tropical storm gaining strength off
Mexico's Pacific coast could bring tropical storm force winds to
Baja California on Saturday, forecasters said.
	   On Friday night, the center of Tropical Storm Celia was 250
miles (400 kilometers) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja
California, the peninsula that juts south from California, the U.S.
Hurricane Center reported from Miami.
	   Celia was moving northwest at 14 mph (22 kph). Forecasters said
it would be 125 miles (200 kilometers) off the tip of Baja
California on Saturday. Tropical storm force winds extended outward
from the center up to 105 miles (170 kilometers), and the storm was
strengthening.
	   Maximum sustained winds were near 55 mph (88 kph). A tropical
storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds top 74 mph (119
kph).
	   Maritime authorities closed the port of Acapulco to fishing and
recreation boats Thursday. Larger vessels were urged to sail with
caution, the government news agency Notimex said.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ With the scent of incense hanging
in the air, Russia buried its last czar in a somber ceremony that
President Boris Yeltsin called an atonement for ``one of the most
shameful pages of our history.''
	   On the 80th anniversary of the executions of the Russian royal
family, nine coffins with the bones of Czar Nicholas II, his wife,
daughters and servants were lowered Friday into one large crypt
beneath the floor of the gilded, 18th-century St. Peter and Paul
Cathedral.
	   ``We have long been silent about this monstrous crime,'' Yeltsin
said of the executions, carried out by Bolshevik revolutionaries at
the dawn of the communist era. ``Guilty are those who committed
this heinous crime, and those who have been justifying it for
decades, all of us.''
	   Yeltsin said the burial should serve as a catalyst for national
reconciliation in a country that has lurched from one upheaval to
another during the 20th century _ from revolution and civil war, to
famine, political purges and the collapse of the Soviet empire.
	   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation,'' said Yeltsin, who abruptly changed his mind
Thursday and announced that he would attend the ceremony.
	   The 67-year-old president, whose health is a constant concern,
appeared tired at the burial ceremony. Although he delivered a
strong and stirring speech, he was the only person in the cathedral
who sat during portions of the service.
	   Yeltsin, who has, 6th graf pvs.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
interrupted his Latin American tour Friday to travel to Rome for
the signing of a treaty to establish the world's first war crimes
tribunal.
	   Gustavo Poch, a press officer in the local U.N. local office,
said Annan was leaving Buenos Aires immediately.
	   As part of a five-country Latin American tour, Annan was
originally scheduled to remain in Argentina through Saturday
morning. Before arriving here, Annan visited Brazil and Uruguay.
	   Annan will resume his tour Monday in Guatemala, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said in New York.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ The Guatemalan army arrested a colonel
Friday for criticizing the army's role in the country's 36-year
civil war.
	   Col. Otto Noack Sierra said on the Dutch network Radio Nederland
that military leaders should ``publicly and openly admit their
responsibility in the excesses committed by the army during the
armed confrontations.''
	   ``We need to look at ourselves in the mirror ... if we really
want to recover the identity of our institution,'' said Noack,
former director of the army's public relations department..
	   The army's public relations department issued a statement saying
``we distance ourselves categorically from those declarations,
because that official isn't authorized to give opinions or make
declarations, especially those relating to what military leaders of
Guatemala should do.''
	   ``By transgressing the established norms, Col. Otto Noack
violated discipline, which can lead to disciplinary actions,'' the
army said.
	   Guatemala's civil war was Latin America's longest and deadliest.
About 200,000 people were killed or disappeared during the 36-year
war. The government and rebels signed peace accords in December
1996.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Eight members of Mexico City police and
federal military police forces have been arrested for attempting to
rob a man who turned out to be a police officer from a nearby city,
newspaper reports said Friday.
	   A police patrol found the eight officers holding the victim at
gunpoint along a street in the Mexico City borough of Naucalpan.
The victim, Nomeli Rivera Sanchez of Huixquilucan, said he was
assaulted shortly after picking up his pay.
	   More than 30 Naucalpan police officers helped capture the eight
suspects.
	   The attempted robbery late Wednesday night followed one day
after a top investigator in Mexico City's police department was
forced to resign when a newspaper report said he had been convicted
of a 1989 kidnapping.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's ruling political party has asked
U.S. President Bill Clinton to use his authority to stop Texas from
installing a toxic waste dump only a few miles (kilometers) from
the U.S.-Mexico border, a report said Friday.
	   A letter signed by officials of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party expressed concern for the environmental impact the dump would
have on nearby communities and the Rio Grande, known in Mexico as
the Rio Bravo, the daily Reforma reported.
	   The dump, to be located near the town of Sierra Blanca and 15.5
miles (25 kilometers) north of the border, has spawned opposition
throughout West Texas and Mexico.
	   The party said the dump would violate a 1983 treaty signed by
the two governments, which established a protected zone within 100
kilometers (62 miles) of the border.
	   The plan ``represents a serious danger of contamination of water
tables and the Rio Bravo and therefore, the health of millions of
people who live along the border,'' the letter said.
	   This month, two Texas state hearings recommended that the state
environmental agency deny a license for the dump due to the
potential risk of a nearby fault. The Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission is not bound by the recommendation.

	   BRIVE-LA GAILLARDE, France (AP) _ A Tour de France that had a
historic beginning in Ireland had another bit of history when the
Festina team was kicked out when its director admitted supplying
drugs to his riders.
	   The news, a bombshell to the cycling world, was certain to shock
riders competing in Saturday's seventh stage.
	   Among the nine members of the Festina team included two of the
favorites, Richard Virenque and Alex Zulle, the current world
champion, Laurent Brochard, and two other members of the team that
won stages last year, Neil Stephens and Didier Rous.
	   In Lille on Friday, Festina team director Bruno Roussel and team
doctor Erik Ryckaert were placed under investigation Friday for
importing prohibited substances and other counts connected to the
drug scandal.
	   The two joined Willy Voet, a Festina team trainer jailed July 9
after customs officers found a stash of anabolic steroids and EPO
in Voet's car bearing Festina emblems. Virenque has won the top
climber award of the Tour the last four years with Voet as his
personal trainer.
	   A statement by Roussel through his lawyer said the Festina
direction, doctors, masseurs and cyclists were involved in the
scheme to supply riders with drugs.
	   ``The object was to optimize performances under strict medical
control,'' the statement said, ``in order to avoid cyclists
personally and uncontrollably supplying themselves under conditions
that could be bad for their health.''
	   A rider denied the charges.
	   `I never took any EPO or any other prohibitive products. I only
took products for recuperation, '' said Pascal Herve, a member of
he Festina team in Varetz, where the team was staying Friday night.
	   EPO, among the drugs found in Voet's car, is a substance that
aids the transport of oxygen within the blood stream and is
difficult to detect.
	   Late Friday, at a news conference in Brive where the sixth stage
of this year's race ended, Tour de France Director Jean-Marie
Leblanc announced that Festina was being excluded immediately from
the Tour _ a ``difficult'' but ``indispensable'' decision.
	   ``It seems to me that the sports ethic, the morality of the Tour
are the most important things ....,'' Leblanc said, saying he hoped
the decision would end the unhealthy climate with the race since it
started in Dublin July 11.
	   Friday's sixth stage moved from La Chatre to Brive-La Gaillarde,
204 kilometers (127 miles) trying to distance itself from the
growing drug drama.
	   Friday's stage was almost a repeat of Thursday with an early
attack followed by a final mass sprint that Cipollini ruled. Second
this time was Nicola Minali, another Italian, with Czech Jan
Svorada third.
	   Three more top sprinters _ Frederic Moncassin of France, Erik
Zabel of Germany and Tom Steels of Belgium _ were right behind.
	   Cipollini's time for the day was five hours, 5 minutes, 32
seconds but the real racing began in the final kilometers.
	   Stuart O'Grady of Australia held on to the leader's yellow
jersey with the riders preparing for Saturday's 58-kilometer
(36-mile) time trial from Meyrignac-L'Eglise to Correze.
	   Defending champion Jan Ullrich, a 24-year old German, is
expected to make his move in the time trials. Last year he won the
Tour by more than nine minutes over Virenque and beat him by more
than 3 minutes in the first time trial.

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The United States picked the surface and
Belgium paid the price in the opening singles matches of a Davis
Cup quarterfinal match Friday.
	   Andre Agassi became the third-winningest Davis Cup player in
U.S. history and Jim Courier also won to give the United States a
2-0 advantage in the best-of-5 series.
	   Agassi broke a tie with Bill Tilden and moved to within one
victory of tying the late Arthur Ashe for second on the U.S. list
by topping Christophe Van Garsse 6-2, 6-2, 6-2. Agassi, who has 26
wins, needs 15 more to tie John McEnroe for best in U.S. history.
	   Agassi, who is 19th in the ATP rankings after falling to 141st
last fall, improved his Davis Cup record to 26-5.
	   In the opening match at the Indianapolis Tennis Center, Courier
beat Filip Dewulf 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 2-7, 6-3.
	   The United States can extend its home winning streak to 18
series with a doubles victory by Richey Reneberg and Todd Martin on
Saturday. The singles pairings will be reversed when the best-of-5
series ends on Sunday. The United States-Belgium winner plays Italy
or Zimbabwe in the semifinals Sept. 25-27. Italy leads that series
2-0 and would travel to the United States if both teams advance.
	   Dewulf, who climbed past Courier to 43rd by reaching the
semifinals of the Swiss Open last week, looked lost on the hard
surface against Courier.
	   ``I didn't feel really comfortable on this kind of surface,''
said Dewulf, whose best success on the tour has come on clay where
he learned the game.
	   Dewulf hit more winners (42) that Courier (20), but unforced
errors produced his undoing. He had 54 to Courier's 36.
	   ``This is just not my kind of surface,'' he said. ``I don't feel
at ease on this surface. A lot depends on your return and serve.
Those are not my favoite strokes of my game.
	   ``I made a lot of unforced errors, especially on the service
returns at important points.''
	   The match between Courier, who has never played on a losing Cup
team in 11 previous times on the U.S. team, and Dewulf was much
closer than the score indicated. Courier had only a 123-117
advantage in points won.
	   ``I played solidly,'' said Courier, who came back from a 2-1
deficit in sets to win the decisive fifth match against Russia in
the opening Davis Cup round to get the United States into this
series.
	   Courier, who had lost seven of his last eight matches this year,
needed just 37 minutes to win the opening set as he overcame a 3-1
deficit when Dewulf had 20 unforced errors.
	   Van Garsse never got into the match against Agassi, who lost
only one point while jumping to a 3-0 lead in the opening set and
needed just 93 minutes to complete the match.
	   ``He's not a hundred times stronger than me, not a thousand
times, but a million times too strong for me,'' the 24-year-old Van
Garsse said. ``I couldn't imagine that somebody could play so fast
on the ball and put so much pressure on me.
	   ``It's tough to say if I played well or not, but I was really
impressed.''
	   ``I felt like I was having to just kind of stay on top of him,
stay controlled, stay inside of myself,'' said Agassi, who had only
16 unforced errors, compared to 37 by Van Garsse.
	   The United States has won more Davis Cup titles (31) and more
Davis Cup matches (187) than any other country. It is 2-0 against
Belgium, having prevailed 4-1 in 1953 and 3-2 in 1957.
	   In other quarterfinals, Germany and Sweden split their opening
singles, as did Mexico and the Bahamas, while Spain leads
Switzerland 2-0 and Italy leads Zimbabwe 2-0.
	   At Hamburg, Germany, Tommy Haas upset Jonas Bjorkman 6-3, 7-6
(7-4), 7-5 before Sweden's Thomas Enqvist evened the quarterfinal
by sweeping Nicolas Kiefer 6-3, 6-3, 7-5.
	   ``It's what we wanted from the singles,'' said Boris Becker,
head of Germany's Davis Cup team. ``It leaves everything open.''
	   At Guadalajara, Mexico, Alejandro Hernandez beat Roger Smith of
the Bahamas, 6-3, 6-1, 6-3, and Mark Knowles of the Bahamas beat
Luis Enrique Herrera 6-3, 1-6, 6-2, 6-2.
	   At La Coruna Spain, Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja won for Spain
on clay courts. Moya, the French Open champion, beat 142nd-ranked
Ivo Heuberger 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 and Corretja downed Marc Rosset 6-1,
6-2, 6-2.
	   At Prato, Italy, Andrea Gaudenzi and Davide Sanguinetti defeated
Zimbabwe's Black brothers. Gaudenzi downed Wayne Black 6-3, 6-3,
6-4, then Sanguinetti took Byron Black 6-3, 6-3, 6-0.

Lake Geneva's paddle wheelers steaming back to the future

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Huge paddle wheelers have plied the
deep, blue waters of Lake Geneva for 175 years, royalty and film
stars sometimes elbow to elbow with commuters and tourists.
	   The timbers of the steamboat classics, with their huge black and
brown funnels, have reverberated to famous jazz bands from
Montreux.
	   The vessels have been part of the lake scene below the
snow-capped Alps since Switzerland's first steamship, the William
Tell, was launched in 1823 by Edward Church, the United State's
consul in France.
	   Sadly, some of the old boats that shuttle daily between France
and Switzerland have run out of steam and are operated by diesel
electric motors. But in the interest of historic preservation,
owners of the paddle wheelers are planning to get back to the real
thing to carry their nearly 1.8 million tourists and cross-border
commuters each year.
	   To mark the 125th anniversary of the Lake Geneva General
Shipping Company and 175 years of steam-powered shipping on the
lake, company executives announced a plan to re-create their
vessels' golden years by reinstalling steam boilers in the four of
their eight paddle wheelers that have been fitted with electric
motors.
	   The first vessel to be ``resteamed'' will be the firm's oldest
paddle steamer still in service, the Montreux, which was launched
in 1904.
	   The company wants to renovate and refloat it for the year 2000
summer season. ``It will be a jewel in the crown, a floating
monument,'' proclaims the firm's President, Edgar Styger.
	   The Montreux will serve as a prototype for replacing the engines
of the other three _ the Vevey, launched in 1907, the Italy, 1908,
and the Helvetia, 1926.
	   The late actor Richard Burton, who lived in the lakeside village
of Celigny and was buried there in 1984, was one of the boats'
``best customers,'' says Bernard Aegler, the company's commercial
director.
	   Other famous passengers have included Richard Nixon, Nancy
Reagan, astronauts, and King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola of Belgium.
Some of the concerts during the world-renowned Montreux Jazz
Festival have taken place on board.
	   The Helvetia was transformed into an impromptu television studio
in 1985 for the Reagan-Gorbachev superpower summit. The Japanese
television network NHK beamed reports about the Geneva-based
conference to Japan from the 240-foot-long (73-meter-long) vessel
moored in the city's harbor.
	   The resteaming of the four ships will be the centerpiece of a
dlrs 16- dlrs 20 million renovation program to be carried out
during the next 12 years.
	   Company executives plan to restore the entire paddle wheel fleet
to its original condition, including the ships' cabins and their
hulls.
	   Its 16-strong fleet, including eight modern motor liners and
launches, provides a lakewide network of services, popular with
tourists, between April and September.
	   The fleet serves 31 destinations on the Swiss shore and 10 on
the French side of the 232-square-mile (600-square-kilometer) lake.
	   For the rest of the year, regular daily services used by workers
commuting across the lake run from Lausanne to Evian, the French
town famous for the bottled waters of its natural spring.
	   In conjunction with Swiss Federal Railways, the firm offers
combined tickets allowing travel on train and boat.
	   Reduced tickets for young people aged 16-25 and senior citizens,
discounted season tickets, family passes and other travel offers
are available.
	   Eurail tickets available to travelers from the United States are
valid on the ships.

	   LEDYARD, Connecticut (AP) _ The tiny Mashantucket Pequot tribe _
grown wealthy by casino profits _ is putting the finishing touches
on a dlrs 135 million museum that resurrects a nearly forgotten
past.
	   The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, which
celebrates the lives of American Indians of southeastern
Connecticut, opens Aug. 11.
	   The 308,000-square-foot (28,613-square-meter) complex is set on
the tribe's reservation, also home to the Foxwoods Resort Casino. A
185-foot (56-meter) stone-and-glass tower gives a sweeping view of
the land.
	   ``It has always been a vision for the whole tribe to have a
cultural center and to preserve the tribe's culture, and with the
parts and pieces that are long gone, having major research done to
find some of that and pull it together,'' says Theresa Hayward
Bell, executive director of the museum.
	   The money to build the museum comes from the tribe's casino,
where slot machines have generated more than dlrs 2.5 billion in
revenues for the Pequots over the last six years. With more than
2.5 million square feet (232,000 square meters) of space, Foxwoods
is the biggest casino in the Western Hemisphere, drawing tens of
thousands of visitors a day on average.
	   ``The cards have fallen our way. We've just been very
fortunate,'' Ms. Bell says.
	   The museum exhibits trace the area's evolution, beginning in the
Ice Age with a walk through a glacial crevasse _complete with
frigid temperatures and the sounds of running water _ and a replica
of a mastodon.
	   Visitors will witness the tribe's ancestors in a caribou hunt
11,000 years ago.
	   Computers and touch-screen interactive video stations accompany
many of the exhibits.
	   Guests can walk into a 16th-century Pequot village set in a
half-acre (0.2-hectare) of simulated woodlands with American
chestnut trees and the sounds of geese flying overhead. The smell
of a campfire wafts from the sweat lodge near a simulated cedar
swamp.
	   The museum includes a model of a 17th-century Pequot fort that
was found by archaeologists in 1992 just 600 feet (180 meters) from
the museum site. The tribe hired a team of archaeologists,
anthropologists, botanists, and other researchers to investigate
Pequot history.
	   ``Everywhere we dig, we hit a site,'' Ms. Bell says.
	   The tribe now has about 250 archaeological sites on the
reservation, some dating back 10,000 years.
	   Another highlight of the museum is a working 18th-century
farmstead that will allow visitors to walk through an orchard and
herb gardens to see farming techniques.
	   Five small theaters will show films recounting events in Pequot
history, including the Pequot War of 1636 to 1638 between the
Indians and the colonists, and the tribe's efforts to get federal
recognition in recent times.
	   Ms. Bell's grandmother, Elizabeth George Plouffe, helped reunite
the tribe's members 25 years ago and is considered the founder of
the modern Pequot nation.
	   The museum's 400-seat auditorium will be used for live
performances, films, and conferences on American Indian issues. In
addition to the permanent exhibits, a 3,800-square-foot
(353-square-meter) gallery will present contemporary American
Indian arts and crafts. The museum also will have a restaurant and
gift shop.
	   The Pequot tribe, which has about 400 members, got assistance
from about 50 other tribes, from helping to reproduce artifacts to
sharing oral histories and providing original artwork.

Man nearly loses arm to pet crocodile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Someone should tell that crocodile:
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
	   An Australian man was lucky not to lose his arm when a pet
crocodile turned on him in the backyard of his suburban home,
police said Saturday.
	   The unidentified 37-year-old crocodile handler was tending a
pond where he keeps three of the aquatic reptiles when he reached
into the water to fix a filter, police said.
	   A five-foot (1.3-meter) female took the opportunity to seize his
arm in her jaws. The crocodile then tried to roll the man into the
water, but he broke free after hitting it on the head, said
ambulance officer Andrew Burns.
	   The man wrapped his shirt around his arm to stop the bleeding as
he waited for help to arrive.
	   ``He received deep lacerations to his arm, and he's lucky it
didn't rip his arm off with the size of the animal,'' Burns said.
	   Still, the man didn't seem to resent his pet's apparent lack of
appreciation.
	   ``He was enjoying the comedy of it,'' Burns said.

Myanmar's opposition calls for foreign intervention, sets deadline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San
Suu Kyi has called on the international community to support her
demand that the Parliament elected in 1990 be allowed to convene by
Aug. 21.
	   ``The international community can do a lot to help accelerate
the process of dialogue if they have the will to do so,'' said Suu
Kyi in an interview with ALTSEAN, a Southeast Asian non-government
organization supporting the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar, also
known as Burma.
	   ``The first thing they can do is to support the convening of our
Parliament,'' said Suu Kyi on Wednesday in the taped interview seen
here Saturday.
	   The demand looks unlikely to break the deadlock between Nobel
Peace laureate Suu Kyi and the military government.
	   It marked the first time the National League for Democracy had
set a deadline for the military to convene Parliament. It was
unclear what would happen if the ruling council of generals refused
to comply, as is likely.
	   The Parliament was formed following a landslide victory of the
league in the 1990 general elections. But the military refused to
convene the body and moved to crush Suu Kyi's supporters.
	   ``We are only asking for what is due to the people of Burma.
That should not be looked upon as a provocation or a confrontation,
particularly in view of the fact that we have waited patiently for
eight years,'' said Suu Kyi.
	   The military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962, said in a
press statement Friday that ``dissidents, criminal and terrorist
groups'' from abroad and within the country are trying to create an
``imaginary scenario where Myanmar has become a nation about to
explode with political tension, ethnic rebellion, economic turmoil
and social unrest and the only way to prevent the explosion from
happening is for the government to have a dialogue with the NLD.''
	   In 1995, the NLD walked out of a constitution-drafting assembly
it said was rigged in favor of prolonged military rule. The body
has not met since March 1996.
	   Suu Kyi, who vaulted to prominence during anti-government
protests in 1988 that were bloodily suppressed, has been under
house arrest or close confinement for most of the last nine years.
Hundreds of her supporters are in jail
	   ``The economic situation is bad as you well know. Education
system is bad, health care is poor, so what do we have left?'' said
Suu Kyi in the interview. ``Our idea of dialogue is a way to find a
resolution, to find a way forward and out of the problems.''
	   A government crackdown has decimated the NLD has been decimated
since the 1990 poll victory. A quarter of the victors have been
imprisoned or exiled. Two have died in prison.

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ He's 4 1/2 years younger than Tiger
Woods, his favorite group is the Spice Girls and he's been playing
golf ever since he could walk.
	   And boy, can Justin Rose play.
	   The English amateur, a scratch golfer at just 14, shot a 4-under
66 on Friday in the second round of his first British Open.
	   That matched the best amateur score ever at the tournament _
Woods also tied it in 1996 _ and left him one shot behind leader
Brian Watts.
	   It also had the young Englishman talking about turning pro
before his 18th birthday in two weeks.
	   ``I'm being tempted into it at the moment,'' he said. ``I
haven't made my final decision as of yet. I was going to use this
week as a guide. Now I think I could be well tempted.''
	   Last year, Rose was the youngest player ever in the Walker Cup,
golf's most prestigious amateur event. And while he had already
made a name for himself there, such a strong showing in the Open
shocked his family.
	   ``It's almost a surreal state of mind,'' said his father, Ken,
who moved his family from South Africa when Justin was 5 because it
wasn't ``quite the environment to bring up kids in.''
	   ``I'm still sitting here trying to believe this is all
happening. I mean, your kid ending up with Tiger Woods, Nick Price.
I can't quite believe it.''
	   Sitting with the elder Rose in the media center was David
Leadbetter, golf's best-known teacher. He tutored Rose for a week
in Florida a few months ago.
	   ``It's amazing to see him because the changes we worked on have
started to take place already,'' Leadbetter said. ``It's amazing
for a man _ a child of such tender years. He's really well ahead of
his years in his maturity and his golf game.''
	   Leadbetter, who also has taught Spain's Sergio Garcia _ dubbed
the next Seve Ballesteros _ called Rose one of the best
17-year-olds he's ever seen.
	   ``Justin's right up there and has a fantastic future,'' he said.
	   The future is now for Rose, who said he had plastic clubs at 11
months and began playing with real clubs at 5.
	   The 6-foot (1.82 meter), slender teen-ager clinched his 66 with
a 10-foot (3 meter) birdie putt on No. 17 and another from 20 feet
(6 meters) on No. 18 on a rainy, windy day at Royal Birkdale.
	   ``I'm still sort of taking it in,'' said Rose, who left school
at 16 to play golf full time. ``It's probably the best I've ever
played.''
	   The last amateur to win the British Open was Bobby Jones in
1930. But putting Rose in that class is premature.
	   He was knocked out of the British Amateur in the first round
last month in a tournament the 18-year-old Garcia eventually won.
And Rose is not as highly rated as the Spaniard or U.S. amateur
Matt Kuchar.
	   ``He's made the cut,'' Leadbetter said. ``Now he's got to set
some new goals and go out there the next two days and enjoy himself
and not put too much pressure on.''

How ill is he? Brazil obsessed with Ronaldo's health

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ What's wrong with Ronaldo?
	   Was it epilepsy, nerves or nothing at all that caused him to
play what many considered to be a lackluster game in the World Cup
championship?
	   Many considered Ronaldo, known by just one name, to be the
world's best soccer player. In Brazil, he's a national treasure
regarded with the same awe Americans accord Michael Jordan.
	   Crushed by their team's improbable defeat, Brazilian soccer fans
are searching for an explanation for the 3-0 loss to France and
have become obsessed about the health of the team's young star, who
now admits he was ill just before the game but played anyway.
	   Exactly what happened in the hours before the championship game
has fans in an uproar, the team's doctor before a review board and
Ronaldo defending his mental health.
	   In an interview aired Friday by Globo TV network, the
21-year-old Ronaldo helped shed some light on the mystery: a few
hours before he took the field for Sunday's title game, he suffered
a convulsion.
	   ``Before the game I had lunch, returned to my room, shaved and
laid down to watch television,'' Ronaldo said. ``Then I started
shaking all over. I had a convulsion.''
	   ``I don't remember anything else other than waking up with pain
all over my body. It was as if someone had beaten me,'' Ronaldo
said. ``The doctor told me I wouldn't be able to play. I said that
I had to.''
	   ``I know a lot of people were expecting much more of me, but I
did the best I could,'' he said.
	   The TV interview didn't specify what caused the convulsion. Hid
comments contradicted earlier reports in Brazilian newspapers,
which quoted the star striker as saying that he never suffered from
convulsions.
	   ``The problem was that the team played poorly and they found an
excuse in me for the defeat,'' he was quoted as saying in Jornal
dos Sports.
	   Ronaldo, twice voted the best player in the world by FIFA, said
he was just overworked.
	   ``The problem happened because of stress. I am tired of the
number of false news reports. They even say I had a nervous
breakdown. ... It was just stress,'' he said in the interview with
Jornal do Brasil.
	   Team officials had first reported that Ronaldo suffered from an
ankle injury, but within hours after the game, a new story emerged.
	   Teammates said Roberto Carlos, Ronaldo's roommate during the
World Cup, saw Ronaldo having convulsions and rushed out of the
room yelling that Ronaldo was sick. Carlos has since refused to
comment on what he saw.
	   Team physician Lidio Toledo examined Ronaldo, allowed him to
play and later said he might suffer from epilepsy, a diagnosis that
Ronaldo has strongly rejected.
	   TV team coordinator Zico told TV Globo News on Friday that coach
Mario Zagallo should not have allowed Ronaldo to play.
	   ``He looked sleepy and groggy,'' Zico said.
	   Since the loss to France, Brazilian television and newspaper
reports have been filled with speculation about what exactly
happened to Ronaldo _ and whether his ailment was ultimately
responsible for the team's loss.
	   Adding to the controversy have been rumors of a nervous
breakdown or a sinister conspiracy. One theory states that the cook
poisoned Ronaldo in the hours before the game.

Heresy or history _ do these Yankees compare with the '27 club?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Those Yankees boasted of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig
and Murderers' Row. These Yankees do not have anyone among the top
50 home-run hitters in the majors.
	   Those Yankees had six players eventually elected to the Hall of
Fame. These Yankees did not have a single player elected to start
the All-Star game.
	   Those Yankees are considered the greatest team ever. And yet,
these Yankees are the ones winning at a historic rate.
	   That said, is it baseball heresy to compare this club to the
1927 New York Yankees?
	   ``People keep asking me how good we are and I tell them I don't
know,'' outfielder Paul O'Neill said. ``The season's not over.''
	   No, but the race in the American League East appears to be done.
At 67-22 going into the weekend, the only chase for these Yankees
seems to be for records. There's the major league mark of 116 wins
set by the 1906 Chicago Cubs and the AL record of 111 by the 1954
Cleveland Indians, both accomplished in a 154-game schedule.
	   ``Every night they step on the field, it's a new record,''
Indians manager Mike Hargrove said.
	   ``What impresses me is they don't have any one person having a
blowout, monster offensive year. They've got a lot of guys having
very good solid years,'' he said. ``They've got good pitching, a
very good bullpen. It's a club built for consistency and the long
haul.''
	   But back to those '27 Yanks.
	   With a lineup led by Ruth and Gehrig, they went 110-44 and
posted the best winning percentage in Yankees' history at .714.
	   And those numbers don't begin the tell the story because perhaps
no team ever inspired such awe or carried such an aura of
invincibility.
	   Ruth hit 60 home runs that season, more than any of the other
seven AL teams. Gehrig had 47 and helped the Yankees finish with
158, dwarfing the average of 40 hit by the other AL clubs.
	   Bolstering their image as Bronx Bombers were second baseman Tony
Lazzeri and outfielder Earle Combs, both future Hall of Famers.
Waite Hoyt (22-7) and Herb Pennock (19-8) led the league's top
pitching staff and also made it to Cooperstown, as did manager
Miller Huggins.
	   Most likely, none of the current Yankees will wind up in the
Hall. But despite ranking just ninth among AL teams in home runs _
and power often defines great teams, such as the Big Red Machine
and the '61 Yanks of Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris _ these New
Yorkers never seem to lose.
	   With a winning percentage of .753 going into the weekend, the
Yankees had matched the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates for the best
89-game record of any team this century.
	   Plus, they had either won or split 33 of their last 34 series
and had gone more than a month without losing consecutive games.
	   They've done it with the top staff in the league, led by
starters David Cone, Andy Pettitte, David Wells, Hideki Irabu and
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez and closer Mariano Rivera.
	   They've done it with things that don't show up so prominently in
boxscores, be it a hit-and-run single by Derek Jeter, a squeeze
bunt by Joe Girardi or a walk by Chuck Knoblauch.
	   They've done it by overcoming injuries to Bernie Williams, Tino
Martinez and Chili Davis, by holding their egos in check and by
showing a daily desire that has impressed manager Joe Torre.
	   ``We knew we'd be good in spring training,'' Torre said. ``But
what I remember is the third weekend of the season, after our
stadium fell in on us. We had to go to Detroit for a series and we
won the first two.
	   ``Now it's Sunday, and it's a game we probably should win. But
nobody took it for granted. I kept hearing it from guys on the
bench _ `Let's win this one, let's get this one.' I thought that
was pretty impressive,'' he said.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ He might be too young to have a
patient bone in his body. But someday Tiger Woods will pull out the
scorecard from this one and remember it as his round for the aged.
	   The first time he played like he was 42 instead of 22.
	   Woods shot a 73 Friday. It left him just one stroke off the lead
at the British Open. Considering what was going on around him for
most of the afternoon _ howling winds, suffocating crowds, more bad
bounces than a college student's checkbook _ it was every bit as
impressive as his opening-round 66.
	   It might have taken a few minutes for that to sink in _ with
him. But not with the old hands in charge of his bag and his swing.
	   Moments after Woods dragged his wind-beaten hide into the
scoring trailer to sign his card, Fluff Cowan, his caddie, and
Butch Harmon, his coach, ran into each other.
	   Their eyes met. Both were grinning. The teachers were old enough
to know their pupil wouldn't face many tougher exams than this.
	   ``Kid's got no quit in him,'' Cowan said.
	   Harmon's grin widened.
	   ``You know that, I know that, and best of all,'' and here Cowan
paused for emphasis, ``he knows that.''
	   The kid does now, anyway.
	   At last year's British Open, Woods finished seven strokes behind
winner Justin Leonard. Go back and look at his scorecards from the
1997 tournament (and trust us, Harmon did this more than once) and
it's easy to see exactly where he squandered the seven shots. He
made double-bogey on two holes, triple-bogey on a third.
	   It was the same way Woods had squandered shots at every major
since he won the 1997 Masters. The way you'd expect a 22-year-old
with spectacular gifts to make his mistakes _ spectacularly.
	   More often than not, those mistakes resulted from what are known
in the business as ``hero shots.''
	   In that sense, every weekend hacker can say ``I'm Tiger Woods''
and be close to the truth. Because hackers know the same
temptations Tiger does only too well. It is practically the formula
for double- and triple-bogey or worse:
	   Get in trouble, try a tough shot to rescue a score. The tougher
the trouble, the tougher the rescue. And the less likely it is to
work.
	   Ultimately, what makes the rest of us play more conservatively
is experience and a lack of ability. Woods is too young and too
talented to have learned that lesson on his own. So Harmon drummed
it into him every chance he got. Until Friday, he had no idea if he
was getting through.
	   Then the round began, with gusting winds and Woods rolling the
ball on the greens like his caddie was handing him a garden rake
instead of a putter. He made four bogeys on the front nine, but
like a man threading his way through a minefield, he was grateful
it didn't turn out worse.
	   ``That's the funny thing. I was 4-over-par, but I'd hit a lot of
good shots,'' Woods said. ``And I was in position to make some
birdies, but I didn't. So I told myself, realistically, if I made a
couple of putts, I'd only be one or two over.
	   ``And that would have been fine. So, knowing that I'm going into
the back nine playing the ball well, controlling my trajectory, I
figured it was just a matter of giving myself some more chances and
maybe the putts would fall.
	   ``And,'' he said, brightening at the memory, ``they finally fell
on the last two holes.''
	   What most people will remember about Friday's round are the
birdies at the last two holes, just as what everybody remembers
about Woods' brilliant run through the amateur ranks are the hero
shots.
	   What they forget is that most of those came in match play, where
the disasters only cost him a single hole. In the pros, on the
other hand, every stroke stays on the scorecard until they settle
up Sunday. That concept finally seems to have sunk in with Woods.
	   The grind-it-out approach so many of his peers have learned to
live with, if only to cash the occasional check, may not look
glamorous. And it requires a lot more patience than Tiger can
muster on a regular basis.
	   But the way he played Friday _ like an old pro trying to hang
on, instead of a young one trying to tear a course apart _ proves
he understands that grinding is sometimes the only way to win a
major championship. Especially in a British Open, when par can be
as precious as a still moment on Lancashire's blustery coast.

Golfer Nick Price accused of abandoning club company
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINO HAZELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A Manhattan lawyer says golfer Nick Price, one
of the leaders after two rounds of the British Open, knocked a
fledgling club company out of bounds by taking his name, fame and
dlrs 2.5 million salary and walking out on a commitment as
pitchman.
	   A complaint, seeking unspecified damages, was filed in Manhattan
State Supreme Court on Friday on behalf of five shareholders of
Atrigon Golf Inc. It alleges that Price used his celebrity to lure
investors to Atrigon, promised a long-term commitment to work with
the Camarillo, Calif., company and collected his dlrs 2.25 million
annual salary plus other pay before bolting for greener greens.
	   Atrigon, formed in 1993, hired Price in 1995 to promote its
anticipated first product, the BlackHawk golf club, said
shareholders lawyer William Brewer. Atrigon officials claimed the
club, with a one-piece shaft and head, would have launched balls
straighter and further than other clubs, which generally have
separate shafts and heads, he said.
	   ``Price left the company high and dry to collect bigger
endorsement fees from a competing golf club manufacturer,'' Brewer
said. ``Shareholders were left holding an empty bag.''
	   Price endorsed Atrigon from March 1995 to April 1996, when his
contract expired, said David Abell, Price's business manager and
head of the Nick Price Group in Jupiter, Florida. Price joined
Goldwin Golf in January 1997, he said.
	   ``While Atrigon was an unfortunate experience for everyone
involved, the facts are that no claim exists against Nick Price,''
Abell said. ``It's baseless.''
	   The complaint names, in addition to Price, several Atrigon
executives. It accuses them of lying about ownership of the patent
on a one-piece club that the company hadn't even developed yet.
	   ``Atrigon directors sold their investors down the river,''
Brewer said.
	   Price finished the second round of the British Open in
Southport, England on Friday in a three-way tie for second place
with Justin Rose and Tiger Woods. They were one stroke behind
leader Brian Watts, who was 3-under-par.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ With several descendants of the
Romanov dynasty looking on, Russia's first president said he hoped
the burial of Russia's last czar and his family would put the
country on the path to reconciliation with its past.
	   ``We must finish this century, which has become the century of
blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and
reconciliation,'' Boris Yeltsin said Friday.
	   Yeltsin delivered a strong and stirring speech during the
ceremony that culminated with the lowering of nine coffins with the
bones of Czar Nicholas II, his wife, daughters and servants into
one large crypt beneath the floor of the gilded, 18th-century St.
Peter and Paul Cathedral
	   He said the burial should serve as a catalyst for national
reconciliation in a country that has lurched from one upheaval to
another during the 20th century _ from revolution and civil war, to
famine, political purges and the collapse of the Soviet empire.
	   The burial, which took place on the 80th anniversary of the
executions of the Russian royal family by Bolshevik
revolutionaries, was officiated by a dozen bearded priests in
gold-and-white robes, with one gently swinging a censer that sent
small puffs of burning incense wafting over the coffins.
	   Dozens of the czar's relatives, diplomats from 50 countries, and
Prince Michael of Kent, a member of the British royal family, which
is related to Russian royalty, stood holding candles at the
cathedral on the banks of the Neva River.
	   The czar's family members tossed white sand, representing the
earth, onto the coffins before the crypt was covered. Outside on
the river bank, cannons boomed in a 19-shot salute _ two shy of the
customary 21 because the czar abdicated a year before he was
killed.
	   ``We have long been silent about this monstrous crime,'' Yeltsin
said of the executions, which occurred at the dawn of the communist
era. ``Guilty are those who committed this heinous crime, and those
who have been justifying it for decades, all of us.''
	   Yeltsin, who has not advocated restoring the Russian monarchy,
has never publicly said what he believes the czar's fate should
have been. However, he has long spoken of the need for the country
to reclaim its long-suppressed history and condemn communist
abuses.
	   ``We must tell the truth _ the (czar's) massacre has become one
of the most shameful pages of our history,'' Yeltsin said. ``By
burying the remains of the innocent victims we want to expiate the
sins of our ancestors.''
	   The house where Nicholas and his family were executed was torn
down two decades ago under the supervision of Yeltsin, the local
Communist Party boss at the time.
	   The 67-year-old president, whose health is a constant concern,
appeared tired at the burial ceremony. He was the only person in
the cathedral who sat during portions of the service.
	   As the ceremony drew to a close, Yeltsin clasped the hands of
Nicholas Romanov, the most prominent of the czar's relatives at the
service, and they spoke briefly.
	   With its understated dignity, the burial was in sharp contrast
to the months of controversy that preceded it.
	   Many leading Russian figures, including the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church, skipped the service due to multiple disputes it
generated. Yeltsin initially said he would not attend but abruptly
changed his mind on Thursday.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917, the Romanov dynasty, and the nature of national guilt and
contrition.
	   The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but Russia has not held any
major, formal ceremonies dealing with the abuses committed during
communist times. Friday's service brought the issue to the fore.
	   ``This is not just a funeral, but a national repentance,'' said
Mstislav Rostropovich, one of the world's leading conductors and
cellists, who was exiled during the Soviet era.
	   ``It shows the entire world that Russia is changing and becoming
more humane,'' he said on Russian television.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   But the burial also raised controversies. The Orthodox Church,
as well as some ordinary Russians, have questioned the authenticity
of the remains despite extensive DNA testing in the United States,
Russia and Britain.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony was
relatively simple. When the coffins were interred, the priest did
not use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques
were on the walls of the chapel.
	   About 1,500 people gathered outside the fortress. A few dozen
were there to protest.
	   ``Factories are closed. People aren't getting their pay _ what's
going on with this funeral?'' said Vyacheslav Marichev, a former
politician.
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for three centuries. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was killed on July 17, 1918, along with his
wife, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   Nine of the 11 bodies were recovered in 1991 from a desolate
forest outside the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. Two
skeletons have never been found _ Alexei, the czar's only son and a
daughter that scientists believe was Maria. Scientific tests
indicate the bones of Anastasia, one daughter some believe survived
the shooting, were among the remains buried.

Impoverished Westerner turned Thai folk comedian dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An Austrian man who became an actor in
Thai folks plays to support his impoverished family has died in a
motorcycle accident, newspapers said Saturday.
	   Stary Wilfred, 31, gained local fame as perhaps the only
foreigner ever to perform in ``likay,'' traditional folk drama
which combines dancing, singing and often racy dialogue.
	   He was found dead Thursday after his motorcycle crashed into an
electricity pole in Tha Wung, north of Bangkok, according to The
Nation. It quoted police as saying his Thai wife and two children
were left with 408 baht (dlrs 10), which would be used for
Wilfred's funeral.
	   Wilfred, who was born in Austria but held a German passport, met
his wife Wichian Charoensi when she was working in Germany. He
returned with her to Thailand in 1992.
	   The economic crisis, which hit Thailand last year, saw their
investments vanish and Wilfred was attracted to the likay, which is
still popular with rural audiences.
	   He became known as ``the likay lad'' and by his stage name of
Henry Maithammada, or Henry the Extraordinary.
	   ``My neighbors who saw my show enjoyed it,'' he told a reporter
last month. ``They laughed and were happy. I like making people
happy. (Thais) are open-minded and they accepted me and I'm
grateful to them.''
	   The novelty of a foreigner appearing as a comic in such
traditional entertainment drew audiences. But earnings from likay
are minimal, and his wife had to work in a tanning factory for
about 100 baht (dlrs 2.50) a day to help support the family.

	   HALONG, Vietnam (AP) _ The four hours it takes to cover the 160
kilometers (100 miles) of bad road from Hanoi to Halong delivers
you to another world. Unlike the cacophonous capital, with its
horn-blaring motorbikes darting hither and yon, nothing happens
very fast on Halong Bay.
	   On a boat in the bay, surrounded by 1,969 monolithic limestone
islands, it's hard to imagine being in a hurry to do anything but
relax and enjoy the unusual seascape.
	   Halong Bay, which stretches along 250 kilometers (155 miles) of
Vietnam's northwest coast, is the country's shining gem, a place to
escape crowded streets and lazily chug along in your boat to
whatever looks appealing. And there's plenty of that.
	   Many of the craggy islands, with hardy trees clinging
precariously to cracks in the sheer rock faces, are virtually
inaccessible. It's not hard to believe that some have never been
climbed.
	   Caves riddle a few. Chinese lighting experts illuminated some on
one island to show off towering columns that reach nearly 50 meters
(150 feet) to the cathedral-like ceiling.
	   So rent a boat _ maybe that one with the dragon's head _ for a
few hours or a couple of days and explore what some call one of the
world's great natural wonders.
	   The beauty and the simplicity of life lead Nguyen Thi Nhung, 37,
to hope that her daughter will marry and stay to live on the
flotilla of boats, stashed away amid several islands, that was home
to her parents.
	   ``The worst thing is you can't make much money,'' Nhung says as
she steers her leaky sampan under a rock overhang into a perfect
little protected lagoon that the boats use to hunker down during
storms.
	   ``But it's beautiful. And you eat the best fish and shrimp every
day.''
	   About 100 people live on the ramshackle floating archipelago,
and they seem to want for little. A couple of tiny antennae jut
here and there, and shouts go up as the national soccer team scores
on battery-powered black-and-white TVs.
	   The centerpiece is a green wood-planked houseboat with seven
other boats lashed alongside and smaller clusters off to the side.
Laundry hangs here and there. Five dogs bark from one five-boat
bubble.
	   Nhung makes a weekly sojourn to land to buy supplies. She earns
a little money showing tourists the hideaways that can't be reached
by bigger boats. Other family members sell fish. The youngest row
out to tourist boats in hopes of getting handouts.
	   For many years, Halong Bay was too far off the beaten path for
any but the most hardy or well-heeled travelers. But things are
changing.
	   For travelers not coming by ship or helicopter _ investors are
being sought for an airport _ the drive is more than four hours
from Hanoi, even though it's only 160 kilometers (100 miles).
	   ``The roads from Hanoi are still very bad. It's a hard trip for
tourists,'' says Nguyen Dinh Chien, a provincial tourism official.
``If everything goes smoothly, we will have a good road to Hanoi
next year. The trip will take less than three hours.
	   ``Many foreign investors say tourism development will be much
better then, that they would be more active.''
	   With the country hungry for foreign currency, the project has
been given priority. Construction work is under way at several
sites along the route.
	   Despite the accessibility problems, tourism has been booming.
	   Chien says the number of foreign visitors has grown an average
of 43 percent per year, jumping from 12,000 in 1990 to 151,000 last
year.
	   Although they come from more than 55 countries, most tourists
are from France, China and Taiwan. Less than 5 percent are
Americans.
	   The once-quiet town of Halong is waking up to opportunity as
more tourist hotels go up and swampy land is filled in to make room
for more.
	   That has meant steady growth in prostitution and other social
ills. A man walking along the shore at night is likely to get
propositioned numerous times by women offering private
``massages.''
	   Police have cracked down some, but Chien knows there are
challenges ahead. ``It's one of the problems we have to settle,''
he says. ``We don't want foreign tourists to be bothered, but we
also are trying to limit the influence of foreign tourists on local
people.''
	   The part of Halong Bay set up for tourism co-exists somewhat
uneasily with Vietnam's largest coal-mining region.
	   Since the average tourist stays only 1 1-2 days, few ever
venture out on a northbound ferry to see mountains of coal waste on
one side of the road, facilities to load ships on the other and
Halong's islands in the distance. It's an almost-surreal contrast.
	   ``The coal-mining industry has caused concerns for tourism
people for a long time now,'' Chien says.
	   Numerous seminars have been held over the last decade on how to
minimize coal's environmental impact on Halong Bay. Japan is
funding a study now.
	   All coal-washing facilities and loading terminals are being
located out of the area that Chien says needs exclusive protection.
	   ``In our planning, all industrial facilities will be moved at
least 30 kilometers (20 miles) from here,'' he says.

Six dead, more than 100 missing after tidal wave hits: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Six people are dead and at least 100
are missing after a tidal wave struck a remote area on the
northwest coast of Papua New Guinea, Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio reported Saturday.
	   The 23-foot- (seven-meter-) high wave hit the coast near town of
Aitape on the large south Pacific island on Friday night following
an earthquake off the coast of magnitude seven, the ABC said.
	   Relief coordinators said said most those killed were children,
according to the report.
	   The wave crushed houses built of jungle materials on beaches
along the northern coast. Local residents said hundreds of houses
had been destroyed and up to 15,000 people may be affected.
	   Rob Parer, a businessman who lives near Aitape, told the ABC
locals were reporting that up to 90 percent of houses in at least
four villages built on the waterfront had been devastated by the
wave.
	   ``The people have never heard of anything like it. They thought
the world had ended,'' Parer said.
	   The ABC reported that communications difficulties in the remote
region would mean the true extent of the disaster would not be
known for some time.
	   It said people with broken limbs were being ferried to a
hospital in the village of Vanimo.

	    &UR; If You Go ... &LR; 
	   GETTING THERE: Visitors can reach Halong Bay from Hanoi by
helicopter for dlrs 80 (1 million dong) one way, by bus for about
dlrs 3 (40,000 dong) or by rented car for dlrs 50-60
(650,000-800,000 dong) per day. Some cruise ships also stop there.
A boat that can carry 10 to 25 people to the islands goes for dlrs
12 (150,000 dong) per hour on Sundays, about half that on weekdays.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ACCOMMODATIONS: A three- to four-star hotel ranges from dlrs
70-200 (900,000-2.6 million dong) per night; smaller mini-hotels go
for dlrs 25-30 (32,000-50,000). Dozens of small restaurants dot the
area, emphasizing meals of the abundant local seafood for dlrs 4-5
(50,000-65,000 dong). Expect to pay considerably more for a
cheeseburger or other Western fare in an upper-scale hotel.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TRAVEL TIPS: Halong Bay is particularly popular with foreign
tourists in the Northern Hemisphere winter, roughly November
through April. The clearest skies are in April-May, but it's also
hot then. May through August is mostly for local tourists. Dress is
casual.
	   The nightlife mostly consists of bars, a handful of pricey
nightclubs and plenty of karaoke parlors.
	   Sunglasses and sun block are essential; mosquito repellent and
swimsuit suggested. Bring needed medicines.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire hit his 41st and 42nd homers to
set a major league record for most home runs by the end of July as
the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-1 Friday
night.
	   McGwire hit a 511-foot (156-meter) homer into the upper deck off
Brian Bohanon (2-6) in the first inning and added another solo shot
in the eighth off Antonio Osuna to break the July mark held by Babe
Ruth and Jimmie Foxx.
	   The homer off Bohanon was the fourth-longest since they started
measuring them at Busch Stadium in 1988. McGwire also hit the other
three, including the record 545-foot (166-meter) shot against
Florida on May 16.
	   McGwire moved within one homer of the Cardinals' team record set
by Johnny Mize in 1940. He walked in his other two plate
appearances, giving him a major league-leading 99 for the season.
 &UR; Cubs 6, Marlins 1 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Sammy Sosa hit his 36th homer and Steve Trachsel
pitched a five-hitter as the Chicago Cubs beat the Florida Marlins.
	   Trachsel (9-5) limited the Marlins to five singles, struck out
nine and walked two in his first complete game since Aug. 17, 1996.
He has won his last three starts after losing his previous four.
	   Sosa's two-run homer, a 440-foot (134-meter) shot to center in
the sixth off Kirt Ojala, was his first since July 10. In June,
Sosa set a major league record for homers in a month with 20.
	   Mickey Morandini had three singles, drove in a run and scored
one for Chicago. Lance Johnson had two singles and scored twice for
the Cubs.
 &UR; Pirates 5, Expos 1 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, in a wild game that featured three bench-clearing
incidents and three ejections, the Pittsburgh Pirates snapped the
Montreal Expos' three-game winning streak.
	   Montreal pitcher Javier Vazquez, Pittsburgh third baseman Aramis
Ramirez were ejected in the sixth, and Pirates hitting coach Lloyd
McClendon was thrown out in the fifth.
	   Mike Williams (2-0), a last-minute starter for Pittsburgh after
Esteban Loaiza was traded to Texas earlier in the day, got the win
in his first major league start since 1996. He allowed one run and
five hits in five innings.
 &UR; Padres 13, Reds 3 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Greg Vaughn and Tony Gwynn each homered twice and
Ruben Rivera had his first career grand slam as San Diego ended
Cincinnati's 10-game winning streak.
	   Steve Finley also homered as the NL West leaders scored 12 runs
off a club-record six homers while snapping the Reds' best winning
streak since 1975. It was only Cincinnati's second loss in 17
games.
	   Andy Ashby (13-5) allowed three runs on seven hits over 6 1-3
innings and pulled even with Atlanta's Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine
for most wins in the National League. The right-hander has beaten
Cincinnati three times this season after starting his career 0-8
against the Reds.
 &UR; Mets 6, Phillies 0 &QC; 
	   In New York, Hideo Nomo won for the first time in seven starts
since joining the Mets, allowing only three hits in seven innings.
	   Nomo (3-8), who was 0-1 for the Mets since being acquired May 25
from the Los Angeles Dodgers, struck out nine as New York snapped a
three-game losing streak. Jeff Tam and Mel Rojas pitched an inning
apiece to finish the shutout.
	   Brian McRae went 3-for-4 with a homer, three RBIs and two runs
scored.
 &UR; Braves 4, Brewers 1 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Tom Glavine pitched seven strong innings and joined
Atlanta teammate Greg Maddux as the NL's only 13-game winners.
	   The Braves, who lead the league with 131 home runs, got solo
shots from Chipper Jones, Andruw Jones and Danny Bautista in
winning their fourth straight and 13th in 16 games.
	   Glavine (13-4) allowed six hits in seven shutout innings. Dennis
Martinez pitched 1 2-3 innings before Mark Wohlers, making his
first major league appearance since June 12, allowed a run to score
on a walk and a double.
	   Rookie John Rocker relieved Wohlers and got the final out for
his first major league save.
 &UR; Astros 10, Giants 7 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Jose Lima won for the first time since June 6 and
Derek Bell had a two-run single in a five-run fourth inning as the
Houston Astros beat the San Francisco Giants.
	   Lima (8-5), who was the first pitcher in the NL to reach six
victories this season, had struggled since then with three losses
and three no-decisions.
	   After falling behind 3-2 after two innings, Lima retired 14 in a
row from the third through the eighth innings and left with a 9-6
lead. Lima allowed eight hits and six runs and struck out five in
eight innings.
	   Craig Biggio and Sean Berry had three hits each for the Astros.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Shawn Green hit two homers, including a grand
slam, and Roger Clemens pitched seven strong innings as the Toronto
Blue Jays beat the New York Yankees 9-6 Friday night.
	   Green went 3-for-5 with a career-high five RBIs. His homer in
the fourth tied the game at one, and his grand slam in the seventh
gave the Blue Jays a 6-1 lead.
	   The Yankees, who lost their second straight for the first time
since June 15-16 _ a span of 26 games _ remained tied with the 1902
Pittsburgh Pirates for the best record in major league history
after 90 games (67-23).
	   Clemens (11-6) won his sixth straight game, striking out 10 and
walking two.
	   Darren Holmes (0-2) took the loss.
 &UR; Tigers 6, Red Sox 4
	   In Detroit, Gabe Alvarez homered and drove in four runs to help
fellow rookie Brian Powell get his first major league win as
Detroit beat Boston.
	   Alvarez was just 1-for-21 since the All-Star break before he hit
an RBI single in the fourth and a three-run homer in the sixth.
Tony Clark added three hits, including two doubles, and scored
twice for the Tigers.
	   Powell (1-1), making his fourth major league start, gave up six
hits and four runs in six-plus innings. Todd Jones got the final
four outs for his 17th save, striking out the side in the ninth.
	   Red Sox rookie Jin Ho Cho (0-3) made his third major league
start and gave up nine hits and five runs in 5 1-3 innings.
 &UR; White Sox 4, Indians 3
	   In Chicago, Albert Belle hit his 300th homer _ his 10th in 10
games since the All-Star break _ and Robin Ventura homered leading
off the bottom of the ninth to give Chicago the victory.
	   Ventura's game-winner off reliever Paul Shuey (1-1) came after
the Indians tied the game in the top of the ninth as White Sox
reliever Matt Karchner blew his third straight save opportunity.
	   Belle, who was miffed because his former manager Hargrove left
him off the All-Star team, did a hop step at home plate while
watching the ball sail out in left-center in the sixth. And after
Belle returned to the White Sox dugout following his 28th homer, he
pumped his fist toward the crowd.
	   Bill Simas (4-3) got the victory.
