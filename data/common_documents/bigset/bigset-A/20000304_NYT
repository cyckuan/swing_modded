PROSECUTOR TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY FOR DRAGGING DEATH OF CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Jackson County
prosecutor said Friday that he would seek the death penalty against
a Kansas City man charged the dragging death of a 6-year-old boy
last week in Independence.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prosecutor Bob Beaird's announcement came hours after a grand
jury upgraded charges against 34-year-old Kim L. Davis to include
first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Last week prosecutors charged Davis with second-degree murder in
the Feb. 22 death of Jake Robel. The boy was dragged after he
became entangled by a seat belt during the theft of his mother's
sport-utility vehicle. Since then, Beaird said, ``We have studied
all the files and I have personally talked to a number of
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's harshest murder charge fits, Beaird said.
</P>
<P>
   Second-degree murder provides for a life sentence; first-degree
murder is punishable by death or life without parole. It requires
proof that a killer acted with deliberation, defined as ``cool
reflection, no matter how brief.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the grand jury indicted Davis for first-degree
murder, along with second-degree robbery, kidnapping and armed
criminal action.
</P>
<P>
   The armed criminal action charge replaces an earlier count of
child abuse. It is based on the concept that Davis used the
sport-utility vehicle as a weapon to kill Jake.
</P>
<P>
   Davis pleaded not guilty in his previous arraignment. He is to
be arraigned on the grand jury charges on March 15. Beaird said he
would file grounds for the death penalty at that hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The case began just after Christy Robel of Independence parked
her Chevrolet Blazer in front of a sub shop at 3010 S. Missouri
291. She went into the eatery and left her keys in the ignition and
her son, Jake, strapped in a seat belt in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records:
</P>
<P>
   Davis tried to shove the boy from the Blazer before stealing it,
and Robel ran outside and tried to grab her son. Jake became
tangled in his seat belt outside the closed rear door, and Robel
screamed at Davis as he drove off with her son. Jake also screamed
as he died. Davis did not stop until motorists captured him after a
high-speed chase that covered five miles.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said the upgraded charges had nothing to do with tears he
shed at a previous news conference dealing with the case. That was
because he had met with the family just before the news briefing,
he said. He also met with them Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're caught in a terrible tragedy,'' Beaird said. ``If you
talk to them, it's pretty hard not to be moved.''

CENSUS 2000 LAUNCHES AD CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mom is a waitress
with no choice other than to bring her toddler to work at the
diner. He bothers the customers. The boss is not happy. A voice
intones:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Next year, billions of dollars will be spent for day care.
Will you get your share?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, the TV commercial implies, can be ``yes'' _ but only
if mom fills out her Census 2000 form.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the less subtle messages being beamed at
Americans as the government makes a glitzy $100 million media pitch
to increase participation in the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Many 30-second spots are airing in prime time to encourage
Americans to fill out the forms that will be mailed to 118 million
households beginning March 13. Census workers began delivering
forms to rural residents Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the Census has resorted to paid,
professional advertising, an effort to reverse a historical decline
in the number of people who mail the forms back.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 50 versions of the ads aimed at such
audiences as working moms, African-Americans, Hispanics and
American Indians. Languages include Spanish, Vietnamese, Polish and
even Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   The spots are slick and well-made. Most are warm and fuzzy, with
an emphasis on smiles, children and community. But the motivation
is self interest. The ads talk about education, health care and job
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top reason is, crudely stated, `What's in it for me?' ''
said Jennifer Marks, chief of the publicity office for Census 2000.
``Part of the message is: `Fill out the Census and you may get this
school or whatever. If you don't fill out the Census this is what
you'll get, which is nothing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The decennial Census is required by the Constitution and
determines Congressional district boundaries and therefore
political representation. But it also influences how and where $185
billion in federal money will be spent next year, as well as
countless millions by state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The ads were produced by a consortium headed by the Young &AMP;
Rubicam Inc. agency of New York, whose clients include AT&AMP;T, Ford
Motor Co. and the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Kirkpatrick of Kansas City's Bernstein-Rein advertising
agency, and a former employee of Young &AMP; Rubicam, was impressed by
the scope of the government's ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an incredible amount of production money being
spent,'' said Kirkpatrick, who is creative director for
Bernstein-Rein's Wal-Mart account. ``To do that volume of
commercials, I'd say is unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 the mail-in response rate to the Census was about 75
percent. By 1990 it had dropped to 65 percent, and there are fears
it could drop even lower this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau estimates each percentage point drop costs about $25
million in door-to-door follow-up by Census workers. So officials
are hoping the advertising investment will actually save money by
boosting mail response.
</P>
<P>
   In previous counts the Census Bureau relied upon free
advertising services, which meant spots on late-night TV or obscure
channels. A professional paid campaign is putting the ads in prime
time during popular network shows, sports events and on cable.
</P>
<P>
   Ads aimed at African-Americans emphasize empowerment. Ads aimed
at American Indians feature a powwow dance as the announcer urges
the audience ``to unite as one tribe.'' Ads aimed at
Asian-Americans promote close family relationships. A spot aimed at
a Puerto Rican audience depicts children playing musical chairs.
One boy appears left out, but is all smiles when he finds a place
to sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take is that it will have the (intended) effect and that
people will come away from this with a more positive feeling about
the Census,'' Kirkpatrick said after viewing a sampling of the ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The total Census ad budget of $167 million also includes radio,
print and outdoor advertising. Other venues include schools and
ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Brochures distributed in schools include activity sheets and
quizzes about the Census and are designed to deliver a message to
parents through their children. To allay fears, the brochures
underscore privacy by reminding that ``Not even the president of
the United States can find out your answers!''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball stars Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants, Derek
Jeter of the New York Yankees and Ivan Rodriguez of the Texas
Rangers taped public service announcements that will appear on TV
and scoreboards in most ballparks through May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to steal an extra base, meet a wall head-on or
stand against a 100 mph fastball,'' outfielder Bonds proclaimed in
one spot. ``So why should I be afraid to fill out the Census? Your
answers are confidential.''

BOTH MOM AND DAD ARE HOSPITALIZED AT BABY'S BIRTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ This may be the rare
case where having a baby was just as hard on Dad as it was on Mom.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the same time that Jonna Brandel of Overland Park, Kan., was
in labor Thursday night at Research Medical Center, her husband,
Joe, was two floors below her undergoing emergency surgery to
remove his appendix.
</P>
<P>
   Their medical adventures began that morning when Jonna went into
labor. The Brandels drove to Research but were told it was too soon
for Jonna to enter the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, while Jonna was having contractions, Joe, 30, was
having abdominal cramps. Friends he spoke to on the phone teased
him that he was having sympathy pains. But Joe's cramps turned out
to be more than psychosomatic. Thursday evening Jonna's parents,
John and Barbara Thompson of Kansas City, brought a chicken and
mashed potato dinner to their house. Jonna ate; Joe was too sick to
take a bite.
</P>
<P>
   Around 9:30 p.m., Joe was feeling so bad that he asked to be
taken to an emergency room. His father-in-law drove him to
Research. About a half-hour later, it was Jonna's turn. Her mother
drove her to Research.
</P>
<P>
   While Jonna was in labor, she received periodic reports from the
doctors about Joe's condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried,'' she said. ``But it was hard to pay attention.
I was preoccupied by what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Joe was out of surgery and ready to witness the
birth of their first child early Friday morning, the Brandels'
daughter, Jordan, was already born.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very disappointed,'' Jonna, 31, said Friday. ``They
brought him up as soon as possible, but the baby came fast. He said
he was sorry he missed the delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, mother and daughter were doing fine. And father?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of green and nauseous,'' Jonna said. ``He was asleep
most of the day'' _ in an adjoining room.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on their conditions, the Brandels plan to go home
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping,'' Jonna said, but Joe ``is the one in
question.''

MISSOURI GOVERNOR'S RACE IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL, POLLS FIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Another statewide
race in Missouri, another dead heat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A poll commissioned by The Kansas City Star shows that the
governor's race is a tossup, with Republican Jim Talent leading
Democrat Bob Holden by 36 percent to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 4 points, meaning
the race is too close to call. The survey covered 628 registered
Missouri voters who said they voted regularly in state elections.
Calls were made Feb. 25 to 28.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research Inc., revealed a
giant wild card: 30 percent of the voters had not made up their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many voters are not familiar with either candidate and remain
undecided,'' said J. Bradford Coker, Mason-Dixon's managing
director.
</P>
<P>
   In another poll this week, Mason-Dixon said Missouri's U.S.
Senate race between Republican John Ashcroft and Democrat Mel
Carnahan also was close. Ashcroft led 47 percent to 44 percent,
within the poll's margin of error. Nine percent were undecided, an
indication that Ashcroft and Carnahan, with their long public
careers in Missouri, are better known than Talent and Holden.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's race, 21 percent said they knew nothing about
Talent, a four-term U.S. House member from St. Louis County. He sat
in the Missouri House from 1982 to 1992, serving as minority leader
his last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 29 percent of Missourians said they didn't recognize
Holden's name. A Kansas City native, he is the state treasurer and
served three terms in the Missouri House in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Talent, Michelle Dimarob, said another reason
for the high undecided quotient was the Senate race's high profile
in Missouri and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of like the quiet, sleeping giant,'' she said of
the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   In the Holden camp, aide Richard Martin said the poll's results
did not surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew this would be a close race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that Talent held his biggest lead, 42 percent to
33 percent, in the St. Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   Holden's biggest edge was in the Springfield area, which he
represented in the House. Holden led 38 percent to 30 percent
there.

GROUPS URGE AID IN THE LIMITING OF WHAT THEY CALL PRICE
DISCRIMINATION BY MEAT PROCESSORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two organizations
representing family farmers have called on U.S. Secretary of
Agriculture Dan Glickman to aggressively use his administrative
powers to limit what they call price discrimination by large
meat-processing companies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The request came during a news conference Friday at the Catholic
Chancery for the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph. Members of
Catholic Charities also participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   John Crabtree, with the Center for Rural Affairs, said Glickman
could improve the situation by issuing administrative rules that
clearly defined what pricing practices were illegal. Crabtree said
he believed some processors' pricing violated the U.S. Packers and
Stockyards Act by paying independent producers less on the open
market than they pay for the same quality livestock from farmers
with whom they have contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Kremer, former president of the Missouri Farmers Union and
a hog farmer in Osage County, Mo., said that without such rules,
many small family livestock farmers would go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Kremer pointed out that prices for hogs reached historic lows a
year ago. He lost about $70 a hog at those prices. Prices have
rebounded to about 38 cents a pound now, still only a break-even
price, he said. He said retail pork prices never reflected those
rock-bottom farm prices.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Agriculture Department said representatives
of the department had been communicating with the Center for Rural
Affairs and were looking at various possibilities to address its
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The general counsel for the American Meat Institute, a trade
organization of the meat-processing industry, said federal
legislation already spelled out what was legal and what was not in
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act allows legal price discrimination for lots of reasons,
and buying volume is one reason to give somebody a different
price,'' said Mark Dott of the institute. ``In those circumstances
when the department thought the rules were not being followed, it
has brought a case. There is some current litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kremer pointed out that a bill had been introduced in the
Missouri General Assembly that would mirror the Packers and
Stockyards Act but allow the state to act against pricing
discrimination. He said it was hoped such state laws might pressure
the Agriculture Department or Congress to act.

FED CHIEF'S OUTLOOK IS INEXPLICABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan made an odd observation when ruminating
recently on the economy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greenspan implied that a recent surge in productivity was not an
altogether good thing because it tended to boost demand even more
than supply, and thus may be inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   By his reasoning, accelerating productivity drives stock prices
higher by feeding expectations of higher profits. Rising stock
prices enhance the ``wealth effect'' that supercharges consumers,
whose expanding net worth makes them want to buy more stuff.
</P>
<P>
   This view is odd for a couple of reasons. One of the first
things Econ 101 students learn is that rising productivity is an
unalloyed good. It's what makes economic growth possible without
the bugbear of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity has increased more than 3 percent annually the past
couple of years, which is remarkable given the maturity of the
expansion. More incredibly, productivity soared at a 5 percent
annual rate last quarter, and many economists expect this estimate
to be revised upward to 6 percent or higher next week.
</P>
<P>
   While many analysts would jubilantly claim this the best
economic news possible, Greenspan sees a dark lining in this silver
cloud, which may portend several more interest-rate increases by
the Fed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another odd aspect of Greenspan's remarks is his apparent
perception of a rising stock market, which definitely isn't the
case. Even when the major indices were climbing last year, the
market's narrow leadership masked the fact that most stocks were in
the doldrums. While the Nasdaq is up so far this year, the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 and Dow Jones industrial average are listing badly.
The Dow's January-February swoon was one of its worst ever.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the stocks that still are rising are for the most
part the dot-com mania darlings that are impervious to the rate
increases the Fed is engineering in the name of cooling the stock
market. These companies use relatively little credit capital and
instead get most of their money from equity investors.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the confusing situation: The Fed chairman appears to
be one of the few economists in the world who perceives strong
productivity gains as a threat to society's well-being. In the name
of fighting an inflationary threat few others can discern, he wants
to halt the rise of stocks that really aren't rising while pushing
policies that won't affect the stocks whose prices are rising.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Join the club. None of this makes any sense, unless
Fed policy-makers responsible for tightening the screws are simply
looking to get even with market participants for not behaving as
the Fed wants them to behave. To be sure, these inexplicable
policies will continue to depress Old Economy stock prices and
eventually even bring the New Economy dot-com wonders back to
Earth. Meanwhile, the overall economy will slide inexorably into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Expansions don't die of old age, it's said, but are killed by
policy miscalculations. Even as strong as the economy is, the Fed
certainly has the power to end this record run of prosperity.
That's a given. The compelling question at this point is whether
this is what the Fed really wants to do. And if so, why?

UCLA'S RUSH WON'T BE RUSHED BACK IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ JaRon Rush doesn't know exactly when he'll
play, how long he'll play or how well he'll play today at No.1
Stanford. But he knows after a 24-game, 84-day suspension, he's as
anxious as he is excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty excited, but I'm also pretty nervous,'' said Rush,
suspended Dec. 10 for violating NCAA rules. ``The team is starting
to play well, and I don't want to mess with the chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard. I had given up on the season. I thought I
wasn't coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush's reprieve came Monday when the NCAA appeals committee
reduced his 29-game suspension to nine games. He was on the Bruins'
bench Thursday night at Cal when they turned a 19-point deficit
into an 83-62 victory. He has no regrets about returning against
the nation's No.1 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to play calm,'' Rush said. ``There's no pressure
on me, and there's no pressure on the team. We're going against the
top-ranked team in the country. Everybody thinks they're going to
blow us out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins need Rush, who averaged 11.3 points and 4.7 rebounds
in three games before the suspension. They need his energy, they
need his tenacity, they need his fouls - especially against
Stanford's deep bench - and they need his rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll add more fire,'' forward Jason Kapono said. ``He plays
with great heart and passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Steve Lavin hasn't decided on Rush's role or his
playing time. He could play 10 minutes if the game is close or 20
if it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to stay with the regular rotation, which has been
irregular,'' Lavin said. ``I don't anticipate him being the first
or second guy off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, he kind of blends in. He's not coming in with our
backs to the wall where he'd be seen as the savior. Things have
fallen in line, so his return is kind of ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Big swing: Lavin called Thursday's 19-point comeback the most
memorable since the Bruins rallied from 16 down to defeat Iowa
State in the 1997 Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 19 down, you still believe you have a chance,''
Lavin said. ``What we kept saying in the timeouts was we were
taking their best shot, but if we could whittle (the deficit) to 10
or below, we cold crawl back in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our energy at halftime was the best it's been all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Comeback II? Unlikely: Even the Bruins' best game might not be
enough to stay within single-digits of Stanford, which beat USC by
43 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal has won 13 consecutive games by an average of 25.4
points, and it's on pace to set the NCAA record for field goal
defense. Opponents are shooting only 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a runaway, but it's very unlikely they'll let
youback in the game,'' Lavin said. ``We can't afford to dig a deep
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Stanford beat UCLA by 48 points, the worst loss
in school history.

<P>
   EASTCHESTER, N.Y. _ The Odyssey Diner here is one of those
old-fashioned political hangouts, where establishment pols, mostly
Republicans, gather at the counter or in a side room to hash things
out over the famous cheesecake and coffee courtesy of the affable
Doukases, who have run the place for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the stiff competition among the Republican candidates and
the approach of the New York primary on Tuesday have enlivened the
discourse here, even among the Doukas family. They unwittingly
served up an example of the split among Republican voters in this
336-year-old town of mansions and Cape Cod-style homes when it
comes to Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   George Doukas, the proprietor, scoffed at the televised face of
McCain as he spoke in a television news report while Doukas played
backgammon. Doukas firmly declared his commitment to Bush, aligning
himself with the county Republican establishment, including this
Westchester County town's supervisor, James Cavanaugh, who is the
newly anointed county party leader and a firm Bush man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bush has the better chance of winning,'' said Doukas,
65, who owns the diner with his family. ``He seems to have done a
good job in Texas and has a good record there.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Republican Party as a whole has not united
behind Bush, neither have the Doukases. Standing a few feet away at
the register, Doukas's wife, Angela, 61, just as firmly declared
her commitment to McCain, of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he lost in South Carolina he made that speech and what he
said stuck in my heart,'' she said. ``He said we will go forth, but
he congratulated Bush even though they fought so much. It just
showed what a strong gentleman he is.''
</P>
<P>
   While far from being a scientific sounding, 28 interviews with
registered Republicans over two days here and in the two
self-governing villages this town encompasses _ Tuckahoe and
Bronxville _ suggested an electorate tuned to the primary campaign
but sometimes ambivalent about the choices a few days before the
Tuesday primary.
</P>
<P>
   There was hope for McCain in people willing to buck the
conventional wisdom and even to risk domestic bliss for their man.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can take comfort, too, in the likes of Mr. Doukas and
William Carlson, a 69-year-old semiretired sales representative who
said he was turned off by reports of McCain's negative campaigning
by telephone. Besides, Carlson said, Bush stands firm on
conservative principles and served as governor of a large, ``tough
state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done a lot of good things in Texas,'' Carlson said.
``He has used the death penalty a lot, and I think we need more of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many people could articulate policy positions of the
candidate they favored. The more common requests of any candidate
were lower taxes, keep the economy cruising, do something to
improve access to health care, but few could explain what their
candidate might do to achieve such goals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's post-New Hampshire primary surge entranced some who
otherwise would have supported Bush because he was so far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is still an open race,'' said Kevin Scully, an
Internet entrepreneur from Bronxville. ``I didn't think of McCain
before, when Bush was the primary candidate, but now I'm starting
to get serious about thinking of McCain. I'm still not able to
clearly get his message, but I will be paying more attention now.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin L. Cooperman, 53, a physiotherapist, said he thought Bush
was ``spending too much time attacking, and I don't like those
tactics.'' This comment came a day before the Bush campaign began
broadcasting radio advertisements and disseminating fliers
questioning McCain's record on financing for breast cancer
research.
</P>
<P>
   While favoring McCain, he said both candidates had disappointed
him by not fully explaining how they would improve the delivery of
health insurance, particularly for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman also said he would be tempted to vote Democratic in a
contest between Gore and Bush. He voted for President Clinton in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   How such sentiments will translate in the voting booth remains
anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanaugh, the party leader, acknowledged McCain's draw. ``I am
not the least bit dismissive of McCain's challenge,'' he said. ``He
is making a strong challenge, and there are people who are enamored
of him. I am not saying Bush has it in the bag. We all have to work
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   For the undecided and even those with a bent, the race could
hardly be described as the same-old, same-old. ``With all these
choices, it's hard to keep up,'' said Robert Frederick, a
38-year-old computer scientist who said he planned to spend the
next few days reading about the candidates before deciding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a fiscal conservative but sort of moderate on social
issues,'' Frederick said. ``Bush and McCain both say they are
fiscal conservatives, and it's hard to keep up on where they stand
on things like abortion, which I think they both oppose, but then
they may have said things like it's OK in certain cases, or
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pro-choice and think the Democrats have done good with the
economy,'' he said. ``Where does that leave me?''

``HURRICANE'' CARTER VISITS PRISON INMATES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAUGUS, Calif. _ Freed by a judge after nearly 20 years in
prison, Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter spent Friday behind bars in
North Los Angeles County, where he urged inmates to better
themselves and break the cycle of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the inspiration for the movie ``The Hurricane'' starring
Denzel Washington, pleaded with inmates at the Peter J. Pitchess
Detention Center to educate themselves to ensure a better future
once they're released.
</P>
<P>
   A former middleweight boxer, Carter was imprisoned for a triple
murder at a New Jersey bar until a federal judge ordered him freed
in 1985. He was joined Friday by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the
National Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a man who has had every kind of indignity. He's been
disrespected in every way possible, yet he respects everyone
else,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Friday's program, ``The Hurricane'' was screened for
about 150 inmates in hopes of inspiring them to make the most of
their time in jail to ensure a better life on the outside and to
help fix the problems that sent them to jail.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both Carter and Jackson pointed out the significant
disparity between the number of minorities in prisons versus
universities throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I enter universities, I see that 85 percent of students
are white, and in prisons, 85 to 90 percent are black folks.
Something is terribly wrong,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson railed against a justice system that has allowed for
wrongful incarceration and the proliferation of recidivism, adding
that about 1.2 million individuals are in jail for nonviolent
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson stressed that many minorities end up in jail because of
the ``racial profiling'' that occurs throughout the nation, and
praised Carter for the inner drive that kept him going while he was
in prison in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who has known Carter for many years and staged a
protest on Carter's behalf in the 1970s, had an idea as he watched
``The Hurricane'' one day. The movie should be shown to prisoners
across the nation, said Tracy Rice, a death penalty appeals
attorney with the Rainbow Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Jackson, Carter and the coalition presented the
film at a prison in Cook County, Ill. The more than 700 male and
female prisoners who attended were riveted by what they saw, Rice
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't hear a pin drop throughout the entire movie,''
she said. ``Half of them were in tears and cheering when the movie
was over ... and we just thought, this can't be the last time we
(show the movie) because it was so powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at Pitchess were Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and
producers, actors and athletes, including actor/producer Mike
Farrell, Washington Redskins quarterback Rodney Peete and record
producer Barry Hankerson.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, some inmates at the North County Correctional
Facility who have shown extra initiative by helping out in the
kitchen, the sewing shop, print shop or other locations, took part
in a motivational presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to get the inmates to change their lives, get
off (drugs) and stay out of jail,'' said Sgt. Pat Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter emphasized how important it is for the community to reach
out to inmates and let them know they matter, rather than
perpetuating a closed society behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prison walls and gun towers are not only there to keep
prisoners in, but to keep the community out,'' Carter said.

APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS EPA RULES TO REDUCE SMOG IN THE NORTHEAST

<P>
   In what clean air advocates called a watershed ruling, a federal
appeals court on Friday upheld rules limiting pollution from
Midwestern states that causes unacceptable levels of smog in
Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-to-1 ruling, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit in Washington upheld the Environmental
Protection Agency rule requiring the control of smog-causing
chemicals that move from several states, among them Indiana, Ohio
and West Virginia, to states like New York and parts of New
England. Coal-burning power plants are the primary source of one of
those chemicals, nitrogen oxide.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling limits the amount of nitrogen oxide that states can
emit into the atmosphere. In some cases, the new limit may require
power plants to reduce their emissions to one-quarter or one sixth
of what had been allowed, said Peter Lehner, chief of the
environmental protection bureau of the New York attorney general's
office. They can chose to limit emissions as they wish, but are
expected to focus on power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision means that we again can move forward to bring
cleaner, healthier air to more than 138 million people living in
the eastern half of the United States,'' Carol Browner, the EPA's
administrator, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had issued regulations on emissions in October 1998,
but their implementation was delayed by litigation over them.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations are expected to take effect by 2003 for some
plants and by 2005 for others. The rules originally applied to 22
states;  &UR; Fri &LR; day's ruling said further review was necessary to
determine how the regulations applied to Wisconsin, Missouri and
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the reductions in emissions would come in six
states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to New York, the other states affected are Alabama,
Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and
Virginia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The total amount of air pollution, especially in the summer,
will be dramatically less,'' Lehner said, predicting that people
would be able to notice reductions in smog and would see some
relief from asthma and other respiratory diseases, which are
worsened by air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while the current regulations focused on summertime
smog the controls might also be necessary in winter and that that
should reduce acid rain and particulate pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinarily big step toward getting year-round
controls,'' he said. Many other lawsuits have been filed to control
year-round pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Hawkins, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental advocacy group involved in the suit, said
Ohio, one of the worst polluters, experienced a higher rate of
hospital admissions in smoggy periods than New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the states that are the biggest polluters of other
states are also the biggest polluters of their own citizens,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the lawyer representing the Midwest Ozone Group, a
coalition of utility and coal companies that fought the
regulations, were not returned last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a massive attack by industry on the EPA effort, but
the court upheld that effort, a joint effort by the EPA, many of
the states suffering from transporting pollution and environmental
organizations,'' Hawkins said. Judges Stephen Williams and Judith
Rogers sided with the EPA. Judge David Sentelle dissented.

MIXED EMOTIONS IN CHILE AS PINOCHET RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert `muted' in lede graf.)

<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet received a muted hero's
welcome from the Chilean military high command as he returned home
Friday from his long exile and house arrest in London to salutes,
brassy martial music and a low flying air force helicopter
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of Chilean society displayed its lingering
divisions, as thousands of detractors and supporters took to the
streets of Santiago in competing demonstrations that vented the
political hatreds of the past.
</P>
<P>
   After a 16-month legal tug-of-war, Britain dropped extradition
proceedings against the 84-year-old former dictator on Thursday,
saying he was too ill to face charges for human rights violations
during his 17-year rule of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of people who disappeared under Pinochet's regime
cried again for their lost loved ones in candle-lit vigils.
Thousands of others rallied to hail the man they say saved Chile
from civil war and the clutches of communism. And while no serious
violence and few arrests were reported, it was hardly a day of
reconciliation. Parts of Santiago looked as if they were under
siege, with police on patrol in armored trucks mounted with water
canon.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet spent his first day back in Chile in Santiago's
Military Hospital, where he underwent medical tests while
sharpshooters were stationed on the building's roof. Local
newspaper and television reports suggested on Friday that he may
spend much of the next several days in the hospital or in seclusion
in army facilities or his Santiago residence. He is expected to
keep a low profile at least through the March 11 presidential
inauguration of Ricardo Lagos, the first Socialist party member to
hold the presidency since Pinochet's overthrow of Salvador Allende
in a violent 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Christian Democratic-Socialist coalition
government and the military high command are discussing ways to
avert demonstrations by pro- or anti-Pinochet demonstrators at the
inaugural festivities. Pinochet apparently has not been involved in
the talks, which reportedly included discussions of how to remove
the former dictator from his position as senator for life in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be improper to organize this as if it were a party,''
Interior Minister Raul Troncoso told reporters, straining to
explain the ambiguities surrounding his government's attitude
toward Pinochet's return..
</P>
<P>
   Chile's uneasy, decade-long transition to civilian democracy was
on display even before the Chilean air force aircraft that brought
Pinochet home touched the ground Friday morning. The military
ordered journalists removed from the arrival area, until President
Eduardo Frei personally intervened by calling Gen. Ricardo
Izurieta, chief commander of the army, to complain that Chile's
democratic image would be sullied by the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   There were no speeches at the arrival ceremony, which was open
only to 450 family members, friends and former senior officials who
served in Pinochet's Cabinet. The politicians who attended went to
pains to say they had come as personal friends and not as
representatives of their political parties.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet smiled and nodded in gratitude as he was received with
a warm hug by Izurieta, who replaced the former dictator as head of
the army in 1998. Then, as a 50-member military band played several
scores said to be the former dictator's favorites, all the
commanders of the armed forces personally greeted him on the
airport tarmac before a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Television commentators expressed surprise that Pinochet looked
as fit as he did in his pressed blue suit, white shirt and violet
tie as he walked to a helicopter with the help of a cane. The
general had been released by British Home Secretary Jack Straw on
the grounds that he was mentally and physically unfit to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinochet is in perfect shape as anyone can see,'' complained
Mireya Garcia, secretary-general of the Family Members of the
Disappeared, as she and 1,500 other human rights activists marched
outside the La Moneda presidential palace Friday. ``All humanity
should feel cheated by this sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a fleet of helicopters escorted Pinochet to the
hospital, flying low through the smoggy skies, traffic halted as
pedestrians and drivers sought to witness the historic arrival.
Office workers scurried from their desks to balconies and windows,
and more than 5,000 people waving Chilean flags and banners
declaring the general the country's savior gathered around the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my greatest happiness,'' said Lucia Varas, a
69-year-old housewife, who carried a poster emblazoned with
Pinochet's portrait in full military uniform. ``He brought us
tranquility and progress. His kidnapping defamed our sovereignty.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When a few young Communist Party activists taunted the crowd
outside the hospital on Avenida Providencia, dozens of young
Pinochet supporters began running toward them and screamed: ``Kill
them, Kill them. Throw out the pigs.'' Some plastic water bottles
were thrown before the police broke up the melee.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, 1,500 human rights activists and leftist protesters
carrying pictures of people who were executed and disappeared
during the Pinochet rule marched from the presidential palace
through downtown Santiago to the central court building. There they
called for the removal of Pinochet's senatorial immunity so he can
stand trial on charges of torture and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assassins, assassins,'' they chanted, as they stopped a few
minutes in front of the executive offices of the army and navy,
pointing their fingers and shaking their fists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel nothing but indignation and bitterness,'' said Monica
Monsalve, the 30-year-old daughter of a railroad labor leader who
was executed in 1973. ``We were so hopeful there would be justice
for all the victims.'' As her voice trailed off, she added, ``Maybe
we can still get some justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty criminal complaints have been filed against Pinochet in
Chilean courts, but appeals and counter-appeals are likely to take
months if not years before he can ever stand trial.

WILLIAMS MAY HAVE TO HELP IN BULLPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Davey Johnson is a matchup type of manager.
He likes to control matchups, and it's easier to do that with two
lefties in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the configuration of the Los Angeles Dodgers' roster
allows for that is another question, but one player everyone
associated with the club is watching is rookie Jeff Williams.
</P>
<P>
   With competition strong and something riding on every outing,
Williams, 27, made an impression by pitching a scoreless inning
Friday against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made some good pitches on tough hitters,'' Johnson said.
``He made good pitches on (Moises) Alou, threw some good change-ups
to him. He was impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers like Williams' physical and mental capabilities, but
they may want him to begin the season at Triple-A Albuquerque as a
starter. He was 2-0 with a 4.08 ERA in five games with the Dodgers
last season.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the need for a second left-hander in the bullpen is
glaring, and if the Dodgers don't find a complement to Onan Masaoka
either in camp or via trade (Dennis Cook of the Mets is a
possibility), Williams could pitch himself into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Splendid Splinter visits: Ted Williams, the last man to hit .400
in a season, visited the Dodgers' clubhouse and spoke to players
and coaches for nearly 30 minutes about hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the players posed for pictures with Williams,
including Gary Sheffield. The two met at last year's All-Star Game
and it remains a detailed image in Sheffield's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of gave me shivers was the All-Star Game,''
Sheffield said. ``It gave me chills. The first time you meet the
guy it's intimidating. Then you go to his museum and see all he
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The six-team summit (including the Dodgers) to
discuss a spring training site in Las Vegas on Monday was
postponed. Dodgers president and COO Bob Graziano said the meeting
would be rescheduled.... Left-hander Masaoka (left ankle) and
righty Mike Fetters (left quadricep) threw off the mound and could
be ready to pitch in games late next week. Also, right-hander Terry
Adams, who had an infected toenail removed earlier in the week,
threw off the mound for the first time and is scheduled to pitch
Sunday.... Sheffield singled in his first at-bat, prompting a
response of ``I have more hits now than I had all of last spring.''

INTERRACIAL DATING BAN TO END AT BOB JONES UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite and expand.)

<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ In an unexpected move, Bob Jones University,
a fundamentalist Christian institution that had come under national
criticism for its ban on interracial dating among its students, has
abandoned that long-held policy, its president, Bob Jones III, said
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, in an appearance on the CNN program ``Larry King Live,''
said that he had asked the university's board Friday afternoon to
end the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, as of today, we have dropped the rule,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Jones, grandson of the university's founder,
provided only a brief explanation, saying the decision was based on
a perception that criticism over the policy was threatening to
obscure the university's Christian mission. ``We have a broader
testimony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones added: ``I said to our administration, `You know, guys,
this thing is of such insignificance to us, it is so significant to
the world at large, the media particularly, why should we have this
here as an obstacle?''' He then said that the ban had damaged the
reputation of the university's graduates and possibly conservative
Protestantism as well. ``I don't want to hurt the church of Jesus
Christ,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also came only days after Democrats in Congress had
proposed a resolution that would have condemned the university for
the ban and for statements that Bob Jones leaders have made about
Roman Catholicism, which have been interpreted as attacks on
Catholics in general (an intent that the university has denied).
</P>
<P>
   The announcement amounted to a remarkable turnaround for Bob
Jones, a 73-year-old institution that hews to an unapologetic
adherence to classic Protestant fundamentalism. After a 13-year
legal fight, the university lost its tax exemption in 1983. And as
late as Wednesday, the university was attempting to explain the ban
on interracial dating according to its belief that the Bible
teaches that God does not want a unified and undifferentiated
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``God made racial differences as he made gender differences,''
said a statement the university posted on its Internet site. But,
the statement added, when God stopped humans from building the
Tower of Babel, a story told in Genesis, God did so to prevent them
from creating ``one-world government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on this biblical account (Genesis 10 and 11),'' the
statement said, ``the university wishes to give God the benefit of
any doubt and avoid pursuing any direction that would give
assistance to the renewed efforts of man to create a one-world
community consisting of one religion, one economy, one government
and one race.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its stance, the university has admitted interracial
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Jones said that although the principle on which
the university's former ban was based remained important, the ban
itself was ``meaningless to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In its Internet statement, the university described Catholic
beliefs as a ``false system,'' but asserted that it loved Catholics
as people and wanted to convert them.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came to the fore after a visit to the university on
Feb. 2 by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a candidate for the
Republican presidential nomination. Bush's opponents, Republicans
and Democrats alike, faulted him for not taking the opportunity to
speak out against the dating ban and the statements on the Catholic
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, after Jones' announcement, Bush said: ``I'm
heartened to hear that Bob Jones University has reversed its ban on
interracial dating. It was wrong to begin with, and that's why I
spoke out against the ban when I was asked about it at a news
conference immediately after my visit there. Tonight, the school
has done the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a paid advertisement that Bob Jones took out Friday in USA
Today and in South Carolina newspapers, the university said it did
not hate Catholics, but asserted that a ``wide gulf'' existed
between Catholic and Protestant beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In the advertisements, the university contended that it was
being falsely accused in news reports as a haven for bigotry.
Instead, it said that the real issue in the controversy was the
university's constitutional right to its religious freedom.

<P>
   In a paid advertisement that Bob Jones took out Friday in USA
Today and in South Carolina newspapers, the university said it did
not hate Catholics, but asserted that a ``wide gulf'' existed
between Catholic and Protestant beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In the advertisements, the university contended that it was
being falsely accused in news reports as a haven for bigotry.
Instead, it said that the real issue in the controversy was the
university's constitutional right to its religious freedom.

STARS CHANGE THEIR FOCUS AFTER BEATING COYOTES

   PHOENIX _ For most of this season, the Stars chased the Phoenix
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed them in the Pacific Division until after the
All-Star break, when they led them. But it always has been the
Coyotes they compared themselves with.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-1 come-from-behind victory against Phoenix last night at
America West Arena mightjust have changed the object of their
pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can catch St. Louis,'' Stars winger Grant Marshall said of
the Western Conference-leading Blues. ``We can catch any team if we
play the way we're capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory did more than extend the Stars' lead in the division
to seven points. The victory positioned them nine points behind St.
Louis and only three behind Detroit for the second-best record in
the West. They have a chance to further trim that with the Red
Wings in town tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the 80s now point-wise and there areother teams in
the 80s now, too,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We've spent
the whole season looking behind us. ... Maybe, we can start looking
ahead a little bit now and chasing other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of last night, the Stars were chasing the pace of the
game. The Coyotes led 1-0 through two periods, although that
eventually meant absolutely nothing. Phoenix has allowed 33 goals
in their past 10 games, with 18 of those coming in the third
period. The Coyotes coughed up four third-period goals on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the guys were talking about it, I didn't hear it,'' Stars
center Aaron Gavey said.
</P>
<P>
   The talk in the locker room was score one early, and Marshall
accommodated, taking a pass from Gavey and going five-hole on
Coyotes backup Bob Essensa 85 seconds in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the next goal of the game was real crucial for us,''
Stars center Mike Modano said. ``You go down 2-0 it's a different
game. But 1-1, boom, boom we score two more quick ones like we did
in Detroit and we took the wind out of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall got them started. Modano kept them going.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock juggled his lines betweeen periods, double shifting
Modano. He responded by assisting on the Stars final three goals,
including Langenbrunner's game winner at 6:36 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Gavey made it 3-1 at 9:27, a pretty wrist shot that went top
shelf on Essensa.
</P>
<P>
   And Brenden Morrow sent most of the crowd of 15,840 to the exits
when he scored at 11:07 to make it 4-1. The Stars threw 19 shots at
the Coyotes in the third period, after getting 17 in the first two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as the third goes on I feel I guess stronger and I
feel better as the opportunities increase a little bit,'' Modano
said.
</P>
<P>
   The four-goal third period wasn't even the Stars biggest at
America West Arena this season.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, the Stars scored five third-period goals for a 6-4
come-from-behind victory. The victory last night gave the Stars a
season sweep in Phoenix this season. Not to mention a stranglehold
on the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock said it's a hard game to make assumptions on
because of who was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were missing key players. The Coyotes were without
winger Keith Tkachuk (ankle), center Jeremy Roenick (flu),
defenseman Teppo Numminen (hip) and goalie Sean Burke (groin). The
Stars were without defensemen Richard Matvichuk (hamstring) and
Sylvain Cote (emergency), along with center Joe Nieuwendyk
(shoulder) and winger Jere Lehtinen (ankle).
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes took a 1-0 lead at 4:11 of the second period on a
goal by Mike Alatalo. They came within a split second of making it
2-0 nine minutes later. Phoenix winger Dallas Drake tipped the puck
into the empty net, but the referee waved the goal off because the
whistle had already blown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two periods I don't even know if the white team was
even out there,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had to guess whether they were in the third when the
Stars effectively stopped playing with the Coyotes and started
playing with the Blues and Red Wings. nn

TRINIDAD WINS UNANIMOUS DECISION OVER REID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In a punishing 12-round duel, Felix Trinidad pounded
David Reid to score a unanimous decision and take away Reid's World
Boxing Association superwelterweight championship at an outdoor
arena here at Caesars Palace Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a completely different Trinidad than the one who had won
a majority decision over Oscar De La Hoya in a welterweight title
bout here on Sept. 18. Trinidad was ferocious as he sent Reid to
the canvas four times in thoroughly dominating the last seven
rounds. Reid sent Trinidad to the canvas in the third round with a
right cross, but Trinidad bounced right up. It was Reid's last best
chance of getting to Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knockdown did not bother me,'' Trinidad said. ``If you
don't get me in the first few rounds, the fight is over. I came
here to win. That's what I told everyone I was going to do, and I
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge Duane Ford scored the bout 114-106, while the judges
Stanley Christodolou and Jerry Roth both scored the bout 114-107.
Reid did not win a round on any judges' scorecard after the fifth
round. Reid (14-1) lost the first bout of his professional career,
while Trinidad (37-0) remained undefeated and can now try for a
rematch with De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me with some good shots,'' Reid said. ``I have to be a
gentleman and take the loss and come right back. Experience played
a factor in the later rounds. I should have been hitting him with
more punches. As a man, as a fighter, the referee saw that I could
continue. I wasn't going to quit. I have respect for every
opponent. Tito was the better man tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid, an Olympic gold medalist on the U.S. team in 1996, had
done a good job of using his speed to control the first five
rounds. But he began to go on the defensive in the sixth round, and
in the seventh round, when Trinidad opened a cut over the side of
Reid's eye, Reid went into an even more conservative mode.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sensing that he was trailing in the fight, Trinidad
opened up his offense at the start of the sixth round and came out
throwing power shots. He caught Reid with a couple of shots, but
was penalized a point by the referee Mitch Halpern for throwing a
low blow.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh round Trinidad caught Reid with a blistering
combination, landing a left on the chin that stunned Reid and sent
him reeling into the ropes. Reid went down to the canvas while
trying to avoid more shots from Trinidad. Reid made it up by the
count of seven as the round ended.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth round Halpern called timeout to have the ring
doctor, Flip Homansky, take a look at a cut on the top of Reid's
right eye. Halpern let the fight continue. Trinidad continued to
press in the ninth round, and Reid was not doing anything to keep
him off of him.
</P>
<P>
   By the 10th round Reid was in bad shape; he was holding on with
sheer courage. Trinidad had taken him where none of his other 14
opponents ever had. In the 11th round Trinidad battered Reid,
knocking him to the canvas three times. Now, it seemed only a
matter of time before he would be hoisting Reid's title over his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dire predictions by De La Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum,
that he did not think this bout would happen, because he believed
Don King, Trinidad's promoter, would lose too much money on the
fight, it happened. King's critics had pooh-poohed the idea of
having this fight outside at Caesars Palace the way that so many
world championship bouts had been held in the 1980s. But it was a
beautiful March night outside. The temperature was in the mid-60s
when the card began.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, who had won his WBA championship after just his 11th
fight, had called this the first defining fight of his career. And
he was right. Trinidad had fought only once at 154 pounds three
years ago, knocking out Troy Waters in the first round of a bout at
Madison Square Garden. Trinidad, 27, had been the welterweight
champion since 1993 _ three years before Reid won a gold medal at
the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This was a $40 million risk for Trinidad. That is the amount of
money that Trinidad had waiting for him in a contract that calls
for two bouts against De La Hoya. De La Hoya fulfilled his end of
the deal by getting past Derrell Coley last week in New York.
Trinidad was looking to get past Reid to keep hopes of the rematch
alive. He did in convincing fashion. ''I'm fighting De La Hoya. I'd
love to fight him. He's fighting Mosley next, so I don't care if I
fight him,'' Trinidad said. ``I plan to move up in weight slowly,
up to the 160s and maybe fight Joppy. Then, maybe to 168 and fight
Roy Jones.''

CELTICS FALL TO RAPTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Add two more names to the list of people who don't
view the Celtics in a positive light: referees Joe Crawford and Jim
Kinsey. The men in green may have left the city of negativity, but
their luck didn't change north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they discovered that the sight of officials signaling
technical fouls offends the senses just as much as a chorus of
FleetCenter boos and the sound of constant criticism. Friday night
at the Air Canada Centre, a tough work week on the court and in
postgame press conferences ended with the ejections of coach Rick
Pitino and Antoine Walker.
</P>
<P>
   As the Celtics' most vocal supporter (Pitino) and leading scorer
(Walker) spent the final quarter in the visitors' locker room, the
chances for a comeback dimmed. Although the Celtics pulled within 5
(100-95) with 4 minutes 12 seconds remaining, they lost to the
Raptors, 114-104. The site of the Celtics' season-opening triumph
became just another disappointing stop on the team's slow, sub-.500
march to the end of the season. The loss extended the Celtics'
losing streak to four and pushed them 12 games below .500. Even
keep-the-encouragement-coming Pitino sounded resigned to the
Celtics' fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 20 years, my friends have kidded me about how
lucky I am,'' said Pitino. ``I guess my luck has run out when
Muggsy Bogues goes 4 for 4 from the 3-point line. But I liked the
way our guys hung in there and hustled. It wasn't a great game for
a few of our players, but the other guys picked it up and gave it
their all.''
</P>
<P>
   Practicing what he preaches, Pitino was full of positive
reinforcement for his players as he paced the sideline. The Celtics
entered halftime trailing by 7 (57-50) but did not give up as they
struggled to keep the Raptors' lead under 10 during the third. When
two Walker free throws brought the Celtics within 9 (80-71) with
1:38 left in the third, Pitino shouted ``Here we go, Celts. Here we
go.''
</P>
<P>
   But the enthusiasm and Pitino's sideline presence did not last
long. As the final minute ticked off the clock, Pitino was assessed
two technicals and tossed from the game by Kinsey. The coach had
argued that Kenny Anderson was tripped by Bogues as he was handling
the ball late in the third. (``You don't fall by osmosis.'') The
point guard went down and turned over the ball, allowing Dell Curry
to convert on the other end. Pitino felt he deserved the technical,
but not the ejection.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the fourth quarter started, Boston trailed by 13
(86-73). And it was not long before Walker joined his coach.
Fighting for a defensive rebound, Walker felt Kevin Willis went
over his back and deserved a foul. The forward took his case up
with the Crawford and lost. The referee served up two technicals
and a second Celtic ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to take (the ejection) personally,'' said
Walker. ``Maybe he wanted to kick somebody out and he picked me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino and Walker stuck around long enough to watch Bogues
tie a career high with 24 points (6 for 6 from the floor), Vince
Carter chip in 30, and Tracy McGrady prove his worth with a
24-point, 3-block, 2-steal performance. With McGrady, Carter,
Bogues, and a well-executed half-court offense (29 team assists),
the Raptors never trailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's positive to go out of town with the wins we got, rather
than the team struggling,'' said Toronto coach Butch Carter, whose
team starts a five-game West Coast trip Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Watching his team play ineffectively in the first quarter,
Pitino inserted the second unit. After falling behind early in the
opening stanza and taking a 12-point deficit into the second
quarter, Boston turned its fortunes around behind the play of
substitutes Tony Battie, Eric Williams, and Doug Overton. In the
first three minutes, the Celtics went on an 11-2 run to cut the
lead to 3. Battie contributed a basket and a steal to the run, and
Williams added 3 points and a blocked shot.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the second period, the Celtics cut the lead to 1.
First, a 3-pointer by Williams brought the Celtics nearly even
(46-45). Then, a dunk by Battie narrowed the margin to 48-47 with
4:29 left. The Boston bench outscored the starters, 34-16, in the
first half, but despite battling after intermission, it wasn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Williams finished with a season-high 22 points to lead the
Celtics, while Anderson dropped in 17. Danny Fortson started and
produced a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   And despite two technicals, an ejection, and the loss, Pitino
remained positive as he headed back to the city of negativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love our attitude,'' said Pitino. ``I just think we really
have to go to work in the summertime. The summer can't be
Margaritaville. The attitude, the team chemistry, the team values
are all there, but we've got to go to work on our games.''

TRINIDAD POUNDS REID
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ If Felix Trinidad lost anything in a disappointing
performance against Oscar De La Hoya, he found it against David
Reid on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad had trouble getting to the previously undefeated WBA
junior middleweight champion in the first half of the fight.
However, once he hurt Reid with a perfect left hook that knocked
him to the canvas in the seventh round, it got ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad battered a suddenly overmatched Reid the remainder of
the fight, cutting him badly over his right eye, knocking him down
three times in the 11th round and capturing the championship by a
one-sided decision before a crowd of 10,100 in an outdoor arena at
Caesars Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The judges scored it 114-106, 114-107 and 114-107 for Trinidad.
The Daily News had it 114-106.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the victory would have meant a rematch with De La
Hoya, who baffled Trinidad (37-0, with 30 knockouts) with his
boxing skills but blew a certain victory when he coasted in the
final rounds in their September fight.
</P>
<P>
   But now, De La Hoya says he plans to forsake a $20 million
payday against Trinidad and fight Shane Mosley for much less in his
next boutin June, which leaves Trinidad's immediate future
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad said he'd like to unify the 154-pound titles but
admitted he'd also like to face De La Hoya again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already beat him, the world knows I beat him, but it would
be a great fight,'' Trinidad said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid (14-1, seven KOs) more than held his own in the first half
of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither fighter was particularly aggressive in the
beginning,Trinidad had trouble coping with Reid's speed and
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, America's only gold medalist in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,
landed his biggest punch in the third round, a straight right that
stunned Trinidad and put him on his pants.
</P>
<P>
   However, Trinidad turned the tide with his single big right in
the seventh, which sent the champion reeling against the ropes and
then down.
</P>
<P>
   Reid never truly recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The cut was factor. The eye swelled and blood dripped into his
right eye. That, combined with his droopy left eye, appeared to
make it very difficult for him to see.
</P>
<P>
   However, make no mistake: It was Trinidad's prowess and huge
edge in experience that were his biggest problems.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed on top of Reid once he hurt him and never let him
breath, landing dozens of hard punches in the late rounds. The 11th
was a circus, with the three knockdowns and the second of two
points Trinidad lost for low blows. (Reid lost one point.)
</P>
<P>
   It amazing that Reid lasted 12 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was in control but then I got hit with a good shot,''
he said. ``... I felt he was a little bit slicker, a little more
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary bouts, Christy Martin (39-2-2, 30 KOs) rallied to
outpoint Belinda Laracuente (18-3-1, nine KOs) of Puerto Rico in an
eight-round women's bout.
</P>
<P>
   Laracuente appeared to control the fight with her speed and
athletic ability. She moved throughout the fight but consistently
beat Martin to the punch and seemed to land many more punches.
</P>
<P>
   However, the judges saw it differently, awarding the
more-aggressive Martin a majority decision.
</P>
<P>
   Martin won the final four rounds on one card and three of the
last four on two to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want a rematch. This is highway robbery,'' Laracuente
said. ``I totally felt I beat the old lady tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin criticized Laracuente for refusing to brawl with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running style didn't work for Oscar De La Hoya and it
didn't work for her,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   WBA middleweight champion William Joppy (29-1-1, 22 KOs) easily
outpointed last-minute replacement Fernando Zuniga (18-3, 14 KOs)
of Ecuador in a 10-round non-title bout.

HORRY SPARKS LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The campaign started a tad late, and wouldn't you
know it, the debates are over, and those CNN trucks have already
packed up and left town. Is it too late for Robert Horry to declare
his candidacy?
</P>
<P>
   For sixth man of the year, if nothing else?
</P>
<P>
   It could be a hard sell in a deep field, but Horry's late push
merits at least a few ``ayes'' at the party convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers pushed their winning streak to 14 games
Friday night, as Horry scored 14 points to help rout the Indiana
Pacers 107-92 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Horry has been the Lakers' most consistent weapon off the bench
the last three weeks, and he continued the onslaught by making his
first five shots and scrapping for several loose balls, inspiring
periodic ``Horr-rry'' chants throughout the building.
</P>
<P>
   He finished 5 for 7 from the field and added four rebounds, four
assists and a Pacer-deflating swat of an Austin Croshere layup
attempt in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was Horry's second-quarter work that established the tone,
though. He scored 12 points in the quarter as the Lakers cruised to
a 17-point lead by halftime and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Lakers a game and a half ahead of the
Portland Trail Blazers and extended their home winning streak to
eight games. In beating the Pacers, they avenged a January loss at
Indiana, which snapped their previous, 16-game winning streak. The
Lakers also avoided being swept in the season series, something no
team has done this season.
</P>
<P>
   And they figured out how to beat the East's best team, their
potential opponent if they reach the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always curious to see how teams will play us,'' coach Phil
Jackson said of the possible Finals preview, ``because there's a
prevailing philosophy as to how to play a team. Everybody tries a
little something different, because we basically show people the
same thing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they showed them a lot of Shaq and Kobe again.
Shaquille O'Neal finished with 31 points and 15 rebounds in an
abbreviated, 36-minute stint, and Bryant scored 22 points. O'Neal
struggled early, finishing 13 of 28 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had a commanding 56-39 lead by halftime, having
established their dominance early in the first quarter and
capitalizing on 11 Pacer turnovers, converting them for 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored eight points in 15-0 run that established the
initial double-digit lead, and the Lakers took a 30-16 lead into
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The bench took over from there.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pacers opened the second with a 7-1 run to cut the
lead to eight, the reserves responded. A Rick Fox layup, then an
Horry 3-pointer. Then another 3 from Horry and a 3 from Brian Shaw,
a Bryant reverse jam (on an Horry feed), and an Horry turnaround
jumper, and the Lakers had a 21-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Horry was a perfect 4 for 4 from the field and 2 for 2 from the
foul line in the second.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was just 6 for 18 but finished the half with 16 points
and 10 rebounds in a mere 19 minutes of work. Bryant scored 10
points.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers' string of wins is now just two shy of matching
their earlier 16-game streak. When the previous one ended, the
Lakers confessed to overconfidence buoyed by the streak itself. And
this time?
</P>

<P>
   RUSSIA-VIGILANTE (Yekaterinburg, Russia) _ Here at the
crossroads of Asia and Europe, the supply lines of opium and heroin
out of Central and South Asia run into big population centers near
the frontier of the drug trade. A group of tough guys who have
organized themselves as a foundation called City Without Drugs, are
leading a brutal civic campaign to take the streets of
Yekaterinburg back from the drug dealers and the corrupt police who
are widely believed to be protecting them. By Patrick Tyler.

<P>
   POLICE-CRIME-RATES (New York) _ With the city's stunning drop in
crime in the 1990s, many New Yorkers have come to assume that
aggressive police tactics and crime reductions are inextricably
linked. But a look at other cities suggests that large reductions
in crime can be achieved with less reliance on the kinds of
confrontational law enforcement measures New York has used. Some
cities, notably San Diego and Boston, have recorded as big or even
larger drops in violence through strategies that rely on close
cooperation between the police and the community. By Fox
Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN (Undated) _ It is really quite impressive, all
this outrage about the anti-Catholic views of Bob Jones University.
Until campaign workers for Sen. John McCain began alerting
Michigan's Roman Catholics three weeks ago, it is questionable
whether there were enough Roman Catholics upset by anything
emanating from Bob Jones University to fill an old-fashioned
confessional. By Peter Steinfels.

   EASTCHESTER, N.Y. _ The Odyssey Diner here is one of those
old-fashioned political hangouts, where establishment pols, mostly
Republicans, gather at the counter or in a side room to hash things
out over the famous cheesecake and coffee courtesy of the affable
Doukases, who have run the place for 27 years. But the stiff
competition among the Republican candidates and the approach of the
New York primary on Tuesday have enlivened the discourse here, even
among the Doukas family. They unwittingly served up an example of
the split among Republican voters in this 336-year-old town of
mansions and Cape Cod-style homes when it comes to Gov. George W.
Bush and Sen. John McCain.

<P>
   MCCAIN-SENATE (Washington) _ At one level, John McCain has been
a model of conservative Republican orthodoxy in his 13 years in the
Senate, with a voting record close to that of Jesse Helms, who sets
the standard for Senate conservatives. McCain's career gets an 85
from the American Conservative Union, a 9 from the liberal
Americans for Democratic Action and an 89 from the National Right
to Life Committee. Helms, the dean of Senate conservatives, gets 99
from the ACU, 3 from the ADA and 99 from Right to Life. But a
Senate career is more than just showing up to vote. And a review of
McCain's record shows that, by subtler measures, his interests,
even passions, are hardly ideological. By Adam Clymer.

   REPUBS-CONGRESS (Washington) _ After a series of twists in their
favor, Republicans have improved their chances of keeping control
of the House in this year's elections, according to party leaders,
analysts and strategists from both parties. The defection of one
House Democrat, the decision of another to retire from his swing
district and the fact that fewer Republican seats will be as tough
to defend as anticipated have all contributed to the Republican
turnaround. By Lizette Alvarez.

   NBA-WORLD (Paris) _ After the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, when
millions of non-Americans were hypnotized by the artistry of Magic
Johnson, Michael Jordan and the rest of the Dream Team, the
National Basketball Association started pushing harder to make its
logo, and the superstars that populate its universe, household
images worldwide. By and large, it has succeeded. But if the NBA is
hurting a bit on the home court, many assumptions about global
growth have been cast into doubt, too. Sales of jerseys, balls and
backboards are flat, as is television audience growth, and
magazines about the NBA draw fewer readers than they used to. There
is no crisis, but the figures partly reflect the impact of the
owners' lockout that canceled 464 games last season, and they also
underscore the challenge of keeping fans who are an ocean apart
from spending their sports money elsewhere. By John Tagliabue.

   MACHINES-HUMANS (Undated) _ Recent advances in airplane design
have energized a debate among designers and industrial
psychologists about how machines should relate to their human
operators. Two different approaches _ one that is fully automated,
the other that relies on human judgment _ illustrate the knotty
issues facing researchers and designers in a variety of fields.
Highly automated machines now automatically administer drugs to
hospital patients, produce sophisticated semiconductors and operate
complex power plants, transforming technicians from machine
operators into supervisory controllers. How the human masters are
best kept ``in the loop'' so they know what the machines are doing
will ultimately affect hundreds of millions of people's lives. By

   BKC-RHODEN-COLUMN (New York) _ Last Sunday, the Rev. James
Forbes walked up to the pulpit at Riverside Church to deliver his
weekly sermon. Four police officers had been cleared in the
shooting of Amadou Diallo, emotions were raging and the
congregation was waiting to hear Forbes, the senior minister,
render a fiery perspective. But before he began, Forbes said he had
some housekeeping to do. Many had read or heard the church's name
mentioned in connection with an inquiry by the NCAA. Specifically,
the NCAA was investigating the role the Riverside Church basketball
program had played in helping Erick Barkley, a Riverside alumnus
and St. John's point guard, pay tuition to a prep school in Maine.
Before Forbes called attention to the Riverside Hawks in church
last Sunday, many members of the congregation may not have known
that there was a gym downstairs, or that the gym housed one of the
most prestigious basketball programs in the United States. By

NEW STRATEGY AT PHILIP MORRIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to make `disease' plural in 2nd sentence.)  
(bl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 4:
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker, is battling
to rehabilitate its image as part of a pariah industry. After
decades of denials, Philip Morris publicly admitted last fall that
smoking is addictive and causes cancer and other fatal diseases.
This week Steven Parrish, a senior vice president of Philip Morris,
said the company was willing to discuss some federal regulation of
tobacco. Parrish also expressed his belief, at a conference
sponsored by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse,
that nicotine is an addictive drug, although not a drug as defined
by the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason to be deeply skeptical of Philip Morris'
new stance. After all, the tobacco industry has long been
duplicitous while fighting to maintain its right to sell a
dangerous product. But that longstanding strategy may be crumbling
under the pressure of public denunciations and new legal threats
against the cigarette manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule this spring on whether the
Food and Drug Administration has regulatory authority over tobacco
under the existing federal act. Meanwhile, a Florida jury is
expected soon to decide punitive damages against the industry in a
class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of injured smokers.
Regardless of how either case is resolved, Philip Morris and other
tobacco companies will remain under intense political and
litigation pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris' shift may reflect a pragmatic judgment that it
will eventually have to accept some form of regulation and that
opening the door to negotiations now could produce a better outcome
for the company than total resistance. The company says it is
willing to work with federal regulators to define and develop a
``safer'' cigarette, remove harmful ingredients from cigarettes and
keep tobacco out of the hands of teen-agers, even if that means
fewer adults smoke in the future. But the company remains
deliberately vague about the kinds of regulations and enforcement
it will accept.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some things are changing. The company is no longer trying
to get immunity against civil lawsuits in exchange for regulation,
as was part of a 1997 proposed deal with the state attorneys
general. It is clearly worried that mounting public anger will lead
to tighter marketing restrictions, even for adults. Now that Philip
Morris is willing to talk, those concerned about the death toll
from smoking need to press Congress vigorously to give the FDA
unquestioned authority over tobacco.

EDITORIAL: A SKEWED TUITION TAX BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite 3rd graf for syntax.)  
(DW) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 4:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved an unfair education bill this week that
would give tax breaks mostly to upper-income families with children
in private schools. President Clinton vetoed a similar proposal in
1998, and he should veto this legislation when it reaches his desk.
The centerpiece of the bill, introduced by Sens. Paul Coverdell,
R-Georgia, and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., would allow families with
annual incomes of up to $150,000 to deposit up to $2,000 a year per
child in after-tax dollars into education savings accounts. The
interest earned on the accounts would be tax-free, and the money
could be used to pay for private school tuition and other
educational expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The current law allows families to set aside up to $500 a year
per child, but limits the use of the money to college costs. An
expansion to $2,000 that would include elementary and secondary
school costs would largely give affluent families a federal subsidy
for tuition they already currently pay.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme is estimated to cost the federal government $1.2
billion over five years, yet little of that would benefit
low-income families, which are not likely to have the money to set
aside and would receive a minimal tax break even if they did.
</P>
<P>
   This measure would siphon off federal revenue that could be
better spent improving public schools that educate 90 percent of
American students. It does not reduce class sizes or improve
teacher quality. Nor would it offer meaningful aid to low-income
students who might want to attend private schools, since the
subsidy is too small to cover full tuition expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders, who contend that education is one of
their top priorities, pushed hard for this idea because it is
relatively inexpensive. But it is still a wasteful tax giveaway
that offers no educational benefits and should be rejected.

HORRY SPARKS LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The campaign started a tad late, and wouldn't you
know it, the debates are over, and those CNN trucks have already
packed up and left downtown L.A. Is it too late for Robert Horry to
declare his candidacy?
</P>
<P>
   For sixth man of the year, if nothing else?
</P>
<P>
   It could be a hard sell in a deep field, but Horry's late push
merits at least a few ``ayes'' at the party convention.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, he could have won a popularity vote Friday night at
Staples Center, as he played a key role in the Los Angeles Lakers'
107-92 rout of the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal led the way with 31 points, and Kobe Bryant
pitched in 22, but it was Horry whose 14-point burst provided the
needed cushion to push the Lakers' winning streak to 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great for us,'' Bryant said of Horry's hot play the
last few weeks. ``Like I've said, I think Robert's the key to this
team, because he does so many things for us, defensively, and
offensively when he's hitting his shots, keeping the floor spread.
It keeps our bench in attack mode.''
</P>
<P>
   That was clear as Horry made his first five shots of the night,
scored 12 points in the second quarter alone and completed his
usual potpourri of contributions with four assists, four rebounds
and a big blocked shot of Austin Croshere in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   All that, and several scraps for loose balls, produced a
familiar, yet new cheer among the home crowd: ``Hor-ry!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't count, because they didn't do it like they used to
to do with Eddie (Jones). They didn't get as loud,'' Horry joked.
``But I appreciate when fans realize you're having a good game,
they acknowledge you, and I'm happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the Lakers, who won their eighth in a row at home,
maintained their 1-game lead over Portland and avenged a January
loss to the Pacers, who snapped their previous 16-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson has often said Horry could be the Lakers' key
man off the bench, but his game went wayward in January after
breaking his nose and playing with an awkward plastic mask. Jackson
said he had to ``nurse'' Horry through that period, but he's been
their best bench performer during the current winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert played real well,'' Jackson said. ``When you have a
player that brings attack or ability to score from the outside at
that position, in this offense it means you have to play the whole
floor, and you don't have a place to help from (defensively). And
that makes it even more valuable for Shaq, to have that spacing out
there. It makes the whole offense kind of click a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, with the No. 1 winning percentage in the NBA, have
now beaten the second (Portland) and third (Indiana) teams in the
same week. And in both cases, it took a big bench effort to
compensate for an off night by O'Neal (13 for 28 on Friday) and
Glen Rice (3 for 10, eight points).
</P>
<P>
   This one was put away surprisingly early. A 15-0 first-quarter
run gave the Lakers a lead they never relinquished, and they took a
56-39 lead by halftime, capitalizing on 11 Pacers turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana never recovered, as Reggie Miller went just 7 for 17 (22
points), and Jalen Rose 4 for 15 (3 points). The Pacers shot just
39.5 percent against a stiff Lakers defense.
</P>
<P>
   Horry helped there too. But about that key-to-the-team stuff ...
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jackson) has been saying that ever since day one,'' Horry
said. `I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I don't want that
pressure on me. I think the whole team is the key, not just one
player.''
</P>
<P>
   So forget that sixth-man-of-the-year candidacy too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let a couple good games make y'all put me somewhere that
I don't need to be right now, you know what I'm saying?'' Horry
said of the suggestion. ``I'm just going and doing what I need to
do. ... I'm just trying to play a little bit aggressive. My
confidence was never gone, even though they weren't falling. You've
got to still shoot the ball, and that's just the way I've been
playing.''

TRINIDAD PUMMELS REID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ If Felix Trinidad lost anything in a disappointing
performance against Oscar De La Hoya, he found it against David
Reid on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad had trouble getting to the previously undefeated WBA
junior middleweight champion in the first half of the fight. He was
losing by two points on all cards after six rounds.
</P>
<P>
   And then, with one monumental punch, all that changed.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad hurt Reid with a perfect left hook that knocked him to
the canvas and seemed to shatter his confidence in the seventh
round. From there, it got ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad battered his suddenly overmatched opponent the
remainder of the fight, cutting him badly over his right eye,
knocking him down three times in the 11th round and capturing the
championship by a one-sided decision before a crowd of 10,100 in an
outdoor arena at Caesars Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The judges scored it 114-106, 114-107 and 114-107 for Trinidad.
The Daily News had it 114-106.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the victory would have meant a rematch with De La
Hoya, who baffled Trinidad (37-0, with 30 knockouts) with his
boxing skills but blew a certain victory when he coasted in the
final rounds in their September fight.
</P>
<P>
   But De La Hoya says he plans to forsake a $20 million payday
against Trinidad and fight Shane Mosley for much less in his next
bout in June, which leaves Trinidad's immediate future uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad is expected to give up his welterweight titles and said
he'd like to unify the 154-pound titles but admitted he'd also like
to face De La Hoya again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already beat him, the world knows I beat him, but it would
be a great fight,'' said Trinidad, who also stands to make $20
million for the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Reid (14-1, seven KOs) more than held his own in the first half
of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither fighter was particularly aggressive in the
early rounds, Trinidad had trouble coping with Reid's speed and
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, the United States' only gold medalist in the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, landed his biggest punch in the third round, a straight
right that stunned Trinidad and put him on his pants. He admitted
later that he was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   However, Trinidad, who has arisen from knockdowns to destroy
other opponents on several occasions, turned the tide with another
big left in the seventh, which sent the champion reeling against
the ropes and then down.
</P>
<P>
   Reid never truly recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The cut, caused by that left hook, was a factor. The eye swelled
and blood dripped into it. That, combined with the droopy left eye
on which he's had surgery, appeared to make it very difficult for
him to see.
</P>
<P>
   However, make no mistake: It was Trinidad's ability and huge
edge in experience that presented the biggest problems for Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad stayed on top of Reid once he hurt him and never let
him breath thereafter, landing dozens of hard punches in the late
rounds as Reid struggled to survive. The 11th was a circus, with
the three knockdowns and the second of two points Trinidad lost for
low blows. (Reid lost one point.)
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing that Reid, completely outclassed in the end, lasted
12 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was in control but then I got hit with a good shot,''
he said. ``I felt he was a little bit slicker, a little more
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary bouts, Christy Martin (39-2-2, 30 KOs) rallied to
outpoint Belinda Laracuente (18-3-1, nine KOs) of Puerto Rico in an
eight-round women's bout.
</P>
<P>
   Laracuente appeared to control the fight with her speed and
athletic ability. She moved throughout the fight but consistently
beat Martin to the punch and seemed to land many more punches.
</P>
<P>
   However, the judges saw it differently, awarding the
more-aggressive Martin a majority decision.
</P>
<P>
   Martin won the final four rounds on one card and three of the
last four on two to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want a rematch. This is highway robbery,'' Laracuente
said. ``I totally felt I beat the old lady tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin criticized Laracuente for refusing to brawl with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running style didn't work for Oscar De La Hoya and it
didn't work for her,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   WBA middleweight champion William Joppy (29-1-1, 22 KOs) easily
outpointed last-minute replacement Fernando Zuniga (18-3, 14 KOs)
of Ecuador in a 10-round non-title bout.

   LOS ANGELES _ When the primaries or caucuses came one at a time
_ like Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan _ it was
easy to tell whether Gov. George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain was up
or down. And even when there were three contests last Tuesday,
figuring out who was up was easy because one candidate, Bush, swept
Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be so simple this Tuesday, with 13 Republican
contests. Tuesday is the biggest and most important single day of
the primary season. And, perhaps, the most confusing. Consider the
possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   Bush Triumph
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is the top Republican vote-getter in California, he will
capture all of that state's delegates _ the largest trove of any
state. He is well ahead in the polls there. If he also wins New
York, where he and McCain are neck and neck in the polls, Bush
would have won the two biggest prizes. If Bush wins Ohio, the third
big prize, he would be unstoppable in his march to the nomination.
The bonus would be if Bush also won Georgia and other states where
he leads in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   California Dreaming
</P>
<P>
   The dream scenario in Austin: Bush wins the states above but
also beats McCain in California's ``beauty contest'' _ surpassing
him in the popular vote among Republicans, independents and
Democrats. Only Republican votes count toward delegates, but if
McCain does not prevail with those other voters, he would be hard
pressed to make the case that he would be the most broadly
appealing nominee in the general election. McCain's advisers have
given up hope of winning the delegates in California. But they
argue that if McCain wins the popular vote _ especially finishing
ahead of Al Gore and Bill Bradley _ that would at least assure him
bragging rights for another week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain Triumph
</P>
<P>
   The one safe bet among McCain's advisers is that he will sweep
New England, where voters tend to be more moderate _ and more
disposed to an insurgent. His camp's best hope is that he could
claim victory by winning Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island and
Vermont plus New York and the beauty contest in California. If
McCain could rack up those victories, and also win in Ohio, the
senator would make it a real race. In Ohio, Democrats and
independents can vote in the Republican primary, but Democrats have
their own primary and many may not cross over to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed Verdict _ or the Big Muddle
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wins, say, the delegates in California, but McCain
triumphs in New York, they could each claim an important victory.
Then the candidate who captures Ohio could declare himself as
having the edge. But what if Bush wins California and New York, but
McCain triumphs in Ohio, Missouri and New England? Given McCain's
victory in Michigan, he could then claim that he was the only
vote-getter in the Midwest, a critical battleground in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Far-Fetched _ But You Never Know
</P>
<P>
   Pundits and pollsters have been confounded at every turn. So no
possibility can be dismissed. Take Georgia, the only Southern state
up for grabs. It is assumed to be another conservative fire wall
for Bush, as was South Carolina. But the race is open to all
voters. What if McCain's independent appeal stirs moderates? Bush
could always prevail in Connecticut, where he was born and where
his grandfather was a U.S. senator. But polls show that many voters
in that fairly moderate state find McCain most appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Race
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley are also on ballots in 16 states Tuesday.
Bradley insists that March 7 is his ``takeoff'' day. But polls show
him way down everywhere _ barely ahead of Alan Keyes in the popular
vote in California. The one state where Bradley may be a bit of a
factor is his childhood state of Missouri. The primary is open to
all registered voters, though Bush is well ahead in the polls. For
all the talk of taking off, what Bradley really is hoping for is a
miracle _ somewhere, anywhere.

<P>
   Several days into the 1992 Los Angeles riots, as exhausted
police officers on 12-hour shifts had just about restored order, a
patrol supervisor walked into the Rampart District station house
and encountered a scene that made him angry.
</P>
<P>
   Every member of the precinct's Crash unit, an elite and
secretive anti-gang squad of more than a dozen men, was playing
cards or working out. So he complained to his boss. Two days later
his tires were slashed, and someone confronted him about tattling
on the officers of Crash (the acronym for Community Resources
Against Street Hoodlums). The officer replaced the tires and they
were slashed again. The message, of course, was clear. Anyone who
meddled with this squad would pay a price.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was an example of the Crash culture that fostered
such widespread corruption that the Los Angeles Police Department
moved to disband all of the units last week.
</P>
<P>
   It came just a week after four New York City police officers
from a special squad called the Street Crime Unit were acquitted in
the death of Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-old street peddler killed in
a barrage of 41 bullets as he stood, unarmed, outside his apartment
building in the Bronx last year. Critics have accused the Street
Crime Unit of promoting a reckless, cowboy culture that is separate
from the rest of the New York Police Department. Its unofficial
slogan is ``We own the night.''
</P>
<P>
   But where the New York unit may have been reckless, the Crash
members at the Rampart precinct were almost certainly premeditated
criminals, according to a chilling 362-page report released last
week by the Los Angeles Police Department. They committed
widespread perjury, stole and dealt in illegal drugs. They even
shot a handcuffed and unarmed man in the head. When he survived,
they testified against him and he was sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that the Street Crime Unit was engaged in
any such lawlessness in New York City. Still, critics say that
these units frequently develop problems like those in Los Angeles
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``These specialized units need very close supervision,'' said
Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of
Nebraska at Omaha. ``They're just a thousand disasters waiting to
happen. They loosen the bonds of supervision, and it's an
invitation to trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who has written a book on civilian oversight of police
departments that is to be published in the fall, said there is a
long history of problems with special units, ``whether it's vice
units in the old days, or street-crime units or gang units.''
Systemic corruption in New York City's vice squad, for instance,
was brought to light by Frank Serpico, an undercover detective, in
the 1970s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current troubles in Los Angeles and New York are vastly
different in scale, but there is an important similarity, Walker
said. ``In both cases, the real problem is with the political
message they get: Get out there, get tough and get results, and
we're not gonna ask questions about how you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And in both cities, he said, the reactions of the mayors have
been weak. ``In New York and Los Angeles, there's sort of this
`drop dead' attitude _ `Go away. We don't have any problems.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Diallo shooting last year, the Street Crime Unit,
which had operated from a headquarters on Randall's Island, has
been reorganized and its members have been placed under the
supervision of local police commanders throughout the city. The
unit had been established in an attempt to combat the high rate of
violent crimes like rape, robbery and murder, and by all accounts
it did just that. But the drop in crime came at a price. Thousands
of innocent people, mostly minorities, were stopped and questioned,
frisked and even arrested by the unit's officers, who dressed
casually in street clothes and rode around in unmarked cars.
Officers joined the unit by volunteering, a practice that, some
critics say, can draw in less mature officers.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the Street Crime Unit last year, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said that the ``unfortunate truth is that
communities of color are disproportionately victimized by violent
street crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles anti-gang units operated out of local police
stations, but they had little interaction with their colleagues.
The Crash officers at the Rampart Division even wore unique jackets
and had special patches; some of them got identical tattoos. They
were so exclusive and stand-offish that regular officers and
supervisors eventually avoided having much involvement with them,
even when calling for backup, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether the problems extend to the Crash
units outside the Rampart area, said Zev Yaroslavsky, a Los Angeles
County commissioner. But it is clear, he said, that the practices
of the Rampart Crash Unit were well known among many officers in
other locations. ``People all over the place were trying to get
into this unit,'' Yaroslavsky said. But officers could join only if
they were sponsored by someone already in the unit. ``To get into
Rampart Crash, you had to pledge like a fraternity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate result of the Crash scandal will be a serious
undermining of the criminal justice system in Los Angeles and
elsewhere, Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick Bobb, a special counsel to Los Angeles County on police
matters, said last week's report indicates that the Rampart squad
was ``essentially a lawless unit.'' The problems in New York are
different, he said. But the combination of the Diallo shooting and
the attack on Abner Louima, who was assaulted by police officers in
a station house bathroom in New York, as well as the Rodney King
beating and the current scandal in Los Angeles, have ``revived
interest in the question of how we police and what the most
effective methods of civilian oversight are.''

<P>
   LONDON _ A very English debate broke out six years ago in the
letters page of The Times of London over the legacy of one Anthony
Chenevix-Trench, the headmaster of Eton College from 1964 to 1970.
When he was drunk, which was quite often, Chenevix-Trench had an
unpleasant habit of beating the students with a savagery unusual
even by Eton standards, and then sobbing penitentially afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, a number of his old pupils didn't seem to hold it
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hourmouzios, for example, reminisced to The Times
that the headmaster ``once flogged the living daylights out of me
with a strap on my bare backside'' and went on to beat all 21
students in a divinity class in a single afternoon. ``However, this
rather Victorian figure who believed in the value of corporal
punishment,'' Hourmouzios noted, ``was a fine teacher who taught me
Latin.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many European countries have wrestled with the
question of corporal punishment, with some even making it illegal
for parents to hit their children. Such proposals are heard here
too, without much chance of success. Although the British finally
outlawed the classic practice of caning, beating and flogging in
independent schools last year, the debate over hitting in the home
has been partly colored by the legacy of beatings some lawmakers
received during their school days _ at times from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Many Britons in public life today, for instance, have recalled
being flogged by Douglas Hurd, Margaret Thatcher's foreign
secretary, a notoriously avid doler-of-punishments who was known at
Eton as ``Hitler Hurd.'' Sometimes caning is almost mentioned as a
mark of pride, a rite of passage completed. It is not a coincidence
that the French call spanking among adults ``le vice Anglais,''
recognizing that it is one offshoot of a society where authority
and love were once linked with childhood violence, pain and
stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last century, no one seriously tried to change
the system. In the last 20 years, though, politicians began to
realize that the state could no longer sanction such behavior, at
least not in schools. In 1986, corporal punishment was outlawed in
state schools _ by just one vote in the House of Commons. In 1999,
after an impassioned debate in which a number of legislators
recalled how they had been beaten as schoolchildren, and quite
right, too, it was finally outlawed in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has now shifted to corporal punishment in the home,
with the Labor government trying to rewrite the law to set out
exactly what constitutes acceptable hitting. The current law, which
dates back to Victorian times, was recently thrown into limbo when
the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it had failed to
protect a young British boy from ``inhuman or degrading
punishment'' by his stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Corporal punishment of children is now illegal in eight European
countries, including Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Latvia. But in
Britain, the Labor government says it will not take that road,
pointing to a number of surveys in which Britons have
overwhelmingly said they supported the right of parents to hit
their children. ``There is a common-sense distinction to be made
between the sort of mild physical rebuke which occurs in families
and which most loving parents consider acceptable, and the beating
of children,'' the government said in a position paper.
</P>

Evelyn Waugh's son, were flogged constantly for offenses like
stealing coal for the fireplaces in their freezing bedrooms.

getting beaten all the time,'' Chancellor said of Waugh, now editor

study on several occasions for what was then called ``six of the

from the wall, throw one at me, we would fence (he was an expert
swordsman) and the proposed beating would be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Matthew Thompson-Royds missed the Chenevix-Trench
era but didn't avoid being beaten. ``Mercifully, my punishment was
carried out by `Leggy' Lambert, the lower master,'' in the 1950s,
he wrote. Still, he seemed sorry to have lived before the era of
human-rights courts.

at Eton obtained full compensation?'' he asked.

<P>
   LONDON _ A very English debate broke out six years ago in the
letters page of The Times of London over the legacy of one Anthony
Chenevix-Trench, the headmaster of Eton College from 1964 to 1970.
When he was drunk, which was quite often, Chenevix-Trench had an
unpleasant habit of beating the students with a savagery unusual
even by Eton standards, and then sobbing penitentially afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, a number of his old pupils didn't seem to hold it
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hourmouzios, for example, reminisced to The Times
that the headmaster ``once flogged the living daylights out of me
with a strap on my bare backside'' and went on to beat all 21
students in a divinity class in a single afternoon. ``However, this
rather Victorian figure who believed in the value of corporal
punishment,'' Hourmouzios noted, ``was a fine teacher who taught me
Latin.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many European countries have wrestled with the
question of corporal punishment, with some even making it illegal
for parents to hit their children. Such proposals are heard here
too, without much chance of success. Although the British finally
outlawed the classic practice of caning, beating and flogging in
independent schools last year, the debate over hitting in the home
has been partly colored by the legacy of beatings some lawmakers
received during their school days _ at times from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Many Britons in public life today, for instance, have recalled
being flogged by Douglas Hurd, Margaret Thatcher's foreign
secretary, a notoriously avid doler-of-punishments who was known at
Eton as ``Hitler Hurd.'' Sometimes caning is almost mentioned as a
mark of pride, a rite of passage completed. It is not a coincidence
that the French call spanking among adults ``le vice Anglais,''
recognizing that it is one offshoot of a society where authority
and love were once linked with childhood violence, pain and
stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last century, no one seriously tried to change
the system. In the last 20 years, though, politicians began to
realize that the state could no longer sanction such behavior, at
least not in schools. In 1986, corporal punishment was outlawed in
state schools _ by just one vote in the House of Commons. In 1999,
after an impassioned debate in which a number of legislators
recalled how they had been beaten as schoolchildren, and quite
right, too, it was finally outlawed in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has now shifted to corporal punishment in the home,
with the Labor government trying to rewrite the law to set out
exactly what constitutes acceptable hitting. The current law, which
dates back to Victorian times, was recently thrown into limbo when
the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it had failed to
protect a young British boy from ``inhuman or degrading
punishment'' by his stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Corporal punishment of children is now illegal in eight European
countries, including Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Latvia. But in
Britain, the Labor government says it will not take that road,
pointing to a number of surveys in which Britons have
overwhelmingly said they supported the right of parents to hit
their children. ``There is a common-sense distinction to be made
between the sort of mild physical rebuke which occurs in families
and which most loving parents consider acceptable, and the beating
of children,'' the government said in a position paper.
</P>
<P>
   But Children Are Unbeatable, a coalition of more than 200
organizations from children's charities to groups representing
adults who were beaten as children, vehemently disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that everyone who hits a child is a bad
parent,'' said Elizabeth Garrett, a leader of Barnardo's, a
children's advocacy group. ``We're saying that everyone in society
has to consider how they may be condoning violence against children

   This is, in fashion parlance, a major shoe moment. There are
shoe refrigerator magnets, charm bracelets, earrings, key rings and
cards _ and that's in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art's
gift shops alone. Over the past three years, no fewer than a dozen
books on shoes have appeared. And most of the shoe effigies and
lore reflect what's afoot _ namely, high heels, the more risque the
better. Women are buying them as never before. And wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   In last month's Vogue, Marina Rust, a contributing editor,
described a pair of ``spiked'' sandals with black ankle feathers as
``Winged Victory, the disco version,'' and said she displayed one
on her hall table as art. ``After Marcel Duchamp's `ready-mades,'''
said Patricia Garland, conservator of paintings at the Yale Gallery
of Art, referring to Dadaists' iconization of shovels and urinals,
``anything could be art. Who's to say that a shoe is not a piece of
sculpture?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not the women who have made Manolo Blahnik's black
``halter back'' heels, nearly 3 inches high and $425 a pair, the
best-selling item on Nieman-Marcus' Web site. And 4-inch styles,
some even costlier, are selling briskly, too. Obviously, when price
is no object, heel height is no problem. One can be chauffeured.
But even women of a more pedestrian bent are buying the look. Mary
Trasko, director of public relations and special projects for the
mass market shoemaker Nina and author of ``Heavenly Soles''
(Abbeville Press, 1989), said, ``It's happening at the low price
point, too, in department stores all around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed desire of women from all walks of life to teeter
around in leather and steel structures that even a longtime shoe
maven like Garland can't relate to _ ``I'm not going to wear shoes
I have to squeeze my foot into like a wicked stepsister no matter
how much I love them,'' she said _ has as much to do with altitude
as attitude. When Hamlet, referring to the platform shoe of his
day, said to the Player-Queen, ``Your ladyship is nearer to heaven
than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine,'' he was
undoubtedly responding to the psychologically, as well as visually,
elevating effect.
</P>
<P>
   But if stature were the only issue, society would still be mired
in the 1990s platform moment. Professional women, it seems, have
discovered what customers of Frederick's of Hollywood have long
understood. ``Sexual appeal is power because it is a way to get
people to do what you want,'' said Valerie Steele, chief curator of
the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who wrote
``Shoes: A Lexicon of Style'' (Rizzoli, 1999). ``And high heels are
the prime symbol of erotic femininity.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because they inspire simultaneous fantasies of
vulnerability (who can run in them?) and of the heel as weapon.
They are a gal's version of a guy thing: the female power tool. Or,
as Freud put it: ``The fetish-like reverence for the feminine foot
and shoe seems to take the foot only as a substitutive symbol for
the once revered and since then missed member of the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sort of power figures in the rise of the heel _ star
power. American culture anthropomorphizes certain products,
investing them with personality and charisma, which makes them more
marketable. The right designer's name, via word of mouth or
advertising, becomes synonymous with the object itself. The hip set
once went forth shod in their Guccis and wearing their Calvins. Now
the cognoscenti say ``Manolos.'' The persona of Blahnik, whose shoe
career embraced the stiletto in the 1970s, pervades his shoes, and
the objects transcend mere appareldom. Or as Diane von Furstenberg
said in last month's In Style, describing her relationship with her
400 pairs of shoes: ``The things in your closet are like friends.
You have old friends, new friends, friends you forget about,
friends you neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is doubtful that Manolos will rival Kleenex as a
catch-phrase. Fashion is nothing if not fickle. Christian
Louboutin, he of the irresistible soles (all of them red), has
arrived. ``A woman carries her clothes,'' Louboutin said, ``but
it's her shoes which carry the woman.'' To him, comfort is
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the kinder heel. The new power trip selling to women is
that they can now stride, as opposed to mince painfully along, in
glamorous shoes. The most popular Louboutin shoes are two and a
half to three inches high. Nina's ``Comfort Collection'' also
promises high style with lower heels. Embellishments like beading
make these shoes more romantic than seductive, more How to Make an
American Quilt than Story of O. ``It's all about femininity now,''
said Dana Christy, fashion director for accessories and intimate
apparel at Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   So it appears _ but not to Patricia Garland, who sees shoes,
regardless of how they're packaged, as a substitute for a car. ``I
don't know any women who get off on cars like men do,'' she said,
``so for women, shoes are a way to express your personality.'' Or
your various drives _ which even in this post-Freudian moment is
still basically what it's all about.

   LOS ANGELES _ Real scandals often require not just scandalous
facts, but a trigger, a nettlesome event, to activate public
outrage. In Los Angeles, for example, a police corruption scandal
in which officers brutalized, framed and, in at least two cases,
shot innocent people has suddenly erupted after quietly simmering
for five months.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the triggers, in this case, may have been a
proposed bond offering.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan is nothing if not fiscally responsible,
and so he broke his near silence on the police scandal three weeks
ago, not in response to more disclosures of abuse, but to announce
that he had a plan to cover its costs. Legal experts have warned
that civil suits by the victims could cost the city more than $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor suggested that the city take the money it expects as
its share of the national tobacco settlement _ more than $300
million over the next 25 years _ and use it to finance an offering
of bonds. This would net the city a little more than $90 million
right away. The problem was that the mayor had already proposed
that the windfall be used mostly to help the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's plan, which he offered at a press conference, was
intended to insure that the country's second-largest city would not
go bankrupt in a sea of lawsuits for monetary damages. But rather
than reassure people the announcement has catalyzed public outrage
against the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, the police officers union defied the
department's chief and demanded an independent investigation of the
widespread abuses, the FBI and the U.S. attorney announced separate
criminal investigations, and the City Council narrowly voted down a
motion to begin its own investigation of the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost issue began to really cause serious alarm among a lot
of people,'' said Joel Wachs, the city council member and mayoral
candidate who made the motion. ``Absolutely, that was the
catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramona Ripston, the executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union office here, had been advocating such an outside
investigation since September, and had little support until now.
The bonds, she said, sobered up people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was more concerned with the money aspects of this
than the moral or ethical aspects, but suddenly when the city
realized this was going to cost so much, people finally began to
focus,'' Ripston said. ``We had no real supporters outside our
little group'' until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups for the disabled were outraged that financing
promised them would be taken away, but the mayor has since assured
them he will get the money from elsewhere. This only means, of
course, that someone else will have to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is going to lose their money and it doesn't seem
fair,'' said John Whitbread of the Westside Center for Independent
Living. ``Everybody's nervous.''

and so he broke his near silence on the police scandal three weeks
ago, not in response to more disclosures of abuse, but to announce
that he had a plan to cover its costs. Legal experts have warned
that civil suits by the victims could cost the city more than $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor suggested that the city take the money it expects as
its share of the national tobacco settlement _ more than $300
million over the next 25 years _ and use it to finance an offering
of bonds. This would net the city a little more than $90 million
right away. The problem was that the mayor had already proposed
that the windfall be used mostly to help the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's plan, which he offered at a press conference, was
intended to insure that the country's second-largest city would not
go bankrupt in a sea of lawsuits for monetary damages. But rather
than reassure people the announcement has catalyzed public outrage
against the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, the police officers union defied the
department's chief and demanded an independent investigation of the
widespread abuses, the FBI and the U.S. attorney announced separate
criminal investigations, and the City Council narrowly voted down a
motion to begin its own investigation of the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost issue began to really cause serious alarm among a lot
of people,'' said Joel Wachs, the city council member and mayoral
candidate who made the motion. ``Absolutely, that was the
catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramona Ripston, the executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union office here, had been advocating such an outside
investigation since September, and had little support until now.
The bonds, she said, sobered up people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was more concerned with the money aspects of this
than the moral or ethical aspects, but suddenly when the city
realized this was going to cost so much, people finally began to
focus,'' Ripston said. ``We had no real supporters outside our
little group'' until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups for the disabled were outraged that financing
promised them would be taken away, but the mayor has since assured
them he will get the money from elsewhere. This only means, of
course, that someone else will have to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is going to lose their money and it doesn't seem
fair,'' said John Whitbread of the Westside Center for Independent
Living. ``Everybody's nervous.''

<P>
   Even as a jet whisked Gen. Augusto Pinochet home to Chile last
week from Britain, ending the prospect of his trial in a foreign
land, a determined alliance of human rights advocates and victims
of his military regime redoubled their efforts to gather new
details of atrocities committed when he ruled Chile in the 1970s
and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt goes on wherever his junta's victims are scattered _ in
Chile, the United States, Spain and elsewhere _ accelerated by the
Internet. The general's critics in Chile feel that large gaps still
exist in what is known about the Pinochet years, and that filling
them represents the key to achieving reconciliation and redemption
for their country's reconstituted democracy.
</P>
<P>
   With the general now home, each new fact to emerge also gives
hope to critics who want to place him in the dock in Chile; to do
that, they will have to get an appeals court to revoke an immunity
granted when he stepped down as president in 1990. For Americans,
the Chileans' quest does something else: it raises questions about
one of the largest gaps in knowledge, involving America's own role
in the Pinochet years.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton has launched an ambitious
project to declassify U.S. records relating to abuses during the
Pinochet era. For more than a year, U.S. government agencies that
worked with Chile have been reviewing their files and slowly
revealing the degree of U.S. knowledge about the contours and
gruesome details of the machinery that killed democracy for a
generation of Chileans. So far, 6,900 documents have been released
and can be seen on the Internet (www.state.gov/foia); thousands
more are due in June.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of U.S. efforts to oust Chile's Socialist
president, Salvador Allende, emerged in Senate intelligence
committee hearings in the 1970s, but the full extent of U.S.
involvement with the junta that replaced him in a 1973 coup remains
shrouded in secrecy. A number of the documents now surfacing were
released in earlier years, but in a form so heavily censored that
their meanings were distorted.
</P>
<P>
   A handful describe Operation Condor, a plan by U.S.-backed
military regimes in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil and
Bolivia to track down and kill leftists, union organizers and
opposition figures. Others describe campaigns of state terror and
the arrest of thousands of political activists. One State
Department cable forwards a request from the Chilean military days
after it seized power, seeking somebody who could help set up
concentration camps for political prisoners. (Washington sent
blankets instead.)
</P>
<P>
   A declassified Defense Intelligence Agency report describes how
Chilean agents created public fear to win support for the junta's
brutality: intelligence agents took hostages and kidnapped an
extreme rightist, and a far-right group that once received funds
from the CIA planted bombs and blamed Marxists.
</P>
<P>
   Among these documents are two internal State Department
inquiries in 1976 that blame Chile's military for the deaths of two
Americans, Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, who were arrested and
executed. The inquiries suggest a possible CIA role in the slaying
of Horman, which was dramatized in the 1982 movie ``Missing.'' The
CIA has not released its records on the killings, saying it will do
so in June, but strongly denies responsibility for Horman's death.
</P>
<P>
   Another document the State Department declassified, titled
``Declaration of an Agent of the DINA'' (the most feared branch of
the secret police), is a confession by a government killer, Juan
Rene Munoz Alarcon. It details the location of mass graves for
leftists _ 345 people at two spots in Santiago, another 112 at
Colonia Dignidad, a secretive German colony in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz also describes the workings of a death squad, naming the
artillery captain who heads it, and its cooperation with security
services in Argentina and Uruguay to hunt down leftist activists _
``all of it permitted by the president of the republic, who is the
direct chief of this entire area.'' He names CIA officials in
Santiago, saying they were ``very important.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his wrenching confession, Munoz says he knows his
honesty will cost him his life, and in a note at the bottom we
learn that he was indeed assassinated two months later.
</P>
<P>
   One 1978 memo from Robert Pastor, a National Security Council
official in the Carter administration, to Zbigniew Brzezinski, then
head of the National Security Council, involves an investigation
into the killing in 1976 of Chile's former defense minister,
Orlando Letelier, and Ronni Moffitt, his American aide, in
Washington in a three-country operation attributed to Condor.
</P>
<P>
   The memo quotes George Landau, then the U.S. ambassador to
Chile, as saying there was no way the colonel who orchestrated the
killing would have done so without informing Pinochet, ``with whom
he had breakfast almost every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   If such pages from Chile's grim past are important to Chile's
victims, they also hold lessons for Americans: Facing questions in
Congress about the assassinations, Pastor notes that Landau had
spoken to ``many people in the State Department'' and was
``prepared to offer a sanitized version of this to Senator ((Edward
M.)) Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the years, the secrecy suggested by Landau's offer to
``sanitize'' the truth has not completely ended. While the State
Department has been the most forthcoming in releasing its records,
other agencies have held out. Key files remain classified,
including CIA documents on Horman and the agency; FBI and Defense
Department documents on Teruggi, and many records about Letelier
case.
</P>
<P>
   Another gap in the public record involves Henry Kissinger, the
impresario of foreign policy in the Nixon and Ford years. He has
declared his papers personal and had them sealed until five years
after his death.
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Archive, a group that has pressed to open
the Chile files, has listed scores of documents not yet made public
on covert efforts to foment a coup while Allende was in office.
Hundreds more, including 175 cables sent from Santiago to
Washington the day after the coup in which Allende died, were sent
by President Richard M. Nixon's' library to the review panel, but
have not been made public. Peter Kornbluh of the National Security
Archive and others argue that given the long history of
Washington's support for Latin American militaries, Americans need
to understand what happened in Chile. ``It's really about the
American public's right to know what was done in their name,
without their knowledge,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ Forty years and 10 presidential elections ago, John
F. Kennedy felt compelled to journey to a hostile conference of
Protestant church leaders in Houston to plead that he would never
serve as a vassal of the pope if he were elected the nation's first
Catholic president.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ignominious moment for many of Kennedy's fellow
American Catholics as the candidate, a decorated war veteran, had
to pass Protestant muster and deal with the dregs of
anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic bigotry rooted in the nativist
prejudices of the 19th century Know-Nothing movement, when native
born Protestants demanded voting, citizenship and education curbs
on the alarming waves of Catholic immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In weathering the fire and winning the election, Kennedy gently
cautioned the nation to oppose any attempt to distort the
presidency by ``making it an instrument of one religious group.''
His words survive as a prescription for all the nimble campaigners
who have followed him through the risky, often treacherous field
where politics and religion overlap.
</P>
<P>
   This year, spurred by an unexpectedly contentious Republican
primary, the nation is witnessing a 180-degree turn on the historic
Kennedy confrontation. This time, it is a worried Protestant
candidate from Texas, Gov. George W. Bush, who is now daily seeking
out Catholic forums and photo ops, replete with church banners and
Roman-collared clerics, to assure one and all his presidency would
not be an instrument of a dominant religious group _ evangelical
Protestantism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that a neat little parallel _ a nervous George Bush
trying to reassure Catholics?'' observed Kate O'Beirne, the
Washington editor for The National Review. She is less amused by
Sen. John McCain's wielding of the religion issue in his
tooth-and-claw nomination struggle with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rare Catholic who even cares about Bob Jones
University,'' O'Beirne said of the South Carolina evangelical
college that McCain has strategically lambasted as an anti-Catholic
bastion happily visited by Bush. ``It's shameless Catholic
baiting,'' said O'Beirne, predicting a backlash of sorts against
McCain among the significant blocs of Catholic voters expected to
turn out this week in the mammoth Super Tuesday primary showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Whether McCain wins or loses, it is clear he has let a
red-white-and-blue genie out of the bottle and its recorking seems
unlikely during the general election campaign this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, fairly leering in delight, are recording every sling
and arrow exchanged in the Republican primary. And for good reason.
It was only six years ago that the Newt Gingrich revolution in the
House alarmed Democrats with the fact that a Catholic majority of
voters had shifted for the first time in decades from Democrats to
Republicans on the House ballot. Before that, Catholics had split
their ticket, voting, say, for President Ronald Reagan but then
returning to their lunch-pail party roots.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans' painful disarray over the role of the
religious right _ a bloc that Reagan first tucked masterfully into
the GOP fold _ is giving Capitol Hill Democrats new hope. In the
House, the McCain attack has caused Democrats to revive an earlier,
largely overlooked flap in which charges of anti-Catholicism marred
a bipartisan attempt to choose a new chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Democrats, hoping to sting Republicans in open
floor debate, quickly offered broadside resolutions condemning Bob
Jones University as segregationist and _ 40 years after Kennedy _
even anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one question of value that will outlast the
primaries,'' promised Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who runs his
party's Senate political operation. ``People are going to want to
be heard on this, the possible alienation of Catholics just when
many thought they were part of the Establishment,'' the senator
added, contending that Bush would be tarred with the issue into the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, think that McCain ``went one day too far'' with
his attack, in the words of Scott Appleby, a history professor at
Notre Dame University. He noted that McCain used the word ``evil''
in a follow-up attack on the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson,
two politico-evangelical stalwarts, but then quickly had to retract
it.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby, the director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of
American Catholicism, feels McCain ``is failing to tap into a
deeper level'' of Catholic fear that is more a relic of history
than descriptive of modern Catholics, who are not monolithic voters
unless faced by an appalling instance of anti-Catholic bigotry.
Bush just does not fill the bill, Appleby thinks.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, too, that it was only after McCain was
defeated in South Carolina and headed for states with broader, more
diverse voter blocs, that he threw down the religious glove and
singled out Robertson and Falwell as ``agents of intolerance,''
betting that the muscle of the religious right has withered since
Reagan blended it into a coalition with post-Kennedy, blue-collar
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, McCain first denied, then confirmed that his
campaign phone-blitzed Catholic voters with reminders of Bush's Bob
Jones appearance and of the school's policy against interracial
dating, which it reversed Friday, and its history of anti-Catholic
polemics, including descriptions of the Vatican as running a
``Satanic system.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was, in some sense, merely stealing from the religious
attack playbook of the Bush campaign in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was some of the worst of American politics I've seen,'' the
political columnist Mark Shields said of attacks by pro-Bush
organizations on McCain, in which some observers sensed wisps of
anti-Semitism and other insults to pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is how the McCain initiative will play out
Tuesday in states like Ohio and New York, where there are
significant numbers of voters who consider themselves Catholic.
Will the bloc fears of the old post-immigration generation revive?

It was only six years ago that the Newt Gingrich revolution in the
House alarmed Democrats with the fact that a Catholic majority of
voters had shifted for the first time in decades from Democrats to
Republicans on the House ballot. Before that, Catholics had split
their ticket, voting, say, for President Ronald Reagan but then
returning to their lunch-pail party roots.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans' painful disarray over the role of the
religious right _ a bloc that Reagan first tucked masterfully into
the GOP fold _ is giving Capitol Hill Democrats new hope. In the
House, the McCain attack has caused Democrats to revive an earlier,
largely overlooked flap in which charges of anti-Catholicism marred
a bipartisan attempt to choose a new chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Democrats, hoping to sting Republicans in open
floor debate, quickly offered broadside resolutions condemning Bob
Jones University as segregationist and _ 40 years after Kennedy _
even anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one question of value that will outlast the
primaries,'' promised Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who runs his
party's Senate political operation. ``People are going to want to
be heard on this, the possible alienation of Catholics just when
many thought they were part of the Establishment,'' the senator
added, contending that Bush would be tarred with the issue into the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, think that McCain ``went one day too far'' with
his attack, in the words of Scott Appleby, a history professor at
Notre Dame University. He noted that McCain used the word ``evil''
in a follow-up attack on the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson,
two politico-evangelical stalwarts, but then quickly had to retract
it.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby, the director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of
American Catholicism, feels McCain ``is failing to tap into a
deeper level'' of Catholic fear that is more a relic of history
than descriptive of modern Catholics, who are not monolithic voters
unless faced by an appalling instance of anti-Catholic bigotry.
Bush just does not fill the bill, Appleby thinks.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, too, that it was only after McCain was
defeated in South Carolina and headed for states with broader, more
diverse voter blocs, that he threw down the religious glove and
singled out Robertson and Falwell as ``agents of intolerance,''
betting that the muscle of the religious right has withered since
Reagan blended it into a coalition with post-Kennedy, blue-collar
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, McCain first denied, then confirmed that his
campaign phone-blitzed Catholic voters with reminders of Bush's Bob
Jones appearance and of the school's policy against interracial
dating, which it reversed Friday, and its history of anti-Catholic
polemics, including descriptions of the Vatican as running a
``Satanic system.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was, in some sense, merely stealing from the religious
attack playbook of the Bush campaign in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was some of the worst of American politics I've seen,'' the
political columnist Mark Shields said of attacks by pro-Bush
organizations on McCain, in which some observers sensed wisps of
anti-Semitism and other insults to pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is how the McCain initiative will play out
Tuesday in states like Ohio and New York, where there are
significant numbers of voters who consider themselves Catholic.
Will the bloc fears of the old post-immigration generation revive?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, as other states, Catholics may be increasingly uneasy
about the Bob Jones reports, says John C. Green, director of the
Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. But
he emphasizes that Protestant evangelicals also see the issue as an
attack on them and not, as McCain insists, solely on two performers
on the nation's politico-religion circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, exit polls in Virginia and interviews with many voters
who identify themselves as religious conservatives suggest that
McCain's remarks are mobilizing support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the issue of religion, as ever in American history,
is putting as much fresh life into primary day as into the Bush
campaign. ``The running joke here,'' Green said, ``is whether
Governor Bush will join the Knights of Columbus by primary day.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quinn, a veteran New York political speechwriter and
historical novelist, said: ``McCain is blowing on some old embers
and causing some smoke, but no real fire. I don't think George Bush
is seen as anti-Catholic.'' Still, Quinn admitted he was intrigued
by how much the Catholic vote might resonate Tuesday with Kennedy's
trial by dogma before the Protestant prelates.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect of McCain's attacks on the religious right were
``politically disastrous,'' in the view of Shields. ``He failed to
distinguish the followers from the leadership, implying they'd been
bamboozled,'' he said. ``And in politics you never blame the
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond questions of strategic advantage in the electoral wars,
there lies the large gray area where voters' impressions of
personal and civic morality overlap. There, the rancorous butting
of politics and religion itself can become an issue as much as a
spectacle for the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Green of the University of Akron sounded decidedly unalarmed
about this instance of boundary crossing. Whether in the year 2000
or 1900, ``this is what campaigns do: they look for appeals that
will work and look for groups that will move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that this election cycle ``has an unusual amount of
explicit references to religion.'' He pointed to the early and
emphatic statements of Christian faith from Bush, Vice President Al
Gore and many of their rivals. He thinks this may be due to voters,
who are looking beyond the booming economy to wonder whether a
rapidly changing culture, regularly troubled by news of its own
lack of control, as seen in a lurid ongoing melange of shootings
and scandal-ridden leaders, demands more avowedly moral politics
and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly are out there now on the stump. They are talking
beliefs and charging hypocrisy, looking for advantage while
promising the high road to voters already sensing the risk, amid
the spectacle of once more mixing politics and religion.

<P>
   Last week Gov. George W. Bush apologized repeatedly for his
appearance at Bob Jones University, which rejects Roman Catholicism
and, until Friday, banned interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   On its Internet site, the university was unapologetic. Here are
excerpts from a statement earlier last week titled, ``The Truth
About Bob Jones University.''
</P>
<P>
   On Interracial Dating
</P>
<P>
   If there is discrimination in the policy, which race is
discriminated against? Black, white or yellow? Each person dates
within his own race. For there to be discrimination, one race would
have to be treated differently from the other. . . .
</P>
<P>
   At the Tower of Babel, God used language to disrupt man's plans
for a one-world government. As a result of this disruption, the
people were scattered and the races were polarized. One thing is
clear: God wanted a divided world, not a federalized world. Based
on this biblical account (Genesis 10 and 11), the University wishes
to give God the benefit of any doubt and avoid pursuing any
direction that would give assistance to the renewed efforts of man
to create a one-world community consisting of one religion, one
economy, one government and one race. The biblical account of Babel
and God's response to it are historical fact. This Christian
institution merely seeks to live and function under its best
understanding of what God is teaching us from this passage about
His purposes for the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Catholicism
</P>
<P>
   If there are those who charge us with being opposed to the
doctrines and theology of the Catholic church, we plead guilty. All
religion, including Catholicism, which teaches that salvation is by
religious works or church dogma is false. Religion that makes the
words of its leader, be he Pope or other, equal with the Word of
God is false. Sola Scriptura.
</P>
<P>
   From the time of the Reformation onward, it has been understood
that there is no commonality between the Bible way, which is
justification by faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ, and
salvation by works, which the faithful, practicing Catholic
embraces.
</P>
<P>
   We love the practicing Catholic and earnestly desire to see him
accept the Christ of the Cross, leave the false system that has
enslaved his soul and enjoy the freedom of sins forgiven that is
available for any of us in Christ alone.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, March 5:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-TEENS (Tokyo) _ For years, the United States has urged the
Japanese to loosen up, to spend more and to be freer in the way
they live. More and more, Japanese teen-agers are running with the
ball, rejecting the staid, studious behavior of the past in ways
that are disconcerting even for a government that has been
investigating ways of makeing childhood less regimented. By Howard
W. French.
</P>
<P>
   AFGHANISTAN-HEIST (Kabul, Afghanistan) _ If the Taliban are
anything, they are holier-than-thou. And that's what made the big
heist so embarrassing. In the cold predawn of Jan. 13, thieves made
off with more than $200,000 in cash from Kabul's main money bazaar.
They met no opposition from the Taliban soldiers who stand watch
over the deserted bazaar at night. By Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   BHOPAL-LAWSUIT (New York) _ Warren M. Anderson, chairman of the
Union Carbide Corp. during the 1984 chemical disaster at Bhopal,
India, has apparently gone into hiding to avoid a summons to appear
in a Manhattan federal court as part of civil proceedings against
him and the company, say lawyers who have hired a private
investigator to locate Anderson. By Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   MOZAMBIQUE-FLOODS (Dateline TK) _ On the delay in getting aid to
flood victims in Mozambique. By Rachel Swarms.
</P>
<P>
   UNESCO-REFORM (United Nations) _ In the family of U.N. agencies,
UNESCO has long been the spoiled child. The top jobs were
invariably cushy and easy to get with a little political pull. When
a new director general with new ideas, Koichiro Matsuura of Japan,
was elected last fall, he thought he knew quite a bit about how bad
things were. ``But I discovered once I was inside that the
mismanagement was much more serious than I had anticipated,'' he
said in an interview. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-EMIGRES (Cali, Colombia) _ After four decades of civil
conflict and a proliferation of guns and gangs, the forces driving
Colombians to abandon their country are perhaps especially acute in
this city of 2 million people, best known for its ruthless drug
cartels. But the phenomenon is national, with people of every class
leaving from small towns and rural areas as well as large cities.
By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-PINOCHET-ASSESS (Santiago, Chile) _ When Gen. Augusto
Pinochet traveled to London 16 months ago on a diplomatic passport,
he was still a powerful force on the Chilean political scene. But
when he returned home on Friday _ benefiting from a British
decision that he was too infirm to stand trial in Spain on charges
of gross human rights violations during his 17 years in power _ he
was a shadow of his former self. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-ENVIRONMENT (Mexico City) _ After five years of pressure
from an environmental movement that is every day more
transnational, the government on Thursday canceled plans with
Mitsubishi Corp. of Japan to build a gigantic salt plant on the
shores of a lagoon where gray whales give birth. It was a decision
Mexico never expected to make when the battle began, back in the
early stages of the country's broad opening to foreign commerce
under the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. By Julia
Preston.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-VIETNAM-WAR (Toronto) _ Next month's 25-year anniversary
of the fall of Saigon and the presidential campaign of Sen. John
McCain are reopening a long forgotten fissure between two groups of
Canadian fiftysomethings: the roughly 25,000 American draft dodgers
still living here, and the almost equal number of Canadians who
volunteered to fight in Vietnam. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CORRUPTION (Beijing) _ The revelation of several
high-level corruption cases has caused tensions within the
government. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BOBJONES (Greenville, S.C.) _ The impression one is most likely
to gain on entering the campus of Bob Jones University is that it
is a very long way from the typical American college. Young men
wear neckties. Young women wear skirts with hemlines at the knee or
ankle. No one is smoking. And a visitor is nearly always addressed
as ``Sir.'' By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   EPISCOPALIAN-RIFT (Pawleys Island, S.C.) _ An unusual alliance
has developed between conservative Episcopalians in the United
States and like-minded heads of some Anglican churches overseas,
who share a perception that the Episcopal Church has come to rely
less on Scripture than on ideas from secular American culture,
especially on issues of human sexuality. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   BIG-FAMILY (Scranton, Pa.) _ Married 12 years, in love for 22,
Barbara and Charlie Smith have created 17 children, and there are
times when Mrs. Smith has sensed disdain laced into the curiosity
of people who were in wonder at their feat. The Smith family
recently ended a harrowing stretch of homelessness, in which the
children had to be parceled out in this ultimately generous city,
and they feared for their own solidarity. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   DIALLO-VOICES (New York) _ None of the facts have changed in the
year since Amadou Diallo died in his doorway: four white police
officers, 41 bullets and one unarmed black man. But in
neighborhoods from one end of the city to the other, away from the
daily protests over the slain man and the political posturing, New
Yorkers' attitudes about the police have begun a subtle shift. By
Ginger Thompson and C.J. Chivers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-RDP (Los Angeles) _ After an extraordinary five-week
roller coaster of contests, the Republican presidential contenders
head into Tuesday _ the most consequential and climactic primary
day of the 2000 campaign _ with Sen. John McCain determined to at
long last crack Gov. George W. Bush's hold on party loyalists. By
Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-FOREIGN-POLICY (Washington) _ North Korea is just one
example of the differences in both substance and style between John
McCain and George Bush when they talk about foreign policy. They
come to their conclusions much as they run their campaigns: one by
instinct, the other by committee. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GAMBLING (Los Angeles) _ Nevada's gambling halls might be
about to face some significant competition right on their doorstep.
Californians, who account for about one-third of the visitors to
Nevada, will vote on Tuesday on a proposal to allow a broad
expansion of casino-style gambling on American Indian reservations
in their own state. By Andrew Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-CAMPAIGN-FUNDS (Los Angeles) _ Cowboys have long been a
vanishing breed in California, but when it comes to campaign
finance, this is still the wild, wild west. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-ADS (Los Angeles) _ So many groups are elbowing for
television time to broadcast their positions on one of the 20
initiatives and referendums on the California ballot, that they are
all but drowning out the political advertising by the presidential
candidates. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-RULES-ASSESS (Washington) _ The peculiarities of the
California election law could conceivably precipitate a credentials
fight at Philadelphia this summer. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL BRIEFS (Undated) _ California senator's outlook is
sunny; Los Angeles DA is biding his time; Taking advantage of a
governor's woes. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-GUARD (Washington) _ Since the scaling back of the
military that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the
Guard and Reserves have played a larger role in U.S. military
operations than ever before. For the Army, the increased reliance
has been the unintended consequence of a deliberate decision made
after the Vietnam War to put critical support units, from engineers
to civil affairs specialists, in the Guard and Reserve. By Steven
Lee Myers. (Part of an occasional series.)
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-RULE-CHANGE (Washington) _ Spurred by election-year
politics and complaints from employers scrambling to find enough
workers to help them keep the boom alive, the House voted 422-0 on
Wednesday to purge the Social Security laws of a relic of the
Depression. For decades, the provision has reduced the benefits of
workers ages 65 through 69 for every dollar they earned over
$17,000. At the time it was enacted, the law was designed to move
older workers aside in favor of younger ones. By Peter T. Kilborn
with Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   ORGANIC-FOOD (Washington) _ More than two years after the
Federal government's first effort to define and regulate organic
food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture
is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of
genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic
label, as well as the use of irradiation to decontaminate them or
the application of sewage sludge when the crops are grown. By
Marian Burros.

   NATIONAL-GUARD (Washington) _ Since the scaling back of the
military that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the
Guard and Reserves have played a larger role in U.S. military
operations than ever before. For the Army, the increased reliance
has been the unintended consequence of a deliberate decision made
after the Vietnam War to put critical support units, from engineers
to civil affairs specialists, in the Guard and Reserve. By Steven

<P>
   The bile between Sen. John McCain and the religious right
involves both God and Mammon.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition and the National Right to Life
Committee, which ran radio ads against McCain in New Hampshire and
South Carolina, tangled with the Arizona Republican before he began
his presidential bid. They battled over McCain's legislation to
overhaul campaign financing. Money, not abortion, is still the
religious right's real beef with him, McCain says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoyed a cordial relationship for many years until this,''
McCain said, referring to his campaign finance bill and his
anti-abortion voting record in the Congress. ``It's turned into a
jihad because they believe this will destroy their impact on the
political process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exclusively about money,'' agrees Sen. Russ Feingold,
D-Wis., McCain's co-sponsor of legislation that would ban the
unrestricted political donations known as soft money. ``John and I
have tried to turn off their money spigot and they find that very
threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   One provision of the McCain-Feingold bill would have placed
restrictions on issue advertising 60 days before an election, a
hindrance to the election-related activities of many ideological
groups, including the Christian Coalition and the National Right to
Life Committee. These groups and others spend millions of dollars
and flood the airwaves near election day with ads targeting foes or
friends on specific issues including abortion, the environment and
health care. Unlike candidates, parties and political action
committees, the groups can collect and spend unlimited amounts and
aren't required to disclose their contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Groups on the left, including the American Civil Liberties
Union, also opposed the provision as interfering with free speech.
Although the issue ad restrictions were stripped out of the Senate
bill voted on last year, a similar provision passed the House. And
the Senate bill's ban on soft money, the large, unrestricted
donations to the political parties, is also anathema to the
National Right to Life Committee and its allies. (Republican Party
committees have given lots of soft money to the group.)
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee, said his group's board decided to endorse Gov.
George W. Bush and run ads against McCain mainly because of
``substantive concerns about his record on right to life issues.''
He cited McCain's comments that he would not seek to repeal Roe vs.
Wade. But Johnson said McCain's campaign reform proposal was
certainly a factor, too. ``We are strongly opposed to certain
components of his proposal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fault lines between leaders of conservative groups and
anti-abortion lawmakers over the issue of political money were
exposed last year. As the House prepared to vote on its version of
McCain's bill, the Christian Coalition, the American Conservative
Union and the National Right to Life Committee warned anti-abortion
congressmen that their votes on campaign finance would be counted
against them in ratings compiled by conservative, anti-abortion
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Writing anti-abortion House colleagues, Gene Taylor, a
Mississippi Democrat, called the warning an ``obvious attempt to
target and intimidate those of us who believe that our campaign
system is in need of an overhaul.''

 McCAIN'S ETHNIC SLUR, GONE BUT NOT QUITE FORGOTTEN

<P>
   The brushfire over Sen. John McCain's use of the anti-Asian slur
``gooks'' flared and faded within a few days late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized for describing his North Vietnamese captors with the
racial epithet, McCain at first defended its use as justified when
applied to his jailers (though not other Asians), given the abuse
he and his fellow prisoners had suffered at their hands. On Feb.
18, however, perhaps with an eye to the California primary on
Tuesday, the Arizona Republican apologized and pledged never to
utter the word again.
</P>
<P>
   End of story. Indeed, voters got to hear or read little about
the episode. Some say that's only because by and large the media as
well as McCain have a tin ear when it comes to Asian-Americans and
their sensitivities. For it turned out that McCain had used the
slur repeatedly over several months while regaling reporters on his
campaign bus with harrowing recollections of his prisoner-of-war
days. And few had reported the fact.
</P>
<P>
   (The New York Times first reported his use of the slur at the
end of a news article on the presidential campaign on Feb. 18, and
noted his apology in a one-paragraph item on Feb. 25.)
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans were left to wonder, if only among themselves:
Would McCain have gotten more adverse publicity if he had uttered a
slur against blacks or Hispanics? The following excerpts, primarily
from Internet and e-mail forums directed at Asian Americans,
capture this and other sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ANTHONY RAMIREZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The issue got the attention of
Asian-Americans in e-mail forums after an article in the Jan. 3
issue of The Nation, the liberal weekly, began circulating via
e-mail about a month ago. It said in part: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking example of the media's unwillingness
to challenge McCain's air of moral authority is when he shocks
listeners by casually calling the Vietnamese ``gooks.'' The racist
and disparaging term, popularized by GIs during the war, occurs
repeatedly in a 1973 U.S. News &AMP; World Report account penned by
McCain after his release from prison. ``The `gooks' were bombarding
us with anti-war quotes from people in high places back in
Washington,'' he wrote, referring to the propaganda that his
captors gave him. A quarter of a century later, while speaking with
reporters aboard the Straight Talk Express in October, McCain was
still calling Vietnamese ``gooks'' _ and according to a reporter
who was there, no one called him on it. It's enough to make you
wonder whether the reporters were thinking: Well, this guy spent
five years in a prison camp, so he can say anything he wants.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In the Internet forum
``soc.culture.vietnamese,'' one participant responded bluntly: (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Just a thought, but if McCain had been caught by Africans while
fighting in Somalia, would he feel as comfortable calling his
torturers ``niggers'' as he does using the word ``gook''? If his
torturers had been Iraqi, would he use the word ``sand nigger''
with such conviction? Or had he been a human rights worker tortured
in Guatemala, would he call his captors ``spics''? Seems to me the
real issue isn't McCain's racial beliefs, but the fact that
Asian-Americans as a voting group aren't formidable enough to make
McCain wary of offending them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Jocelyn Dong offered similar criticism
(before the McCain apology) in an e-mail forum aimed at
Asian-American journalists: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   John McCain would do well to rethink this case of ``straight
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The English language is rife with words to express a former
POW's feelings towards the men who tortured him: barbarians,
sadists, savages and other epithets far more choice.
</P>
<P>
   But the slur he's sticking to is the racial one. Not one that
zeroes in on the unconscionable cruelty of his enemies, but one
that expresses hatred of ``differentness'' _ skin color, facial
features, culture.
</P>
<P>
   As a presidential candidate, McCain should take a broader view
of his remark by realizing how harmful it is to use  &UR; any &LR;  racially
derogatory term, in any context. Straight talk sometimes needs to
be revised. It probably wouldn't be personally easy for him, but he
could set a moral example by apologizing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But in the same forum, Stanton Tang was
willing to cut the senator some slack: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Having been raised in Arizona and having followed the senator's
career fairly closely, I cannot recall any instance of McCain
showing racial prejudice. I prefer to judge him, not on one
instance, but on his actions. If the term was used in context of
those individuals who tortured him for five years in a prisoner of
war camp, it may not be palatable to us, but that does not mean it
is not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I also am against political correctness for a very
simple reason. Would you prefer to know who holds racist views and
agendas openly, or would you prefer that they carry such biases in
secret?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, such terms offend me. However, if that person expresses
their views, then the public can judge for itself (and perhaps
condemn as well) those prejudicial views.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Vera Chan was also sympathetic to the
senator: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think we younger Americans who haven't lived through
a major war or significant civil unrest just can't fathom and
therefore understand how dehumanizing war is. . . . After all, how
many, say, Korean- or Chinese-Americans have parents or
grandparents who continue to condemn all Japanese because of their
wartime experiences?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) McCain gets further support in a letter to
the editor of the San Francisco Chronicle from Frank Koucky, a
reader: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Those who attack McCain (who defended an Asian nation with his
life) should go read ``When Hell Was in Session'' ((by a former
American prisoner of North Vietnam)) and learn a little about what
he went through before they open their mouths. To attack McCain for
speaking badly of his friends' murderers is as foolish as attacking
Jews for speaking badly of SS death camp guards.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But in the Internet forum
``soc.culture.asian.american,'' another presumably Asian-American
participant put forth no doubt a widely held view: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that his torturers are ((expletive)) who deserve
to be cursed. But the fact that he chooses to use a racial slur, in
a public forum, and as a presidential candidate. . . . indicates
that he is more ignorant about the issues than someone in his
position should be. Although the term is meant for his torturers
only, the fact that it is race-based will naturally impute all
members of the Vietnamese ethnicity. And of course, it will
concurrently be imputed to all A-As _ since, you know, they can't
tell us apart anyway.

of his remark by realizing how harmful it is to use  &UR; any &LR;  racially
derogatory term, in any context. Straight talk sometimes needs to
be revised. It probably wouldn't be personally easy for him, but he
could set a moral example by apologizing.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But in the same forum, Stanton Tang was
willing to cut the senator some slack: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Having been raised in Arizona and having followed the senator's
career fairly closely, I cannot recall any instance of McCain
showing racial prejudice. I prefer to judge him, not on one
instance, but on his actions. If the term was used in context of
those individuals who tortured him for five years in a prisoner of
war camp, it may not be palatable to us, but that does not mean it
is not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I also am against political correctness for a very
simple reason. Would you prefer to know who holds racist views and
agendas openly, or would you prefer that they carry such biases in
secret?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, such terms offend me. However, if that person expresses
their views, then the public can judge for itself (and perhaps
condemn as well) those prejudicial views.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Vera Chan was also sympathetic to the
senator: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think we younger Americans who haven't lived through
a major war or significant civil unrest just can't fathom and
therefore understand how dehumanizing war is. . . . After all, how
many, say, Korean- or Chinese-Americans have parents or
grandparents who continue to condemn all Japanese because of their
wartime experiences?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) McCain gets further support in a letter to
the editor of the San Francisco Chronicle from Frank Koucky, a
reader: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Those who attack McCain (who defended an Asian nation with his
life) should go read ``When Hell Was in Session'' ((by a former
American prisoner of North Vietnam)) and learn a little about what
he went through before they open their mouths. To attack McCain for
speaking badly of his friends' murderers is as foolish as attacking
Jews for speaking badly of SS death camp guards.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But in the Internet forum
``soc.culture.asian.american,'' another presumably Asian-American
participant put forth no doubt a widely held view: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that his torturers are ((expletive)) who deserve
to be cursed. But the fact that he chooses to use a racial slur, in
a public forum, and as a presidential candidate. . . . indicates
that he is more ignorant about the issues than someone in his
position should be. Although the term is meant for his torturers
only, the fact that it is race-based will naturally impute all
members of the Vietnamese ethnicity. And of course, it will
concurrently be imputed to all A-As _ since, you know, they can't
tell us apart anyway.

<P>
   It was Sunday every day last week on the Republican campaign
trail. Sen. John McCain made a speech Monday calling the
televangelist Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell ``agents of
intolerance,'' while Gov. George W. Bush told everyone that he was
not anti-Catholic, but that his opponent was playing dirty
politics.

<P>
   The next day, Bush clobbered his opponent in the Virginia and

</P>
<P>

released ads charging McCain with opposing money for breast cancer
research, and appeared with breast cancer survivors to denounce him

Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in tow. McCain called the ads a distortion
of his record, and the radio host Don Imus denounced them.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared as if it was McCain who had his back against the
wall, since he has been unable to make serious inroads against
Bush's core Republican support, especially in California.
Independents and Democrats will not win him the nomination.

   A Sticky Icon Turns 50
</P>
<P>
   It was some year, 1950: the first Club Med opened, Minute Rice
was introduced, Smokey the Bear and the slogan ``only you can
prevent forest fires'' were born and a newfangled copying machine
was perfected by a little company in upstate New York that soon
changed its name to Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another entry on the hit parade of popular-culture
icons from 1950: Silly Putty.
</P>
<P>
   The goofy substance celebrated its 50th anniversary last week by
being stretched, pounded and squished, the same as always. At the
factory in Easton, Pa., executives were talking about how people
had found uses the inventor (who never knew what to do with Silly
Putty anyway) never dreamed of: plugging leaks, stabilizing wobbly
furniture, cleaning computer keyboards, quitting smoking. Yes, some
stop-smoking programs tell smokers they need to knead Silly Putty
when they get the urge to light up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crosses generations, and you don't outgrow it,'' said
Tracey Muldoon Moran, a spokeswoman for Silly Putty. Of course,
there are those who wish they had, like the burglar who broke into
the company's Canadian office and stole a computer. It didn't take
a Joe Friday to catch the thief _ his fingerprints were all over
the Silly Putty he had played with before he made his getaway.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-silly history of Silly Putty is that it was invented
by accident in a synthetic-rubber laboratory during World War II.
It languished until 1950, when a New Haven, Conn., toy store bought
the first batch. It quickly sold out. Soon baby boomers were
lifting backwards copies of comic-strip figures out of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed since the '50s. Now, Muldoon Moran said,
``We get phone calls from folks saying, `My putty isn't working.'''
We tell them, `Your putty is working, it's the printing process
that's changed.'''

   Eichmann's House: The Bureaucracy of Murder
</P>
<P>
   Last week Israel released the memoirs of Adolf Eichmann, whom it
executed for war crimes in 1962. The document, written in an
Israeli jail, was kept sealed for fear it would be used to distort
the history of the Holocaust. It was unsealed at the request of
lawyers for Deborah Lipstadt, an American professor being sued for
libel by David Irving, whom she has described in a book as ``a
dangerous spokesman for Holocaust denial.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the 1,100 handwritten pages, Eichmann, the architect of
Hitler's Final Solution, charted the Nazi hierarchy. Eichmann's
Jewish Office of the Gestapo _ B-4 _ is at the bottom, consistent
with his claim to have been a minor cog in the genocidal machine.
``I was one of the many horses pulling the wagon and couldn't
escape left or right because of the will of the driver,'' he wrote.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chart is literally accurate, and deeply misleading. Aaron
Breitbart, a senior researcher at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Los Angeles, notes that, from 1942 on, Eichmann had formal
authority for eliminating the Jews, to which Hitler had given the
highest priority, and he reported directly to the No. 2 officer in
the SS (which ran the concentration camps). ``The SS had much more
political power than the Army,'' Breitbart said, ``and Eichmann had
much more power than any general.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann even felt he could defy Heinrich Himmler, the SS
leader, Breitbart said. In 1944, with the end of the war in sight,
Himmler ordered Eichmann to stop gassing Jews. Eichmann ignored
him.

   Testing for Pregnant Women

   When the crack epidemic was in full swing during the 1980s, the
plight of ``crack babies'' led to a vigorous debate over what to do
about pregnant women who use illegal drugs. South Carolina came up
with a singular answer: test their urine when they come to public
hospitals for prenatal care or delivery, and report positive finds
to the police. Several dozen women were arrested, some taken from
hospital beds in handcuffs or leg shackles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a case brought by 10 of the women, the Supreme
Court agreed to decide whether the urine tests were
unconstitutional searches or whether they were justified by the
health needs of fetuses and babies.

plight of ``crack babies'' led to a vigorous debate over what to do
about pregnant women who use illegal drugs. South Carolina came up
with a singular answer: test their urine when they come to public
hospitals for prenatal care or delivery, and report positive finds
to the police. Several dozen women were arrested, some taken from
hospital beds in handcuffs or leg shackles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a case brought by 10 of the women, the Supreme
Court agreed to decide whether the urine tests were
unconstitutional searches or whether they were justified by the
health needs of fetuses and babies.

   Taking Aim at Tax Shelters
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department issued new rules to make it harder for
large corporations to evade income taxes. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers said the official estimate that illegal
shelters cost $10 billion annually ``is just the tip of the
iceberg.'' But the next day tax lawyers at a Federal Bar
Association meeting in Washington pointed out loopholes in the new
rules that may create more business for the accounting, law and
investment firms that design abusive shelters for corporations.

   Ronald Taylor, a black man whose apartment, police said,
contained anti-white writings, shot five white men in a Pittsburgh
suburb, killing three. His rampage began when he set fire to his
home and ended at two fast-food restaurants. Taylor, who has a
history of mental illness, repeatedly pointed his gun at the police
officers who cornered him, but they did not fire. He was charged
with a hate crime, as well as murder.

   A 6-year-old boy brought a loaded .32-caliber gun to an
elementary school near Flint, Mich., and shot Kayla Renee Rolland,
a 6-year-old classmate in the first grade.
</P>
<P>
   The local prosecutor decided not to file charges against the
boy, saying he was too young to have formed criminal intent.
Instead, involuntary manslaughter charges were brought against a

   Reaching beyond earth, air, fire and water, Aristotle insisted
that the heavenly spheres _ the realm of the stars and gods _ must
be composed of something less mundane. This ethereal fifth essence,
or ``quintessence,'' was the very substance, medieval theologians
went on to propose, of which the angels themselves were made.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of modern astronomy is to banish such mystical
notions, proving that everything above consists of no-nonsense
matter, that we live in a material world. But as was clear from
Dark Matter 2000, a conference held in February in Marina del Rey,
Calif., the quest is only progressing because of science's
willingness to stretch the very meaning of the word ``matter.''
This once simple stuff is coming to seem as ethereal as anyone
could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hopes to the contrary, it now appears more certain than
ever that most of the universe is made from some kind of unworldly
``dark matter'' that canpass right through ordinary matter,
leaving barely a trace. Scientists are also coming to believe that
empty space is pervaded by an equally mysterious ``dark energy,'' a
kind of anti-gravitational umph that is accelerating the cosmic
expansion, the explosion set off by the big bang.
</P>
<P>
   With a sense of irony, some physicists are calling this
hypothetical new force quintessence _ a reminder that Aristotle
wasn't so far off in believing that the heavens are more alien and
wondrous than meets the earthly eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual universe is far more interesting than the universe
of science fiction,'' said Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss, chairman of the
physics department at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
``Nature comes up with possibilities that no science fiction writer
would dare suggest.'' With a foot in both worlds, Krauss is the
author of ``The Physics of Star Trek'' and ``Quintessence,'' a
newly updated book about dark matter and dark energy.
</P>
<P>
   Dark matter was concocted to get around a disturbing fact:
Galaxies spin so fast that they should have twirled apart eons ago.
Count the stars in the Milky Way and add up their heft. The
inescapable conclusion is that there isn't nearly enough gravity to
hold the whole conglomeration together. Astronomers originally
hoped that something ordinary like dim, burnt-out stars hiding in
the galactic outskirts could account for the missing gravity. But
attempts to find these Machos, for ``massive compact halo
objects,'' have yet to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening the mystery, cosmologists have concluded that the
universe probably couldn't have evolved the way it has unless most
of the dark matter is not just dark but invisible _ made from
exotic stuff that neither emits nor reflects light.
</P>
<P>
   What is this barely existing substance? Aristotle needed a
hypothetical essence with just the right properties to form the
luminous heavenly spheres. The theorists needed to come up with
particles that were massive enough to balance the scales of nature
and yet interacted only very weakly with ordinary matter. Otherwise
it would be hard to explain why the stuff hadn't already been
found. Tailor-made for this purpose is the ``weakly interacting
massive particle,'' or Wimp _ the paradoxically powerful rival to
the Macho.
</P>
<P>
   To separate itself from theology, science must find evidence
that its creations are real. At the recent conference in Marina del
Rey _ the full title was Fourth International Symposium on Sources
and Detection of Dark Matter in the Universe _ astronomers from the
University of Rome defended a dramatic claim they had posted on the
Internet earlier in the month: that they had detected a wind of
Wimps blowing through the earth as it moves across the sky.
Detecting a particle that was designed to be almost undetectable is
obviously quite a feat. Other researchers immediately disputed the
claim, and a California team that has been diligently seeking Wimps
declared that it had found none at all.
</P>
<P>
   And so the question of what accounts for the dark matter remains
appropriately up in the air. Experimenters are also looking for
other candidates, like the axion, a lightweight, weakly interacting
particle (ghostlier than the famously ghostly neutrino) that was
originally devised for an entirely different purpose: Unless there
were axions, physicists realized, an important theory in particle
physics would contain a glaring mathematical inconsistency. Named
after a popular laundry detergent, the axion would blot out the
stain.
</P>
<P>
   Even farther out into the speculative realm is a very heavy
version of the Wimp called the Wimpzilla. And farthest out of all
is the so-called mirror matter. While Wimps would react very
reluctantly with ordinary matter, the mirror matter would be even
more aloof, apparent only through its gravitational pull.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicists speculate that the mirror matter is just regular
matter trapped in another dimension. While its light is stuck
inside what amounts to a parallel universe, its gravity comes
shining through, bedeviling the astronomer's calculations. This
nether realm might also be home to the dark energy _ the
quintessence needed to give a boost to the cosmic expansion,
explaining why it is speeding up instead of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists would rather find answers to the cosmic
mysteries without leaving their own universe. But if this is not
possible, there may be some consolation. Our shining stars would
look like dark matter to observers in the mirror world. If some
kind of cosmic justice prevails, astronomers on both sides of the
looking glass are sharing the same deep sense of confusion.

A CREDIBILITY GAP IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)

special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl
Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

<P>
   The latest buzzphrase circulating among politicians and computer
industry executives these days is the digital divide, the gulf
between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who do not. Poor people and minorities, or so the thinking
goes, are in danger of being shut out of what promises to be the
most important mode of gathering and exchanging information, and
what is emerging as a common way of making and spending lots of
money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, there is a growing recognition among those
dealing most closely with the issue that the term digital divide,
while clever and provocative, has become a catchall phrase for
politicians with conspicuous agendas and that the divide is a
complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement can fully explain.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, it seems that the nation is actually facing a
multitude of digital divides, not one limited to race or income or
education. While it is true that millions of people are still
without access to computers or the Internet, those who are counted
as connected fall along a spectrum: Some are dialing into the
Internet through antiquated rural phone lines that cannot handle
high data speeds, while others use ultra high-speed connections
from both work and home. Millions of others are getting their
connection only occasionally from public libraries, classrooms or
community centers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was a busy time for those in the digital
bridge-building business. First, Vice President Al Gore visited a
San Francisco nonprofit group to deliver a speech on the divide.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, the Rev. Jesse Jackson opened a branch of his
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Silicon Valley, with the goal of closing
the divide among the poor. The same day, Jackson delivered a speech
at the University of California at Berkeley in which he pronounced
access to technology ``the newest stage of the civil rights
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, results of a survey conducted by National Public
Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government corroborated earlier studies that
found that at higher income levels there is virtually no racial
gap. More good news: Of those who bought computers in the last two
years, about one-third are from low-income or minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the survey found a persistent racial divide among
low-income households when it comes to computer ownership and
Internet access at home.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings may not spell out the problem as much as help
reveal its thorniness. It helps to start by looking at the ways in
which people connect to the Internet. Plenty of people have
connections at work, but some of them are not wired at home. In
addition, connecting to the Internet from work, a library or school
is quite different from connecting from the privacy of one's living
room. Experts say that the only way to fully appreciate the Web is
to experience it and that the most useful experience, unfettered by
the constraints of an institutional setting, comes with using the
Internet from home.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a high-speed cable modem connection gives a
Web surfer a far different view of cyberspace _ one that's
lightning quick and rich with sound and motion _ than that seen via
a slower link from a traditional modem.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, much of the digital bridge-building has focused on
schools. At first blush, the gap there doesn't seem especially
alarming. According to Market Data Retrieval, a company that has
surveyed the nation's public schools, 94 percent of schools in
wealthy districts have access to the Internet, compared with 84
percent of schools that serve poor populations.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures are deceptive. ``Those numbers fail to address
the nature of those connections,'' David Gollaher, chief executive
of the California Healthcare Institute, a nonprofit group in La
Jolla, Calif., told a group of health care experts who gathered
last week at Berkeley to discuss the digital divide and e-health
(industry shorthand for the delivery of health information and
services on the Internet).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the poorer schools, Gollaher said, connect to the
Internet using a relatively slow 56 kilobit-per-second connection,
which may be fine for sending e-mail but prevents a large
population of potential users from experiencing the full scope and
power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gollaher later said it was not until he got a high-speed
connection at his home that his own children grew interested in the
Web. ``They download a lot of music, and they listen to radio
stations online,'' he said. ``Many of the uses they prefer are uses
that depend on high-speed connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have claimed in recent weeks that the digital
divide is actually a myth, that income at all levels might play a
greater role than race in disparities between the digital haves and
have-nots, though the two are often connected.
</P>
<P>
   The NPR survey disproved that claim with a finding that among
households of all income levels, 57 percent of whites under the age
of 60 have Internet or e-mail access from home, compared with 38
percent of blacks. In households where income is less than $30,000
a year, the study found, 34 percent of whites have access from
home, compared with 19 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That divide narrows drastically when online access takes place
outside the home, especially in the workplace. ``The gap largely
disappears everywhere except at home,'' said Molly Brodie, a vice
president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who oversaw the NPR
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you start to look a little deeper, you see that the
biggest problem is at home,'' said Donna L. Hoffman, a professor of
management at Vanderbilt University and the co-author of a 1998
study with results similar to those in the NPR survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can understand what it can do for you
unless you use it,'' she said of the Internet. ``You have to try
it, then you can see the meaning it can have in your own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting to the Internet from outside the home makes having
such an experience more difficult, she said. ``I just think it's
very hard to do that when you have a 30-minute limit, or when you
have to wait in line, or with others around.''
</P>
<P>
   David Greenbaum, a researcher at Berkeley who works with
community groups in Oakland to address the digital divide, suspects
that the problem of access from home might be one of cause and
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One premise that underlies all of this is that if someone had
the right kind of access at home, they'd be much more involved in
the whole wired and online world,'' Greenbaum said. ``But if they
already had the impulse and interest to be part of that world, then
they'd have the kind of motivation to have a machine at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the NPR survey found no significant difference
between whites and blacks at low-income levels when it came to
owning other home electronics, like cable television and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum said that at a recent digital divide conference in
Oakland, a number of people asked: ``Why is it people are willing
to spend $500 on a big wide-screen TV? How can we instill that same
kind of economic pull to a desire to being online?''

connection at his home that his own children grew interested in the
Web. ``They download a lot of music, and they listen to radio
stations online,'' he said. ``Many of the uses they prefer are uses
that depend on high-speed connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have claimed in recent weeks that the digital
divide is actually a myth, that income at all levels might play a
greater role than race in disparities between the digital haves and
have-nots, though the two are often connected.
</P>
<P>
   The NPR survey disproved that claim with a finding that among
households of all income levels, 57 percent of whites under the age
of 60 have Internet or e-mail access from home, compared with 38
percent of blacks. In households where income is less than $30,000
a year, the study found, 34 percent of whites have access from
home, compared with 19 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That divide narrows drastically when online access takes place
outside the home, especially in the workplace. ``The gap largely
disappears everywhere except at home,'' said Molly Brodie, a vice
president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who oversaw the NPR
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you start to look a little deeper, you see that the
biggest problem is at home,'' said Donna L. Hoffman, a professor of
management at Vanderbilt University and the co-author of a 1998
study with results similar to those in the NPR survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can understand what it can do for you
unless you use it,'' she said of the Internet. ``You have to try
it, then you can see the meaning it can have in your own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting to the Internet from outside the home makes having
such an experience more difficult, she said. ``I just think it's
very hard to do that when you have a 30-minute limit, or when you
have to wait in line, or with others around.''
</P>
<P>
   David Greenbaum, a researcher at Berkeley who works with
community groups in Oakland to address the digital divide, suspects
that the problem of access from home might be one of cause and
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One premise that underlies all of this is that if someone had
the right kind of access at home, they'd be much more involved in
the whole wired and online world,'' Greenbaum said. ``But if they
already had the impulse and interest to be part of that world, then
they'd have the kind of motivation to have a machine at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the NPR survey found no significant difference
between whites and blacks at low-income levels when it came to
owning other home electronics, like cable television and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum said that at a recent digital divide conference in
Oakland, a number of people asked: ``Why is it people are willing
to spend $500 on a big wide-screen TV? How can we instill that same
kind of economic pull to a desire to being online?''

<P>
   In 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson rode to re-election on his successful
support of Proposition 187, which barred the children of illegal
immigrants from attending public school in California.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Republican-led Congress pointed to the huge
budget deficit when it enacted legislation that barred hundreds of
thousands of legal immigrants from receiving food stamps and
federal disability assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant bashing then swept into the presidential campaign as a
wedge issue. Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, called
for barring the children of illegal immigrants from attending
schools. Wilson seized on anti-immigrant proposals to spur his
faltering presidential bid. And Pat Buchanan's motto may well have
been ``Don't give me your tired, your poor.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference four years make. George W. Bush has denounced
the Republicans' past anti-immigrant initiatives and boasts that he
can speak Spanish, while Al Gore has even assayed a few stumbling
words of Espanol. Not only that, Republican Party strategists have
declared that Hispanics will be the soccer moms of this year's
campaign. It's as if immigrants have been transformed
Cinderella-like into the belles of the political ball. ``There's
been a remarkable turnaround,'' said Frank Sharry, executive
director of the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group for
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. Democratic and Republican strategists
agree that Hispanics may provide the swing votes in the four states
_ California, New York, Texas and Florida _ that have large
Hispanic populations and which, taken together, account for half
the electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   While immigrants tend to vote in smaller percentages than other
demographic groups, the number of Hispanic-American and
Asian-American voters is growing fast, and so are their campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants are also increasingly valued by Corporate America;
were the nation's 6 million illegal immigrants expelled tomorrow,
thousands of restaurants, hotels, farms, poultry plants and garment
factories and gardening companies would be forced to close for want
of workers. Some economists also believe that the nation's record
economic boom may have already sputtered without immigrants to fill
millions of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that without the flow of immigrants, we
would have hit much earlier the level at which we started to have
wage inflation, and that would have meant higher interest rates and
that would have reduced the spectacular growth that we see,'' said
Daniel Bachman, chief economist at Transatlantic Futures, a
Washington-based research institute. His opinion is shared by Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a low-wage, service economy phenomenon. The
high-tech sector has asked that the annual quota for high-skilled
immigrants be nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Unions, like many Republicans, viewed immigrants with suspicion.
The AFL-CIO, for example, saw them as an economic fifth column that
took away union jobs and depressed wages. Recently, however, it has
called for a general amnesty for illegal workers. In economic boom
times, with unemployment at 4 percent, these are potential union
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer have a knee-jerk reaction that immigrants drag
down the standard of living,'' said John Wilhelm, president of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. ``We, the labor
movement, want to show we're on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the Public Policy Institute of California found that
in 1994, 20 percent of Californians said immigration was the topic
they most wanted politicians to talk about, while this year only 2
percent of Californians feel that way. ``Whenever we're in boom
periods, as we are today, people are more generous in their
attitudes toward immigrants,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey
director at the California institute. ``Immigration is not a very
good wedge issue in the current economic climate,'' said Mark
Baldassare, survey director at the California institute.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans switched tacks after sifting through recent election
returns. In 1996, 72 percent of Hispanic voters backed Bill
Clinton, while 21 percent supported Bob Dole. And exit polls showed
that in California's 1998 race for governor, 78 percent of Hispanic
voters backed Gray Davis, the Democratic victor. Republican
strategists were also startled that in California alone, 250,000
Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants became naturalized Americans and
registered to vote in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The record number of immigrants who have sought citizenship,
registered to vote and then voted Democratic around the country in
recent years is widely viewed as a backlash against
Republican-backed, anti-immigrant policies. ``The politics of
immigrant bashing has backfired,'' said Harry Pachon, president of
the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a research group in Claremont,
Calif. This has made a small group of Republicans, led by Jack Kemp
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, who spoke out against their
party's nativist policies, look prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic politicians risk being torn between Hispanic voters
and the traditionally Democratic African-Americans, who often see
them as competitors for jobs and political power. Nonetheless, with
demographers projecting that Hispanics will replace
African-Americans as the largest minority group in five years, the
role of Hispanics in politics will undoubtedly grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ellis Island immigrants of the early 1900s became a key
part of the New Deal coalition that led to decades of dominance by
the Democratic Party,'' said Sharry of the National Immigration
Forum. ``The new wave of immigrants is clearly up for grabs, and
with the tight races for Congress and the White House, this
fast-growing population can determine who dominates over the next
few decades.''

   BAYWATCH-OVERTIME (Los Angeles) _ It's not exactly ``Baywatch.''
Los Angeles County lifeguards, the models for the popular TV show,
may have been too tired to rescue swimmers last year because some
worked as much as 105 hours of overtime a month, according to a new
audit. County Auditor-Controller Alan Sasaki found lifeguards cost
the county $1.3 million in overtime and may not have been
``physically alert and mentally capable of performing.'' By Troy
Anderson. (Will move in the ``a'' national news file and in the

LIFEGUARDS' OVERTIME COST LOS ANGELES COUNTY $1.3 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ It's not exactly ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County lifeguards, the models for the popular TV
show, may have been too tired to rescue swimmers last year because
some worked as much as 105 hours of overtime a month, according to
a new audit.
</P>
<P>
   County Auditor-Controller Alan Sasaki found lifeguards cost the
county $1.3 million in overtime and may not have been ``physically
alert and mentally capable of performing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifeguard Capt. Steve Moseley said public safety was never
jeopardized, and the overtime ensured the most experienced
lifeguards were on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never put someone out in a lifeguard tower who we
thought was in any way unable to fulfill their job,'' Moseley said.
``We would never compromise public safety on someone's belief that
they were entitled to an overtime shift.''
</P>
<P>
   The audit found that a group of 20 permanent lifeguards had
worked 7,138 hours of overtime, or between 50 and 105 hours of
overtime a month each.
</P>
<P>
   An average permanent lifeguard earns $58,900 a year, but if one
worked 50 to 105 hours of overtime a month, he or she would make
$87,784 to $119,556 a year. The high end is more than county
supervisors and superior court judges, who only make $117,912
annually.
</P>
<P>
   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky requested the audit in
December after receiving a complaint that the Los Angeles County
Fire Department's Lifeguard Division was spending too much money on
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleged that permanent lifeguards, who earn an
average of $31.35 an hour for regular pay and $48.14 an hour for
overtime, were working the extra hours rather than temporary and
part-time lifeguards who make $23.95 an hour straight time and
$36.15 an hour overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found the overtime cost taxpayers nearly $1.3 million
in 1999, up from about $1 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned they were paying overtime to their
higher-paid employees and, as a result, spending more than they
needed to,'' Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem we've had in the city and county. If this kind
of abuse is taking place at this small scale, it raises the
possibility it is taking place on a larger scale in our bigger
departments.''
</P>
<P>
   The overtime problem worsened after the Lifeguard Division was
transferred from the Department of Beaches and Harbors to the Fire
Department. The department's policy allows only permanent
lifeguards to fill in - working overtime - because officials say
they are more experienced than temporary ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we use permanent personnel, we can guarantee their level
of training,'' Moseley said.
</P>
<P>
   Lifeguard officials cited the extensive use of defibrillators as
the key reason why more experienced personnel are needed. Those
machines require an emergency medical technician certification and
four hours of special training.
</P>
<P>
   However, auditors noted that a significant number of part-time
lifeguards are EMT certified and require only the four-hour
training to be certified in these positions.
</P>
<P>
   The audit recommended that the Fire Department re-evaluate its
overtime policy, establish rules on the number of hours that can be
worked and monitor overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman said using a group of well-trained
temporary lifeguards to fill vacancies rather than training a large
number of part-time lifeguards is the best way to reduce overtime.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, March 5, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds: CHILE-U.S.-REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLICS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The GOP slugfest over
whether John McCain is baiting Catholics by painting George W. Bush
as anti-Catholic has freed a genie from a bottle corked 40 years
ago by John F. Kennedy. Democrats are rejoicing, for it was only
six years ago that the Gingrich-led House revolution showed that a
Catholic majority of voters had shifted for the first time in
decades from Democrats to Republicans on the House ballot. Before
that, Catholics split their ticket, as in voting for Ronald Reagan
but then returning to their old lunch-pail Democratic roots. By
Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   With sidebars, BOBJONES-REVIEW and MCCAIN-RELIGION-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   DARK-MATTER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Modern astronomy was supposed to
banish Aristotelian and mystical notions about the composition of
the universe, proving that everything above consists of no-nonsense
matter, that we live in a material world. But as was clear from
Dark Matter 2000, a conference held in February, the quest is only
progressing because of science's willingness to stretch the very
meaning of the word ``matter.'' This once-simple stuff is coming to
seem as ethereal as anyone could have imagined. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-DIVIDE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The latest buzzphrase among
politicians and computer executives is the digital divide, the gulf
between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who do not. People in the latter category, the thinking goes,
are being shut out of the most important mode of gathering and
exchanging information in the new century. In fact, there is a
growing recognition among those dealing closely with the issue that
the term digital divide, while clever and provocative, has become a
catchall phrase for politicians with conspicuous agendas and that
the divide is a complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement
can fully explain. By Katie Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1996, immigrant bashing was
in: Bob Dole, Pete Wilson and Pat Buchanan took positions that
could be seen as anti-immigrant. But what a difference four years
makes. In the 2000 campaign, nary a nasty word has been uttered
about immigrants. GOP strategists say Hispanic Americans will be to
this year's campaign what soccer moms were to the 1996 campaign.
Democratic and Republican strategists agree that Hispanics may
provide swing votes in California, New York, Texas and Florida _
which together account for half the electoral votes needed to win
the presidency. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERTUESDAY-SCENARIOS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With the primary
and caucus schedule so far, it's been easy to keep track of whether
Gov. George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain is up or down. It may not
be so simple this Tuesday, with 13 contests. It is the biggest, and
most important single day of the primary season. And, perhaps, the
most confusing. Consider the possible scenarios. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-HEELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ What's behind the comeback of high
heels? Professional women may have discovered that sex appeal is
power because it is a way to get people to do what you want. And
high heels are the prime symbol of erotic femininity, because they
inspire simultaneous fantasies of vulnerability (who can run in
them?) and of the heel as weapon. They are a gal's version of a guy
thing: the female power tool. By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-POLICE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Scandals often require not
just scandalous facts but a trigger, a nettlesome event, to
activate public outrage. In Los Angles, for example, a police
corruption scandal in which officers brutalized, framed and shot
innocent people has suddenly erupted, after quietly simmering for
five months. At least one of the triggers, in this case, may have
been a proposed bond offering. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD-NYPD-ABUSES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A scathing report detailing
corruption and abuse in an elite-anti-crime unit of the Los Angeles
Police Department came just a week after four officers in a similar
squad in New York were acquitted in the death of an unarmed man
they shot 19 times. But where the New York officers may have been
reckless, the Los Angeles officers were almost certainly
premeditated criminals. Although there is no indication that the
New York unit has engaged in such lawlessness, critics say such
squads are risky ventures that frequently lead to problems. By Jane
Fritsch.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-SLUR-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The brush fire over John
McCain's use of the word ``gooks'' flared and faded quickly.
Asian-Americans may have wondered: Would McCain have gotten more
bad publicity from a slur against blacks or Hispanics? Some
excerpts, primarily from Internet e-mail forums directed at Asian
Americans, capture this and other sentiments.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   BRIT-CORPORAL-PUNISH-REVIEW (London) _ Britain has outlawed
corporal punishment in schools, and the debate has now shifted to
the home, with the Labor government trying to rewrite the law to
set out exactly what constitutes acceptable hitting. The current
law, which dates back to Victorian times, was recently thrown into
limbo when the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it had
failed to protect a young British boy from ``inhuman or degrading
punishment'' by his stepfather. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ U.S. agencies that worked with
Chile during the Pinochet era have been reviewing their files and
slowly revealing the degree of U.S. knowledge about the system that
killed democracy for a generation of Chileans. The full extent of
U.S. involvement with the Pinochet regime remains shrouded in
secrecy, but some facts have been coming into sharper focus. By

</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLICS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The GOP slugfest over
whether John McCain is baiting Catholics by painting George W. Bush
as anti-Catholic has freed a genie from a bottle corked 40 years
ago by John F. Kennedy. Democrats are rejoicing, for it was only
six years ago that the Gingrich-led House revolution showed that a
Catholic majority of voters had shifted for the first time in
decades from Democrats to Republicans on the House ballot. Before
that, Catholics split their ticket, as in voting for Ronald Reagan
but then returning to their old lunch-pail Democratic roots. By
Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   With sidebars, BOBJONES-REVIEW and MCCAIN-RELIGION-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   DARK-MATTER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Modern astronomy was supposed to
banish Aristotelian and mystical notions about the composition of
the universe, proving that everything above consists of no-nonsense
matter, that we live in a material world. But as was clear from
Dark Matter 2000, a conference held in February, the quest is only
progressing because of science's willingness to stretch the very
meaning of the word ``matter.'' This once-simple stuff is coming to
seem as ethereal as anyone could have imagined. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-DIVIDE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The latest buzzphrase among
politicians and computer executives is the digital divide, the gulf
between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who do not. People in the latter category, the thinking goes,
are being shut out of the most important mode of gathering and
exchanging information in the new century. In fact, there is a
growing recognition among those dealing closely with the issue that
the term digital divide, while clever and provocative, has become a
catchall phrase for politicians with conspicuous agendas and that
the divide is a complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement
can fully explain. By Katie Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1996, immigrant bashing was
in: Bob Dole, Pete Wilson and Pat Buchanan took positions that
could be seen as anti-immigrant. But what a difference four years
makes. In the 2000 campaign, nary a nasty word has been uttered
about immigrants. GOP strategists say Hispanic Americans will be to
this year's campaign what soccer moms were to the 1996 campaign.
Democratic and Republican strategists agree that Hispanics may
provide swing votes in California, New York, Texas and Florida _
which together account for half the electoral votes needed to win
the presidency. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERTUESDAY-SCENARIOS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With the primary
and caucus schedule so far, it's been easy to keep track of whether
Gov. George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain is up or down. It may not
be so simple this Tuesday, with 13 contests. It is the biggest, and
most important single day of the primary season. And, perhaps, the
most confusing. Consider the possible scenarios. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-HEELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ What's behind the comeback of high
heels? Professional women may have discovered that sex appeal is
power because it is a way to get people to do what you want. And
high heels are the prime symbol of erotic femininity, because they
inspire simultaneous fantasies of vulnerability (who can run in
them?) and of the heel as weapon. They are a gal's version of a guy
thing: the female power tool. By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-POLICE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Scandals often require not
just scandalous facts but a trigger, a nettlesome event, to
activate public outrage. In Los Angles, for example, a police
corruption scandal in which officers brutalized, framed and shot
innocent people has suddenly erupted, after quietly simmering for
five months. At least one of the triggers, in this case, may have
been a proposed bond offering. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD-NYPD-ABUSES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A scathing report detailing
corruption and abuse in an elite-anti-crime unit of the Los Angeles
Police Department came just a week after four officers in a similar
squad in New York were acquitted in the death of an unarmed man
they shot 19 times. But where the New York officers may have been
reckless, the Los Angeles officers were almost certainly
premeditated criminals. Although there is no indication that the
New York unit has engaged in such lawlessness, critics say such
squads are risky ventures that frequently lead to problems. By Jane
Fritsch.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-SLUR-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The brush fire over John
McCain's use of the word ``gooks'' flared and faded quickly.
Asian-Americans may have wondered: Would McCain have gotten more
bad publicity from a slur against blacks or Hispanics? Some
excerpts, primarily from Internet e-mail forums directed at Asian
Americans, capture this and other sentiments.

UNESCO'S FAT GETS A TRIM AND REFORM IS IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the family of U.N. agencies, UNESCO has long
been the spoiled child. The top jobs _ in Paris, no less _ were
invariably cushy and easy to get with a little political pull.
Reformers anxious to curb the selfish traits of this wayward
offspring came and went without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   When a new director general with new ideas, Koichiro Matsuura of
Japan, was elected last fall, he thought he knew quite a bit about
how bad things were. He had been Japan's ambassador in Paris for
five years and chairman of UNESCO's World Heritage Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I discovered once I was inside that the mismanagement was
much more serious than I had anticipated _ a lot of arbitrary
appointments, arbitrary promotions,'' he said in an interview. His
office alone had 20 politically appointed advisers hired without
professional screening. They were soon dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuura, a lawyer and economist who graduated from Haverford
College in 1961 after four years at Tokyo University, made tough
speeches to the board of the agency _ formally the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization _ and to its
staff. He opened a Web site for complaints from the 2,500
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered that there were a lot of people more demoralized
than I had anticipated,'' he said. ``Rewards to the undeserving,
not to those who deserved them _ that was a common theme.'' He
found that some departments had refused to meet with outside
auditors, and in-house auditing systems were ``weak, almost
nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsuura, 62, a veteran diplomat who is fluent in English,
French and Spanish, succeeded Federico Mayor Zaragoza of Spain.
Mayor is blamed for acquiescing to many political appointments
demanded by member nations but won praise in his two-year term for
squashing UNESCO's efforts to develop a ``new international
information order,'' which many nations saw as an attempt to
regulate or muzzle the press.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the information proposal and mismanagement at the top
of the organization prompted the United States to withdraw from
UNESCO. Britain and Singapore followed suit, but Britain went back
in 1997 under Prime Minister Tony Blair. President Clinton told
UNESCO in 1995 that he was prepared to restore U.S. membership, but
administration officials say there is no money to rejoin.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuura hopes to tempt the United States back in with a reform
plan he says he will put in place this spring.
</P>
<P>
   David Malone, president of the International Peace Academy in
New York and a former Canadian Foreign Ministry official in charge
of relations with international agencies, is skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Matsuura faces an uphill battle in turning around an
organization which is deeply scarred,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of UNESCO is that successive heads have turned it
into a personal patronage machine, neglecting programs and bloating
the staffing,'' Malone said. ``We used to all know what the UNESCO
objectives were. Now nobody knows what UNESCO does beyond the World
Heritage sites. The important work is on literacy, education, key
cultural monuments and themes, and serving as a forum for the
promotion of high scientific standards. Who ever consults UNESCO
now on science?''
</P>
<P>
   Matsuura is the first Asian to head UNESCO, which was
established in 1946. Since then, Matsuura said, the world has
changed ``and we must evolve with it.'' He says UNESCO, with a
largely Europeanized view of culture _ more than half of the 630
World Heritage sites are in Europe _ needs to extend more help to
the poorer nations that also want to save their historical
artifacts and natural sites and cultures not necessarily covered by
the current convention governing world heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot be simply content with promoting intellectual
cooperation among developed nations, without paying attention to
the needs of developing nations,'' Matsuura said. ``The convention
only covers tangible things. It does not cover intangibles like
craftsmanship, music, tradition and languages.''
</P>
<P>
   UNESCO was founded to promote peace through knowledge and
communication, Matsuura said, and he is planning to interpret that
in very concrete ways. UNESCO has already been involved in projects
as diverse as restoring colonial Havana and recreating a
traditional silk industry in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuura is making a big push into education. He has been asked
by Bolivia to help create a higher education system, and Haiti is
seeking advice on all levels of schooling. But the biggest job will
be Nigeria, where President Olusegun Obasanjo is asking UNESCO to
design a basic school system. ``There is a country of 120 million
people,'' he said, ``and their education is in shambles.''

DROPOUTS' CAREER IN JAPAN: PAINTING THE TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For Misa Horii and Ami Yamazaki, Saturday night begins
at 7, when they set out to prowl the streets of Shibuya under tiny
white hats, bleached-blond hair, chalky makeup and pink highlights
methodically applied atop their deep copper tans.
</P>
<P>
   If their usual pattern holds, the two 15-year-olds will make a
full night of it, maybe nightclubbing or just walking Shibuya's
crowded, narrow alleys, being invited out by admirers of all ages.
Reaching home by dawn, they will sleep through the day.
</P>
<P>
   What sets these girls apart from the mass of similarly dressed
teen-agers who haunt trendy districts like Shibuya is not that they
will pull an all-nighter from time to time, but that they have
dropped out of high school altogether, preferring a full-time life
of nocturnal amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just come here on Saturday nights,'' said Horii, who
wore white boots with towering platform soles, a long white coat,
an orange minidress and blue contact lenses. ``We are here all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Horii and her friend have decided the future is now. The boredom
of school is a thing of the past; they decided it could not compete
with the excitement of Shibuya's streets. So night after night they
follow the same routine: meeting in the early evening in the
shadows of one of Tokyo's busiest subway stations and heading off
into the crowds for a new adventure.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the United States has urged the Japanese to loosen
up, to spend more and to be freer in the way they live. More and
more, Japanese teen-agers are running with the ball, rejecting the
staid, studious behavior of the past in ways that are disconcerting
even for a government that has been investigating ways of making
childhood less regimented.
</P>
<P>
   Crime, violence and drug use may not yet be part of the mix, as
they are in the United States, but in the last five years,
particularly in big cities like Tokyo, freewheeling sex, heavy
drinking and delinquency have exploded among the high school set.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of the nose-to-the-grindstone ethic of long study
hours and single-minded focus on exams and careers that helped
build postwar Japan, the motto of the current crop of 15- to
18-year-olds seems to be that girls and boys just want to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any real serious boyfriends, just sex friends,''
said Yamazaki in a refrain often heard from the young people who
fill the streets of Shibuya, a noisy, bustling quarter of
department stores and fashionable clothing and record shops, some
of which stay open all night.
</P>
<P>
   Horii said: ``It is too tiring to get up for school every
morning. All I want to do is play.''
</P>
<P>
   How much of this kind of chatter is simply posturing by young
people straining to appear mature is not clear. But what is clear,
experts say, is that their kind of behavior is increasing quickly
as the Japanese shift from deeply disciplined, industrial mores to
much freer consumerist ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of morals, of rules, and the notion of principles
have become weakened,'' said Tamotsu Sengoku, director of the Japan
Youth Research Institute. ``More and more, parents are trying to
enjoy their own lives, and are gradually becoming indifferent to
their children. The value system is changing, and the mass media
and entertainment are presenting the view that people should enjoy
themselves, and so social values are heading more and more in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier generation, children like Horii and Yamazaki might
have chosen to run away, Sengoku said. Nowadays, though, many
parents avoid involvement in the emotional conflicts of their
teen-age children _ who are required by law only to complete junior
high school _ and there are few runaways ``because the household is
so free.''
</P>
<P>
   Although experts differ over the degree and speed with which
this shift is occurring, recent statistics make it clear that
dramatic changes are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 10 million students of junior and senior high school
age in Japan, 120,000 dropped out last year, a 20 percent increase
from two years earlier, Sengoku said. Similarly, a survey of
teen-age sexuality last year found that more than 50 percent of
girls have had intercourse by their senior year in high school, 10
percentage points higher than in a similar study in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Although plenty of young Japanese still work hard, attending
special cram schools in the afternoon after their regular school is
over, for many teen-agers the belief in an ever-rising future that
has driven Japan's remarkable industriousness appears to be
evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   To the question of what will become of them in 10 or 15 years
after they have dropped out of high school, Yamazaki replied: ``We
just want to preserve the same mood. We have energy, and can keep
going and going. If we get wrinkles, we'll cover them with makeup.
If we get more wrinkles, we can always get a face lift.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Horii and Yamazaki may seem a bit overwrought in their belief in
the indestructibility of youth, but their devil-may-care attitude
is increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   Kiyoichi Harada and his close-knit circle of Shibuya buddies _
hip-hop fans who wear colorful T-shirts, baseball jackets and their
caps on backward _ also share the carefree way of life.
</P>
<P>
   High school academics seem to have meant little to most of them.
More important, and more fun too, is hanging out nightly in the
streets here, where they distribute free entrance tickets to
attract people to social clubs and night spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to the university,'' said Harada, who leaned
with his friends on the large plate-glass windows of a busy
Starbucks that overlooks Shibuya Crossing. ``I want to open my own
business,'' he said. What kind? ``A profitable one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, reflecting with his friends, he came up with a quick
answer: ``Perhaps a suntan salon. I go to salons all the time. It's
cool to be dark. It attracts the girls.''

U.S. TO ESTABLISH STRICT NEW RULES FOR REGULATING ORGANIC FOOD
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than two years after the federal government's
first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win
public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much
tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified
ingredients in products carrying the organic label. The rules also
prohibit the use of irradiation to decontaminate the products and
the application of sewage sludge as fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, to be announced next week, could take effect by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 275,000 comments received in response to the
original proposal in 1997, virtually all of them opposed those
three processes, which the Agriculture Department had considered
allowing.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules indicate an about-face in the department's
attitude toward organic farming and represent one of several steps
it is taking to help the small- and medium-sized farmers who have
mainly been ignored or even discriminated against by the agency for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic
food abroad, where there has been substantial opposition to the use
of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could turn out to be the most important rule USDA has
issued in 20 years,'' said Dr. Margaret Mellon, the director of the
agriculture and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned
Scientists, an environmental advocacy group in Washington that had
urged the agency to toughen its earlier proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Agriculture Department's policies have made small farmers
an endangered species,'' Mellon said. ``Now it is trying to
construct a system to allow small farmers to help them survive, to
help them flourish. It is also a turning point in its relationship
to consumers. The agency has never before been responsive to
consumers' desires or demands.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said that if
the public thought the standards were too strict they should let
the department know during the 90-day comment period before the
agency enacts the final rules. ``I'd rather go from too strict
standards and ease them than going the other way,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is clearly moving towards stricter definitions of
what constitutes organic food. After initially ignoring many of the
recommendations of the National Organic Standards Board, which had
been set up to help the agency formulate the regulations, the
Agriculture Department has now taken all of the board's advice,
including total prohibition of antibiotics in animals raised as
organic; the use of 100 percent organic feed; and the requirement
of outdoor access for animals.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of organic food have been increasing about 20 percent a
year. When Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act in
1990, sales of organic food had reached $1 billion: projected sales
for 1999 are $6.46 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, raw products could carry the federal
agency's organic seal on the front of packaging if they were 100
percent organic, meaning that they are grown and manufactured
without the use of added hormones, pesticides or synthetic
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Processed food that is made from at least 95 percent organic
ingredients could also carry the seal. And processed food
containing at least 50 percent organic ingredients could be labeled
``made with organic ingredients'' and list up to three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Irradiation, genetic modification and the use of sludge would be
prohibited not only in the organic ingredients but in the
conventional ingredients in foods made partly with organic
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Products made with less than 50 percent organic ingredients may
use the word organic only in the list of ingredients on the side
panel; in this case, the prohibition against those three processes
would not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Several advocates of organic farming who have seen the revised
rules say that the standards are stricter than those developed in
any other country and have set the bar very high for organic
farmers in the United States, possibly discouraging rather than
encouraging them to grow organic crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The document is certainly much closer to meeting industry
expectations than the first one but the pendulum may have swung too
far,'' said Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic
Trade Association. ``The standards seem to be written in a vacuum
and do not take into account what supplies, ingredients and
production materials are actually available. I am afraid that some
people are not going to bother to be organic anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the areas of concern that has been left vague in the new
rules is how to treat organic crops that have been contaminated
with drift from nearby genetically engineered crops. An Agriculture
Department official said that no level for drift had been set but a
farmer would not be penalized if some low level of contamination
occurred as long as he had followed all of the organic procedures
required.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a larger effort to help the more than 12,000 organic
farmers, the administration's budget for the first time includes a
$5.5 million request for organic research. In addition, the
Agriculture Department has a pilot project for crop insurance for
organic farmers and is studying other things that might help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I want to preserve family farming,'' Glickman said.
``We need economic avenues for small- and medium-size farms and
this is one way to do this. Clearly organic agriculture is a way
farmers can make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   The public can send comments to the Agriculture Department by
mail or on the Internet at www.ams.usda.gov/nop.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR;  _ After an extraordinary five-week roller coaster
of contests, the Republican presidential contenders head into
Tuesday _ the most consequential and climactic primary day of the
2000 campaign _ with Sen. John McCain determined, at long last, to
crack Gov. George W. Bush's hold on party loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the political swings have been as turbulent as the
stock market in recent days, no one can safely predict how voters
will size up their choices in the 13 Republican primaries or
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But a close examination of the contests in those states, based
on interviews with strategists and politicians, and on fresh
polling data, found that with the exceptions of New York and New
England, McCain has had difficulty moving past the base of
independents and Democrats who propelled him into the most
competitive primary struggle in decades _ and one of the most
vitriolic.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling contests amount to the closest this country has
ever come to a national primary, with races in every region and
nearly one-third of the national convention delegates at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has centered mostly on the electoral powerhouses of
California and New York, the biggest delegate prizes, and, to a
lesser degree, Ohio. McCain has the best shot of pulling off a
victory in New York, polls show, and Bush is ahead in California
and Ohio. But the rivals are competing mightily for the popular
vote in California, which carries no delegates but could be an
important lift for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins two out of those three contests would be well on
his path to the nomination. Those three states have always been
critical for candidates in a general election. Now, for the first
time in decades, they are primary battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The predicament for McCain is that except in his home state of
Arizona, he did not capture more than 40 percent of the vote from
self-identified Republicans in any of the contests thus far. And
polls show that McCain is drawing 40 percent or more of the vote
only in three states voting Tuesday: New York, Massachusetts, and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davenport, who ran the delegate operation for Bob Dole in
1996 and is neutral this year, said he had seen no evidence that
McCain was making headway with Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a little too late to move the numbers,'' he said.
``The Bush campaign has done a good job at painting George Bush as
the Republican candidate who supports all of the Republican
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who have not had a major contest since New Hampshire
on Feb. 1, are on ballots from coast to coast Tuesday. But with
Vice President Al Gore having won all of his party's contests thus
far _ and former Sen. Bill Bradley trailing in the polls in every
state voting Tuesday _ most leading Democrats have pronounced the
race all but over.
</P>
<P>
   Before McCain's impressive upsets in New Hampshire and Michigan,
most Republicans had predicted that Bush, with his stacks of money
and endorsements, would have wrapped up the nomination earlier.
Now, after McCain's losses last week in Virginia, Washington state
and North Dakota, the pressure is on him to prove that he can
attract Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   So far, McCain has benefited from victories in states where
independents and Democrats could rally behind him in Republican
primaries. There are far fewer ``open contests'' coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of McCain's advisers acknowledged that they were
having trouble winning over loyal Republicans. The problem, they
said, is that the recent discourse has been dominated by charges
and counter-charges over advertising tactics _ and over McCain's
condemnation of two religious conservative leaders _ that have
prevented the senator from hammering at his message that he is a
conservative in the Reagan mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're talking about campaign reform and cutting spending
and saving the military, Republicans are very supportive,'' said
Dan Schnur, the McCain campaign's communications director. ``When
we get bogged down in push-polling and third-party attack ads and
Pat Robertson, we lose our way and the less time there is to sell
the reform message. And that's what's going to win it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In states like Maryland, where independents can vote in the
Republican primary, McCain supporters said they had all but given
up trying to appeal to the Republican faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our effort is better spent trying to get out the independents,
instead of trying to convince Republicans to change their minds,''
said Donald E. Murphy, a state delegate and one of the few elected
Republicans in the state who supports McCain.
</P>
<P>
   By aggressively emphasizing McCain's tensions with religious
conservatives, the Bush campaign is trying to stir a backlash among
Republicans _ and to score enough victories Tuesday to put down the
McCain candidacy once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that this is all about delegates right now,'' said
Scott Reed, who ran the Dole campaign four years ago. ``This is
about momentum and direction and putting away the McCain
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, is confident to the point of
being almost dismissive of McCain. That is in part a reflection of
Bush's triple victory last week. And no matter what happens
Tuesday, Bush is well positioned a week later when the contest
turns south and he has enormous advantages in his home state of
Texas and in Florida, where his brother, Jeb Bush, is governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the flavor du jour _ or was,'' Rove said, speaking of
McCain. ``There's a little bit of traction with the guy but it's
not durable, it's not long lasting, and it hasn't been.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both camps concede that McCain is not likely to catch up to win
the Republican vote in California, which means Bush would get all
the delegates. But McCain hopes to beat Bush in the popular vote,
which includes Democrats and independents. Rove said he believed
Bush may well surpass McCain in what it called the ``beauty
contest.'' Yet if there is such a split verdict _ if Bush wins the
delegates and McCain wins the popular vote _ the senator could
challenge the results and could make the case that he is more
electable because he attracts Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain camp is counting on a triumph in New York and a sweep
of the New England states. McCain seems to be running best among
Republicans in those states because they have more moderate voters
who are most hospitable to his message of campaign reform and his
attacks on religious conservatives. McCain is also competing
aggressively in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush campaign officials said they were confident
that besides California, they would prevail in New York and Ohio.
Just as McCain is running relatively uncontested in New England,
the same is true for Bush in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, the McCain campaign has seemed on the
defensive, and has been somewhat off stride because of internal
sniping and tactical blunders. For example, McCain had at first
dropped out of a nationally televised debate in Los Angeles on
Thursday with Bush and Alan Keyes. After the decision drew scalding
publicity in the state, McCain relented and agreed to participate,
but by a satellite linkup.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest question that will be answered Tuesday is
whether McCain can persuade traditional Republican voters to
support him. Both campaigns are concentrating their television
advertisements in New York, California, Ohio, Missouri and Maryland
as they make appeals to Republican voters. Here in California,
McCain has appealed to those voters in television commercials in
which he portrays himself as heir to the Reagan legacy. His
campaign has focused its energies _ and McCain's appearances _ on
Orange and San Diego Counties in Southern California. He has also
held rallies in inland cities like Stockton, Fresno, Bakersfield
and Riverside, which are more conservative than cities closer to
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But in many states, McCain's supporters said they had all but
given up trying to woo hard-core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, one of the most conservative states voting Tuesday,
the McCain campaign has essentially conceded the race to Bush. For
McCain, the state, with its increasingly urban population, was one
of his best hopes to break the governor's hold on the South. But
the candidate has not visited the state recently, and the
campaign's resources largely consist of volunteers and used, pasted
over campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   Kil Townsend, a veteran organizer who has volunteered to help
McCain's seat-of-the-pants effort in Georgia, groused at how the
candidate has neglected the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Up north in Minnesota, Bush also has a far more organized
campaign than McCain. That has left the senator's loyalists trying
to court independents who can vote in the caucuses on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials in the state said McCain had picked up
support in the area, but not among traditional Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional and core Republicans like we have here are going
to stick with the established candidate, Bush,'' said Chris
Jacobson, a local Republican official. ``As a rule, we're pretty
tried and true. One of our concerns is how many independents and
Democrats will be crossing the lines. But Bush seems to have a
stronghold on Republican voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides painting McCain as divisive and questioning his
Republican credentials, Bush has highlighted some of the more
moderate elements of his record in states where conservatives are
less of a factor in the primary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, for example, the Bush campaign produced a
statewide mailing, radio advertisements and telephone banks to
emphasize the candidate's position on such local issues as his
support of mass transit and of the Seawolf, a nuclear submarine
produced in Groton.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain organization appears far less organized. Richard
Foley, a former state Republican chairman who is a leading McCain
backer in the state, said after the New Hampshire primary, McCain
supporters collected weathered McCain placards to use back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw as many as we could in our cars after New
Hampshire,'' Foley said. ``We're not above it all. There's no room
for the guys in the expensive suits with the $20 cigars on our
team.''

DRIVEN BY FEAR, COLOMBIANS LEAVE IN DROVES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia _ The long, chaotic line outside the government
passport office here begins forming shortly after sunrise. By the
end of the day, as has been the case every workday for more than a
year, 800 to 900 passports will be issued to a multitude of
Colombians eager to leave a country that has become one of the
world's most lawless and violent. Many will be headed for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the end of 1998, the high figure had been about 500 a
day, and then only during the peak vacation season in July and
August,'' said Colombia Medina, the passport department's weary
director. ``But we no longer have a high or slow season anymore,
just a constant flow of people wanting to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   After four decades of civil conflict and a proliferation of guns
and gangs, the forces driving Colombians to abandon their country
are perhaps especially acute in this city of 2 million people, best
known for its ruthless drug cartels. But the phenomenon is
national, with people of every class leaving from small towns and
rural areas as well as large cities.
</P>
<P>
   By government estimates, 800,000 people _ 2 percent of
Colombia's total population of 40 million _ have left the country
in the last four years. The expectation is that the exodus has not
yet reached its peak because the country's problems are no nearer a
solution. And the prospect of a $1.6 billion, two-year aid package
from the United States has not eased Colombians' anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence continues to rise and left-wing guerrilla and
right-wing paramilitary groups increasingly use kidnapping and
extortion to finance their war with each other and the state.
Colombia's murder rate is 10 times that of the United States, and
last year 2,663 kidnappings were reported. Both rates, experts say,
are the world's highest.
</P>
<P>
   Such statistics, abstract as they are, have left the average
citizen with a very real feeling that there is no longer a safe
haven to be found anywhere on Colombian soil.
</P>
<P>
   The raw numbers of people leaving are alarming enough, but
because many of those exiting are highly educated professionals,
including engineers, architects and doctors, the accelerating
exodus has become a deep source of concern here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia in its entirety has been transformed into a giant
travel agency,'' Juan Fernando Cristo complained in a recent column
in El Espectador, a major national daily. ``Everyone seems disposed
to emigrate, and nothing could be worse for the country than this
growing phenomenon and the subsequent loss of human talent,
productivity and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Cali residents, a turning point came last spring when a
unit of one of the country's leftist guerrilla groups, the People's
Liberation Army, raided a church in an affluent neighborhood during
Sunday Mass and took more than 150 hostages for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, guerrilla groups now operate at will in the
surrounding countryside, setting up roadblocks, halting vehicles to
check the identities of passengers, and, in a practice known in
Colombian slang as ``miraculous fishing,'' kidnapping those whose
names appear in a laptop computer registry of the rich and
prominent. Affluent neighborhoods of the city are apparently no
safer: On Wednesday, three teen-agers were kidnapped on their way
to an elite private school.
</P>
<P>
   One man waiting in line for a passport last week was Luis
Alberto Guevara, 28, a former investigator at the prosecutor's
office here. He now works for an airport security company, but has
obtained a visa that will allow him to move to Florida and do the
same work there. The environment, he said, is certain to be ``much
calmer and less dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of insecurity here is growing tremendously, and so
our work becomes increasingly dangerous, with constant threats from
all sides,'' he said. ``I do not want my children to have to live
through what we have lived through.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent family recently began moving to Florida after
suffering through three kidnappings of family members by
guerrillas, paying a ransom each time. They are trying to liquidate
their businesses and properties and shift the rest of their assets
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this country, but the situation here has become
unbearable,'' said a family member who is still here, coordinating
the transfer, and who spoke on condition of anonymity because of
fears that he, too, could be kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone with a decent economic situation is trying to get
out,'' he said, ``because no matter how many ransoms you pay, you
are never fully vaccinated against the guerrillas, and the police
or even private security can provide no protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The affluent are not the only ones giving up. Working-class
Colombians are also leaving in growing numbers. Armando Berenguez,
a 32-year-old taxi driver, is about to go to Spain, leaving his
wife and 10-year-old child behind until he can find a job ``at a
hotel or in construction or anything that is honest'' and a place
for his family to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't dare take a fare out past the city limits here
anymore because the guerrillas will stop you at one of their
roadblocks and kidnap you and your passenger and take your car,''
he said when asked why he was leaving. ``It happens all the time to
people I know, and when you've had your car taken from you like
that, there is no way you can make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those leaving are unemployed and would ordinarily be
regarded as economic immigrants. But they are quick to reject that
label, pointing out that the recession Colombia is currently living
through, its worst in 70 years, has its origins in the guerrilla
conflict, which has intensified in recent years as efforts to find
a settlement have deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich are getting themselves and their money out of the
country as fast as they can, and the guerrillas keep on bombing
power pylons and oil pipelines, which makes the foreign companies
afraid to invest here,'' said Juan Carlos Rios, 28, an electrician
about to head for the Netherlands Antilles, where a sister-in-law
works as a hotel chambermaid. ``That means there is no work for
people like me, and we become victims of a crisis we did not
create.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to curb the drug trafficking profits that allow the
guerrillas to buy weapons, recruit fighters and maintain a huge
network of informants, the Clinton administration is proposing a
$1.6 billion two-year emergency aid package for Colombia. But that
plan, too, seems to be contributing to the jitters that are driving
Colombians abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things are this bad now, what is going to happen when all
the gringo money gets here?'' asked Juan Pablo Robles, 34, a
technician who is about to go to Spain. ``The whole country is
going to become a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics provided by the U.S. Embassy in Bogota,
Colombians are seeking entry to the United States at a record rate:
366,423 applied for nonimmigrant visas last year, compared with
150,514 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the requests for nonimmigrant visas and
just over half of the 11,345 applications for immigrant visas were
granted last year, embassy records indicate.
</P>
<P>
   The preferred destinations of Colombians fleeing to the United
States are said to be Miami, New York City and parts of New
England. Large Colombian immigrant communities are already well
established there and newcomers can hope to be received warmly by
relatives, former neighbors or schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the United States remains the dream of most of those
who are leaving,'' said Medina, the passport official. ``But
getting an American visa can be a real problem, so a lot of people
are also going to Spain'' or to nearby countries like Costa Rica,
which does not require visas of Colombians.
</P>
<P>
   Applications for political asylum in the United States, while
still small in absolute terms, have also begun to rise, as has the
approval rate for such claims, according to Immigration and
Naturalization Service figures. In the last quarter of 1999, the
agency received 396 political asylum requests from Colombians,
compared with 334 in the previous 12 months, and the approval rate
rose from 19 percent in 1998 to 46 percent by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Colombian government agency that oversees
immigration matters, at least 565,000 Colombians, or one of every
five travelers, who left the country from 1996 to 1998 did not
return. Final figures for 1999 are still being compiled, but
government officials say everything points to a sharp increase in
the rate of departure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Picking up on the trend, the newspaper El Tiempo recently
published what it called ``an inventory of reasons not to leave for
the United States.'' These ranged from ``You really have to stop
completely at stop signs'' and ``There are not as many holidays,''
to even more fanciful considerations like ``The natives do not know
how to dance either salsa or merengue'' and the coffee and
chocolate are inferior.
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade ago, ``the extraditable leaders of the drug
cartels said they preferred `a tomb in Colombia to a jail cell in
the United States,''' the newspaper reminded its readers. But
``many Colombians today prefer any space whatsoever in the colossus
of the north to a moral, physical, psychological, or employment
tomb here in our own country.''

NEW FLOOD AID TO MOZAMBIQUE, AND SOME COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique _ Saturday's headline in the daily newspaper
Noticias hit a nerve: ``West Closes Its Eyes to Tragedy in
Mozambique.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, eagerly awaited U.S. and British military helicopters
will start searching for those still stranded by devastating floods
and hauling food and medical supplies to the hundreds of thousands
of people left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But while government officials and relief workers have applauded
the imminent arrival of the 10 helicopters, six fixed-wing planes
and hundreds of soldiers, other people in Mozambique are
complaining that the outside world took too long to respond to the
crisis here.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the aircraft and soldiers start flying, virtually
all of the people trapped on trees and rooftops will already have
been saved. And the flood waters of the Limpopo and other rivers
have started to recede, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which had issued an urgent appeal for $65
million, has received only about half that amount, officials said
Saturday. And on Friday, Leonardo Simao, the foreign minister,
bluntly told reporters that he believed the delays in assistance
had resulted in unnecessary deaths. No one knows exactly how many
people have died, but relief agencies estimate the toll in the
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the response had been more quick, I believe more lives
could have been saved,'' Simao said after meeting in South Africa
with ministers from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. ``I
believe the inertia of bureaucracy is evident.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who have already committed over $11 million to
the relief effort, say they responded as quickly and efficiently as
possible. No one _ not the Mozambican government, nor the relief
workers on the ground _ expected the flood waters to rise so
dramatically on the weekend of Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no question that the assistance from the United
States and Britain is still desperately needed and welcomed.
Mozambique is still struggling to distribute food, shelter and
medicine to nearly 1 million people who have lost houses, food
supplies or livelihoods and to rebuild this country's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate does highlight the simmering resentment felt by
many government officials and relief workers across Africa who say
the powerful nations of the world often fail to act as quickly here
as elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring South Africa, which sent seven of its 100 military
helicopters for the worst of the crisis, has come under fire for
sending so few.
</P>
<P>
   South African military officials say they needed helicopters for
missions in flooded areas of South Africa, which also experienced
torrential rains. And they feared that sending too many helicopters
to Mozambique might result in deadly collisions. ``We did all we
could,'' said Sam Mkhwanzi, a spokesman for the South African
Ministry of Defense. ``We were having our own floods, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation was also complicated by the changing nature of the
disaster itself. The first floods started in mid-February. By Feb.
26, most people thought the worst was over.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had already sent in six disaster assessment
experts and donated about $630,000 for food, emergency health
centers and logistical support. Relief agencies had begun to send
emergency crews home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first phase of the floods was coming to a relatively
satisfactory end,'' said Ross Mountain, the United Nations' special
envoy to Mozambique. ``Then last weekend, the skies opened in
Zimbabwe and South Africa. This came down the river and that's when
this much greater challenge arose.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The appeals went out to the world last weekend, and by midweek,
with television stations broadcasting footage of the flooding, the
United States had pledged helicopters, hundreds of troops and more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Some relief workers and government officials argue that
helicopters should have arrived almost immediately, in the early
days of last week, and that the United States and Britain could
have done more to get them there. The role of Portugal, the
colonial ruler of Mozambique until 1975, also came under fire,
particularly because Lisbon currently holds the presidency of the
European Union, normally a source of disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   But Mountain said he believes the world contributed what it
could. ``One can always say we must do better,'' he said. ``But I
think countries and governments have moved pretty quickly.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ None of the facts have changed in the year since
Amadou Diallo died in his doorway: four white police officers, 41
bullets and one unarmed black man. But in neighborhoods from one
end of the city to the other, away from the daily protests over the
slain man and the political posturing, New Yorkers' attitudes about
the police have begun a subtle shift.
</P>
<P>
   It is reflected in the deeply divided relationship that Jude
Mignon, a barber in Brooklyn, has with the police. Mignon, 32, a
co-owner of the Chocolate City Barber Shop and Cafe in Crown
Heights, said that officers from the local precinct regularly stop
in to chat, and that their presence has been good for business.
</P>
<P>
   But at night, he said, the police seem more like a rude gang in
sweatshirts and jeans. A couple of times while walking home from
work, Mignon said, he has been stopped by plainclothes officers,
pushed against a wall and frisked.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a pose with his arms outstretched to display his baggy
clothes and cascading dreadlocks, Mignon said: ``To look at me, you
wouldn't know if I sold drugs or owned a business. But if you are
from this community, you would know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``I don't hate all cops. Some of them are real cool
to me. But some have too much power.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year since the storm of police bullets in the Soundview
section of the Bronx, New York has been racked with noisy confusion
from protests over police brutality, high-profile warnings against
the dangers of an anti-police backlash and the spectacle of a
public trial. Yet interviews with nearly 100 people in three
boroughs last week show that the public furor over the case masks
signs of a complex new consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the the angry clamor, or maybe because of it, some New
Yorkers say they have a fresh sense of the perils of police work.
And it appears that the Police Department, besieged by community
complaints, has redoubled its efforts to focus on outreach as well
as arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 100 interviews a year ago, soon after Diallo was
killed, the mood of the city was darker. New Yorkers of all races
said they worried about police aggression, and many residents _
blacks in particular _ expressed their distrust with palpable
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   After the acquittal of the four officers on Feb. 25, that
distress continues. Interviews were conducted last week in the
neighborhoods along the No. 2 subway line, which threads its way
though a variety of economic and ethnic neighborhoods, including
housing projects in the Bronx and a youth center in Brooklyn; an
atrium cafe on Wall Street and a public park in Harlem; a hangout
for black professionals in Brooklyn, and a leather boutique in
Greenwich Village. Those talks showed that there was still deep
anxiety across the city over the death of Diallo and the acquittal
of the four officers who fired the fatal barrage.
</P>
<P>
   White New Yorkers _ bankers on Wall Street, commuters at
Pennsylvania Station and retirees in the West Village _ said they
were stunned that the four officers had been acquitted, and they
worried aloud about increasing racial tension.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and Latinos in wealthy and working-class neighborhoods
vehemently criticized both the acquittals and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's unwavering support of the police, saying that these
factors had magnified their anger and deepened their fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not getting any better,'' Robert Ali, 48, said while
people-watching at the Fulton Street Mall in Brooklyn. ``After
something bad happens, the healing will start, but then there is
another episode. So you have to ask yourself, `Are things really
going to change?'''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, however, to reflect on their own experiences with
the police and their overall feelings about the department, some
people expressed a mixture of feelings. Comments from very few
people reflected the tone of the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has referred
to the police as some kind of occupying force. And very few
espoused Giuliani's staunch defense of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Most attitudes fell in a conflicted place between those two
poles. After speaking for several minutes about how upset she feels
over the Diallo shooting, Kirsten Levingston, a lawyer, concluded
that she could come to no conclusion about her feelings toward the
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually do have a complex view of the police,'' said
Levingston, a black woman with one child, who lives in Brooklyn.
``It's both `I feel for you, you have a tough job' mixed with `You
need to be more respectful and decent to the people you are
serving.'''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, shortly after Diallo had been buried in Guinea, his
homeland, The New York Times interviewed an equally broad group of
New Yorkers. The aim, then as now, was to learn how people viewed
their growing police force as the city neared the end of a
renaissance decade marked by plummeting crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Whites who were interviewed then expressed sharp interest in and
concern over the way Diallo died, even though many said they could
not imagine something like that ever happening to them. In them,
the shooting stirred frustrations over strict, some said rude,
enforcement of petty matters like leash and traffic regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Faint echoes of those feelings were heard in interviews with
whites last week, but many acknowledged that their interest in the
case had waned and that the police had returned to being an
invisible part of their world.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Pommes said his attitudes about the police have evolved
over the last year. Pommes, a 27-year-old book publicist, said that
immediately after Diallo was killed, he worried that the police
were using ``horrific force'' to fight crime. Now, he says, he has
a ``more balanced'' view of the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a job to do, and it is a hard job,'' Pommes said
while waiting at Pennsylvania Station for a train home to Long
Island. ``Sometimes they do it well, and sometimes they make
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Long Islander at the station, Sherry Gellis, said: ``I
do not think police do things carelessly. I think they can become
unnerved, like most human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and Latinos remain more on edge. A year ago, in the fury
over the shooting of Diallo, many spoke in bitterly hostile tones
about the police presence in their communities, with almost no
positive reflections.
</P>
<P>
   And the acquittal of the four officers dredged up those same
deep strains of anger and distrust that linger in minority
communities, where people feel unfairly targeted by crime-fighting
strategies that rely on waves of street searches.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Stopping to chat in the North Bronx, Sgt. Richard Rodriguez of
the Marine Corps Reserve, a Persian Gulf war veteran, said that as
a military man, he was ashamed of the behavior of the New York
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been halfway around the world,'' Rodriguez said. ``I've
lived with police in North Carolina and in California. And the
police department here, I'd say 50 percent are foul.''
</P>
<P>
   As he entered the Hoyt Street subway station in Brooklyn,
Shikwan Galliego, a security guard, said more aggressive police
tactics have taken too large a toll on communities like his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should have to put up with cops harassing us
so that we can have less crime,'' he said, clutching the hand of
his 2-year-old son. ``They are supposed to stop criminals, not
anybody who's black.''
</P>
<P>
   But in more than a few of the neighborhoods visited last week,
people did not speak of the Police Department as monolithic. What
emerged from their experiences with the police was the image of a
Jekyll-and-Hyde agency with two distinct personalities.
</P>
<P>
   One is embodied by the uniformed beat officer, whose attributes
were best described by a group of giggling teen-agers outside Clara
Barton High School in Crown Heights. Shivering in the chilly
breeze, the girls said officers from the nearby precinct station
house regularly visited their school and some played basketball
with them after classes.
</P>
<P>
   Sharisse Hewitt, 17, said she had seen the officers help lost
children get home. Eimy Aguilar, 15, said the police have restored
security to the apartment building where she lives. ``They are
there 24-7 trying to get the drugs out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Jermaina Howard, 16, said that she once approached an
officer on the street to ask for information on becoming a police
officer and found him enthusiastic and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The other part of the Police Department, specialized units, is
the centerpiece of Commissioner Howard Safir's crime-fighting
strategies. In some operations, the department flushes the street
with plainclothes officers to sweep out guns and drugs. Others use
small plainclothes squads to root out a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who shot Diallo were part of the Street Crime Unit,
as was Officer Louis Rivera, who shot and killed another Bronx man
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The newest such units, organized under the name Operation
Condor, have already made more than 13,500 arrests since they
started in mid-January, according to department records. There are
no figures on how many people were stopped and frisked to reach
such arrest figures.
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets, where the units are notoriously unpopular,
most minority residents interviewed last week had been stopped and
searched at least once or knew someone who had been.
</P>
<P>
   K. Lee Johnson, a 28-year-old musician and producer for Big East
Entertainment in Harlem, has had an angry encounter with the
special units. He recalled a time last November in Queens when
three plainclothes officers descended upon him from an unmarked car
and frisked him, saying they were looking for guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt humiliated,'' Johnson recalled. ``I felt I had no right
to walk the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   While the experience left him shaken, he has also watched his
neighborhood become safer and more vibrant because of the police.
When asked how he felt about them, he gave a love-hate answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime has cleaned up,'' he said. ``You can walk down the
street and feel secure. You know they are on the beat and looking
out for your safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ``But in the same manner, you're afraid of cops.
You never know what a cop will do when he approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of conflicted experiences and feelings about the
police were expressed by numerous people who live and work along
the path of the No. 2 subway.
</P>
<P>
   At the southern end of the line, in Flatbush, Derrick Dawson,
31, runs recreational programs for about 200 youths at the
neighborhood YMCA. On Feb. 25, shortly after the four officers were
acquitted of murdering Diallo, Dawson was expecting the kids to
gather for their weekly ``teen night.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought seriously about canceling, thinking that
tempers could flare. Instead, he decided to let the teen-agers come
and vent.
</P>
<P>
   Crammed into the small auditorium, they were silent at first, he
said. But slowly the trickle of angry questions turned into a
flood.
</P>
<P>
   He said the teen-agers asked how it was possible that the
officers could be acquitted on all charges in the Diallo shooting.
They wondered what it meant for their own safety. They wondered
whether there was anything they could do to protect themselves from
the people who were supposed to be protecting them. They wondered
whether they could really trust the police.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson said he reminded the angry group about the officers who
had been friends to them, who had helped young teen-agers stay out
of trouble, who play basketball in Y-leagues, who participate in
career seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more than anything, the reason the kids did not do
anything that night was because they have relationships with police
officers,'' said Dawson, who was born and raised in the
neighborhood. ``I don't think the kids think all police are bad.
They just felt betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as possible, he said, he wants to arrange for officers
from the local precinct to visit the center and speak directly to
the teen-agers there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand. We have Latin Kings. We have Crips. We
have Bloods. We have all the gangs,'' he said, ``but we tell the
kids when you walk through that door, leave your colors outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be a safe haven for the kids,'' he said. ``And
we want them to keep their positive relationship with the police.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To the north along the subway line, near the Atlantic Avenue
stop, there is a laid-back crowd of black professionals hanging out
at Lucian Blue. Wayne Rambharose, the owner, said he opened the
restaurant and bar, with soft yellow walls lighted by votives,
because he wanted to bring a bit of SoHo to the black middle-class
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Rambharose, 37, looked the image of cool, wearing an Afro and
glasses with blue-tinted lenses the size of quarters. He has never
been hassled by the police, he said. In fact, his relations with
officers have been pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   But the shooting of Diallo and the acquittal of the officers
shattered his attitude about the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a really, really unhealthy atmosphere in New York
right now,'' he said. ``It's not even a racial thing anymore, with
whites against blacks. But there is a divide between police and all
the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the atmosphere he blamed on the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never made an effort to embrace blacks,'' Rambharose
said. ``There's never been any extension of an olive branch, and
this is a time when that is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the bar, Emmett Devon Harrell struggled to
reconcile his anger over the verdicts with his positive feelings
toward the police.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he is a product of the prosperous times of
the last several years in New York, times that allow more and more
young men to spend $450 on the leather jackets he designs. But, he
said, the shooting of Diallo and the acquittals were like a reality
check.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it really comes down to it, whites still have all the
power, and we have none,'' said Harrell, who is black, ``no matter
how successful we may think we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he found it hard to summon rage against the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they all have good intentions,'' he said. ``It's
just that some of them let their egos get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Manhattan, three young men who work for a Wall
Street bank sat and discussed their feelings about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McWilliams, 31, who is white, said he had ``negative
feelings'' because he believes that the police are rude and
arrogant with white suspects and are racist in their dealings with
black suspects. The Diallo shooting, he said, supports that.
</P>
<P>
   But Dom Romano, 27, disagreed. He said he thought the police in
New York have done well in lowering crime across the city, and he
saw the Diallo shooting as an honest mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that neighborhood, if I was a white cop and I saw a black
guy reach in his back pocket, I'd be on edge,'' he said. ``You hate
to stereotype, but I can definitely understand why they were
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Upper West Side, Anita L. Halton, a 21-year-old white
woman, waited with friends for the start of their jazz dance class.
She said she is almost oblivious to the police. ``I actually feel
very ignored by the police,'' she said with a shrug. ``It's almost
an invisible force to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the police presence at the north end of the No. 2 line has
changed the landscape, in ways good and bad. Parks are not littered
with syringes, and mothers say they are less afraid to let their
children play outside.
</P>
<P>
   Cavan E. Sherland, 32, a barber in the Williamsbridge section of
the Bronx, said he gets regular courtesy visits from the police in
the neighborhood and is reassured by their presence. But he does
not recognize the officers who have stopped him for questions after
he locks up at night. And what is worse, he said, the officers do
not know him.

<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan _ If the Taliban are anything, they are
holier-than-thou. And that's what made the big heist so
embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   In the cold predawn of Jan. 13, thieves made off with more than
$200,000 in cash from Kabul's main money bazaar. The brigands were
methodical in their noisy work, dismantling the metal shutters and
jimmying the locks on 10 stores. They met no opposition from the
Taliban soldiers who stand watch over the deserted bazaar at night.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, come morning, those guards, like the money, were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to have been an inside job,'' said a currency
trader, Haji Amanullah, who lost $165,000. This was not, he quickly
realized, the most prudent answer to give about the Islamic
fundamentalists who control most of the country. So he hastened to
amend: ``I'm not saying the Taliban did this. I completely trust
the Taliban. It was probably done by people in the clothing of the
Taliban, impostors from the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamentably, with all its other woes, Afghanistan's forlorn
capital is suffering a mini-crime wave, a rare circumstance in
recent years. Chopping off a robber's hands and feet has generally
deterred those inclined toward banditry.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the money bazaar been hit twice, several homes have
been burgled in the last two months by armed ruffians who work in
the wee hours, seemingly untroubled by a 9 p.m. curfew enforced at
the Taliban militia's checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, our enemies have become active in Kabul,
infiltrating people into the city for the purpose of besmirching
our reputation,'' said Mullah Ghulam Haider, a white-bearded judge
who dispenses the Taliban's stern wrath on criminals. ``Our
security forces will leave no stone unturned until we catch these
people and end this rash of robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are notoriously tough on rule breakers, meting out
severe punishments for murder, adultery, homosexuality, improper
dress, watching television or listening to music. And while many
Afghans complain about Islamic strictures that seem medieval, they
have praised the Taliban for eliminating crime.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a doctor who was stabbed and his money taken,'' said
Muhammad Naseem, a jeweler. ``If someone comes into this shop and
says, `Stick your hands up,' how can I resist? The Taliban have
forbidden people to have guns.''
</P>
<P>
   As is the case everywhere, people say they do not want to point
a finger at anyone _ and then they point and point. Not all the
Taliban are pure of heart, many allege.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an implausible theory. Afghanistan is notable for
fluid loyalties and vendible comradeship. Much of the militia's
battlefield success is owed to cash gifts paid to local warlords
who then joined the movement and brought along their troops.
Taliban trained in religious schools have become mixed together
with Ali-come-latelies less devoted to Islamic uprightness. It is
hard to vouch for partisans who have been purchased.
</P>
<P>
   There are other hypotheses, too, including the sociological ones
that lay the blame on poverty. ``Unemployment leads to crime,''
said Abdul Qadir, a money trader. ``People do not have enough to
eat these days. What do you expect them to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Deprivation is certainly rife. War has been a constant in
Afghanistan for 21 straight years. The economy capsized long ago.
Good research is impossible in such mayhem, but experts believe the
average annual income to be less than $175.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the scene of the great $200,000 heist _ the money
bazaar known as Sarai Shahzadah, or House of the Prince _ is an
excellent location to observe many of the peculiarities of the
present-day economy _ the impact of the war, the injunctions of
Islam, the desperation of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the crime victim, Amanullah, after initially
naming the Taliban as suspects in taking his $165,000, was not
finished in his heedful exoneration of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy with the Taliban,'' he said. ``I have been
personally assured that their supreme leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar,
is sorry for my loss, and if the money is not recovered, the
Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will stand liable for the full
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanullah is a tall man who was wearing a white skull cap, a
black leather jacket and an expensive watch, a gift from his
brother, a carpet dealer in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are elated with the Taliban,'' he again emphasized. ``They
have our full trust.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sarai Shahzadah has 225 small storefronts on three levels. While
it is Kabul's financial hub, it looks like a cheap motel. In the
courtyard, hundreds of small-timers try to get in on the action,
hectically trading tiny sums of dollars, Afghanis, Pakistani rupees
and German marks, hoping to go home with $1 profit for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no work in Kabul,'' said Shams Muhammad, 30, a textile
engineer. ``This bazaar is full of engineers, teachers and doctors.
We stand here all day, exchanging currency for people who come by,
making a few cents on every transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The amateur traders may be short of wealth, but they are not
wanting for sheer bulk of cash. By necessity, they carry around
foot-high stacks of paper money.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre bit of banking, Afghanistan's currency is printed
by the Taliban's remaining opposition, the government of
Burhanuddin Rabbani, who unceremoniously fled Kabul in 1996. Most
nations still recognize the old government, which faces high costs
in keeping up its end of the civil war and prints excessive amounts
of cash to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as such things always go, the more money that is
manufactured the less it is worth. Ten years ago, the Afghani was
trading at about 50 to $1; five years ago 3,000 to $1; last year
40,000 to $1; now, about 54,000 to $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thieves were wise to steal dollars,'' joked Amin Khustai,
the amiable president of the bazaar. ``Can you imagine the weight
of so many Afghanis?''
</P>
<P>
   Out came the calculators. Using notes worth 5,000 Afghanis _ the
second highest denomination _ the equivalent of $200,000 would tip
the scale at 24 tons.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the use of the incredible shrinking Afghani
is the fact that two types are in circulation, the other being
leftovers that were printed by a second opposition figure, the now
self-exiled Abdul Rashid Dostum. In some cities, like Kabul, these
alternate bills are worthless. In others, like Dostum's one-time
redoubt Mazar-i-Sharif, they fetch about half value.
</P>
<P>
   To an untrained eye, the Rabbani and Dostum currencies look
identical. But with money so dear, few eyes can afford to be
untrained. As each bill is inspected at the point of purchase, all
but the smallest of transactions seems to require the time it would
take to authenticate a painting.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Afghani remains the common currency of the
street, though with its value in free fall, merchants quickly try
to convert the bills to another currency. Besides, Afghanis take up
too much space. Big pockets are needed just to buy a bottle of jam.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are few private banks in Afghanistan. According to the
Taliban, Koranic law prohibits the payment of interest. ``In Islam,
banks may loan a customer money for a specific project, but only if
there is an arrangement to share in both the profits and losses,''
said Abdul Manan Deobandi, the third deputy governor of the
national bank.
</P>
<P>
   Most people with a sizable amount of cash keep it with a
currency trader like the recently looted Amanullah. He is one of
the bazaar's leading figures, though his shop, one of the nicer
ones, is but a single narrow room with a badly cracked teller's
window.
</P>
<P>
   It is a busy place, with tea always brewing on a small stove.
Men enter with their armfuls of Afghanis, placing them on an old
table, unburdening themselves as if they had been hauling a cord of
wood. Amanullah records deposits by hand in a ledger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is safe here in the bazaar,'' he said proudly,
momentarily forgetting his robbery.
</P>
<P>
   He was reminded of that unfortunate incident, and this pleased
him greatly, for it gave him another chance to mention his support
of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban provide excellent security,'' he said. ``We are
very, very happy with them.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exceptionally mild air for early March will spread from the
Plains to the Eastern States during the next few days. Meanwhile, a
series of Pacific disturbances will keep much of the West unsettled
with valley showers and mountain snow.
</P>
<P>
   Record-setting warmth will envelop most of the Missouri and
northern Mississippi Valleys on Sunday. Increasing breezes from the
south will combine with plentiful sunshine to boost afternoon
readings above 70 degrees in these regions. Elsewhere in the Plains
and Mississippi Valley, it will be mainly dry and mild although
isolated showers will occur in the increasingly humid air across
central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A tandem of low pressure areas will promote inclement weather in
most of the Southwest. Rain will be locally heavy near a front in
southern California, especially where moist winds ascend the
sloping terrain of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains.
Farther east, intermittent snow will occur from the southern Sierra
to the mountains of northern Arizona and Utah. Showers will dampen
many valleys of the interior Southwest. Drier air will reach the
coast from Washington to northern California as offshore winds
develop.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will be a bit cooler than Saturday as gusty winds
from the northwest develop in the wake of a cold front. Clouds and
a few flurries will occur from the Adirondacks to northern New
England, particularly early Sunday. Elsewhere, ample sunshine will
prevail from the Middle Atlantic States to the Southeast with
afternoon temperatures a bit above the seasonal average.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: March Contrasts
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a heavy wet snowstorm blanketed much of western and
northern Kansas. By Saturday afternoon, temperatures will surge
into the 70s in the same region. Spectacular contrasts like this
are the signature of the third month. The strengthening March sun
steadily warms the equatorial regions while arctic air lingers over
Canadian tundra. Storms in the atmosphere mix air masses in an
effort to eliminate temperature differences. In March, these storms
can draw warm tropical air toward the north as easily as they bring
the last vestiges of winter south.

   WASTE _ WASHINGTON _The reform movement, which has been
languishing in recent years, may be making a comeback in this
year's presidential elections. The war on waste and pork barrel
spending is seen as a powerful image in John McCain's insurgency
against politics as usual. Exit polls indicate that reform has a
strong appeal, especially for his backers. The message is one more
jarring one for the capital, where even Republicans have allowed
the crusade against waste and pork to languish in recent years.

Now, facing their third deadline to reach an agreement, negotiators
are saying that immense complexities unforeseen at the start of the
negotiations may negate efforts to devise formulas for sharing the
waters of two major river basins. For instance, heavy use of
groundwater for crop irrigation in southwest Georgia has emerged as
a pivotal issue in the negotiations. The deliberators acknowledge
that so little is known about the impact of irrigation on river
flows in the region that several more years of intense study is
needed before they can some to a substantive agreement. When
Alabama triggered the water war 10 years ago by suing the Corps of
Engineers over metro Atlatna's water use, the irrigation issue was
not even regarded as a problem. (Seabrook, Atlanta

socks and black dress shoes. But as soon as he enters the woods,
McCarter, 55, comes to life with his deep voice explaining the
medicinal uses of several plants along our path. Before his
retirement, McCarter spent 25 years with the park service and
estimates that he has been on about 100 searches. ``He's the best
tracker I've ever known,'' says John Houck, chief ranger of the
Smoky Mountain park. He sees things that normal people don't see.
They call it 'cutting sign.' I still can't get it.'' (Harmon,

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Increasingly concerned about a backlash to its
growing reliance on the National Guard and Reserve, the Army has
decided to limit overseas deployments of these units in
peacekeeping and other military operations to a maximum of six
months, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's decision will shorten the time these troops have to
be away from home, which Pentagon and Army officials hope will ease
the strain that a rising number of calls to active duty have had on
reservists, their families and, especially, their employers.
</P>
<P>
   The new limit is the first significant step by the Army to
recognize that its greater reliance on the Guard and Reserve _ like
that of all the other armed services _ has so intensified the
burden on its citizen-soldiers that it threatens to undermine their
willingness to join or stay in those units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to continue to rely on this part of the force,''
said Charles L. Cragin, the assistant secretary of defense for
reserve affairs, ``and therefore we have to look at things we can
do to make it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the scaling back of the military that followed the fall of
the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Guard and Reserves have played a
larger role in American military operations than ever before. There
are now three simultaneous presidential mobilizations of reservists
_ for Bosnia, Kosovo and the continuing containment of Iraq _ and
there is no end in sight to any of them. The president still has
the authority to call up troops for Haiti, too, but the American
military has largely ended its presence there.
</P>
<P>
   For the Army, the increased reliance has been the unintended
consequence of a deliberate decision made after the Vietnam War to
put critical support units, from engineers to civil affairs
specialists, in the Guard and Reserve. It was a response by the
Army's chief of staff at the time, Gen. Creighton Abrams, to
President Johnson's decision not to call up the reserves during the
Vietnam War for fear of generating greater opposition to it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, whenever Army units conduct an overseas operation,
at least some reservists go along. Moreover, with the tempo of
peacekeeping operations having increased through the 1990s, Army
leaders say they now have no choice but to turn even more to the
564,000 members of its Guard and Reserve to ease the burden on its
active force of 479,000, despite the strains that has placed on
reservists who must set aside their civilian lives, including
college educations or jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy has raised questions _ in the Pentagon and,
just as important, on Capitol Hill _ about the structure of today's
Army and its budget if it cannot meet its worldwide missions
without relying so heavily on the Guard and Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, two of the Army's 10 active divisions, the 10th
Mountain and the 1st Mechanized Infantry, classified themselves
unready for war because so many of their troops were committed to
Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This helps explain why Army officials defend their increased
reliance on the Guard and Reserve for a greater share of
peacekeeping as a way to let the Army focus on the Pentagon's
stated strategy, which is to fight and win two major regional wars
nearly at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Integration is the right thing to do,'' said P.T. Henry, the
Army's assistant secretary for reserve affairs, referring to the
service's plans to incorporate more and more Guard and Reserve
units into continuing operations. ``The benefit is that we can
share the load. We're willing, in knowing that, to pick up the
attending consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's decision to shorten overseas rotations is one of a
series of steps the Pentagon has taken to address what officials
acknowledge are the new burdens being placed on the nation's
citizen-soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's chief of staff, Gen. Erik K. Shinseki, is expected to
announce the decision on Tuesday at a ceremony handing over command
of the American sector of NATO's peacekeeping operation in Bosnia
to the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter rotation will not apply to the 700 men and women
from the 49th, including its headquarters company and aviation,
engineering, communications and military police units, who will
serve in Bosnia for nearly eight months. The call-up of the 49th is
the largest single deployment of Guard troops since the Persian
Gulf war in 1990 and 1991. The 49th will be the first unit to take
command of an overseas operation since the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, in fact, the Guard and Reserves were
underused, Pentagon officials say. They were literally held in
reserve for ``the big one,'' which never came. With President
Johnson adamant about not turning to the Guard and Reserves,
joining them was a way to avoid being drafted for the war in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The increased reliance on the Guard and Reserves has brought
some political fallout, especially on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers
echo the complaints of reservists about the strains the deployments
have created and question the Army's intent to rely more heavily on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, inside as well as outside the Pentagon, have
questioned whether the Defense Department would ever have to
actually fight two nearly simultaneous regional wars, which has
been the policy since 1993. Modifying this policy, they argued,
would allow the Pentagon to ease training requirements on the
active force, freeing troops for missions the Army is conducting _
and requiring less use of the Guard and Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   After reducing the Army to 479,000 soldiers today from 770,000
in 1989, Army officials argue that the force is now not configured
to carry out what the Pentagon calls ``operations other than war''
and still spend enough time preparing to fight major wars. The
phrase ``operations other than war'' refers to unanticipated
missions, like those in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and now Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could argue that the Army is well structured for the most
stressing threat to our vital interests, potentially presented by
two nearly simultaneous major theater wars,'' said Col. Blair Ross,
an Army officer who serves in the Department of Defense's strategy
office, ``but that it is not as well structured for some of the
day-to-day requirements of engagement.''

WASHINGTON: of engagement.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The growth in Army operations other than war has led to calls
for increasing the total number of active troops, something that
Army leaders have echoed, but that the Department of Defense
opposes, citing the expense and the difficulties in recruiting
enough soldiers today.
</P>
<P>
   Critics on Capitol Hill, including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson,
R-Texas, complain that the real problem is the number of
peacekeeping missions to which President Clinton has committed
American troops. Hutchinson said an increased reliance on the Guard
and Reserves should not become a routine policy because of the
impact such deployments have on reservists and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army's effort to ease the burden of these deployments is
encouraging,'' she said, ``yet fails to address the underlying
problems caused by deployments that are not in our national
interest and appear to have no end.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the trend appears likely to continue _ and even
grow.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Pentagon report, the Reserve Component Employment Study
2005, predicted that five years from now there would still be at
least two peacekeeping missions like Bosnia and Kosovo. The report
also called on the services to do more to use the Guard and
Reserves, including giving them a significant role in defending the
nation against possible terrorist attacks and the national missile
defense system the Pentagon is planning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered the services
to remove ``all structural barriers'' to integrating Guard and
Reserve units into active-duty operations. It may be one of his
lasting legacies as secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Since the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia began in 1995, more
than 33,000 of the 150,000 troops who have served there _ 22
percent _ have belonged to the Guard and Reserves many of them in
specialties that exist primarily in the Army's Reserve components,
such as public affairs, medics, transportation and psychological
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the 49th's headquarters company represents a
further expansion of the Guard's role in Bosnia. The Army has
already scheduled deployments in Bosnia of headquarters units of
the 29th Infantry Division from Virginia and the 28th Infantry
Division from Pennsylvania, as well as combat brigades from North
Carolina, Oklahoma, Georgia, Idaho and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Army and Pentagon officials say they have not yet fully measured
the long-term ramifications of an increased reliance on the Guard
and Reserves. They hope that steps like the Army's will assuage
some of the concerns. In recent years, the Pentagon has also
offered new benefits to reservists, including expanded dental care
and access to government rates on airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's decision to shorten rotations for its Guard and
Reserve units applies only to operations other than war. In the
event of a conflict, the Army will still be able to mobilize its
Guard and Reserve units and send them overseas for the 270 days
allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   The policy brings the Army closer in line to the other services.
Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units, for example,
generally deploy no more than three months, though some individual
commanders and specialists serve as long as six.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Army officials described the shift as a matter of fairness,
since active Army units generally deploy from their home posts for
only six-months. They concede that over time the policy could
increase the number of Guard and Reserve units called to serve, but
added that shortening deployments could ease the impact on
individual reservists, especially with their civilian employers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Army limited deployments of doctors, nurse
anesthetists and dentists to 90 days after more than a third of the
doctors ordered to Bosnia from 1995 to 1998 quit the Reserve rather
than risk being called away from their civilian practices again.
Officials said they realized that most doctors could not afford to
be away from their patients more than 90 days without risking their
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Robert J. St. Onge Jr., the Army's deputy chief of
staff for operations and plans, said the demands of rising
deployments also affected soldiers on active duty. Like their Guard
and Reserve counterparts, the active-duty soldiers faced repeated
tours and months away from home, something officials believe has
eroded morale and hurt recruiting and retention of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, however, is that members of the Guard and
Reserves sign up for military duty expecting to serve 39 days a
year _ one weekend a month and two weeks each summer _ not for 270
days. And expectations have been slow to change.
</P>
<P>
   St. Onge recalled hearing a radio advertisement for the New
Jersey National Guard recently that extolled the benefits of
joining, including extra pay and college grants. ``I kept waiting
to hear the shoe drop: `And you can serve in exotic places,''' he
said. ``It never came.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing use of the Guard and Reserve has challenged many
assumptions about the Army, from its strategies to its structure to
its budget. ``The whole dynamic has changed,'' St. Onge said. ``And
frankly, if it goes south, we're going to have to look at a new way
of doing business.''

campaigning against Bush for the Republican presidential

executions until authorities determine whether the convictions

ANALYSIS: BACK IN CHILE, PINOCHET IS A REAL NOWHERE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ When Gen. Augusto Pinochet traveled to London
16 months ago on a diplomatic passport, he was still a powerful
force on the Chilean political scene. He was a leader of
conservatives in Congress as a senator for life who could pick up
the telephone to weigh in on crucial military matters.
</P>
<P>
   No one seriously suggested that the former dictator would ever
be prosecuted for his past.
</P>
<P>
   But when he returned home Friday _ benefiting from a British
decision that he was too infirm to stand trial in Spain on charges
of gross human rights violations during his 17 years in power _ the
84-year-old was a shadow of his former self.
</P>
<P>
   His political future is being negotiated by military and
civilian officials who do not even consult him. Several of his
closest former aides are under arrest, and he himself faces months
if not years of legal proceedings to escape prosecution here.
</P>
<P>
   His own seat in the senate, which he was granted under a
constitution written during his 17-year military rule, now appears
to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For Pinochet, it is a bleak panorama.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Lavin, the star of the Chilean right, who nearly won the
presidential election in January, did not attend the small airport
ceremony honoring Pinochet's return. The few conservative
politicians who did come were quick to tell reporters that they
were there as private citizens, not as representatives of their
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Ricardo Lagos, the first Socialist president of Chile
since Pinochet overthrew Salvador Allende in 1973, have let it be
known that Pinochet is not invited to his inauguration March 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a great majority of the population,'' an editorial in the
daily La Tercera argued on Friday, ``Pinochet is now part of the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was at the height of his powers, Pinochet bragged that
``not a leaf shakes in Chile without my knowledge.'' And people
believed him, even after he gave up the presidency in 1990. The man
who ruled Chile for 17 years only stepped down after losing a
plebiscite, but he was able to negotiate a sweet deal from his
civilian opponents: He remained commander of the army until 1998,
then became a senator for life, thus gaining legal immunity and
lasting influence.
</P>
<P>
   But during his months under house arrest in Britain, he became,
in Chile, something akin to the emperor with no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something incredible has happened,'' said Armando de Ramon, a
noted historian. ``They humiliated him and did what they wanted to
him. And that is the reason this country has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the taboo subjects of disappearances and torture
became the daily grist of the news media as journalists covered the
charges made against Pinochet by prosecutors in Spain, Belgium,
France and other quarters. Local rights groups resuscitated
themselves, and torture victims began to organize. And younger
military officers _ concerned that Pinochet's legal woes would
damage the armed forces _ began to distance themselves from his
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's absence opened a vacuum, and the man who filled it
was a previously obscure appeals court judge in Santiago, Juan
Guzman. Early last year, Guzman came up with an inventive legal
interpretation that has jolted the military's impunity, opened the
way for the arrests of 40 former military and police officers and
forced the military to begin a dialogue with rights lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman's ruling, which has been upheld by the supreme court,
found that an amnesty declared by the Pinochet regime to protect
officers involved in political crimes between 1973 and 1978 could
not be applied to cases involving people who are still missing,
since the victims may still be alive as victims of ongoing
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly finding the missing people alive is unlikely. But this
interpretation has put pressure on the military to offer
information to family members who would like to bury their dead.
Otherwise, the officers face years of embarrassing prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman is now pushing ahead with the unthinkable: prosecuting
Pinochet himself. He has been assigned to investigate 60 criminal
complaints against the general, and he appears to be concentrating
on a possible connection between the former dictator and a
helicopter-borne death squad known as the Caravan of Death, which
removed 75 political prisoners from military and police prisons in
the month after the 1973 coup for summary executions and
clandestine burial.
</P>
<P>
   Since more than a dozen of the victims are still missing _ and
at least theoretically could be alive _ an investigation into the
death squad has already led to the prosecution of a retired general
who was a close aide to Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Before Guzman can indict Pinochet in the case, he will have to
seek the revocation of his senatorial immunity. That will not be
easy, especially because legislators are pushing a constitutional
amendment to allow the former dictator to step down from the Senate
but retain his immunity.
</P>
<P>
   But an indictment is not entirely out of the question, and Lavin
and other conservatives have said they will not stand in the way.
The conservatives still say they respect the former dictator's
economic accomplishments, but they read the opinion polls. And the
polls show that well over half of Chileans believe Pinochet should
face justice in Chile.

EPISCOPAL CHURCH RIFT WIDENS WITH BISHOP CONSECRATIONS

<P>
   PAWLEYS ISLAND, S.C. _ In this pleasant coastal community, a
place of lush golf resorts and second homes, there is little to
evoke Rwanda, a densely populated East African nation, the site of
a devastating ethnic conflict in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the two places have a link, a spiritual one, which became
abruptly apparent a month ago in an event that sent shock waves
among the world's Anglican churches, whose 73 million members
include those in the Episcopal Church in the United States. The
Rev. Charles H. Murphy III, 52, rector of All Saints Episcopal
Church, whose stately campus here occupies a swath of land near the
Waccamaw River, was consecrated a bishop by the head of the
Anglican Province of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In the same ceremony, which took place in Singapore, another
Episcopal priest, the Rev. John H. Rodgers Jr., retired dean of
Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry in Ambridge, Pa., was also
consecrated a bishop, under the authority of the Anglican Province
of Southeast Asia. Within days, both men returned to the United
States, with plans to minister to conservatives in the Episcopal
Church who feel alienated from the church's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, conducted with no warning to Episcopal Church
leaders, vividly showed an unusual alliance that has developed
between conservative Episcopalians in the United States and the
like-minded heads of some Anglican churches overseas, who share a
perception that the Episcopal Church has come to rely less on
Scripture than on ideas from secular American culture, especially
on issues of human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a crisis of leadership in the American church,''
Murphy said in an interview here last week, a few hours before he
was to fly to Rwanda, for a meeting with his new boss, Archbishop
Emmanuel Kolini. While there are divisive debates within the
Episcopal Church over such questions as whether to ordain gay men
and lesbians as priests, Murphy said, ``Human sexuality issues are
a symptom of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative congregations in this country have already
requested his ``oversight'' as a bishop, he said. But, he added,
Kolini asked that he take no action now, and instead wait for
guidance after the heads of the 38 Anglican church provinces
worldwide hold a long-scheduled meeting in Portugal on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the heads of two of those provinces to create bishops
to minister within the areas of sister churches, as happened in
Singapore on Jan. 29, is remarkable. In secular terms, it would be
as if the governor of one state appointed a judge to administer
justice in another.
</P>
<P>
   After the consecrations, the Episcopal Church's top official,
the Presiding Bishop Frank T. Griswold III, declared in a letter to
American bishops that he was ``appalled'' by the event, and ``even
more so'' by the accusations that the church was in a crisis, which
he said was not true.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold could not be reached for comment this week because he
was away from his office, but in an earlier interview in February,
he said he would go to Portugal to ``share a very different story
about the Episcopal Church'' with his fellow primates, the heads of
the Anglican churches.
</P>
<P>
   The consecrations in Singapore have also reverberated across the
Atlantic, to England, where Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey,
the spiritual leader of the Church of England and first among
equals among Anglican bishops, declared recently that he did not
recognize the consecrations as valid.
</P>
<P>
   The consecrations come at a time of great internal stress within
American Christianity over cultural issues that began to emerge in
the 1960s, like the leadership role of women and the rights of
gays.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Within the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, some
conservative groups appeal directly to the Vatican, seeking
crackdowns on priests and theologians they view as transgressing
church teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) have spent years
fighting over the question of whether to ordain gays and lesbians,
with opponents of that idea prevailing.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church, too, has wrestled inconclusively with how
to relate to its gay members. One retired bishop in 1995 faced
heresy charges for having ordained a noncelibate gay man as a
deacon, although a church court cleared him of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Rodgers said the
consecrations should not be seen as a conservative response to one
issue, but to a larger sense of crisis, involving questions about
the authority of Scripture as the guide for life. He also said he
felt ``firm and clear'' about his own status as a bishop in the
Province of Southeast Asia. But what future role he and Murphy
would play, he said, ``really depends on how the primates work it
all out'' at the Portugal meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 52, is the son, brother and brother-in-law of Episcopal
priests. Ordained in 1975, he has led All Saints since 1982. When
he arrived at the parish, he found fewer than 100 people in Sunday
worship, he said, but now has about 600, a sizable congregation in
an area far more rural than urban.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in a rocking chair with a back cushion that read,
``Life is Short, Hell is Hot and the Stakes are High,'' Murphy said
he felt ``100 percent Anglican,'' and impelled ``to lead, not
leave'' the faith.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he drew inspiration from the work of the consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, who fought in the 1960s to make automobiles
safer. ``What Ralph Nader decided to do was to go over the heads of
the Big Three automakers and go directly to Congress,'' Murphy
said. ``After a long battle with no results, we went over the heads
of the American church and appealed to the international church.''
</P>
<P>
   The international church is weighted increasingly toward the
Southern Hemisphere, where the faith, in all its varieties, is
growing rapidly. A century ago, about nine in 10 of the world's 31
million Anglicans lived in Great Britain, the United States and
Canada. But now, according to statistics common in Anglican
circles, Africa and southern Asia account for slightly more than
half the globe's Anglicans.
</P>
<P>
   The shift was made apparent in 1998 at the Lambeth Conference,
the bishops' meeting that occurs once a decade, where African and
Asian prelates joined their socially conservative peers to pass a
resolution declaring homosexuality ``incompatible with
Christianity.''

HOME AT LAST, A FAMILY WITH 17 CHILDREN REUNITES

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCRANTON, Pa. _ Married 12 years, in love for 22, Barbara and
Charlie Smith have created 17 children and there are times when
Mrs. Smith has sensed disdain laced into the curiosity of people
who were in wonder at their feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have that look, you know, and they ask `Oh my God,
how do you do it?''' she said as her youngest, 18-month-old Steven,
lolled underfoot and the eldest, 18-year-old Chad, took a break
from painting a bedroom of his own, the first he has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Smith, who delights in the size of his family, rolled up
his left sleeve to show his tattooed roll call of children's names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they are, every one of my little kiddies, except ...'' He
paused and squinted about, checking the tattoo against the impish
faces scattered around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except the three youngest,'' Barbara Smith interjected, and
there was great laughter at her husband's struggle to recall all
the names and the observation that, well, he always has another
arm.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's difficulty was not hard to understand _ keeping the names
straight was complicated by the children's fondness for nicknames.
So let the record show that as the Smith family ended a harrowing
stretch of homelessness, in which the children had to be parceled
out in this ultimately generous city and they feared for their own
solidarity, the roster from eldest to youngest ran somewhat as
follows:
</P>
<P>
   Chad, Brian (Bri), twins Ashley (Betsy) and Eric (Feedhead),
Danielle (Megan), Dustin (Bundy), Charles (Chewy), Kricket, Casey
(Pie), Bristy (Starla), twins Trysta (Gaga) and Kysta (Kooter),
Kaylee, Skyler (Howie), Shawn (Mikey or Bighead), Corry and Steven
(Puggy).
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past year, Charle and Barbara Smith, evicted
from a condemned house, had to make daily rounds of assorted havens
in the city to collect their children for school and then again for
the evening common meal and baths at a relative's house, and
finally back to their separate sleeping berths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were together and the next day we were all scattered,''
Barbara Smith, 43, said of the bad spell when even the city's
welfare and housing agencies despaired of finding them a place that
was big enough and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were afraid we'd never be back together again as a
family,'' she said, relating how the family was bucked to the
American Red Cross as a disaster case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to take in a family of 17 kids?'' asked Robert E.
Quinn, the director of Habitat for Humanity for Lackawanna County.
``These days the government can't handle it when you have 17
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, a Scranton native and seasoned housing worker, found a
way to bring the Smiths back together in a home of their own,
earning himself the nickname Ozzie when the children found out that
he does not like one of his given names, Oswald.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Ozzie, what's happening?'' a pug-faced tyke (Chewy?
Bighead?) shouted from the porch of the Smiths' 10-bedroom home in
north Scranton's Marvin section, an appropriately resilient
neighborhood where miners once raised families.
</P>
<P>
   The reunited Smiths have been breezing through the rooms of the
80-year-old frame house fixed up through the labor of hundreds of
Scranton volunteers. There were also more than 2,000 hours of
``sweat equity'' from the family _ nine times the minimum required
by Habitat, the 24-year-old international charity for self-help
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifesavers,'' Charlie Smith said of Habitat and the Scranton
residents who rebuilt the house and donated 16 rooms of furniture.
``You don't see a large family today; especially you don't see a
large family that's still together.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the dining room, his wife tended some of the children and
said gently, ``No more problems. I don't consider the kids a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Smith, who has made his living by helping children get
on and off school buses, said he was eager to take on the $150
monthly carrying charge for the home. The fright of seeing his
family homeless and fractured had made him desperate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the point of pitching a big tent,'' he said as he
looked about his home. ``If it wasn't for my kids, I'd have gone
off the deep end. I look at the act of God and he comes out and
says, `Bite your tongue, hold your peace, and you'll make it
through.' And that's what we've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   There should be a ``victory celebration,'' not a mere
housewarming, Charlie Smith suddenly announced. ``We're back
together once again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to my bedroom,'' he said. ``Just for
taking a long sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Smith openly cherished the family sanctuary. ``I want to
lock the door and cry,'' she said. The children laughed at that
idea, and made their mother smile.

CORRUPTION INQUIRY IN CHINA LEADS TO A TOP OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ As China's Parliament prepares to start its annual
session, a spokesman admitted Saturday that one of the body's top
officials is suspected of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng Kejie, a vice chairman of the powerful Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress, or Parliament, is under
investigation ``in relation to his economic interests,'' the
spokesman said in response to a question from a Hong Kong
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Cheng had been detained have been reported in a few
foreign publications. But there was no official confirmation of any
troubles surrounding him until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng is one of the highest officials yet to fall in spreading
corruption inquiries in China, which some top officials have warned
are putting the Communist Party's future in peril because so many
inquiries end at the doors of senior party members.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng, 67, formerly governor and deputy secretary of the
Communist Party in Guangxi autonomous region in southern China, was
brought to Beijing in 1998 by Li Peng, chairman of the National
People's Congress, to serve as one of several vice chairmen. He is
also a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Another former deputy party secretary in Guangxi was recently
given a life sentence, while the former party chief of a major city
in that region was sentenced to death on apparently related bribery
and corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is equal before the law and whoever violates the law
will be punished,'' said Zeng Jianhui, spokesman for the People's
Congress, at Saturday's news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation of several high-level corruption cases has caused
tensions within the government. By some reports, the former deputy
governor of Jiangxi province in southern China, already sentenced
to death for accepting bribes, will soon be executed to set an
example.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing still has made no public announcement about what
appears to be the biggest case of all, a smuggling scandal in
Fujian province that has led to the arrest or flight of numerous
party, customs and police officials.
</P>
<P>
   As the National People's Congress prepared to convene on Sunday
in the Great Hall of the People, security around the hall and in
adjacent Tiananmen Square was unusually tight, and several foreign
journalists were followed by security agents.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two days, at least 16 members of the outlawed Falun
Gong spiritual movement have been arrested in the square as they
tried to unfurl banners.
</P>
<P>
   The government has intensified its crackdown on a similar
healing sect with millions of followers and a charismatic leader,
according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement. Zhang Hongbao, the founder in 1988 of the
Zhong Gong movement, is on the run from the police, the center
said, while hundreds of leaders of the group have been detained
over the last several months and a business it ran has been closed
down.

PLAN TO LIMIT POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS GETS SOME UNLIKELY HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cowboys have long been a vanishing breed in
California, but when it comes to campaign finance, this is still
the wild, wild west. It is one of only six states, and the only big
one besides Illinois, with no restrictions on political
contributions or spending. Its Democratic governor, Gray Davis,
raised a record $13.2 million in his first year in office last
year.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say Californians have not tried to rein in
campaign spending. In 1996, voters easily passed a ballot measure
that limited individual contributions to $500 in statewide races,
but a federal judge struck it down as unrealistically low in a
state in which one week of television advertising costs more than
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now another proposal to limit giving and spending is on the
primary ballot here on Tuesday, Proposition 25. And though polls
show it failing to draw the majority support needed to pass, it got
assistance from an unusual source this week: a $1 million
contribution for television and radio advertising from the
millionaire Max Palevsky, a longtime donor to Democrats from George
McGovern to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around politics for a while, and whether I go to
Sacramento or Washington these days, there's just a climate that
everything is for sale,'' said Palevsky, who made his fortune in
computers. ``And what is shocking is that all the people take that
as a fact of nature, that it's just the way it is. Until we do
something about that, everything else doesn't really count that
much, because we'll never get any serious reform in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 25 is sponsored by Ron K. Unz, the Silicon Valley
software millionaire and former Republican gubernatorial candidate
whose ballot measure to end bilingual education passed
overwhelmingly two years ago. Unz was introduced to Palevsky by the
actor Warren Beatty, who toyed last year with running for president
on a platform of campaign finance overhaul and flirted with making
an advertisement for the measure this week.
</P>
<P>
   But in a twist, Proposition 25 is opposed not only by business
and taxpayer groups who do not like its provisions for public
financing of campaigns, but by a number of newspaper editorial
boards and civic groups that generally support campaign finance
changes. These include the California League of Women Voters, which
argues that the measure is not restrictive enough and would create
a range of new complications and potential abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the pragmatists vs. the purists,'' said Robert Stern, a
former counsel to the state's Fair Political Practices Commission
and president of the nonpartisan Center for Governmental Studies
here.
</P>
<P>
   Stern supports the measure, but a colleague, the center's
campaign finance director, Craig Holman, opposes it. ``That's just
the nature of reform groups,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would limit contributions to $5,000 for statewide
races, require immediate Internet disclosure of all contributions
of $1,000 or more, ban corporate contributions, and provide
vouchers for free television and radio time to statewide campaigns
that agree to limit spending. Unz contends the cost would be less
than $2 a year per voter.
</P>
<P>
   Critics counter that the measure would amount to a $55 million
annual tax increase, would not restrict so-called soft money
donations to political parties and would provide public subsidies
for the ballot initiative campaigns that have increasingly come to
dominate the state's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Unz, a policy wonk who does not hesitate to plunge into issues
that others have worked on for years, said that some groups had
looked askance at the measure simply because of his involvement.
``That's certainly an element,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Henderson, legislative director for the state chapter of
the League of Women Voters, acknowledged that it was unnerving to
have ``someone who hasn't been working on this to come along and
say, `Well, this is what I want and take it or leave it.''' But she
added: ``We think it isn't real reform. It basically takes pretty
much what they have at the national level, which I think everybody
knows by now is a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   But longtime advocates of campaign finance limits, like Fred
Wertheimer, the former leader of Common Cause and now president of
Democracy 21, a public policy organization in Washington, said
Proposition 25 was better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find the problems with it, but there are important
elements to it, and its passage would send yet another signal to
the politicians around the country that this issue is real,''
Wertheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest statewide Field Poll found nearly half of likely
voters opposed to the measure, with about 36 percent supporting it
and 18 percent undecided.

EDITORIAL: PRIMARY ENDORSEMENTS: JOHN MCCAIN AND AL GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, March 5:
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, New Yorkers, Californians and voters in nine other
states have the unusual opportunity of participating in
presidential primary elections that could be decisive in their
parties' nominating contests. By the end of the day, it could be
clear whether Gov. George W. Bush faces a prolonged battle from
Sen. John McCain on the Republican side and whether Vice President
Al Gore has put an end to former Sen. Bill Bradley's campaign for
the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   This page does not always endorse in the presidential primaries.
We last did so in 1992. We believe dual pre-nomination endorsements
are in order this year because of the competitiveness of the
contests and because of the importance of the choices before our
readers. These endorsements are also, in some sense, a tribute to
the vigor and seriousness that the four candidates have brought to
this campaign season. So with a bow of respect to all four for
reviving public interest in the election process, we endorse McCain
as the preferable candidate for the Republicans and Gore as our
choice for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   THE LEADERSHIP TEST  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In their very different ways, each of these two men communicates
a greater capacity for overarching presidential leadership than his
opponent. McCain's potential proceeds from deeper knowledge about
government and a commitment to reform as a guiding idea rather than
a hastily adopted slogan. Gore, for his part, knows more about
domestic and foreign issues than any candidate in either party, and
his aura of confidence and readiness for command have intensified
while Bradley's appetite for the job seems to have mysteriously
diminished during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   We have clear disagreements with McCain on issues like abortion
and gun control, as well as profound reservations about Gore's
record on the Clinton-Gore campaign's fund-raising abuses in 1996.
But real campaigns seldom present perfect choices. Therefore a
nomination endorsement has to take into consideration the broad
agenda of challenges that will face the next president and to
reflect a reasoned judgment _ and sometimes even a leap of faith _
as to a candidate's ability to rise above ideology and past
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The list of tests confronting the next president is a daunting
one. It includes preserving peace and prosperity, improving
education, health care and the environment, and healing the
religious and racial divisions in American society. In their
respective races, McCain and Gore are unequivocally the best
choices to lead in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICAN RACE
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this point in the political calendar finds the
Republicans with the more competitive race. While trailing in the
important California contest, McCain is strong in New York and has
the potential to prolong a healthy battle for the soul of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The party's leaders first looked to Bush as a modernizer who
would end the damaging ``culture wars'' that led to President
George Bush's defeat in 1992. The governor was presented initially
as an inclusive moderate with a short but impressive record in
Texas. He improved his state's schools and challenged the GOP
status quo by opposing congressional attempts to balance the budget
by punishing the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But in fighting off his opponent, Bush has embraced a punitive
hard-right agenda. After first challenging his party's
congressional leaders, he has made himself an instrument of their
opposition to campaign finance reform. His ill-advised tax-cut
proposal, miscues on foreign policy, opposition to gun control and
vows to appoint anti-abortion Supreme Court justices have further
dimmed his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   If he does win the nomination, perhaps he could reclaim his
original political persona as a more spacious kind of Republican
who would be a uniter, not a divider. But the smarter course for
Republicans would be to choose McCain, who would not have to be
repackaged and repositioned when it comes to outreach and reform.
</P>
<P>
   He has a proven ability to get votes from the vital center of
the American spectrum. He began with a vow to destroy the ``iron
triangle'' of donations, lobbyists and legislation. He broke
further with the Republican leadership to oppose Bush's outsized
tax-cut scheme as too weighted toward the wealthy. Bravely, and
perhaps foolishly, he became the first important Republican figure
to challenge leaders of the religious right for intimidating the
party with religious-based litmus tests.
</P>
<P>
   This has led Beltway Republicans to launch a nonsensical effort
to depict McCain as a false conservative. The charge is wrong on
the facts. McCain has opposed gun control and abortion. In the
foreign policy area, he has been one of the Clinton
administration's toughest critics. Although we do not agree with
many of these positions, we think Republican voters should judge
him on his real record, not the falsified version being pushed by
Bush's right-wing enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   As a zestful insurgent battling to open his party, McCain has
brought gusts of fresh air, excitement and common sense to American
politics. Despite our differences with him on abortion and other
im`ortant policies, we respect his politics of principle and his
opposition to congressional influence-peddling, and we recommend
him to voters in the Republican primaries.

 UNDATED: Republican primaries. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   The reality of the Democrats' battle is that Bradley is on the
ropes. Only weeks ago, he seemed the likely beneficiary of primary
voters' conflicted attitudes toward President Clinton. The leader
who presided over the longest economic boom in American history and
accomplished many progressive goals had also brought dishonor to
the Oval Office. Gore could not be blamed for the singular lunacy
of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. But he was tarnished by
fund-raising fiascoes invoked by the very words ``Buddhist temple''
and ``no controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Bradley seemed ready to capitalize on a general public
impulse to turn the page. But after a promising start, he stumbled
badly in regard to policy and performance. His ambitious health
care proposal, the initial centerpiece of his campaign, was
attractive, especially because of its goal of universal coverage.
Yet he never effectively answered Gore's charge that he had
underestimated the cost of his proposals and jeopardized Medicaid
and Medicare. Even more striking, Gore's swarming debate style did
not bring out the warrior in Bradley. Instead, the challenges made
him seem petulant and remote.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was simply that the thoughtfulness and independence
that marked Bradley's Senate service did not translate to the
stump. Certainly his eloquence on race and his demands for higher
ethical standards elevated the campaign. But the voters picked up
on Bradley's lack of energy and on a certain emotional austerity in
his connection with them. If overeagerness to please is a defect in
Gore, Bradley possesses an even more disturbing inability to convey
a real hunger for the opportunity to serve.
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE'S POTENTIAL  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty to criticize in the style and substance of
Gore's record. The Republicans are already planning to run videos
of the Buddhist temple event, where Gore still insists he was
shocked to find that money was being raised. In this campaign, he
has exaggerated flaws in Bradley's record and been evasive about
the evolution in his own position on abortion, guns and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore brings tremendous gifts to his quest for the White
House. Most impressive to us, he communicates a passion to lead, a
determination to leave a positive mark on history and a burning
desire to step out of his mentor's shadow and prove that he
possesses the self-control and presidential high-mindedness so
lacking in Clinton. The Al Gore of today has a deep commitment to
social justice, abortion rights and gun control. To make up for his
fund-raising lapse in 1996, he promises that if elected he will
make campaign finance reform one of the top half dozen legislative
priorities for his first year.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, the vice president is clearly the
best-prepared candidate in this race. He is also his party's
strongest leader on environmental protection and scientific
progress. On issues ranging from preserving the Everglades to
pushing for a global treaty on carbon dioxide emissions, he is the
primary architect of Clinton's environmental legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Widely ridiculed for asserting that he invented the Internet,
Gore can actually take credit for seeing the digital world before
most other political leaders. He promises to bring a grasp of
science and technological advances to the White House at a time
when a host of tough problems on everything from Internet privacy
to genetic engineering will confront the nation. Finally, Gore's
experience as a successful partner in making the right decisions on
budget and fiscal issues, and in fighting a reactionary Congress to
protect and even expand domestic programs, holds great promise for
the future. Like Clinton, the vice president can be a maddening
compromiser. But he has a strong internal compass and is more
prepared for presidential responsibility than Clinton was in 1992
and than Bradley is today.
</P>
<P>
   Our endorsements of McCain and Gore apply only to the nomination
competitions of their parties. As always, we will wait until late
in the general election campaign to make a final endorsement for
the presidency. The fall campaign, of course, will provide another
set of tests for the final two contestants. But every citizen
should hope that the last months of this political year will be
marked by the earnest effort that Al Gore, Bill Bradley, John
McCain and George W. Bush brought to the primary season.

 &HT;    CONFIDENT OF NOMINATION, GORE ROAD TESTS ANTI-GOP CAMPAIGN
THEMES
 &HT;    For Sunday, March 5
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Vice President Al Gore, confident of a ``Super
Tuesday'' primary victory over Democratic challenger Bill Bradley,
road-tested campaign themes against Republican presidential rivals
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   His most potent weapon against the GOP nominee, judging from his
emphasis during a swing through Massachusetts and New York, is the
economy, the strongest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue now is whether or not we're going to keep that
prosperity going or whether or not we're going to take the advice
of both Republican candidates and take a right wing U-turn back to
the old polices of the past,'' Gore said during a rally at Boston's
historic Faneuil (pronounced FAN-yuhl) Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also raised environmental issues in his criticism of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain, something he has
rarely done in the Democratic contest with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the environment, just remember two numbers _ zero and one,
since this is the digital age,'' Gore said of the GOP presidential
contenders:
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them in the Senate two years ago had a zero rating from
the League of Conservation Voters. The other one is the governor of
a state which he has just led to the position of number one in air
pollution, number one in water pollution, number one in land
pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   He also ripped Bush for his anti-abortion stand, noting that the
Texas governor had met privately in the past with televangelists
Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. He said the ``code'' language
Robertson and Falwell used following the meeting indicated Bush
would appoint Supreme Court justices committed to overturning Roe
v. Wade, the court ruling that granted abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're saying is they had a solid promise to give the
right wing extremist wing of the Republican Party control of our
Supreme Court and the interpretation of our Constitution,'' Gore
said. ``Let's stop that.''
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed Bush's recent concession that he would allow
voluntary trigger locks on firearms. ``That's not the issue,'' Gore
said. ``The issue is we want to make mandatory child safety
locks.''
</P>
<P>
   And later, during a speech in Buffalo, he criticized the two
Republican candidates for opposing health care reforms and hate
crime legislation backed by Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore barely mentioned Bradley in a morning speech to several
hundred people who gathered on a sunny, brisk day in the square in
front of Faneuil Hall, which was built in 1742 and has provided a
forum for a number of historic figures, including Samuel Adams,
Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony and John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's passing reference to Bradley was to remind voters that
both he and his challenger have said that Tuesday's primary voting
in 15 states, including Massachusetts, ``will be the decisive
moment'' in the campaign for the Democratic campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You here in Massachusetts ... have an opportunity to close the
book on the Democratic nomination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' two senators, Ted Kennedy and John Kerry, joined
Gore on the stage and in the attacks on the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry ridiculed Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' with a
joke about Bob Jones III, president of Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, and John Rocker, the Atlanta Brave pitcher who made
inflammatory remarks about minorities, gays and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The definition of George Bush's compassionate conservative
(cq.) is Bob Jones III forgiving John Rocker,'' Kerry quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Bob Jones University prohibited inter-racial
dating, barred gays from its campus and regarded Catholicism as a
false religion.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a Catholic, also took note of Bush's appearance at Bob
Jones and McCain's criticism of the Christian right's influence on
the GOP's nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that the only thing these Republican candidates
can talk about is religion,'' Kennedy said. ``But neither one of
them has a prayer against Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy added to the general election atmosphere of Gore's final
weekend of campaigning before ``Super Tuesday'' by making jokes
about possible running mates for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had found a note in one pocket asking him to remind
Gore that New York has 33 electoral votes. He said it was signed,
``Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he found another note addressed ``Dear Dad,'' asking him
to remind Gore that Rhode Island has only 8 electoral votes. He
said the note, supposedly from his son, Rep. Patrick Kennedy of
Rhode Island, cautioned the senator against reminding Gore that the
younger Kennedy is only 32, too young under the U.S. Constitution
to be vice president.

LITTLE OPPOSITION THIS TIME TO AN EXPANSION OF TRIBAL CASINOS
</HEADLINE>
  (With CALIF-CAMPAIGN-FUNDS) 
(nk) 
 BY ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nevada's gambling halls might be about to face
some significant competition right on their doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Californians, who account for about one-third of the visitors to
Nevada, will vote on Tuesday on a proposal to allow a broad
expansion of casino-style gambling on Indian reservations in their
own state. Some analysts say the measure would eventually make
California the nation's second largest gambling state, ahead of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest that the measure will win approval. Tribes
and other supporters of the measure, known as Proposition 1A, have
raised about $20 million for advertising, while the opponents have
raised only about $44,000.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some tribes are planning to enlarge and embellish
casinos, even adding hotels and restaurants. New casinos are
planned, some of them near the major highways linking San Francisco
and Los Angeles to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   California has 41 tribal casinos, with about 19,000 slot
machines. But the tribes never had an agreement for those machines
with the state, as required by federal law, so the casinos have
been in danger of being shut down.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 ballot measure to legalize the casinos won 63 percent of
the vote but was ruled in violation of the state constitution's ban
on Nevada-style casinos. The new measure would change the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming Proposition 1A is approved, the number of slot
machines in the state could more than double to nearly 45,000 under
an agreement between the state and nearly 60 tribes. Some opponents
say the agreement could be interpreted to allow more than 100,000
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lower number is greater than the 36,000 machines in New
Jersey, though far behind the roughly 200,000 in Nevada. Card games
like blackjack and baccarat would also be allowed for the first
time, but not craps or roulette.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would push California fairly quickly into the second
largest jurisdiction in the country,'' said William Eadington,
director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial
Gaming at the University of Nevada in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 ballot battle was the most expensive in state history,
with the tribes spending more than $60 million and opponents, led
by Nevada casinos, more than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   This time, labor unions, which opposed the 1998 proposition, are
happier because the new agreement would allow casino workers to
unionize. And some Nevada casinos have decided that they cannot
beat the tribes and have joined them.
</P>
<P>
   Three Las Vegas-based gambling companies _ Harrah's
Entertainment, Station Casinos and Anchor Gaming _ have announced
agreements to finance and manage California tribal casinos. Stephen
A. Wynn of Mirage Resorts is talking to the Cabazon Band of Mission
Indians about building a resort near Palm Springs, a tribal
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of gambling have seized upon this. ``It will be a Las
Vegas Indian tribe industry in California,'' said Cheryl Schmit,
co-director of Stand Up for California, an opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of Proposition 1A downplay how much expansion might
come. The tribes are emphasizing in advertisements that approval of
the proposition is needed to prevent the shutdown of existing
casinos, which have allowed the tribes to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents say that many reservations are too remote to
support a big casino. California will not become like Nevada or
Atlantic City, N.J., they say, because the casinos will be sparsely
scattered and each tribe can have no more than 2,000 slot machines,
about the number found in a mid-size casino in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-four thousand machines is not going to turn California
into anything huge,'' said Anthony Pico, chairman of the Viejas
Band of Kumeyaay Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Pico said his 300-member tribe had water and sewage, health
insurance and full employment because of its casino about a
30-minute drive east of San Diego. The tribe has acquired a bank
and is buying a television station and building a gambling cruise
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the tribal casinos could become more
attractive with the modern slot machines that would be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. says that expanded gambling in California
would divert $626 million, or about 6.9 percent, of Nevada's
gambling revenues in 2004. Hardest hit would be Reno and Laughlin,
a city at the southern tip of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas is expected to be relatively unscathed because it
offers entertainment beyond gambling and is less dependent on
California tourists than other parts of Nevada. The $100 million
casinos being announced in California would pale beside the
billion-dollar theme resorts clustered along the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Landau, chief financial officer of Boyd Gaming, which
operates several Las Vegas casinos, said, ``It's not like Las Vegas
is going to be reproduced in Palm Springs.''

 &HT;    Astros expect Central struggle after payroll cut
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Visitors to new Enron Field in Houston this
spring will find the following: a 30-degree hill in deep center
field with a flag pole atop it, all of it in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose idea was that?'' asked new Astros center fielder Roger
Cedeno. ``I thought they were joking.''
</P>
<P>
   It was club president Tal Smith's idea, the layout inspired by
quirky old Crosley Field. But it's not Houston management's only
radical thinking this season. Visitors to Enron also will find
something else: a lesser team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good point,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``You'd like to
go into the new stadium with the strongest team you've had. But the
economics of baseball don't always work out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the franchise's most successful run _ three NL
Central titles in a row and a 283-203 record under manager Larry
Dierker _ the Astros voluntarily took a step back this winter.
Houston management doesn't worry as much about Ken Griffey's
arrival in Cincinnati as it does about St. Louis' upgraded
rotation. The Astros could tumble to third this year.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect to go every year without losing somebody
along the way,'' closer Billy Wagner said. ``But when you make
changes, you don't want to make a lot of big ones _ like we have
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cy Young runner-up Mike Hampton (22-4) was traded away, as was
center fielder Carl Everett (25 home runs, 108 RBIs). The rationale
was the same in both deals; each was approaching free agency, and
the club could not pay to keep them. Still stinging from the Randy
Johnson experience _ three prospects lost for 84 1/3 total innings
_ Houston sent them off.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros know the road well. Hampton is the third ace the team
has lost in three years, after Johnson and Darryl Kile in 1997. The
club lopped off position players Sean Berry and Brad Ausmus after
the 1998 season for similar payroll maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I expect every year,'' manager Larry Dierker
said. ``I think it's a big challenge for (general manager) Gerry
(Hunsicker), as much or more than for us, because he's got a
payroll limit. He has to find ways.''
</P>
<P>
   In what should be a celebrated time, Hunsicker has assembled a
lesser cast. Hampton, who made it clear he would not discuss a
contract extension, went to the New York Mets, along with
disgruntled outfielder Derek Bell, for Cedeno and right-handed
starter Octavio Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who enters his last season before free-agent
eligibility, went to Boston for shortstop prospect Adam Everett and
pitcher Greg Miller. Adam Everett is highly regarded but is still a
year away from consideration for the majors. Dotel joins the bottom
of the rotation, Cedeno takes over in center, and the Astros try to
say that will be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The club's anchor of Craig Biggio (34 years old) and Jeff
Bagwell (32 in May) remains, and the team expects a big year from
Moises Alou after a year's absence with a damaged knee. But minus
an ace and Everett's production, another division title might be
too much to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't become easier,'' said Hunsicker, the 1998
NL executive of the year. ``You know you're trying to beat the odds
every year. It's just reality. Unfortunately, there's a direct
correlation between money and success in this business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending money certainly doesn't guarantee anything, but not
spending, at least to a certain level, pretty much guarantees
you're not going to be able to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, though hardly cash-strapped, have midmarket
financial restrictions. While their projected payroll of $48
million is nowhere near the Braves' $83 million-plus, Houston has
determined to cut losses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite drawing 2.7 million fans a year ago and a guaranteed 3
million with the opening of Enron Field, owner Drayton McLane
ordered an $8 million reduction in 2000 payroll. McLane, who never
saw a major-league game until he purchased the club in 1993, claims
the Astros have lost $100 million since then.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Everett signed a four-year contract worth $30
million. In New York, Hampton already has said he will explore free
agency next fall instead of re-signing with the Mets, and he'll
fetch top dollar. If those developments aren't enough vindication
for Hunsicker's moves, he need only consider pitchers Freddy Garcia
and John Halama, who would have had big roles in Houston if they
hadn't been shipped to Seattle for Johnson and his two months of
the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things that have to start happening for (the
new players) to get us going,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past three seasons, the Braves and Astros have met
in the postseason. The series might not have made the blood boil,
as the New York Mets and the 1999 NLCS did, but the two teams and
the two organizations developed a sense of respect. However, it
might be a while before the Astros are back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd told me with all the injuries we had last year, that
we're still going to win, I'd say you're crazy,'' Bagwell said.
``But you know what? We're going to have to try it again this
year.''

COMMENTARY: W., IN THE PINK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STONY BROOK, N.Y. _ Like trapeze artists, the Republican
governors catch George W. Bush as he flies into their states and
swing him through the air, trying to get him to the platform
safely.
</P>
<P>
   They supply the machines and muscle and brass-knuckle
strategists and line of attack for those blistering ads. They
remold W. into whatever will work for their states.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, former Gov. David Beasley banished
Compassionate Conservative Bush and gave a bear hug to Bob Jones
Bush. In Michigan, Gov. John Engler banished Bob Jones Bush and
wrapped his Catholic arms around Moderate Compassionate Reformer
With Results Bush. In Arizona, Gov. Jane Hull contrasted Stormy
McCain with Sunny Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes New York. It's George Pataki's turn to dangle W., his
old Yale classmate, from his wrists. He's determined not to drop
his charge, as Engler and Hull did, or leave him black-and-blue, as
Beasley did.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has come up with a truly novel incarnation: Breast Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The New York governor and the Texas governor sashayed onto the
stage at the State University of New York at Stony Brook sporting
little pink ribbons on their lapels. (To add authenticity to the
portrait of men dripping with female empathy, they had Elizabeth
Dole trotting alongside W., for the first time in weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   The pink ribbons were designed to trip up John McCain once and
for all. The Bush campaign aired a radio ad scorching the Arizona
senator as an opponent of breast cancer financing.
</P>
<P>
   In his anti-pork crusade, McCain has targeted some health
spending that was slipped into unrelated bills, including some for
breast cancer facilities in New York. But that hardly defines him
as a breast cancer research opponent. The ad, with its selective
reading of the McCain record, makes no mention, of course, of other
breast cancer research he supported.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki team chose Long Island for its panel discussion on
breast cancer and press conference because it has high rates of the
disease and is a locus of anti-cancer activism.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush crew had some queasiness when Salon reported, after the
ad began running, that McCain's sister suffers from breast cancer.
But the Pataki team told the Bushies to buck up, outlining Bush's
comeback that it was ``all the more reason to remind him what he
said about the research that goes on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's state, meanwhile, has the highest percentage of women
without health insurance, according to one private health group,
and four in 10 women over 50 haven't had a mammogram in two years.
</P>
<P>
   W., who was merely following the Pataki script, had no new
proposals to fight breast cancer. When asked what he had done in
Texas, he hemmed and hawed, mentioning his wife's efforts to
encourage early detection and admitting he wasn't sure if there was
money in his state budget for cancer research centers. ``I'll have
to check,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It was sickening to see the laudable goal of fighting breast
cancer twisted into just another campaign blast.
</P>
<P>
   Equally sulfurous was another ad, this one sponsored by the
so-called Republicans for Clean Air, lauding Bush as a great
environmentalist despite the notorious Texas smog.
</P>
<P>
   While W. denied having anything to do with the ad, one of his
big contributors, Texas businessman Sam Wyly, a Bush Pioneer, owned
up on Friday to paying $2.5 million to broadcast the ad in New
York, California and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   So here was W., who has been laboring to rap McCain as a
Democrat, wrapping himself in such Democratic issues as the
environment and women's health.
</P>
<P>
   As the McCain bus rolled from Grand Central to a Wall Street
rally on Friday, the candidate and his two renegade supporters,
Rep. Peter King and the Staten Island borough president, Guy
Molinari, discussed the Bush ad, which they referred to in
shorthand as ``the breast.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked McCain why he always seemed so taken aback and aggrieved
at each new ploy, given the predictability of tough Bush campaign
tactics. ``I'm not surprised,'' he objected. Then after a second,
he admitted: ``Oh, maybe I am. I am surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   But the senator has a fatalist streak. He knows that if he
survives Super Tuesday, he'll be treated to the grand finale of the
gubernatorial trapeze act in Texas and Florida _ with two guys
named Bush.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After an extraordinary five-week roller coaster of
contests, the Republican presidential contenders head into Tuesday
_ the most consequential and climactic primary day of the 2000
campaign _ with Sen. John McCain determined, at long last, to crack
Gov. George W. Bush's hold on party loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the political swings have been as turbulent as the
stock market in recent days, no one can safely predict how voters
will size up their choices in the 13 Republican primaries or
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But a close examination of the contests in those states, based
on interviews with strategists and politicians, and on fresh
polling data, found that with the exceptions of New York and New
England, McCain has had difficulty moving past the base of
independents and Democrats who propelled him into the most
competitive primary struggle in decades _ and one of the most
vitriolic.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling contests amount to the closest this country has
ever come to a national primary, with races in every region and
nearly one-third of the national convention delegates at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has centered mostly on the electoral powerhouses of
California and New York, the biggest delegate prizes, and, to a
lesser degree, Ohio. McCain has the best shot of pulling off a
victory in New York, polls show, and Bush is ahead in California
and Ohio. But the rivals are competing mightily for the popular
vote in California, which carries no delegates but could be an
important lift for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins two out of those three contests would be well on
his path to the nomination. Those three states have always been
critical for candidates in a general election. Now, for the first
time in decades, they are primary battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The predicament for McCain is that except in his home state of
Arizona, he did not capture more than 40 percent of the vote from
self-identified Republicans in any of the contests thus far. And
polls show that McCain is drawing 40 percent or more of the vote
only in one state voting Tuesday: New York.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davenport, who ran the delegate operation for Bob Dole in
1996 and is neutral this year, said he had seen no evidence that
McCain was making headway with Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a little too late to move the fumbers,'' he said.
``The Bush campaign has done a good job at painting George Bush as
the Republican candidate who supports all of the Republican
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who have not had a major contest since New Hampshire
on Feb. 1, are on ballots from coast to coast Tuesday. But with
Vice President Al Gore having won all of his party's contests thus
far _ and former Sen. Bill Bradley trailing in the polls in every
state voting Tuesday _ most leading Democrats have pronounced the
race all but over.
</P>
<P>
   Before McCain's impressive upsets in New Hampshire and Michigan,
most Republicans had predicted that Bush, with his stacks of money
and endorsements, would have wrapped up the nomination earlier.
Now, after McCain's losses last week in Virginia, Washington state
and North Dakota, the pressure is on him to prove that he can
attract Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   So far, McCain has benefited from victories in states where
independents and Democrats could rally behind him in Republican
primaries. There are far fewer ``open contests'' coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of McCain's advisers acknowledged that they were
having trouble winning over loyal Republicans. The problem, they
said, is that the recent discourse has been dominated by charges
and counter-charges over advertising tactics _ and over McCain's
condemnation of two religious conservative leaders _ that have
prevented the senator from hammering at his message that he is a
conservative in the Reagan mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're talking about campaign reform and cutting spending
and saving the military, Republicans are very supportive,'' said
Dan Schnur, the McCain campaign's communications director. ``When
we get bogged down in push-polling and third-party attack ads and
Pat Robertson, we lose our way and the less time there is to sell
the reform message. And that's what's going to win it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In states like Maryland, where independents can vote in the
Republican primary, McCain supporters said they had all but given
up trying to appeal to the Republican faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our effort is better spent trying to get out the independents,
instead of trying to convince Republicans to change their minds,''
said Donald E. Murphy, a state delegate and one of the few elected
Republicans in the state who supports McCain.
</P>
<P>
   By aggressively emphasizing McCain's tensions with religious
conservatives, the Bush campaign is trying to stir a backlash among
Republicans _ and to score enough victories Tuesday to put down the
McCain candidacy once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that this is all about delegates right now,'' said
Scott Reed, who ran the Dole campaign four years ago. ``This is
about momentum and direction and putting away the McCain
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, is confident to the point of
being almost dismissive of McCain. That is in part a reflection of
Bush's triple victory last week. And no matter what happens
Tuesday, Bush is well positioned a week later when the contest
turns south and he has enormous advantages in his home state of
Texas and in Florida, where his brother, Jeb Bush, is governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the flavor du jour _ or was,'' Rove said, speaking of
McCain. ``There's a little bit of traction with the guy but it's
not durable, it's not long lasting, and it hasn't been.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both camps concede that McCain is not likely to catch up to win
the Republican vote in California, which means Bush would get all
the delegates. But McCain hopes to beat Bush in the popular vote,
which includes Democrats and independents. Rove said he believed
Bush may well surpass McCain in what it called the ``beauty
contest.'' Yet if there is such a split verdict _ if Bush wins the
delegates and McCain wins the popular vote _ the senator could
challenge the results and could make the case that he is more
electable because he attracts Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain camp is counting on a triumph in New York and a sweep
of the New England states. McCain seems to be running best among
Republicans in those states because they have more moderate voters
who are most hospitable to his message of campaign reform and his
attacks on religious conservatives. McCain is also competing
aggressively in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush campaign officials said they were confident
that besides California, they would prevail in New York and Ohio.
Just as McCain is running relatively uncontested in New England,
the same is true for Bush in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, the McCain campaign has seemed on the
defensive, and has been somewhat off stride because of internal
sniping and tactical blunders. For example, McCain had at first
dropped out of a nationally televised debate in Los Angeles on
Thursday with Bush and Alan Keyes. After the decision drew scalding
publicity in the state, McCain relented and agreed to participate,
but by a satellite linkup.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest question that will be answered Tuesday is
whether McCain can persuade traditional Republican voters to
support him. Both campaigns are concentrating their television
advertisements in New York, California, Ohio, Missouri and Maryland
as they make appeals to Republican voters. Here in California,
McCain has appealed to those voters in television commercials in
which he portrays himself as heir to the Reagan legacy. His
campaign has focused its energies _ and McCain's appearances _ on
Orange and San Diego Counties in Southern California. He has also
held rallies in inland cities like Stockton, Fresno, Bakersfield
and Riverside, which are more conservative than cities closer to
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But in many states, McCain's supporters said they had all but
given up trying to woo hard-core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, one of the most conservative states voting Tuesday,
the McCain campaign has essentially conceded the race to Bush. For
McCain, the state, with its increasingly urban population, was one
of his best hopes to break the governor's hold on the South. But
the candidate has not visited the state recently, and the
campaign's resources largely consist of volunteers and used, pasted
over campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   Kil Townsend, a veteran organizer who has volunteered to help
McCain's seat-of-the-pants effort in Georgia, groused at how the
candidate has neglected the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Up north in Minnesota, Bush also has a far more organized
campaign than McCain. That has left the senator's loyalists trying
to court independents who can vote in the caucuses on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials in the state said McCain had picked up
support in the area, but not among traditional Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional and core Republicans like we have here are going
to stick with the established candidate, Bush,'' said Chris
Jacobson, a local Republican official. ``As a rule, we're pretty
tried and true. One of our concerns is how many independents and
Democrats will be crossing the lines. But Bush seems to have a
stronghold on Republican voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides painting McCain as divisive and questioning his
Republican credentials, Bush has highlighted some of the more
moderate elements of his record in states where conservatives are
less of a factor in the primary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, for example, the Bush campaign produced a
statewide mailing, radio advertisements and telephone banks to
emphasize the candidate's position on such local issues as his
support of mass transit and of the Seawolf, a nuclear submarine
produced in Groton.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain organization appears far less organized. Richard
Foley, a former state Republican chairman who is a leading McCain
backer in the state, said after the New Hampshire primary, McCain
supporters collected weathered McCain placards to use back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw as many as we could in our cars after New
Hampshire,'' Foley said. ``We're not above it all. There's no room
for the guys in the expensive suits with the $20 cigars on our
team.''

COMMENTARY: A RERUN OF THE '70S SHOW? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody knows that the economic crises of the 21st century
will be high-tech, high-concept affairs: our networks will be
disrupted by hackers or our markets will be trampled by the
electronic herd. Nobody thinks that the new economy is vulnerable
to mundane, old-economy crises like those of the 1970s. Gasoline
lines, a world held for ransom by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries _ those scenes are as dated as bell-bottoms and
disco.
</P>
<P>
   So even though crude oil prices have surged above $30 a barrel,
even though the U.S. energy secretary's pleas to OPEC to loosen up
are starting to sound a bit desperate, it's hard to get worked up
about the situation. Surely we cannot really be at risk of
replaying the '70s energy crisis, which was caused by ... actually,
what did cause the energy crisis?
</P>
<P>
   I haven't forgotten about the Yom Kippur War or the overthrow of
the shah. But why did those temporary disruptions cause oil prices
to remain very high for more than a decade? Incredibly, there is no
widely accepted answer; nor is there even a live debate about the
issue. In fact, I haven't been able to find a single economics
research paper published after 1991 that even tries to make sense
of the era of high oil prices. And if we don't know why it happened
then, how can we be sure that it won't happen now?
</P>
<P>
   The immediate oil problem is a matter of physical constraints.
Philip Verleger, one of the few really good economists to stay
focused on oil when the subject became unfashionable, points out
that it takes quite a while to get the stuff here from the Middle
East. So even if OPEC countries increase output sharply after their
meeting later this month, we can't expect real market relief until
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Since the output increases now being discussed look too small
even to stop the drain on much-depleted inventories, let alone
rebuild them, a summer spike in gasoline prices _ $2 a gallon,
maybe even $2.50 in some places _ looks entirely possible.
</P>
<P>
   Will that price spike be short-lived? Not necessarily. The world
market for oil is one in which the normal rules of supply and
demand do not work very well, at least in the short run. Given
time, higher oil prices induce people to drive smaller cars, heat
their homes with gas and generally cut back on their oil
consumption. High-priced oil is also a stimulus to exploration and
production around the world. But in the short run neither the
supply of nor the demand for oil responds much to its price.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, past experience suggests that some oil-producing
nations may actually reduce output when the price rises. With
plenty of cash flowing in, they start to regard oil left in the
ground as a pretty good investment. They can also afford to start
being good cartel members, doing their bit to drive prices up still
further. As the economists Jacques Cremer and Djavad
Salehi-Isfahani pointed out 20 years ago, this means that an oil
market disruption can, for a time, be self-reinforcing: Higher
prices lead to lower overall supply and hence to still higher
prices. (Incidentally, this means that oil crises aren't all that
mundane after all: At a deep level they resemble Asian-style
financial crises, which are also all about self-reinforcing market
instability.)
</P>
<P>
   Verleger laid out a scenario _ not a prediction _ in which oil
prices actually continue to rise through this year, reaching
something like $40 a barrel, and in which small swing producers,
including Iraq, start to have considerable market power.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons to discount that scenario. Oil producers
like Mexico and Kuwait are reluctant to face American ire. They
also know that too high a price will be self-destructive, setting
the stage for an eventual crash. And in any case, our own economy
is less vulnerable to oil shocks than it used to be: America now
burns only about half as much oil per dollar of real GDP as it did
back in the early '70s. So the odds are against a full-dress replay
of the energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I can't help feeling uneasy. A small voice keeps warning
that those who have not even tried to understand the past may be
condemned to repeat it.
</P>

IN MEXICO, NATURE LOVERS MERIT A KISS FROM A WHALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico learned last week that it cannot be half
global.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of pressure from an environmental movement that
is every day more transnational, the government on Thursday
canceled plans with Mitsubishi Corp. of Japan to build a gigantic
salt plant on the shores of a lagoon where gray whales give birth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decision Mexico never expected to make when the battle
began, in the early stages of the country's broad opening to
foreign commerce under the 1994 North American Free Trade
Agreement. Up to that time, Mexican leaders had been able to
dismiss the complaints of foreign environmentalists as an intrusion
into their national affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But in the war for Laguna San Ignacio, a tranquil inlet in an
unblemished Baja California desert, the nationalist arguments no
longer packed any punch. And as Mexico received $11.6 billion last
year in long-term investments from abroad, it also discovered that
it could not ignore the other forces, like the environmental
movement, that are crisscrossing borders and making politics into a
global game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a million people to do it,'' said Jacob Scherr, a
director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. group
that led the campaign, ``but we showed that we can work together
worldwide to compel even the largest corporations to respect
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and foreign conservationists united behind the campaign,
organizing support from the humble Mexican fishing communities on
the shores of the lagoon to the offices of several U.S. mutual
funds that agreed to shun Mitsubishi stock. The crusade was waged
over the Internet and in the press across North America.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi received at least 750,000 letters calling for it to
scrap the project, and a boycott of its products was getting under
way in California. Bus stops in Mexico City carry posters showing a
regal fin rising above the lagoon's serene waters and asking riders
if they want the whales to belong to ``a corporation'' or to
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government owns 51 percent of the salt company that
proposed the salt plant and Mitsubishi owns 49 percent. The company
already runs a big 50-year-old salt evaporation plant in another
lagoon frequented by whales up the coast from San Ignacio.
</P>
<P>
   If Mexico and Mitsubishi had gone forward with the new plant,
they would have been permanently stuck with the image of
profit-happy predators that the environmental movement had spun
around them.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists were aware that their victory did more than
guarantee peaceful swimming for the whales at Laguna San Ignacio.
It proved that they could be lead players on what has become an
international stage.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo lashed out with uncharacteristic
spleen last week when he announced the decision to dump the
project. ``Frankly, it infuriates me that some groups used this
project to gain fame and even, I have to say it, to reap economic
and political profits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's embrace of the global economy has forced it to be
flexible on trade issues with the United States, on whose economic
fortunes Mexico now depends more than ever. It has begun to observe
international standards in human rights, another area that was once
considered off-limits to foreign pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But no issue has been as open to direct influence by
international groups as environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, of course, the environmentalists had one ally
whose charisma was irresistible: Gray whales are among the most
amiable of nature's creatures. Although they are more than 40 feet
long, they oblige whale-watchers by raising their snouts very
gently to be kissed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Environmentalists quietly conceded that the threat to the whales
might not be as great as the protest propaganda suggested. But
Zedillo and Mitsubishi finally acknowledged that the enormous
industrial plant could alter and befoul the pristine ecosystem of
the lagoon and its desert surroundings in ways that no amount of
human science could foretell or repair.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's success in international trade probably contributed to
its willingness to step back from the $100 million investment and
200 jobs that the salt plant promised. Mexican officials long
contended that scrapping the project might discourage other
investors, but it became clear that not even Mitsubishi would
change its view of Mexico as a promising market.
</P>
<P>
   No one was as surprised at the reversal as Homero Aridjis, the
Mexican writer and conservationist who began the drive to stop the
salt plant five years ago from the living room of his Mexico City
home. Today he is at the center of a powerful international
network. ``It was a victory of nature over commerce,'' Aridjis said
simply.

KEY FIGURE PROVES ELUSIVE IN U.S. SUIT OVER BHOPAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren M. Anderson, chairman of Union Carbide Corp. during the
1984 chemical disaster at Bhopal, India, has apparently gone into
hiding to avoid a summons to appear in a New York federal court as
part of civil proceedings against him and the company, say lawyers
who have hired a private investigator to locate Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts to deliver a summons to Anderson's last known
address in Florida have failed and the property appears to be
vacant, the lawyers say. Union Carbide has declined to accept a
summons on behalf of Anderson, or to disclose his present location,
said Kenneth F. McCallion, the lawyer who initiated the civil case.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 people were killed and 200,000 others were
injured in Bhopal on Dec. 3, 1984, when 40 tons of vaporous methyl
isocyanate, hydrogen cyanide, monomethyl amine, carbon monoxide and
possibly 20 other chemicals were released from the Union Carbide
pesticide plant after an explosion. Many more people have died
since of gas-related illnesses. It ranks as one of the world's
worst industrial accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The company argues that it is not required to provide further
compensation to victims of the disaster after a 1989 settlement for
$470 million in a civil case brought by the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement with the government of India in 1989 of all
claims arising from the Bhopal tragedy did not just cover Union
Carbide, it covered all directors, officers and employees,
including Warren Anderson,'' said Sean Clancy, spokesman at Union
Carbide's corporate headquarters in Danbury, Conn. ``Based on that
settlement, we see no reason to encourage any disturbance of
Anderson, who retired as chairman 12 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who retired in 1989, is listed as living at 1111 South
Catalina Court in Vero Beach, Fla. The Indian government, following
criminal proceedings against him and the company, has issued an
arrest warrant for Anderson and notified Interpol that he is a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged in India with ``culpable homicide'' _ the legal
equivalent of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had no luck in serving him at his residence in
Florida,'' said McCallion. ``Union Carbide has declined to assist
or accept service on his behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Union Carbide and Anderson, in absentia, are currently on trial
as criminal defendants in India. Anderson and company officials in
the United States have refused to subject themselves to the
jurisdiction of the Bhopal District Court, despite orders by the
Indian Supreme Court to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A written decision by John Keenan, a U.S. District Court judge
in New York, on May 12, 1986, also ruled that Union Carbide ``shall
consent to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of India.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine senior Indian officials from the Bhopal subsidiary of Union
Carbide are in custody for the trial under way in the Bhopal
District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Union Carbide contends that all personal injury and related
claims were settled with the payment to the Indian government. Over
95 percent of the claimants who received payments have been given
about $600 in the case of injuries or about $3,000 in the case of
death. More than half the money has yet to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in New York charges the company and Anderson
with violating international law and fundamental human rights of
the victims and survivors. The suit was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York. It states that ``the
defendants are liable for fraud and civil contempt for their total
failure to comply with the lawful orders of the courts of both the
United States and India.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The explosion took place during routine maintenance at the
plant. A storage tank containing 60 tons of methyl isocyanate
filled with water, apparently from leaky valves and corroded pipes,
setting off a runaway reaction. In past statements, Union Carbide
blamed a ``disgruntled employee.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that the plant safety systems were
switched off or malfunctioning or under repair. The plaintiffs in
New York include individual survivors as well as five victims'
organizations. McCallion alleged in his complaint that the company
``demonstrated a reckless and depraved indifference to human life
in the design, operation and maintenance of the Union Carbide of
India Ltd. facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Union Carbide, the victims' groups contend, has refused to
provide information to medical workers in Bhopal, where advocacy
groups say an estimated 10 to 15 people die every month from
exposure-related illnesses, on the composition of the leaked gases
and their effects. The company argues that these are ``trade
secrets.'' The Bhopal Hospital Trust that treats victims was set up
by Union Carbide as part of the settlement.

 &HT;    Gibbs: doctor of defense
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The first thing Gary Gibbs has had to do is get
used to living somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's new defensive coordinator hasn't lived anywhere other
than Norman, Okla., for 30 years. And during that time, Gibbs spent
almost every waking moment focused on either his family or Oklahoma
Sooners football.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs starred as an inside linebacker on two Oklahoma national
championship teams in the 1970s and was 32-1-1 as a starter. He
stayed on as a graduate assistant, was promoted to part-time, then
full-time assistant, then coordinator and, finally, head coach. A
native of Texas, Gibbs even remained in Oklahoma after being forced
out as head coach in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Norman is 1,000 miles away _ in both literal and figurative
terms _ and Gibbs is starting a new life in a new place. He left
his family and the Sooners behind to try to help his old friend
return the Bulldogs to glory.
</P>
<P>
   SETTLING IN
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen, Athens is a lot like Norman,'' said
Gibbs, hired by coach Jim Donnan on Valentine's Day. ``Things
revolve around the university. It's a great place to raise a
family; there's a lot of interest in the team. But I really haven't
had a chance to get out and look around very much. I've really just
gone from point A to point B most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Point A'' is his suite at the Holiday Inn Express hotel on
Broad Street, and ``point B'' is his office on the second floor of
Butts-Mehre Heritage Hall. Gibbs arrives at work at 5:30 each
morning and he doesn't leave until 8:30 or 9 at night.
</P>
<P>
   He has a lot of work to do. Anyone who watched Georgia play
defense last year can attest to that.
</P>
<P>
   Under former defensive coordinator Kevin Ramsey, the Bulldogs
(8-4) finished last in the SEC in total defense (382.6 ypg) and
11th in scoring defense (25.9 ppg). They gave up an average of 39
points a game in losses to Tennessee, Florida, Auburn and Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs' task as Georgia's third defensive coordinator in three
years is to make sure that it doesn't happen again. His credentials
say it shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners posted impressive defensive numbers under Gibbs.
Their final national rankings were second in total defense and
first in rushing defense in 1984; first in total defense and second
in rushing and scoring defense in 1985; first in total, rushing,
passing and scoring defense in 1986; and first in total, passing
and scoring defense in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, Oklahoma finished sixth, first, third and
third in the final AP polls during those seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gary Gibbs, with all due respect to all of our
coaches, is Coach Donnan's best hire,'' athletics director Vince
Dooley said. ``He has an incredible record of success as a
defensive coordinator. Not only is he an excellent coach, but he's
highly regarded in college athletics as a man of high integrity....
I think he's just what the doctor ordered.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oklahoma, competing then in the run-oriented Big Eight
Conference, wasn't facing offenses as sophisticated as college
teams are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has changed, certainly,'' Gibbs conceded. ``I don't
think I'm going to come in here and wave a magic wand and recreate
the defenses that we had at Oklahoma. That was a unique group that
really accomplished a lot....
</P>
<P>
   ``But Georgia is an outstanding program. We've got good athletes
here. What we want to do as a staff and as a unit is just to
understand our roles and what we have to do to achieve certain
goals. And have fun doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE SCHEMES FLEXIBLE
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey swore by pressure, attacking defense. Gibbs swears to no
single scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to doing what you have to do defensively to win,
and there's not one answer to that,'' he said. ``Coach (Barry)
Switzer used to say, `It's not the alignment that's important; it's
the alignees.' I believe that. It's what kind of players you have
and creating situations that are in your favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs has been on the job just three weeks and only 10 days
remain before spring practice begins, so he is hesitant to make an
assessment. But he will offer this: Few of Georgia's problems have
anything to do with talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got good speed and quickness and guys who can run,'' he
said. ``You see spurts of great team speed. You see Richard
(Seymour) and Marcus (Stroud) making plays and Boss (Bailey) making
plays. But, you know, there's a thin line between winning and
losing. There's usually seven or eight plays that make the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs said Georgia came up on the short end of most of those
plays last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes teams beat themselves,'' he said. ``You hear that
about offenses all the time, that they had too many turnovers or
they didn't convert third down or just didn't execute, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the same thing applies on defense. If we've got a
linebacker who misaligns or he's got coverage on the tight end but
he covers the back and the tight end's free, that wasn't physical,
that was mental.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Gibbs said, he isn't going to totally remake the Georgia
defense. A tweak here and there, a lot of work on fundamentals and
an attitude adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to bring in a new playbook,'' he said. ``We're
just going to put a new cover on the old one.''

U.S. DANGLED POISON SECRETS BEFORE SOVIETS, BOOK REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An American double agent working for the FBI
provided the Soviet Union with nerve gas data in the 1960s that may
have spurred Moscow's own efforts to develop chemical weapons, says
a new book on the espionage case.
</P>
<P>
   The spy, an Army sergeant, was told by the U.S. government to
hand over the nerve gas information, the book says.
</P>
<P>
   The American officials had decided to give the Soviet Union the
secret nerve gas data because they hoped the information would lead
it down the wrong path in the development of its own chemical
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The data concerned a formula that the United States had tried to
develop but had then abandoned because it was considered too
unstable for weapons use. By giving it to the Soviets, American
officials hoped, they would lead Moscow to waste time trying to
develop an unusable nerve agent.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remain about whether the American information
actually aided the Soviets, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the nerve gas formulas passed to the
Soviets led them to develop new chemical weapons. But intelligence
gathered about the U.S. weapons program may have prompted the
Soviets to conduct more intensive research and development on their
own program, the book says.
</P>
<P>
   The complex double-agent case in which the nerve gas information
played a central role has been revealed for the first time in a new
book, ``Cassidy's Run: The Secret Spy War Over Nerve Gas,'' by a
Washington-based author, David Wise, and is to be published this
month by Random House.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on Joseph Cassidy, an Army sergeant whom the
book calls the FBI's longest-running double agent of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Selected by the FBI from a pool of noncommissioned officers in
1959 as a ``dangle'' to lure Soviet intelligence officers to
recruit him as a spy, Cassidy worked as an FBI double agent against
the Soviet Union for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   His case, code-named Operation Shocker, was designed to learn
more about Soviet intelligence operations in America and to keep
the Russians busy with an American agent under FBI control, rather
than with real spies.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that the Cassidy case ultimately allowed the FBI
to unearth deep-cover Soviet moles operating in the United States
who were assigned by the Soviets to work with Cassidy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is extremely accurate about my role as a double
agent,'' Cassidy, now 79 and living in retirement in Florida, said
in an interview. The FBI declined to comment on the book.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had to allow Cassidy to pass the Soviets some
genuine secrets in order to keep them interested, the book says. By
establishing his credibility with real secrets, Cassidy was then in
a position to give distorted information to the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, while Cassidy was assigned to the Army's Edgewood
Arsenal in Maryland, where the government was then developing
chemical and biological weapons, the FBI had him pass the Soviets
information about a nerve gas agent on which the United States had
done research.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had halted research on the nerve agent, called
GJ, and it had never been developed into a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   But Cassidy passed the Soviets documents that indicated that the
United States had successfully created the nerve agent, to try to
convince the Soviets that the United States was ahead in nerve gas
development.
</P>
<P>
   Real information about the U.S. research effort on the nerve gas
was mixed in with the fake documents.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve gas deception operation ran for 3{ years, as Cassidy
repeatedly passed documents _ some real, some fake _ to the Soviets
about the GJ nerve gas.

END TO SOCIAL SECURITY PENALTY WELCOMED BY COMPANIES AND THEIR
WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN with LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At McDonald's Corp. in Oak Brook, Ill., the oldest
workers, those 65 to 69, scrutinized their paychecks as the end of
each year approached. Last year, when their accumulated wages
neared a magic number, $15,500, many resigned. ``A senior would
sadly say, `I can't afford to work here anymore,''' said Walt
Riker, the company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As McDonald's workers went, so went Emily Galvenz, 68, of Miami,
out walking in a park on Thursday. ``That was one of the reasons I
never took a full-time job after I retired,'' said Galvenz, who
works part-time managing a beauty salon. ``It just hurts to give
money like that away to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that from now on, Galvenz and the McDonald's
employees will be able to work and earn as much as they like _ with
the enthusiastic blessings of their employers.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by election-year politics and complaints from employers
scrambling to find enough workers to help them keep the boom alive,
the House voted 422-0 on Wednesday to purge the Social Security
laws of a relic of the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the provision has reduced the benefits of workers
ages 65 through 69 for every dollar they earned over a certain
amount. At the time it was enacted, the law was designed to move
older workers aside in favor of younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and President Clinton are widely expected to go
along, and the bill they are considering would be retroactive, to
the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Across virtually every sector of the economy, the initiative is
receiving enthusiastic acclaim, reflecting the now-rare unanimity
among lawmakers of both parties on Capitol Hill. With the sole
possible exception of the leadership of organized labor, which has
yet to take a position, this is one of those exceptional government
initiatives that hardly anyone faults publicly.
</P>
<P>
   But while saying the overall effects should be positive for
workers, their employers and the economy, some experts in workplace
management say it creates new challenges for employers in managing
older work forces and, once the economy stalls, in dispensing of
those who have lost their edge. Increasingly, they say, retirement
is becoming a matter of negotiation, requiring new flexibility in
setting workers' schedules and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many corporations will look to phased retirement,''
said John Woyke, principal of Towers Perrin, a human resources
consulting firm in New York. ``In the typical job _ especially in
the service economy where people aren't constrained by their
muscles _ we do not see a decline in ability at age 65.'' And in
this tight job market, he said, ``we will see a definite number of
initiatives to encourage people to stay longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, older workers are docked $1 in Social
Security benefits for every $3 they earn above a limit the
government sets _ rising to $17,000 for this year from $15,500. The
repeal means little for those who earn less than $17,000. At
$20,000 in wages, the worker loses $1,000 in benefits. And at about
$68,000, the worker loses it all, up to $17,196 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unambiguously a good thing,'' said Gary Burtless,
labor economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. At the
point at which workers start losing Social Security benefits, he
said his research has shown, they simply stop work because they see
themselves paying an additional tax on top of all their other
taxes. ``It's just a pure bad tax,'' Burtless said.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Morton, a lobbyist for the AARP, calls it ``good labor
policy, good social policy and good economic policy.'' Bruce
Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said, ``Everyone's running out of workers. Anything that will
ameliorate that problem is useful.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, is also one of
its biggest employers, with 885,000 workers in the United States.
The company does not know how many are older than 65, but it says
134,000 are over 55.
</P>
<P>
   Most Wal-Mart employees earn low wages, less than $10 an hour.
But when they do cross the $17,000 annual threshold, or about $8.30
an hour for a full-time job, the penalty kicks in at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This House vote will mean a lot to them and it will make us
happy too,'' said Tom Williams, a Wal-Mart spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The repeal also pleases a company where workers earn vastly more
than at Wal-Mart _ Lockheed Martin Corp. in Bethesda, Md., the
giant defense contractor. There, older professional workers
routinely earn more than $68,784 a year, the point at which the
$1-for-$3 formula wipes out their entire Social Security benefit.
Restored, the benefit comes as a significant bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might cause people with deep experience to stay longer,''
said James Fetig, a Lockheed spokesman. After Lockheed experienced
a series of rocket launch failures, Fetig said, an analysis showed
that one reason was that too many ``mature, first generation''
rocket scientists had left the company in the mergers and
downsizings of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   At General Mills in Minneapolis, one of the nation's oldest big
companies, Michael Peel, the vice president for human resources,
says the company has ``lots and lots'' of employees who are in
their 60s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as irreplaceable talent,'' Peel said. ``And given
the demographic crunch in our country and the scarcity of
intellectual capital,'' the repeal of the earnings limitation
``will have a beneficial impact'' on the company's efforts to hold
onto those workers.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Weatherbee, spokeswoman at IBM, said, ``The basic point is
that we want the skills that will win in the marketplace, and these
skills come across in all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, at least, concerns about whether workers'
performance declines with age appears not to be an issue, or at
least not one that employers openly discuss. With the job market so
tight, consultants say employers have an incentive to retrain
workers with expiring skills, or move them to jobs where they can
be more productive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they say, employers have another reason for holding
on to the workers they have even if the economy slows: the
baby-boom population is moving into its 50s, and far fewer younger
workers are coming up behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a corporation wants to get rid of its work force it has
no problem doing it,'' said William Goldberg, partner in charge of
personal financial planning in the Houston office of KPMG, the
consulting firm. ``It is just the opposite in this tight labor
market.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At universities, where complaints of doddering tenured
professors have become commonplace, administrators say they doubt
that the ending the earnings limitation will have much to do with
the professors' choices to stay or move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals, either at the faculty or at the staff level, at
that age level, at that age bracket, view working for the
university as a calling,'' said Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel
at the American Council on Education, which represents 1,800 public
and private colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as a profession,'' Steinbach said, ``rather than as a job.
And to the best of my understanding, no individual in the past,
present or future, viewed the cap as an impediment or a stricture
on their desire to continue to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But for workers in other fields, the repeal is likely to achieve
just what employers and lawmakers hope in expanding the labor
force.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Homer May of Sagamore Beach, who turned 65 in
June, said he would not let the repeal thwart his plans to retire
soon from his job as a mechanical piping designer. ``We want to go
places and do things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also plans to work, part-time, until he reached the
earnings limit of $17,000. ``My cap was like four days a month,''
he said, ``and this will give me the opportunity to be a little
more flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend and fellow piping designer, Robert Flaherty, of
Quincy, Mass., turned 65 on Wednesday, and he has no plans yet to
slow down or retire. ``But the concern about making the money and
losing the Social Security was down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew people,'' Flaherty said, ``who worked for me some years
ago when the limit was $7,000, and they would work until three in
the afternoon, and they would leave because they didn't want to
lose any Social Security money.''

COAST TO COAST, TROVES OF DELEGATES AT STAKE ON TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voting on March 7 represents the closest this country has
ever come to a national primary to choose the major parties'
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Contests will be held in 16 states from coast to coast and in
American Samoa. Nearly a third of the 2,066 delegates to the
Republican convention and 4,338 delegates to the Democratic
convention are at stake. Chances are, when all of Tuesday's votes
are counted, it could be clear who will be nominated at both
conventions in August.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the public attention and the candidates' resources have
been devoted to California and New York, which together have 42
percent of the Republican delegates to be chosen on Tuesday and 46
percent of the Democratic delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But other large states, like Ohio, Georgia and Massachusetts,
are also voting. And New England is holding what amounts to its own
regional primary with contests in every state except New Hampshire,
which had the first primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The potential combinations are intriguing. For instance, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona is the favorite in all five New England
states that are voting and that together have 102 Republican
delegates, one more than New York. If McCain wins most of the
delegates in New England and New York, that could offset a victory
by Gov. George W. Bush in California, which has 162 Republican
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bush could sweep Georgia (54 delegates) and
Missouri (35) and do well in caucuses in Minnesota (34), and that
could balance losses in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is complicated by the Republicans' voting rules.
In most of the states voting on Tuesday, only a fraction of the
delegates are allocated on the basis of who wins statewide, and
most are awarded to the candidate who carries each congressional
district. As a result, in many states, Bush and McCain are each
likely to win some delegates, and it is possible they will be
divided fairly equally.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore appears to have a
clear lead over former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey in every
state voting on Tuesday. And while Bradley may win some delegates
in congressional districts, he may not win the majority of the
delegates in any state.
</P>
<P>
   In all states, Democratic candidates are allotted delegates
according to their proportion of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   (The following reports were written by David E. Rosenbaum, Paul
Zielbauer, Todd S. Purdum, Adam Nagourney, Sam Howe Verhovek and
Dirk Johnson.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CALIFORNIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Single ballot with all candidates. Only votes of
party members count for delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 367 Democratic, 162 Republicans, winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 26, Bush 9, Gore 21, McCain 29.
</P>
<P>
   California has not played a decisive role in settling a
presidential nomination in nearly three decades, and its impact
this year may be diluted by same-day contests in other big states.
But all four major contenders have poured time, money and
television advertising into trying to do well in the biggest state
of all, and the final two debates before the March 7 primaries were
both in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual feature of this year's primary is that the
names of all candidates will appear on the same ballot regardless
of party, providing the first big test of the probable nominees'
comparative strength in a general election. The latest polls show
Gore, Bush and McCain in something close to a three-way tie for the
overall vote, with each drawing about a quarter of likely voters
and Bradley and Alan Keyes, the third Republican candidate,
trailing badly in single-digits. Under party rules, only the votes
of party members will count in selecting delegates for each party,
and Bush has consistently led McCain 2-1 among Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush have almost all the support of their party
establishments and the most organizational troops on the ground.
They and their opponents have each spent millions of dollars on
television advertising, although their commercials have not run
nearly as often as a welter of advertisements for statewide ballot
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest political surprise of the season in
California was Bradley's inability to gain any real traction. He
spent a year teaching at Stanford University after leaving the
Senate, and more than held his own in the fund-raising sweepstakes
against Gore in both Hollywood and the Silicon Valley. But
California's economic recovery has almost precisely coincided with
the Clinton administration's tenure in Washington, and Gore's
assiduous seven-year courtship of the state has paid off in his
strong standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONNECTICUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Only party members can vote in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 54 Democratic, 25 Republican, winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 3, Bush 1, Gore 2, McCain 3.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published last week by Zogby International shows McCain
and Bush in a statistical tie. Several factors stand in Bush's
favor: strong support from the state's governor, John G. Rowland,
who has overseen a statewide effort on Bush's behalf, and family
history. President Bush, the candidate's father, was born and
raised in Greenwich, George W. Bush was born in New Haven and
attended Yale University, and the Bush name remains a powerful
beacon to the party faithful. How many faithful there are remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's anti-establishment message has widespread appeal in
Connecticut, where 40 percent of the state's 1.9 million voters are
independent. But the senator is hindered by the state's voting
rules, which bar independents from the primaries and prohibit
crossover voting. New voters and independents have until Monday at
noon to register in a party.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, who control the state Legislature, Connecticut
seems poised to give a victory to Gore, whose image has appeared on
television screens far more than Bradley's. A Quinnipiac College
poll taken two weeks ago showed Gore leading Bradley by 9 points,
and Bradley has not been able to cut down his deficit since then.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Voters can cast ballots in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 77 Democratic. 54 Republican, 33 winner-take-all per
congressional district, 21 at-large, winner-take-all overall.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 2, Bush 2, Gore 5, McCain 1.
</P>
<P>
   This state is solidly in the Bush camp. Almost all of Georgia's
elected Republican officials are supporting Bush. McCain canceled
his only visit to Georgia in the days before the primary and has no
staff or resources in the state.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four major candidates have run any television
advertisements. Bush and Gore each made a single quick appearance
in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has the backing of Gov. Roy Barnes and most party leaders,
and a poll last week showed him leading Bradley among Democrats, 64
percent to 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAWAII &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 33 delegates are at stake in the Hawaii Democratic
caucuses. But there has been hardly any campaigning in what remains
the most solidly Democratic state in the nation, and the 10th
smallest, with just four electoral votes. Republicans will choose
their delegates in a state convention in May.
</P>
<P>
   None of the major presidential contenders has visited the state,
and none has any paid staff there. Even the flushest, the Bush
campaign, is headquartered in the home of its state chairman,
Barbara Marumoto, although a telephone line, fax line and post
office box are paid for by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has the support of virtually the entire elected
establishment, and Lt. Gov. Mazie Hirono, the head of the local
steering committee, said there were plans for minimal direct
mailings and phone calls aimed at getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IDAHO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are sometimes referred to as an endangered species in
Idaho, and whoever is the party's presidential nominee will face a
huge uphill battle for the state's four electoral votes in
November. Neither Gore nor Bradley has campaigned in the state in
recent months, though their wives, Tipper and Ernestine, happened
to wind up together at a state Democratic dinner in Boise last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, 16 of the state's 23 Democratic delegates are at
stake in Tuesday's caucuses; the rest are so-called superdelegates,
already selected. As elsewhere, Gore has a clear edge in
endorsements of elected officials and teacher and labor groups. And
he has the backing of the widow of Sen. Frank Church, an iconic
figure in the state. But Bradley has the support of Cecil Andrus, a
popular former governor and secretary of the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will select their delegates at caucuses in May.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAINE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Only party members can vote in primaries, but
independents can enroll in a party at the polls. Deadline for party
switching has past.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 23 Democratic. 14 Republican, allotted by proportion
of vote, unless majority, then winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 1, Bush 0, Gore 1, McCain 1.
</P>
<P>
   Most voters, about 300,000, are registered as independents. In
1992, they helped Ross Perot beat President Bush in the state's
general election.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no polls of Maine voters recently, making the
candidates' popularity hard to measure. Bradley's campaign has been
buoyed by endorsements from 10 of the state's 18 Democratic state
senators.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is in a tight race with Bush in Maine, where the Bush
family owns a home and garners strong support from the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-five out of 100 times in Maine the more moderate
candidate will win the primary,'' said Christian Potholm, a
professor at Bowdoin College, in Brunswick. ``If McCain came to
Maine and spent a little money on television, I think he could win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MARYLAND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Independent voters can vote in Republican, but not
Democratic, primary. No crossover voting.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 68 Democratic. 31 Republican, 24 winner-take-all per
congressional district, 7 at-large, winner-take-all overall.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 2, Bush 2, Gore 5, McCain 1.
</P>
<P>
   Although Maryland is the 19th most populous state, the
presidential candidates have devoted few resources there. There has
been little television advertising, and the candidates have visited
mostly for fund-raisers. Partly this is because much of Maryland
receives Washington newspapers and television. The extensive
political coverage makes local campaigning and advertising less
important than they might be elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bush ahead, but his lead is not commanding. The Bush
campaign sent about a dozen paid staff members to Maryland last
week to supervise mailings and phone banks. The McCain campaign has
a corps of volunteers but no paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland is one of the most heavily Democratic states in the
country. By all accounts, Gore has a substantial lead over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Under state party rules, independents can vote in the Republican
primary and this could work to McCain's advantage. The word in
Republican circles is that the higher the turnout, the better the
chances of a McCain victory.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MASSACHUSETTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Independent voters may vote in either primary. No
crossover voting.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 93 Democratic. 37 Republican, winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 11, Bush 2, Gore 6, McCain 6.
</P>
<P>
   Even in liberal Democratic Massachusetts, about half of
registered voters are independent and more than 25,000 Democrats
have changed party affiliation to vote Republican on Tuesday. Both
are good signs for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show McCain ahead of Bush by more than 20
percentage points, even though the state's governor, Paul Cellucci,
and the state party are supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released on Feb. 25 showed McCain drawing strong support
from registered Republicans and sweeping every demographic
category.
</P>
<P>
   In September, polls showed that Gore led Bradley 40 percent to
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerry Chervinsky, a pollster with KRC Communications
Research in Newton, Mass., said things had changed drastically.
``Gore will win convincingly,'' Chervinsky said. ``Massachusetts
still loves Clinton, there's no Clinton fatigue here.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MINNESOTA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Voters declare they are members of a party before
voting in caucus.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 34 Republicans. Caucuses hold nonbinding straw polls
on candidates and elect delegates to conventions that pick parties'
national convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 3, Bush 1, Gore 2, McCain 0.
</P>
<P>
   This is the largest state in which both parties choose their
delegates at caucuses. The Democrats will hold theirs on March 11
and 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are also holding a straw poll, but the outcome
will have no binding effect on delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage in caucus states usually goes to the candidates
with the best organizations, so it is assumed that Bush will win
most of the support at the Republican precinct caucuses on Tuesday.
McCain has no official campaign in the state. The latest polls show
Bush ahead in public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But in politics, Minnesotans often go against the grain. There
is no registration by party in the state. Voters will be free to
attend whichever caucuses they please. And no one is able to
predict the size of the turnout or the outcome with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MISSOURI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Voters can cast ballots in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 75 Democratic. 35 Republican, winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 9, Bush 5, Gore 1, McCain 2.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain made in-and-out stops in Missouri last week, but
neither candidate has put many resources into the state. The most
recent polls show Bush somewhat ahead. But Missouri does not have
party registration, so it is hard to predict who will turn out for
which primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was reared in Crystal City, down the Mississippi River
from St. Louis, and he announced his candidacy there. Bradley also
seems to have done more television advertising in the state than
any other presidential candidate. But none of the state's
Democratic Party leaders are suggesting that he will come out ahead
of Gore on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Party members only.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 243 Democratic. 101 Republican. Candidates have
slates of delegates in the 31 congressional districts, 93 in all;
the three delegates with the most votes in each district win. State
party committee chooses eight at-large delegates.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 27, Bush 5, Gore 26, McCain 11.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, most people in politics assumed they knew the
contours of the New York primary: There would be a huge fight on
the Democratic side, as Gore faced a stiff challenge from Bradley.
On the Republican side there would be, well, nothing _ or almost
nothing, as the state's Republican machine once again ensured that
its favored candidate, this time Bush, had the primary ballot to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   What is actually happening is the reverse. The Republican Party
failed to keep McCain and Keyes off the ballot. This resulting
fight _ the first competitive Republican primary in New York since
1980 _ appears to ride on a few factors. The first is a harsh
attack directed at McCain by Bush, in the form of mail and radio
and television advertisements, that portray him as anti-New York,
against breast cancer research and anti-environment. The second
factor is the system: Delegates appear on the ballot, with the
candidates' names in tiny type underneath. Unlike McCain's
delegates, Bush's tend to be elected officials; they are well known
and have a network to get out their vote. The third factor is
McCain, whose campaign would seem particularly well suited to the
state's moderate Republican electorate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bradley's campaign has been barely perceptible.
What might prove most significant is what happened long before the
vote: Gore's methodical campaign to nail down support from unions,
Democratic officials and constituency groups. These are the people
who get the vote out. And they could make the difference in a
presumably low Democratic turnout.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NORTH DAKOTA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota's Democratic caucuses are essentially a beauty
contest. The state's 14 Democratic delegates will be chosen at the
state party convention in April.
</P>
<P>
   The state's two senators and one House member are Democrats, but
North Dakota has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate
since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Neither Gore nor Bradley has had
any significant organization in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   No statewide polls have been conducted on the race, but Gore is
expected to dominate the delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won the Republican caucuses on Feb. 29 with 76 percent of
the vote, taking all 19 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OHIO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Voters can cast ballots in either primary, after
enrolling in a party at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 146 Democratic. 69 Republican, 57 winner-take-all per
congressional district, 12 at-large, winner-take-all overall.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 4, Bush 6, Gore 7, McCain 2.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has high hopes for Ohio, the third-largest state voting
on March 7. Independents and Democrats are free to vote in the
Republican primary. Similar rules led to his victory in Michigan on
Feb. 22, and the demographics in Ohio resemble those in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has run a substantial amount of advertising on television
statewide. His campaign stops in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati
last weekend received considerable coverage in newspapers and on
television news shows.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has little organization in the state. Bush, on the
other hand, has the support of Gov. Bob Taft and almost all other
prominent Republicans in the state, and he is organized in each of
Ohio's 88 counties. The latest polls show Bush with a modest lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore appears to be comfortably ahead.
Union families and African-Americans are disproportionately
important in Democratic primaries in Ohio, and Gore seems to have
solid support from those groups.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RHODE ISLAND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: No crossover voting, but independent voters can
cast ballots in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 22 Democratic, 14 Republican, winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 2, Bush 1, Gore 3, McCain 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island is one of New England's most staunchly Democratic
states. Only about 15,000 of the state's 600,000 voters _ or 2.5
percent _ cast ballots in the 1996 Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Every winner of New Hampshire's presidential primary since 1972
has also won in Rhode Island, and McCain and Gore are the clear
favorites on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush have the support of the top officials in their
parties. Gov. Lincoln C. Almond and Sen. Lincoln Chafee support
Bush. Sen. Jack Reed and Reps. Bob Weygand and Patrick Kennedy are
behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But like voters in neighboring Connecticut, Rhode Island's
voters are historically independent of party machinery, and 39
percent of the electorate, according to a recent survey, may still
be undecided.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERMONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VOTING RULES: Voters can cast ballots in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   DELEGATES: 15 Democratic, 12 Republican, winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE VISITS: Bradley 1, Bush 1, Gore 0, McCain 1.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's core theme of campaign finance reform will find a ready
audience in Vermont, which has some of the nation's strictest rules
on donations.
</P>
<P>
   With independents and Democrats far outnumbering Republicans,
and the primaries open to all voters, McCain will have an
advantage. Polls show him leading Bush by about 20 points. McCain
forces are predicting victory in the election, only the second
binding primaries held in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Bradley is better organized than in most
other states, and his campaign has been well received by liberal
Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has received endorsements from members of the state's
Democratic national committee delegation, but Gov. Howard Dean and
several other top state officials have come out for Gore. Recent
polls show Gore leading Bradley 56 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attention lavished on Washington state by candidates
of both parties for last week's primary, it was, in terms of
collecting delegates to the national convention, an almost
meaningless exercise.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, the primary, which Gore won easily despite
Bradley's nearly nonstop presence in the state for a week leading
up to the vote, was a beauty contest only. For the Republicans,
just 12 delegates were at stake; Bush collected seven and McCain 12
in a proportional allocation of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Tuesday's caucuses will be the deciding factor in
allocating 94 Democratic delegates and 25 remaining Republican
delegates. Since the caucuses tend to attract the more die-hard
elements of each party, both Bush and Gore, the winners in the
broader primary voting, are expected to do at least as well on
Tuesday, although both McCain and Bradley have held out hopes of a
surprise victory in the caucuses.

MCCAIN'S CANDIDACY REOPENS VIETNAM-ERA WOUNDS FOR CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Next month's 25-year anniversary of the fall of Saigon
and the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain are reopening a
long forgotten fissure between two groups of Canadian
50-somethings: the roughly 25,000 American draft dodgers still
living here, and the almost equal number of Canadians who
volunteered to fight in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where most people have access to American
television news, scenes of crowds flocking to hear McCain are
striking deep chords among the Vietnam War generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been surprised by the deep emotional responses _ anger
and resentment, empathy and compassion,'' said Michael J. Strada, a
West Virginia professor who did not flee to Canada but has been
researching those who did, connecting the ``dodger diaspora''
through an e-mail chat list.
</P>
<P>
   How draft dodgers feel about McCain's candidacy has a lot to do
with how they see themselves today, 30 years after they left the
United States. Those who have climbed into the establishment here _
as lawyers, business executives, teachers and doctors _ are more
even-handed about the political popularity of the Vietnam veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Others who are less well-off are sometimes still hostile about
what drove them to leave and are critical of the McCain candidacy.
And among Canadians who voluntarily signed up to fight with the
Americans, the senator's compelling story makes him a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Diamond, a social worker who came here from Connecticut
in the fall of 1968, sees the political rise of McCain as heralding
a simplistic revisionism of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is rehabilitating the war by bringing up the fact that he
went to Vietnam, that he did his duty, that he was a POW, defending
the U.S.,'' said Diamond, a University of Hartford graduate who
works here with homeless people. ``It would take an awfully big
person to say, `I was a POW for 5{ years, and I was wrong, and my
country was wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lebowitz, who left his home in New York to escape the
draft and is now president of a Vancouver software development
company, said: ``John McCain represents the aging of an American
generation. And he represents it with grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Malboeuf was a Vietnam volunteer who crossed the border
heading south, signing up for a two-year stint with the U.S. Army's
101st Airborne in Vietnam. Today, he sees McCain's rise as
vindication for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see him win it,'' said Malboeuf, a salesman
who is active in a Toronto chapter of a Canadian Vietnam veterans
group. ``He would bring back some credibility, some respect for the
veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate also focuses attention on a rare northbound migration
in modern North America. Americans often see population movement
along the Canadian border as uniformly southbound with Canadians
moving to the United States for lower taxes, milder weather and
better jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But upheavals in the United States have provided immigrants to
Canada: British loyalists after the Revolutionary War,
African-Americans escaping slavery before the Civil War, farmers
during Canada's Western land rush, and in the late 1960s, about
50,000 young men who came to Canada to escape the Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's government accepted American draft evaders by
forbidding its authorities to ask American men about their draft
status. In 1969, after a heated debate, Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau extended Canada's welcome to American military deserters.
Roughly 1,000 deserters are believed to have taken refuge in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the dodgers and deserters are believed to have
gone home after President Jimmy Carter declared an amnesty in
January 1977, his first official act as president.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Canadian volunteers returned home, they were
greeted like mercenaries, according to Tracey Arial, author of ``I
Volunteered: Canadian Vietnam Vets Remember'' (Watson &AMP; Dwyer,
1997). Referring to their historically low profile here, she said:
``The only time these guys get called by the media is on the
anniversary of My Lai. The draft dodgers get all the coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Vandals have occasionally hit the two Canadian memorials to the
110 countrymen who died fighting in Vietnam. In the late 1990s,
Canadian federal officials said that Vietnam was not Canada's war
and refused to allot public space in Ottawa for a war memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Now, emboldened by the political rise of McCain, the volunteers
are emerging from the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCain would make a good president _ if I was there,
he would have my vote,'' said Lee Hitchins, a U.S. Navy veteran,
who is president of the Canadian Vietnam Veterans in Ottawa.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Canadian veterans are nearly unanimous in saying they feel
vindicated by McCain's rise, the aging draft dodgers are split.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility to the presidential ambitions of an unapologetic
Vietnam veteran comes from some dodgers who remain outside of
Canada's power circles, men like Diamond, the social worker, or
Morgan Davis, a professional blues singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain fits like a glove as far as the United States goes,''
said Davis, a former California campus radical with the Students
for a Democratic Society. A resident here since 1968, Davis added:
``It's an imperialistic nation. They love to have war heroes _ John
F. Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, 31 Canadian organizations worked to help
American draft dodgers make the transition here. Today, all these
groups have vanished, largely because the Americans, mostly middle
class college graduates, have proved to be successful immigrants.
They include university professors, a Toronto business consultant,
a Montreal psychiatrist, a Vancouver airline pilot, and, in Ottawa,
a member of the National Parole Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an expatriate but I can't remember why,'' said Lebowitz,
the president of the software development company.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back 35 years to when he was an 18-year-old growing up
in New York, Lebowitz said that he and McCain made different
choices, partly in response to different upbringings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was third generation Annapolis,'' he continued. ``I grew up
in a left-wing American household in Flushing. I grew up hating the
McCarthyites that killed the Rosenbergs,'' referring to the
execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953 on espionage
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Similar views came from Dave Lutz, who left a teaching job in
Brooklyn in the summer of 1969 to escape the draft. He came to New
Brunswick, where this one-time ``long-hair,'' as he described
himself, rose to become president of the provincial law society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an accident of history that I am here, and did not go
to Vietnam,'' he said, talking on his cell phone as he drove to a
skiing weekend in Maine. Most of the draft dodgers who stayed in
Canada have dual citizenship, and regularly visit the land of their
birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as revisionist,'' he said of the response by
American voters to McCain's war record. ``The country is
desperately looking for a hero, and this happens to be the guy with
the credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Strada, who teaches political science at West Virginia
University, said that many Canadian-American draft dodgers today
``view vets as co-victims of the Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deep philosophical difference between vets and
draft dodgers,'' said the professor, who has interviewed about 75
American dodgers in Canada for his research. ``But today I see
expressed by the draft dodgers a considerable amount of empathy for
the suffering that veterans went through.''

FOR MCCAIN, A FAINT ECHO OF EISENHOWER'S COUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Texas, Pa., Ohio, N.H., Mich., Mass., Conn., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A war hero challenged the choice of the
establishment, a member of an old political clan, for the
Republican presidential nomination. For reasons that were not
entirely clear, the war hero, who saw himself as a stout
conservative, was considered too liberal by the party's old guard.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign unfolded, the war hero's undoubted popularity
with the public prompted newspapers to suggest that only he could
defeat the Democratic nominee in the fall. But the state-by-state
rules governing the selection of delegates were stacked against
him, and his rival was the clear favorite when the convention
opened, with 530 delegates to the war hero's 427.
</P>
<P>
   So the hero challenged the rules with a cleverly named ``Fair
Play'' amendment, promoted with banners proclaiming ``Thou Shall
Not Steal!'' and persuaded the convention to overturn them. The
forces of orthodoxy were completely outflanked, and the hero won
the nomination. In November, to no one's surprise, he was elected
president by a decisive majority.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1952, the contenders Dwight D. Eisenhower, the
liberator of Europe, and Robert A. Taft, the son of former
President William Howard Taft. Nearly a half century later,
Republican politicians are looking back to that tumultuous
convention in Chicago's International Amphitheater and wondering
whether something vaguely similar might happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the obvious similarities, there are major
differences between the half-forgotten Republican contest of 1952
and the battle between this year's war hero, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, and this year's establishment standard-bearer, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas. Unlike McCain, Eisenhower was a political
neophyte; unlike Bush, Sen. Taft was the most prominent member of
his party, twice before a contender for the presidency and
thoroughly tested in the politics of Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most delegates are chosen in primaries and caucuses
rather than by party leaders, as in 1952, and most of them arrive
at conventions already committed. That means there is less room for
insider maneuvering. In 1952, the delegations of Michigan,
California and Pennsylvania were at least nominally unpledged _ a
pool of votes that Eisenhower ultimately managed to tap. (A
byproduct of the need to woo California was the choice of its
junior senator, Richard M. Nixon, as the vice presidential
nominee).
</P>
<P>
   But the peculiarities of the California election law could
conceivably precipitate a credentials fight at Philadelphia this
summer, as did unusual procedures at the Texas state Republican
convention in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The primary in California is in two parts. In the first, all
registered voters will chose among presidential candidates of all
parties, listed on the same ``bedsheet'' ballot; that so-called
beauty contest will give a strong hint as to which candidates have
the best chances of capturing the coveted electoral votes of the
nation's biggest state in November.
</P>
<P>
   But because of Republican party rules, it will have no impact on
the choice of California's 162 convention delegates. They will be
allocated strictly on the basis of votes cast by registered
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush inherits no great California following from his father,
former President George Bush, who wrote off the state in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite possible that McCain, who has scored heavily in
states where Democrats and independents crossed over in large
numbers to vote for him, could defeat Bush in the beauty contest
yet lose the convention delegates to him. Indeed, one of the
shrewdest observers of California politics, Bill Carrick, a
Democratic campaign consultant, has suggested that as one logical
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   If it happens on Tuesday _ a large ``if'' _ and if McCain
manages to win a significant number of the other primaries the same
day, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and perhaps
Ohio _ another big ``if'' _ the Arizonan would have a significant
bloc of delegates. Would he then challenge the credentials of a
California delegation pledged to a candidate whom he had beaten in
the state's all-comers contest?
</P>
<P>
   It would not necessarily be a lopsided fight if he chose to do
so; under the present party rules, contested delegates cannot vote
on their own challenged credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has issued no threats, but speaking in Stockton,
Calif., this week, he said that a muddled verdict would present
Republicans with a seriously messy problem.
</P>
<P>
   Although careful to say he did not want ``some big delegate
fight,'' McCain added: ``If there's a split decision, that's going
to be a debate taking place within the Republican Party. Do they
want somebody who won the majority, or do they want somebody who
only won Republican votes?''
</P>
<P>
   Aides, less circumspect, said all options would be considered,
including a lawsuit challenging the delegate-selection process, an
appeal to the California party to share delegates and a credentials
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would argue forcefully, no doubt, that he had played by the
rules in other states and accepted his losses (in New Hampshire and
Michigan, for example) and that McCain should do the same thing in
California. But a new ``fair play'' gambit could put considerable
pressure on him, particularly if he barely eked out a victory in
the Republicans-only vote there.

 &HT;     McCAIN GINGERLY QUESTIONS BUSH ON DEATH PENALTY

<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ Sen. John McCain is gingerly questioning Texas
Gov. George W. Bush's refusal to use DNA evidence to review the
guilt or innocence of convicted murderers awaiting execution on
Texas' death row.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning against Bush for the Republican presidential
nomination, told reporters that executions ought to be suspended
until authorities determine whether the convictions warrant a
second look using high technology identification technology that
relies on genetic material.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that if he were a governor he would ``review every
murder case, every person on death row and see if there's a DNA
application so we can either substantiate their conviction or maybe
give them another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made his remarks aboard his campaign bus, ``Straight Talk
Express,'' as he traveled from New York City late Friday evening to
a campaign rally in Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has presided over more executions than any governor in
U.S. history, has publicly defended Texas' handling of death
penalty cases _ most recently during the nationally televised
candidates' debate last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has 453 inmates awaiting execution. A total of 121 inmates
have been executed in Texas since Bush became governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   McCain conceded that as a member of the U.S. House and Senate
for the past 18 years who has never served as governor of a state,
he had never faced ``an issue like that.'' McCain added: ``But it
just seems to me that I'd be glad to say to my people, `Look,
there's a new technology out there called DNA.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain contrasted Bush's continuation of executions in Texas
with the decision by Illinois Gov. George Ryan to suspend lethal
injections for convicted murders pending a comprehensive review of
prosecutorial conduct, police investigations and DNA. Ryan ordered
the reassessment after a series of murder convictions were
overturned due to police or prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's action affects 161 inmates on Illinois' death row.
Thirteen convicts condemned to die have been exonerated, some as
the result of DNA tests. Of the 12 convicts executed since 1977,
serious questions have arisen about the innocence of one of those
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is Bush's campaign chairman in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about the cases in Texas or Illinois,''
McCain told reporters. ``But I know the governor of Illinois said,
`Time out. Let's look at all these cases to see if there's
applicability (for DNA).'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``If I were the governor of a state and there were
some cases on death row that were on appeal _ which they all are _
I would say, `Okay, why don't we just pause here a minute or a week
or a month or however long it takes you _ and find out those cases
where DNA technology might have some application, look at that and
with the rest of them, press on.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said whenever new technology emerges with possible value
to the criminal justice system, ``It just seems to me that... you
should see if it applies.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain insisted that he didn't intend to ``second guess''
Bush's actions.
</P>
<P>
   As president, McCain said, he would review the convictions of
any federal prisoners on death row, adding: ``I would just make
sure that every person on death row where DNA applied would be
checked out. I don't understand why not.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments came in response to a question about Bush's
remarks about the death penalty during Thursday night's televised
debate. Bush defended Texas' justice system, noting that a federal
court had ordered the release of a convicted murderer whose rights
to legal counsel had been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is out,'' Bush said. ``I'm sorry he's out, he's a
really violent person. I hope he gets retried soon. But the system
worked in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he was ``absolutely confident that everybody who
has been put to death'' during his six years as governor had been
``guilty of the crime charged'' and had had ``full access to our
courts, both state and
</P>
<P>
   federal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush reiterated that he supported the death penalty, saying that
if the penalty is ``administered surely, swiftly and justly it will
save lives.''

   MCCAIN-DEATH PENALTY (PORTLAND, Maine) _ Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., is gingerly questioning Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
refusal to use DNA evidence to review the guilt or innocence of 453
convicted prisoners awaiting execution on Texas' death row. McCain,
campaigning against Bush for the Republican presidential
nomination, told reporters that governors ought to suspend
executions until authorities determine whether the convictions
warrant a second look using high technology identification
technology. Bush, who has presided over more executions than any

Texas death row are protected by the state and federal court
appeals process without the need for a separate DNA review. BY

FOR UNDERDOGS, TUESDAY   MAY NOT BE SO SUPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a five-week political whirlwind that began
with the New Hampshire primary, the insurgent candidates, John
McCain and Bill Bradley, head into ``Super Tuesday'' facing the
same difficulties that have dogged them from the start, with much
of the political establishment and party rules arrayed in
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   With the notable exception of the five New England states, some
of the biggest states holding elections on Tuesday are so dominated
by the party infrastructure and rules favoring George W. Bush and
Al Gore that some analysts refer to Super Tuesday as Establishment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very steep hill to climb,'' said former Senator Warren
Rudman, national cochairman of McCain's campaign against Bush, the
Republican front-runner. While predicting McCain will do ``very
well'' on Tuesday, Rudman said that under arcane party rules,
McCain could receive the most overall votes in the two biggest
states, California and New York, while receiving far fewer
delegates than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong with that,'' Rudman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Kaufman, who was political director for then President
George Bush and is a friend of his son, the Texas governor, said
Bush's prospects this Tuesday look good because of his campaign's
expenditure of tens of millions of dollars across the country and
his ability to earn the backing of party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain hurricane has been pretty impressive,'' said
Kaufman, a Republican national committeeman from Massachusetts.
``But Bush's investment is paying off. The McCain hurricane has
blown through and (Bush) is still standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bradley, who lost by just four points to Gore in New
Hampshire and then had to wait a month for the next primary, is
behind in the polls in every state that will vote Tuesday,
including New York, where he once played professional basketball.
It has been difficult to overcome Gore's advantage in local and
national organization, as Bradley found out when he lost last
Tuesday in Washington despite six straight days of campaigning
there. Bradley chalked up the loss to ``entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
   The very phrase ``Super Tuesday'' underscores the difficulty
facing the insurgents; it is a contest of more than a dozen states
_ 16 for Democrats; 13 for Republicans _ where money and
organization are supremely important. That is a marked contrast to
the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, when the focus was on
meeting voters and spending many days in the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make the argument that being associated with the
establishment is not a good thing in Iowa and New Hampshire,'' said
a Gore spokesman, Chris Lehane. On Super Tuesday, by contrast,
``You are talking primarily about the core Democrats in those
states, and there's not the independent influx you had in other
states. You are talking traditional base.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one has been more frustrated by the process _ and
particularly the schedule _ than Bradley. After narrowly losing New
Hampshire, he believed his campaign was on the rise. Then he had to
wait a month for the next contest, the nonbinding Washington
primary that he lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be a vicious cycle,'' said a Bradley
spokesman, Mo Elleithee, who nonetheless says Bradley has some
bright prospects for Tuesday in the Northeast. ``The media wasn't
paying attention because we didn't have a contest, and then the
media would say no one was paying attention,'' Elleithee said.
</P>
<P>
   The five New England states holding primaries on Tuesday have
leaned toward Gore and McCain, although Bush has said he hopes to
win in Maine and perhaps Connecticut. Massachusetts is the most
obvious exception to the importance of the GOP establishment, with
McCain far ahead in the polls despite Bush's backing by Governor
Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   The race is expected to be decided in three crucial contests:
New York, Ohio, and California.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, a win in just one of those states might prompt him
to extend his campaign. New York is his best hope. But a strong
showing in several states would be helpful because most states,
including California, award Democratic delegates on a proportional
basis, Bradley spokesman Tony Wyche said.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, who had hoped to ride a national wave of momentum to
a blowout on Tuesday, the stakes are equally high. But his campaign
fears that even winning New England and New York, where he is even
in the polls with Bush, may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   McCain defied the New York party leadership, which backs Bush,
and got his name on the ballot. But he may find that even if he
wins the popular vote, party leaders may still use their power to
help Bush. For starters, New York rules allow eight members of the
party leadership to appoint their own delegates, all of which
presumably would go to Bush. Other delegates are allocated by the
vote in each congressional district. So, while McCain is likely to
win by a landslide in New York City congressional districts,
possibly piling up a large enough margin to win the statewide
popular vote, he could lose many upstate congressional districts to
Bush, who would thus get a large share of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is even worse for McCain in California, which has
the biggest prize of 162 delegates. Under the state's Republican
Party rules, only the votes of Republicans count toward the
winner-take-all selection of delegates, which greatly hurts the
chances of McCain, who has relied on his crossover appeal among
independents and Democrats. McCain at least hopes to win the
state's ``beauty contest'' vote, in which any voter can
participate. Thus, McCain could win the overall vote without
getting a single delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Some McCain backers, while doubting there is any chance to win
the Republican vote, believe that a win in the beauty contest could
set the stage for a convention challenge of delegate rules. Under
this theory, a successful challenge could result in McCain winning
at least some of California's delegates, but the idea is considered
a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Ohio, where delegates are awarded by congressional
district, meaning that even a McCain win would not result in a
sweep of the state's delegates. The McCain campaign has compared
Ohio to Michigan, which McCain won with the votes of many Democrats
and independents. Indeed, 18 percent of McCain's Michigan vote came
from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a big difference between Ohio and Michigan. Ohio,
unlike Michigan, is holding a Democratic primary on the same day,
so there will be less incentive for Democrats and independents to
cross over and vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio is a state where organization matters,'' said John Green,
a longtime observer of the state's political scene and director of
the Bliss Institute at the University of Akron. ``We have eight
different media markets and different cultures. The fact that
Ohio's election is occurring on a day with so many other states
stretches resources thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Michigan, Green said, ``The Bush people have figured
out in this state how to use their organization. They are appealing
to independents as well as Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore similarly has a huge organizational
advantage that is likely to give him a major victory in Ohio, Bliss
said. Super Tuesday, he said, is probably the establishment's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation early on was that the primaries would be over
quickly because of the organizational prowess of Bush and Gore,''
Bliss said. ``It didn't work that way for a while. But we are back
to that now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has some hope of doing well in Missouri, where he is
within 10 points of Bush in the polls, but McCain is given little
chance in Minnesota, which has a caucus system that favors an
establishment candidate. There are also contests on Tuesday in
Maryland, which could be a tossup state, and Georgia, which is
leaning toward Bush.

AT BOB JONES UNIVERSITY, THE STUDENTS WONDER WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS
ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The impression one is most likely to gain on
entering the campus of Bob Jones University, a place of yellow
brick buildings and well-kept lawns, is that it is a very long way
from the typical American college. Young men wear neckties. Young
women wear skirts with hemlines at the knee or ankle. No one is
smoking. And a visitor is nearly always addressed as ``Sir.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where life is shaped by fundamentalist Christian
beliefs, and by a great many rules as well. Home to 5,000 students,
Bob Jones has a dress code emphasizing modesty. Classes begin with
prayer. Rock music is forbidden, as are alcohol, tobacco and
holding hands during dates. A bell in the dormitories signals
lights-out at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me more disciplined,'' said Miriam Rybak, 20, a
junior from Damascus, Pa., talking with friends outside the student
snack bar.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Stevens, 18, a freshman, agreed. ``Anywhere in life there
are going to be rules, whether they're federal laws or moral
standards,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   And Lauren Dooley, 19, from Tyler Hill, Pa., added, ``It's a lot
less of the party life than other schools, but I think that's a
good thing.'' She also said that she believed she had made her
life's best friends at Bob Jones: ``We all know we love God.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that is part of the larger picture here, it has been
obscured of late by the political firestorm that blew up around Bob
Jones after Gov. George W. Bush of Texas visited the school on Feb.
2. Bush's opponents faulted him for not speaking out against Bob
Jones' ban on interracial dating and its leaders' harsh criticisms
of Roman Catholic beliefs _ positions that seemed at odds with the
pride the university takes in its academic and fine arts programs.
</P>
<P>
   And then, unexpectedly, the university dropped the ban on
Friday, a move announced by its president, Bob Jones III, on CNN's
``Larry King Live.'' It had become a distraction, Jones said. ``Our
concern for the cause of Christ, our concern for our graduates''
was more important, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, the university placed full-page advertisements in
USA Today and South Carolina newspapers saying that it was not
racist and that it did not hate Catholics. On the CNN program,
Jones made similar statements, but he emphasized the theological
differences between Catholics and fundamentalist Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking not just of Catholics but also of Mormons, Buddhists,
Hindus and others, Jones said, ``We wish these people knew the Lord
Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy seems to have taken many students by surprise.
Several said that the issues had not been the subject of discussion
before the political furor provoked by Bush's visit. Some said that
neither they nor others at Bob Jones had any antipathy toward
Catholics _ even if they rejected Catholic teachings about the
church and the sacraments _ and denied that the university was
racist.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Inafuku, 22, a senior from Waiane, Hawaii, who is student
body president, is the son of an East Asian father and a white
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bob Jones were racist, would I be student body president?''
Inafuku asked. ``Would I be allowed to be in this position? I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones began admitting blacks in 1970 and has a relatively
small number of African-American students. One of them, Angela Lee,
20, a junior from Ellicott City, Md., said she had been impressed
with what Jones said when he spoke at her Baptist church when she
was a high school student.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I prayed about the decision, when I visited the campus, I
didn't believe what other people told me'' that was negative about
the university, she said, ``because I experienced firsthand the
love of the Lord'' through faculty and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't a popular decision,'' she added. ``I went to a
more liberal Christian school, and it was kind of a joke _ me, the
black girl, going to Bob Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   The university was founded in 1927 in Florida by Bob Jones Sr.,
an evangelist who had been licensed to preach at 15. He later moved
the school to Tennessee, then in 1947 to Greenville, a city located
near the Appalachian foothills in northwest South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Academically, it offers more than 110 majors, from accounting
and aircraft maintenance to English, foreign languages, nursing and
special education. It is also known for its serious interest in
fine arts, enhanced by its second president, Bob Jones Jr., who
built up a nationally known collection of Baroque religious
paintings (many of them done by Catholic artists). The university
stages operas and Shakespeare plays.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Brighton, 22, a senior, said, ``I came as a violin
performance major, and I was looking for a college with a very,
very good music program.'' As for the rules of campus life, she
said, ``They're really not that hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Jones' theological outlook _ which has led the
university to be sharply critical not just of Catholicism, but of
the National Council of Churches, the Southern Baptist Convention
and the Rev. Jerry Falwell _ is never far from view. The bookstore
features titles like ``Reclaiming Authentic Fundamentalism,'' as
well as small tracts about Christian fundamentalism that students
can use to proselytize others. Among the speakers scheduled for an
upcoming Bible conference are the Rev. Ian Paisley, the militant
Presbyterian from Northern Ireland, who is an old friend of the
school.
</P>
<P>
   James L. Guth, a professor of political science at nearby Furman
University, said Bob Jones represented a separatist fundamentalism
that is far less common in the United States than it once was. Some
very conservative Protestants _ Falwell perhaps most prominent
among them _ recognize the value of cooperating with other faiths
to advance common social causes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Bob Jones, the science department does teach about evolution.
``But it is taught as theory, in opposition to creation,'' said
Jonathan Pait, the university's spokesman. ``We do think students
should be aware of the theory _ and what we believe is an
unacceptable theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Pait declined to provide a copy of the student handbook, on the
grounds that its statements about rules for students could be taken
out of context. ``What makes us sigh is when that becomes the
focus,'' he said. ``We are distressed when the excellence of this
place is not stressed at the same level as the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the university seems so strict, it has sometimes
been the subject of strange rumors.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Terry Haskins, a graduate of the school and now
president pro tem of the South Carolina state Legislature, chuckled
when he recalled that in the early 1970s, some in Greenville
believed the university had painted its sidewalks pink and blue,
one for women and the other for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's first and foremost a Christian college, teaching the
nondenominational fundamentals of the Protestant faith,'' Haskins
said. ``In many ways, by society's standards, it's very
old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rhonda Galloway, a professor of English, spoke to her
students about Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose spiritual pilgrimage led
him into territory that she made clear was vastly distant from the
fundamentalism of Bob Jones. Her prayer before the class, however,
focused on the issues at hand.
</P>
<P>
   As students bowed their heads, she said, ``We pray, Lord, that
out of this controversy that faces us right now that you will be
glorified.''

FIERCE AD WARS ON BALLOT ISSUES, NOT PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On television and radio the pitch is made
relentlessly. Every commercial break brings another political
come-on. But most of the time it isn't the governor of Texas or the
senator from Arizona, the vice president of the United States or
the former senator from New Jersey whom they are asking you to vote
for.
</P>
<P>
   It is Yes or No.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot clock never seems to stop, whether it is for
Indian gambling or against insurance reform, in favor of clean
water or in opposition to gay marriage. So many groups are elbowing
for television time to broadcast their positions on one of the 20
initiatives and referendums on the California ballot that they are
all but drowning out the political advertising by the presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The California campaign of the air is unlike any other in the
nation. The presidential candidates may have made big financial
investments in the state's sprawling network of media markets; Sen.
John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush have spent a total of about $5
million in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers are dwarfed by the expense and intensity of
the campaigns for the ballot measures _ a fierce, electronic war
lasting months, on which interest groups have spent over $120
million of an astonishing $150 million, a war chest over twice the
size of the one amassed by the national campaign of Bush. It is
among the most expensive barrages of political advertisement any
state has seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's madness,'' said Kim Alexander, president of the
California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit group that, among other
things, tracks campaign spending. ``The ads are designed to scare
voters, manipulate voters, do everything but inform voters. I think
people are going to wonder whether we have too much democracy in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   The veritable dust bowl of issues before the voters _ ``I have
29 decisions to make on my ballot, and I have over 80 candidates to
consider,'' Alexander said _ prompted her to compose a song and
post it on her foundation's Web site: ``If we pass Prop 17 church
raffles are OK/Eighteen changes the length of time we put murderers
away,'' it goes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1900s, California has a quirky history with
voter initiatives, with the most famous being Proposition 13, the
1970s ballot measure that capped local property taxes and caused
deep cuts in education financing. But rarely have commercials for
the questions created such distracting static in a presidential
primary here.
</P>
<P>
   That is because traditionally the state held its election near
the end of the primary season. This year the contest was moved up
to prime time on the primary calendar, making the nation's most
populous state crucial in the selection of the nominees, and thus a
more frenetic media battleground.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the most expensive in the country for political
advertisers, with a dozen major media markets and highly
competitive local stations whose newscasts do not put a premium on
political coverage. (``Would your child know what to do if they
were kidnapped?'' asked a promotion for one dinnertime newscast
last week. ``Tools to get out alive!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``California, for many years, has not been a determining factor
in a presidential primary,'' said Allan Zaremberg, president of the
California Chamber of Commerce. ``We've never had a lot of
competing messages in a presidential primary before, so you haven't
had that presidential clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaremberg's group has taken sides in several of the ballot
fights. The chamber is allied with those opposed to Proposition 25
(which provides for public financing of political campaigns) and
those in favor of Proposition 26 (which changes voting procedures
for local school construction projects). It is also aligned with
groups spending $50 million in the most confusing and expensive
ballot question-fight, which concerns two propositions, 30 and 31,
dealing with lawsuits in insurance cases.
</P>
<P>
   There are also ballot measures involving gambling on tribal
American Indian land (Proposition 1A), safe drinking water (12),
watershed protection (13), restricting marriages to those between a
man and a woman (22), and repealing excise surtaxes on cigarettes
(28), which have active ``for'' and ``against'' advertising
campaigns on television.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The commercials run a gamut from appeals to the heart _ as in a
pro-1A spot suggesting that the right to gamble will help lead ``to
Indian self-reliance'' _ to nasty jabs at the opposition. In one
advertisement running constantly against Propositions 30 and 31, a
trio of sleazy-looking lowlifes, with greasy hair and lounge-lizard
shirts, sling beer bottles as they discuss a scheme to bilk
insurance companies in a scam called the ``swoop and squat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You find the car you like,'' one of them says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice car,'' adds another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gotta have insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I pull in front of the car we like, Frank cuts in front of me,
I slam on the brakes _ boom! `The squat.'''
</P>
<P>
   A narrator interrupts: ``Propositions 30 and 31 make it easier
for cheats to get away with fraud, driving up your insurance
rates,'' the voice says, as the con men gloat in oily triumph.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a pair of referendums that supporters assert would
essentially force insurers to settle claims more quickly in some
accident cases. To make it all the more confusing, though, the
groups that spearheaded the campaign to get the measures on the
ballot are opposed to the propositions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind-numbing, isn't it?'' asked Kelly Hayes-Raitt, a consumer
advocate active in the ``Yes-on-30'' campaign, which is being
outspent by the ``Nos'' by 10 to 1. ``I've been watching their ads
since November,'' she said of the opposition campaign. ``What it's
done is forced the yes campaign to respond to all of these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus California viewers are treated to what one might call
double-negative spots. ``Slick and misleading, drivel, blatant
distortions, untruths,'' the Yes-on-30 commercial begins, in an
attack on the attack ads run by the No-on-30 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, in the endless cycle of grainy footage revealing
the deterioration of California schools in the Yes-on-26 ads, or
the rueful-sounding voice-overs of the No-on-22 spots, the grinning
visage of Bush or the silver-haired McCain pokes through for a
fleeting moment, as if to signal, from a remote point on the
horizon: Hey, remember us? And then it's immediately back to
``swoop and squat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't figure out 30 and 31,'' said Arnie Kleiner,
general manager of KABC, the ABC affiliate in Los Angeles. He calls
the spots for the propositions ``a blessing and a curse'': good
because they bring revenue _ unlike candidates for federal office,
the yes and no campaigns are charged full advertising rates _ and a
bit of a nuisance because they crowd out some of the stations'
regular advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said she believes the chaotic flow of proposition
spots has a corrosive effect on voters, that the disjointed parade
of video pleas for yeses and nos jades viewers and overstuffs their
brains. ``The more choices we ask voters to make, the more we
dilute voters' abilities to make informed choices,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the California ballot to come up with a potential
remedy for itself. Among the many propositions is number 23, which
asks that in future elections, voters be allowed to cast their
ballots for ``None of the above.''

CALIFORNIA SENATE RACE; LOS ANGELES PROSECUTOR'S STRATEGY; ILLINOIS
GOVERNOR'S WOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  (jw)

<P>
   CALIFORNIA: SENATOR'S OUTLOOK IS SUNNY
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the hoopla surrounding the presidential primaries, it
has gone almost unnoticed that there will be a U.S. Senate race on
the ballot when California voters go to the polls on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's senior senator, Dianne Feinstein, a liberal
Democrat, is seeking a second six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when she first ran for a full term (she initially went
to Washington in 1992 to fill out the final two years of an
unexpired term), Feinstein was barely able to fend off her
conservative Republican challenger, Rep. Michael Huffington of
Santa Barbara. He set a national record that year for a Senate
candidate, dumping almost $30 million of his personal fortune into
the contest, and he came within a couple of percentage points of
turning Feinstein out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington has since gone on to other pursuits. And Election
2000 appears to be shaping up as a comfortable romp for Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   She has scared off all Democratic challengers of any
consequence. And on the Republican side, the likely primary winner,
Rep. Tom Campbell, a moderate from the Silicon Valley, has yet to
come up with either the name recognition or the money neede$ to
oust a sitting California senator _ especially one who has plenty
of money and is advertising heavily, who over the past six years
has boosted her job approval rating to around 60 percent, and who
is frequently mentioned as a possible choice for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls have Campbell losing by a solid 20 points in
the fall, with more than half of all voters saying they hardly know
who he is. Perhaps more telling, the polls indicate that come
Tuesday's primary, when cross-party voting will be permitted, about
1 in 5 Republicans and 3 in 5 independents plan to support
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks are fat and happy in California right now and not
inclined to change horses,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffee, a
political analyst at Claremont Graduate University. ``This is
Dianne Feinstein's race to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA: LOS ANGELES PROSECUTOR BIDES HIS TIME
</P>
<P>
   No district attorney in the country is better known than Gil
Garcetti of Los Angeles _ and no wonder. The city has a mix of big
crime, big money and big celebrity that is straight out of, well,
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But high-profile prosecution has high risks, as Garcetti found
out after he failed to win a conviction in his biggest case, the
O.J. Simpson murder trial. Angry voters almost installed a new DA
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Garcetti managed to squeak back in at the last moment.
And he is up for re-election again on Tuesday, facing two other
candidates in a quest for a third four-year tour. Once more he
finds himself in a tough fight.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Garcetti has enjoyed a number of major prosecution
successes. His office has also been praised for undertaking
aggressive campaigns against welfare fraud and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   But all that has been tempered lately by a major scandal in the
police department _ a scandal that Garcetti's detractors charge was
not only not uncovered by his office but has been pursued only
halfheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti has been notably reticent about firing back at his
challengers, Steve Cooley, one of his deputies, and Barry Groveman,
a lawyer who had worked in both private practice and with some city
agencies. Why, since both men are campaigning hard and spending
heavily on advertising?
</P>
<P>
   According to his aides, Garcetti figures there is a strong
possibility he will end up in a runoff in the contest, which is
nonpartisan, and therefore has decided to save most of the $1
million he has raised for that. They say he has concluded that any
major statements he might make to win on Tuesday and thereby avert
a runoff would surely be drowned out by all the noise surrounding
the presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ILLINOIS: TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A GOVERNOR'S WOES
</P>
<P>
   Hardly any governor in the country is under more fire now than
George Ryan of Illinois. Ryan, a Republican, has been trying for
months to fend off charges that long before legal authorities began
a major investigation into corruption in the office of the Illinois
secretary of state, which he once occupied, he knew things were
amiss.
</P>
<P>
   One recent poll found that seven of every 10 Illinoisans do not
believe the governor's denials.
</P>
<P>
   That statistic caught the eye of State Rep. Bill Brady, who is
running for Congress in the 15th District in east-central Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Brady is a Republican himself. But he figured there were votes
to be had by playing off the governor's difficulties. He came up
with two television ads that politically dovetail.
</P>
<P>
   The first says: ``In 1999, George Ryan called for higher taxes.
State Rep. Bill Brady urged the governor not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The second ad accuses state Rep. Tim Johnson, one of Brady's
major opponents in a party primary set for March 21, of voting for
higher taxes. Ryan has endorsed Johnson.

FOR PINIELLA, ONE YEAR AT A TIME 
THE UNDERSELLING OF GWYNN 
A MANAGER'S CHALLENGE 
LOPES LOOKING UPWARD
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Not every manager working in the last year of
his contract is unhappy about it. Lou Piniella of the Seattle
Mariners has no problem with his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically have told our people here that we got a new
general manager and it's fair to him to let him work with me and
make sure he's very comfortable,'' Piniella said. ``I told them
that I could manage very, very well on a one-year contract. I've
got no concerns at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are already in a state of flux, so what is one more
piece of uncertainty. They finally rid themselves of the agonizing
Ken Griffey Jr. problem, but Alex Rodriguez has them biting their
nails, so a little thing like a manager is not going to faze them.
Nor will it faze Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can manage very well on a one-year deal,'' said Piniella,
who previously managed the Yankees and the Cincinnati Reds. ``I can
manage on a one-year deal forever. It doesn't bother me. Some
people feel differently. I feel if I'm doing my job correctly and
well that there's an opportunity whether it's here or somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Gillick, the new general manager, had nothing but praise for
Piniella. ``I think Lou's an excellent manager,'' Gillick said.
``He handles people well, and he has a real love and passion for
the game. That's real important. From my standpoint, Lou's a solid,
solid guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Piniella said Gillick was new, Gillick noted that
the Mariners have a new chief executive officer, too, Howard
Lincoln. ``He wants to see how Lou and I get along,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   By deferring to Gillick, Piniella might be keeping his options
open. After eight seasons in Seattle, he could be ready to go
elsewhere, or at least consider another job, depending on the
openings seven months from now. He may want, like Griffey, to work
closer to home, which is Tampa, Fla. He may want to be available if
the Reds' job becomes available. He managed the Reds to the World
Series title in 1990, and working conditions have improved since he
left two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say that,'' he said in response to the idea of
changing jobs. ``I never mentioned that. We'll just wait and see
what happens. I haven't given it any thought. I'm very happy
managing just the way I am and whatever happens happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens this year, Piniella said, he wants to continue
managing. ``I have some goals that I'd like to reach,'' he said,
``so from that standpoint, yeah, I'd like to continue managing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his goals, he said, is to win the World Series with an
American League team. Sparky Anderson, who last week was elected to
the Hall of Fame, won it in each league, with the Reds in the
National League and the Detroit Tigers in the AL. Unlike Anderson,
Piniella played on World Series winners, too, though in the same
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been done where a guy has played on a winner and
managed a team in both leagues to win,'' Piniella said. There's
another combination he would like to put together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to win 1,500 games,'' he said. ``I think it's only
been done once where a manager has had 1,500 hits and 1,500 wins.
Some old guy way back when did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen managers gained 1,500 or more victories in the 20th
century, the so-called modern era of baseball. Of those who played,
none reached the 1,500-hit plateau. In his research, Bob Rosen of
the Elias Sports Bureau had to dip back into the previous century
to find the ``old guy'' Piniella referred to.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Clarke, who began playing in 1894, finished his career with
2,672 hits. He began managing in 1897 and ended that career with
1,602 victories. Piniella collected 1,705 hits as a player and has
won 1,019 games as a manager. He will need a minimum of six seasons
to achieve his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to retire,'' he said, then added, ``It's not
going to be my choice. It won't be my option. It will be somebody
else's option.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella's success as a manager has been good enough that
whether he is with the Mariners or with other teams he should get
the seasons he needs to join Fred Clarke in that select circle and
have the chance to win that elusive World Series championship as an
American League manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Underselling of Gwynn
</P>
<P>
   Another player with Tony Gwynn's career would possibly have
earned twice the money he has in his 17-year career. Gwynn agreed
to his latest contract the other day, a nonguaranteed extension for
the 2001 season, prompting a renewed assessment of the San Diego
star's salary history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says that,'' he readily acknowledged when he was
asked if he has always undersold himself. ``You try to figure out
what you think you're worth and try to get it. A lot of times it's
less than what other guys are getting because other guys are not
afraid to go somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, this is where I want to be. Knowing that, you find a
number in your mind you feel comfortable with and hopefully that
they feel comfortable with. This time I wanted to get closer to
what I thought I was worth on the open market.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn thought he was worth $8 million for one year. That is what
he will make out of the new contract, which includes a $2 million
signing bonus, if he has 502 plate appearances or if the Padres
exercise the option for a $6 million salary. If he doesn't and they
don't, they will pay him a $2 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' Gwynn said, ``the number wasn't the issue. It was
whether to guarantee it or not. They didn't want to because I was
going to be 40 this year. I wanted it guaranteed because I thought
I had earned it. They gave, I gave. I gave up the guarantee and I
got a bonus in front and a buyout in back. If I stay healthy this
year, the option kicks in and everybody is happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's desire to remain in San Diego has saved the Padres
millions of dollars in the right fielder's 18-year career. In April
1997, for example, when he had already won seven National League
batting titles (he would win his eighth that season), he signed a
three-year contract extension for $12.6 million, an average of $4.2
million a year. His $4.3 million salary this year is dwarfed by
salaries of players with less talent.
</P>
<P>
   Has he ever thought of playing elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really, no,'' he said. ``My dad thought I should. I knew
in my mind this is where I want to be. When you're on the outside
looking in, it's hard to understand. When you're on the inside, you
know. I'm where I'm supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Gwynn could relate to Ken Griffey Jr.'s taking less
money to play in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where he wanted to be,'' Gwynn said. ``There's nothing
like being happy. There's nothing like playing where you want to
play. That's something I've known for a long, long time.''

<P>
   A Manager's Challenge
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Baker, who manages to keep his San Francisco Giants in
contention more often than not, does not resent the expenditures
the Arizona Diamondbacks made last year en route to a 100-victory
season and a division championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing you can do about it,'' he said. ``You can't apologize
for spending your own money.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he chooses to take a different view of a team in the
Diamondbacks' economic position. ``It makes me feel like the
have-nots vs. the haves, which makes it kind of fun to me,'' the
manager said. ``It reminds me of when I was a kid playing against
the country club guys. You could take pride in beating the country
club boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Did that happen often? ``Sometimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes Looking Upward
</P>
<P>
   His title is manager, but this spring Davey Lopes is playing the
role of drill sergeant. Not that the Milwaukee Brewers' training
camp resembles Camp LeJeune; Lopes' drilling is mental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being in the Marines,'' he said. ``You have to
brainwash people into believing that you're the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming on-field command of a franchise that has endured seven
successive seasons of losing records, Lopes has to change the
players' minds before he can expect the players to change the
team's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in losing situations; I know what goes on in losing
situations,'' the rookie manager said. ``People come to the
ballpark and say `I got mine, I don't care.' Sometimes things need
to be said. You have to be vocal about it. You have to emphasize
that you will not accept that mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most losing scenarios, nothing is being said. Everybody
accepts it from top to bottom and that's where the problem comes
in, when everybody becomes a victim of it. I will not become part
of that scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes wants to instill in his players the belief that when they
go on the field, they have a chance to win. ``Some teams have a
better chance than others,'' he said, ``but that doesn't mean you
can walk in with the attitude that I cannot win.''
</P>
<P>
   A negative attitude can overwhelm teams like the Brewers because
they are at a disadvantage economically. Teams in the lower salary
stratosphere have demonstrated they have little chance to compete
for division championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all I don't want to hear it,'' Lopes said of the
potential for his players to blame losing on their economic status.
``No. 2, in reality they are right that other teams have the
resources to do things that we aren't going to be able to do. But
that doesn't stop you from giving everything you have. I don't want
you to use that as an excuse for not winning. As soon as you do
that, you're dead in that you become complacent, you become
selfish, you become everything that you shouldn't become as an
athlete.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lady is angry. And justifiably so.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is an answer,'' Joan Hodges was saying. ``I don't
want to go out of the house and have somebody ask me, `What
happened?' I need an explanation. Maybe I could live with it if I
lived somewhere else, but I'm right here in Brooklyn, in the same
house for 40 years. Ever since Tuesday, I've had people come up and
kiss me like he just died.''
</P>
<P>
   And last Tuesday Gil Hodges' candidacy for the Baseball Hall of
Fame did die, at least for another year. Again. Some friends even
sent his widow flowers, as if in mourning. But the campaign won't
die.
</P>
<P>
   As if she were still sitting behind home plate at Ebbets Field
and rooting for him, Joan Hodges is keeping his memory alive. As if
he never died of a heart attack during spring training in 1972 when
he was managing the Mets after having hit all those home runs as
the Dodgers' huge and humble first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last thing Gil would want me to do, campaign for
him,'' she continued, sitting under a painting of her late husband.
``But I've got to keep fighting for my player, my man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this was the year. Everybody was behind him _ the
mayor, the governor, the borough president, the bishop. We had a
restaurant on Flatbush Avenue reserved for the celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, Hodges did not get enough votes from the Hall of
Fame's Veterans Committee for induction into the Cooperstown, N.Y.,
shrine, but strangely, neither did any other former players since
1945 on the ballot, notably Bill Mazeroski, Tony Oliva, Joe Gordon
and Mel Harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had let Mazeroski in, that's all right, that's their
prerogative,'' Joan Hodges said, referring to the Pittsburgh
Pirates second baseman, whose home run won the 1960 World Series
against the Yankees. ``But when nobody else got in, how could they
ignore my husband?''
</P>
<P>
   In other categories, the committee did elect Sparky Anderson,
the third-winningest manager in history, who measured the Reds and
the Tigers for three trays of World Series rings; Bid McPhee, an
1890s second baseman, and Turkey Stearnes, a Negro League
outfielder from the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In his 18 seasons with the Dodgers (both in Brooklyn and Los
Angeles) and the early Mets, Hodges hit 370 home runs and drove in
1,274 runs. He knocked in both runs in the 2-0 seventh-game victory
over the Yankees in 1955 for the Brooklyn Dodgers' only World
Series title.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he was never ejected from a game,'' Joan Hodges said. ``He
had the integrity and character that Cooperstown insists on in its
Hall of Famers.''
</P>
<P>
   It is baffling as to why the committee, which considers players
who never got enough Hall of Fame votes in the annual Baseball
Writers' Association of America ballot, keeps rejecting Hodges when
it has elected so many of his contemporaries who often got fewer
votes from the writers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Hodges received more writers' votes than any
player not eventually elected by the committee. In one year or
another Hodges also received more writers' votes than the nine
eventually elected by the writers _ his Dodger teammate Duke
Snider, Don Drysdale, Bob Lemon, Early Wynn, Eddie Mathews, Luis
Aparicio, Juan Marichal, Hoyt Wilhelm and Billy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges also received more writers' votes in one year or another
than the 11 later elected by the committee _ his Dodger teammate
Pee Wee Reese, Phil Rizzuto, Red Schoendienst, Bobby Doerr, George
Kell, Hal Newhouser, Enos Slaughter, Johnny Mize, Nellie Fox, Jim
Bunning and Richie Ashburn. Another committee choice, Rick Ferrell,
received a total of only two votes from the writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year Richie Ashburn got in, he called me in tears,'' Joan
Hodges said, referring to the 1995 election. ``He told me, `I can't
believe I got in before Gil did.' And for Gil not to get in this
year. He's not only overqualified, he had no competition.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Joe L. Brown, the former Pirates general manager
who is the committee chairman, there were ``so many outstanding
candidates, it split the ballot.'' Actually there were two ballots.
On the first, each member could vote for as many as 10 players. If
nobody received the required 75 percent, the top 10 vote-getters
were put on a second ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buck O'Neil was ill,'' Brown said, referring to the Negro
League representative on the 15-member committee. ``That meant 11
of the 14 votes were needed. But nobody got 11.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprising. In recent years, at least one relatively recent
former player has been elected by the committee of five former
players, notably Hank Aaron, Ted Williams and Stan Musial; five
former executives, notably Brown and Bill White; and five news
media members, notably Leonard Koppett and Jerome Holtzman. That
cast is expected to change slightly by next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hall of Fame bylaws, a committee member serves a term of
three years, but no more than two consecutive terms. Williams has
been there since 1966, Musial since 1973, O'Neil since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bylaw was put in, I forget exactly, but sometime in the
'90s,'' Ed Stack, the chairman of the Hall of Fame's board, said.
``Starting next year, some current members will be rotating off the
committee each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that will help (or hurt) Hodges' chances at next year's
meeting, but his widow will continue to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a radio interview I did the other day, I used the phrase,
`personal vendetta.' I'd like to retract that,'' she said. ``And
some people think our campaign hurt Gil this year; that maybe the
committee thought, `We'll show you.' But I'll continue to campaign.
Right now the whole country is listening to the presidential
campaigns. Don't I have that right, too?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The pitching line was two and one-third innings,
four hits, two runs. These numbers meant nothing, nor did the game,
and for those very reasons, Andy Pettitte's father took a seat
behind the Yankee dugout, in the warm Florida sun, to watch his boy
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Those other games, the ones that count in the standing and
beyond, have become too stressful, too much for a man who has
always prided himself on how much he could handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy Pettitte,'' he said Friday afternoon, introducing
himself while extending his right hand on the top step of the
Yankee dugout at Legends Field. Not Tom, or Thomas, because, after
all, he is only 50, a strapping man with a youthful face who
nonetheless gazes in the mirror and demands an explanation for what
his body in recent years has put him through.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, doctors removed two feet of his colon. The
following year, they cut him open to unclog the main artery to his
heart. There have also been operations on his lower back, his neck
and a whole mess of issues with his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' he said, at an exasperating loss, ``all that weight
lifting caught up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was never competitive, just recreational, the mark of a man
who wishes to stay busy, work hard, hold up his end. For 14 years,
Tommy Pettitte was a police sergeant in Baton Rouge, La. When Andy
was 8, the family moved to a town near Houston, where Tommy worked
in a chemical plant that produces additives for motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't use the word retirement, not yet, preferring to say
he is on leave, or ``LTD,'' and wanting very much to believe he
will eventually return, or as soon as the doctors determine what's
wrong with him this time. As soon as the experts can explain the
mysterious chest pains and the near-blackouts, which they believe
are not heart-related and may be caused by some undetected muscle
spasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked since I was 13,'' he said. ``This is a mental
thing for me, being 50, in this situation. I'm too young for all
this.''
</P>
<P>
   While we were on the subject of the hard-working, resolute
Pettitte men, Tommy knew that his son, at 27, was too young to be
considered past his prime, Yankee bait, when the trade rumors were
flying last summer, like some of the home-run balls Andy was
throwing.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy knew this in his heart, and thank goodness for Joe Torre,
for Mel Stottlemyre, for their patience and faith and the lobbying
that made George Steinbrenner back off and trust his baseball
people. Andy showed 'em down the stretch, and in the postseason,
just as Torre and Tommy expected he would. With a new $25 million,
three-year contract, Andy Pettitte pitches on for Torre, for a man
Tommy Pettitte called ``more of a father to him than I am, if you
know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   What he meant was that for the long baseball haul, from here to
October, it is Torre who watches over Andy, not him. Heck, the last
two years, Tommy hasn't even been able to watch Andy pitch in the
World Series. That fourth game of the 1998 Series, he was in the
hospital, with a catheter plugged inside him. And last season,
while his son was pitching Game 3 at Yankee Stadium, Tommy picked
up and went to the ``picture show,'' which is what they called the
movies when he was a kid in Louisiana, because he knew the pressure
of watching couldn't be good for his heart.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, he just doesn't want to be a burden, the way he
was in the playoffs a couple of years ago when, 15 minutes before
Andy took the mound, they were talking on the telephone and Tommy
made a mistake and stopped lying about the chest pains. Andy went
out and got bombed that night, and Tommy has since worried that his
health has contributed to his son's diminishing pitching returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell him all the time, `Daddy, when I'm out there pitching,
I'm not dwelling on you,''' Andy said before taking the mound
against Toronto Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy, Andy said, was never the pushy Little League father,
never planned for his son to be a ballplayer, even insisted he
spend a year in college after the Yankees drafted him in high
school. ``He coached me as kid,'' Andy said. ``He bought all the
books and videos and tried to learn as much about pitching as he
could. But once I was in high school, he never tried to be my
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not until recently when, much to his chagrin, Tommy
Pettitte has had more time on his hands than he knew what to do
with. Father and son filled some of it together, breaking out the
film of Andy's halcyon Yankee days from 1996-97, when he won 39
games. They discovered his motion was slower, more deceptive,
giving him greater command of his sinker and changeup, which he
threw for strikes Friday, which made both Pettittes smile.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, the pitching coach, has nothing to worry about.
Tommy Pettitte said his only ambition is a clean bill of health,
and to get back to work. He said: ``I told Andy, `I'd like to get
up to New York one of these years and see you all get your rings.''
</P>
<P>
   He settled Friday for seven spring training outs, and then Tommy
Pettitte and his wife, Joann, went home to Texas.

GEORGE STREET, SUBMARINE COMMANDER AND WAR HERO, DIES AT 86
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Capt. George L. Street III, who won the Medal of Honor in World
War II for directing a daring submarine attack that destroyed three
Japanese ships off the coast of Korea, died Feb. 26 at a nursing
home in Andover, Mass. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as the skipper of the submarine Tirante, Street, then a
lieutenant commander, brought his boat into the Japanese anchorage
off Quelpart Island, a high, rocky spot containing an air base, in
the early hours of April 14, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The waters, about 100 miles south of Korea, were heavily mined
and the Japanese had radar-equipped patrol vessels off the island
in addition to five shore-based radar stations.
</P>
<P>
   But Street was determined to find Japanese ships and sink them.
He approached the harbor on the surface at night, gun crews at
their stations. If the submarine was detected, it would have to
shoot its way out of trouble because the waters were too shallow
for it to dive.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 a.m., the Tirante fired torpedoes at a large ammunition
ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous, beautiful explosion,'' Street would write in his
report. ``A great mushroom of white blinding flame shot 2,000 feet
into the air. Not a sound was heard for a moment, but then a
tremendous roar flattened our ears against our heads. The jackpot,
and no mistake!''
</P>
<P>
   The explosions lighted up the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the glare of the fire, Tirante stood out in her light
camouflage, like a snowman in a coal pit,'' Commander Street would
report. ``But, more important, silhouetted against the flame were
two escort vessels, both instantly obvious as fine new frigates of
the Mikura class. Steadied to pick off the two frigates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tirante did just that, using two torpedoes to blow up one of
the frigates and destroying the other one with one torpedo. Street
then took the Tirante out of the harbor at full speed and dived,
eluding depth charges from a pursuing patrol.
</P>
<P>
   While the Tirante had been approaching the Japanese-held harbor,
it had received word over its radio of the death of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt and the ascension to the presidency of Harry
S. Truman. A few hours after the Tirante completed its mission, it
sent a message to the Pacific submarine command reading: ``Three
for Franklin ... Sank ammunition ship two escorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Street received the Medal of Honor from Truman at the White
House on Oct. 6, 1945, and was a recipient of the Navy Cross. He
was decorated a second time by Truman in December 1947, receiving a
gold star in lieu of a second Silver Star for his actions in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   George Levick Street III, a native of Richmond, Va., graduated
from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1937. He took part in war patrols on
the submarine Gar before assuming command of the Tirante. After
World War II, he held a variety of administrative and seagoing
posts before retiring from the Navy in 1966 as a captain.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary, of Andover; a son, George L.
Street IV of Portland, Maine; a daughter, Kris Terry of Kingsport,
Tenn.; a sister, Melinda Ogilvy of Old Greenwich, Conn.; and four
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Street's executive officer on the Tirante was Capt. Edward L.
Beach, also a recipient of the Navy Cross, whose best-selling novel
``Run Silent, Run Deep'' (Holt, Rinehart &AMP; Winston, 1955) drew on
his experiences aboard the Tirante and other World War II
submarines. Endicott Peabody, a future governor of Massachusetts,
was a lieutenant on the Tirante.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his individual honors, Street was exceedingly proud
of a collective award, the Presidential Unit Citation, which went
to the Tirante for its overall combat record. As Street put it, ``I
really treasure that more than the Medal of Honor because every man
was there with us.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION IS MOVING INTO THE LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ballplayers used to go to spring training to dry out, slim down
and refocus their batting eyes. Those who didn't have to spend the
winter working in the local hardware store got fat on the
rubber-chicken circuit telling stories about Mickey and Billy
getting lost in the woods with Jim Beam and rifles.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a very good time because there were no free
agents, designated hitters or mental patients in baseball, except
for Jimmy (``Fear Strikes Out'') Piersall, who was cured in the
movie. There was no Prozac or psychiatrists, and players who
crashed their cars, passed out drunk during communion breakfast
speeches or beat their wives were usually fined an autographed
baseball. We weren't advanced enough to be in denial.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew how fouled up Mickey and Billy were? We do now, too
late for them, in a time when spring training looks like auditions
for the road show of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' The
general level of compassion in the pastime would please Nurse
Ratched.
</P>
<P>
   Two players who could have used serious therapeutic help, Darryl
Strawberry and John Rocker, have been suspended from the game.
Darryl's yearlong suspension may be long enough so baseball won't
have to feel wistful about him anymore. Rocker's 73-day suspension
was reduced last week to 27 by an arbitrator, a just if irrelevant
decision. And then there's Bill Pulsipher, the Mets pitcher who
passed out, according to most reports, from an overdose of dietary
supplements. Pulsipher was also taking Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Could that antidepressant have had some effect?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald L. Kamm, vice president of the International Society
for Sport Psychiatry, also wonders. ``We don't really know enough
yet about drugs and the physiology of the elite athlete,'' he said
last week from his office in Oakhurst, N.J. ``How quickly do
athletes metabolize drugs, how are drugs affected by adrenaline
surges and fluid loss?''
</P>
<P>
   Kamm portrays psychiatric drugs not as performance enhancers but
as ``performance enablers _ they can get an athlete back to who
they are. We need athletes to step forward and demystify the
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The current most valuable patient is Julie Krone, who took
Zoloft for post-traumatic stress disorder that led to depression
after two serious race-track falls. She will be a lead speaker in
May in Chicago when the sports psychiatrists run a panel on
psychopharmacological approaches to athletics and exercise at the
American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting. According to
Kamm, Krone has been an important _ albeit singular _ voice in the
attempt to let athletes know about the values of psychiatric
medication while competing.
</P>
<P>
   The sports industry tends to tolerate, often to continue to
promote, athletes exhibiting symptoms of mental illness until their
box-office value depreciates or they become an embarrassment.
Strawberry and Rocker have been crying out for help. (We're not
even talking about psychopaths like Mike Tyson and Lawrence
Phillips here.)
</P>
<P>
   Just what responsibility do employers have toward the mental
health of employees they pay to perform? When athletes ask for more
money or pout in the clubhouse, management likes to tell the news
media that they are, after all, still in adolescence. When athletes
fall into real trouble, we are told that they are adults who should
assume responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Rocker is diagnosable,'' declares Dr. Richard Lustberg, a
Long Island psychologist with a radio show and a Web site
(www.psychologyofsports.com). ``He seems to be a person with low
self-esteem trying to rise above feelings of insignificance. I
think he may be depressed. He runs on the field like a pumped-up
WWF character without a script. He felt threatened by New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lustberg sees Rocker and Strawberry as good candidates for
psychiatric drugs. He describes the Yankee slugger as a
``vulnerable man who could not meet the demands of his environment;
he had poor boundaries, he acted out of emotional feelings and he
looked to sex for intimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players are under pressure from the news media, says
Lustberg, and from fans who themselves are in denial. ``Fans are
being ripped off, but these are people paying for their own
emotional experience,'' he said. ``Strawberry did nothing to them,
yet they blame him. And Rocker ends up getting what he needs, which
is a relationship with an entire city.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Strawberry and Rocker are properly medicated by Kamm and
therapized by Lustberg, they can be referred to Dr. Nate Zinsser,
the director of applied sports psychology at West Point.
</P>
<P>
   Zinsser originally called with some mild complaints about a
recent piece here on Dr. Michael Miletic, a Detroit-area
psychiatrist who believes that the adaptation to early trauma is
one of the survival defenses that elite athletes use to reach high
levels of achievement. Zinsser thinks that approach is too focused
on pathology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the seeds of athletic success can be sown in
trauma,'' Zinsser said, ``but they're also sown in the joy of
discovery, of finding something you are blessed with.''
</P>
<P>
   While Miletic, who is also a psychoanalyst, is dealing with
athlete-patients reluctant to deal with their unconscious,
Zinsser's patients are taught to ``just look and do,'' following
the more traditional sports counsel that analysis leads to
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overthinking is often the problem,'' Zinsser said. ``Winning
requires some forgetfulness. Suppress negative emotions.
Concentration, composure, confidence. Just look and swing!''
</P>
<P>
   Zinsser takes a dim view of antidepressants, which he sees as a
``quick fix,'' although he admits that they work. Which brings us
back to Pulsipher. The last pitcher known to be on an
antidepressant _ Pete Harnisch _ referred to his ``depressive
episode'' as ``a cold in my brain.'' Even during a 1998 interview
that the makers of Paxil had paid him to sit through, Harnisch told
me that he was not comfortable with the term ``mental illness.''
His own explanation of the malady that caused him to sit out most
of the 1997 season was that his body chemistry was destabilized
when he abruptly quit a 13-year chewing tobacco habit during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   Even as reluctant a role model as Harnisch proved to be, he is
rare and courageous in sports, where the stigma of needing
emotional help is so great that nothing happens until a Strawberry
overmedicates himself or a Rocker throws a tantrum for attention.
</P>
<P>
   We need Julie Krone, who could teach all of us about bravery in
competition, to ride in on this one.

A DIFFERENT TRINIDAD CONQUERS REID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ If Oscar De La Hoya took time out from his Hawaiian
vacation to watch Felix Trinidad beat David Reid here on Friday
night, then he might want to extend his time away from the ring.
And he might want to scratch Trinidad from his 2000 date book.
</P>
<P>
   The 153-pound Trinidad who steamrolled Reid over the last seven
rounds en route to a 12-round unanimous decision was not the same
stiff 147-pound Trinidad who was outboxed through eight rounds and
spent the last four rounds futilely chasing a retreating De La Hoya
last Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Looking more comfortable with the additional weight, Trinidad
(37-0) entered the ring loose and confident against Reid (14-1),
who lost his World Boxing Association superwelterweight title (154
pounds). Reid's speed seemed to get to Trinidad early as Reid
decked Trinidad with a right cross in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went down to the canvas for the first time, the first
thought that came to my mind was, `It's over for David Reid,'''
Trinidad said. ``I have been down before, but when I get up I'm
always dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid had no idea what awaited him. He said he wanted to finish
Trinidad off in the third round but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt close to victory, but I couldn't hit him with the shots
to finish him,'' said Reid, who wore dark glasses to hide a badly
cut and swollen right eye. ``I wanted to box him more. I wanted to
stay inside and bang with him. But I learned he was too slick for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Mitchell, Reid's longtime trainer and manager, said that Reid
got away from the game plan, which was to throw the jab and stick
Trinidad with the right hand. It worked like a charm in the first
four rounds, but then, Mitchell said, Reid lost focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave got a little too comfortable,'' Mitchell said. ``Dave was
right on the money until the sixth round, and he got off the plan.
That's just inexperience. You have to remember that this was just
his 15th fight. By the time he gets to 20, he'll be a heck of a
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad took over after the sixth round. He pressed Reid at
every turn and stayed on him, hitting him with hard shots. He
opened a cut over Reid's right eye in the seventh and floored Reid
with a left to the chin. That shot seemed to take everything out of
Reid. His legs became rubbery and he never seemed to recover. Reid
took an awful beating in the 11th round, going down three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came close to stopping it three times,'' Mitchell said.
``But Dave went down to one knee and I saw him wave me off.''
</P>
<P>
   After the third knockdown in the 11th round, Trinidad jumped up
on the second rope of the neutral corner and began yelling to the
crowd as if the fight were over. But Reid got up and came out in
the 12th round and showed tremendous courage by finishing the fight
on his feet and throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said that Reid would take a break from the ring and
determine where he will go from here.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad will most certainly give up the International Boxing
Federation and World Boxing Council welterweight titles now that he
has won the WBA superwelterweight title. He has 72 hours to give up
the IBF title and 15 days to decide whether he wants to defend or
vacate the WBC title.
</P>
<P>
   If he vacates the WBC title, then it goes to De La Hoya, who
defeated Derrell Coley last week in an elimination bout for the
147-pound title. Trinidad said he would like to meet De La Hoya
again, but closer to 154 pounds and never at 147 pounds. Don King,
Trinidad's promoter, said he would get in touch with De La Hoya's
promoter, Bob Arum, as soon as possible to try to work out a deal
for the rematch. But Arum has said that De La Hoya is all set to
meet Shane Mosley at 147 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   King tried to embarrass De La Hoya and HBO, which has an
exclusive contract to broadcast De La Hoya's bouts, into abandoning
the Mosley fight and doing the Trinidad rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is not a welterweight. He's a lightweight,'' King
said of Mosley. ``He's only fought twice as a welterweight, and one
of them was Willie Wise. HBO has too much integrity to put on such
a sham of a match.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Trinidad-De La Hoya rematch cannot be made, then Trinidad
said he wants to unify the 154-pound titles, which means fighting
the winner of the Fernando Vargas-Ike Quartey bout on April 15 or
Javier Castillejo of Spain.

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Orlando Hernandez, the Yankees pitcher, does this
drill: He places his fingertips at his ears, extends his elbows
out, turns to his right and spins around 10 times. Without pausing
his motion, he then reverses himself, spinning around 10 times in
the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   He stops and plants his feet, staring forward, his body weaving
slightly. It's the sort of thing aspiring astronauts might do. It's
the sort of thing you shouldn't try right after lunch.
</P>
<P>
   He does this to improve his equilibrium. Other Yankees pitchers
admire his equilibrium; they probably wish they had his
equilibrium. But no other pitcher has adopted this training method.
``If I tried some of Duque's drills, I'd probably break my neck,''
pitcher Andy Pettitte said.
</P>
<P>
   They share the same fields with Hernandez for eight months out
of the year, and they don't understand much of what he does, how he
trains or the purpose of some of his exercises. He is the medicine
man of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain mystique about El Duque, even among his
teammates,'' pitcher David Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   All they truly comprehend about Hernandez is his success. They
have seen him win, in the most important games, watched him humble
the best hitters in the most crucial moments, and there is no need
to ask why or how. They don't know anything firsthand about Cuba,
where Hernandez is from. They aren't sure how old he is, whether he
is 30, as the Yankees' media guide says, or 34, as government
documents and other baseball records indicate.
</P>
<P>
   He does not possess the instruments of the typical mound
surgeon, the 95 mph fastball, a split-fingered fastball or the hard
sinker. Hernandez's stuff is quite ordinary, in its raw form _ a
fastball of 88 to 90 mph, a nice little curve, a wide-breaking
slider; if he were a doctor, it would be like treating a patient
with okra root, daisy petals and boiled bark. But the medicine man
wins.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez does this drill: He draws up his left leg, as if to
begin his pitching motion. His left kneecap is chest high. Then he
hops, from right to left, his 220 pounds propelled solely by his
right leg. He lands on his right foot, without lowering his left
leg, and continues to hop, again and again. El Duque could hop for
hundreds of yards, it seems, to strengthen and stretch the muscles
that power his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Other Yankees pitchers admire Hernandez's physical strength.
None of them are hopping off one leg before they pitch. ``I tried
it,'' said the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre, ``and I'd fall over
after two or three hops.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez sometimes works out with Rohan Baichu, the team's
massage therapist and a distance runner attempting to represent
Guyana in the 2000 Olympics. Baichu finds he cannot jog leisurely
when he runs alongside Hernandez; rather, Baichu must push himself.
Hernandez showed him a drill in which he leaps forward, off one leg
and then the other, over and over. ``He is like a track athlete,''
Baichu said. ``His legs are extremely strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Baichu believes that with training, Hernandez would run 400
meters in under 50 seconds, and he is sure Hernandez would be a
great boxer. He and El Duque have traded shadow punches, and he was
surprised by the quickness of El Duque's hands. Jeff Mangold, the
team's strength and conditioning coach, thinks Hernandez would be
great at basketball, as a point guard, because of his awareness of
all that is happening around him.
</P>
<P>
   Mangold recalled that game last summer when Hernandez stabbed at
a grounder and discovered the ball was tangled in the webbing of
his glove. There was a runner on third base at the time, but with
virtually no hesitation, Hernandez sprinted toward first and threw
his glove, while running, to first baseman Tino Martinez. To
Mangold, the play required many of those subtle parts of what makes
Hernandez special _ the instant diagnosis of the situation, the
confidence to even attempt a toss of his glove, and, in the end, a
perfect throw of that oddly shape package of ball and glove. ``And
to throw it for distance,'' Mangold said. ``He's a special guy.''
</P>
<P>
   If records held by scouts and the state of Florida are accurate,
then Hernandez was born in 1965, rather than 1969, the date listed
in the Yankees' media guide, and his performance in his first two
seasons, his 29 victories, is unique. Only one pitcher in the
history of baseball started his career after the age of 32 years 8
months _ Hernandez's age at the time of his debut _ and had more
success in his first two seasons, according to the Elias Sports
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Turner pitched his first game in the big leagues at 33 years
10 months and won 34 games for the Boston Braves in 1937 and 1938.
Turner, who went on to become the longtime pitching coach of the
Yankees during Casey Stengel's tenure as manager, didn't pitch in
the big leagues until an advanced age because he struggled to
interest any team, said Fred Russell, a longtime friend of Turner's
in Nashville. (Turner died in 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's opportunities were limited because he was not
allowed to leave his homeland. When Joe Torre, the Yankees'
manager, told Hernandez that he would pitch the first game in each
of the playoff series last year, he and Stottlemyre could see the
pride in Hernandez, a gleam in his eye. But there was more.
Hernandez appeared greatly honored that he had been given the
responsibility to represent his team in such important games. Maybe
it wasn't such an unusual response for someone who had pitched in
the name of his countrymen before defecting from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I not be honored,'' Hernandez asked rhetorically the
other day, with Jorge Posada interpreting, ``with David Cone, Roger
Clemens and Andy'' Pettitte on the team? ``The Lion, the Tiger and
the Monkey,'' Hernandez said laughing, referring to Cone, Clemens
and the long-armed Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There had been skepticism in the organization about Hernandez at
first, about the high leg kick and seemingly mediocre stuff. Joe
Girardi, the former Yankees catcher, conceded to Cone that he had
been very wrong about Hernandez's ability after watching El Duque's
debut, in which he allowed only one run in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was sure, almost immediately after meeting El Duque, that
Hernandez possessed a special understanding of pitching. Cone
played catch with El Duque in spring training of 1998, and
Hernandez's fastball seemed to have an unusual movement. Cone asked
Hernandez to show him how he was holding the ball, to share a
secret among pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez held the ball out, and Cone was stunned: When pitchers
throw a four-seam fastball, they brace their fingertips against the
seams of the baseball, using the stitches as a lever as they pull
down and release the ball. But Hernandez placed his fingertips on
the smooth surface, somehow managing to generate enough traction to
make the ball turn like the standard four-seam fastball _ but with
that added unusual movement.
</P>
<P>
   A dry four-seamer, Cone called it, because most pitchers
gripping the ball on the smooth surface could do so only with the
aid of spit or another foreign substance, making it a wet
four-seamer. Anyone who could grip a baseball this way and make it
work, Cone decided right then, had an uncommon insight into his
craft.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has started six games in the post-season, and the
Yankees have won all six. In those games, Hernandez has permitted
just 24 hits and 5 earned runs in 44 innings, for a 1.02 earned run
average. ``You can see fear in a pitcher,'' shortstop Derek Jeter
said. ``You can  &UR; see  &LR; it,'' he repeated, as if his brain was
rifling through stored images of frightened pitchers, with faces
that betrayed confusion and panic.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter watches Hernandez, with his cap curled and pulled low
above his eyes, like a tunnel for his vision. Jeter sees no fear.
``I don't think he's afraid to fail,'' Jeter said. ``That has a lot
to do with being a big-game pitcher. He just looks focused. He
looks like he's going to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been times during the regular season, Stottlemyre
said, that Hernandez might become distracted, by an umpire or his
frustration. But in the post-season, Stottlemyre has noticed,
Hernandez ignores everything on the periphery; Posada agrees.
``He's just looking straight at me, thinking about what he's trying
to do,'' Posada said. ``It's just him and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez reaches the dugout between innings and grasps a copy
of the opponent's lineup card, studying the hitters to come. He has
a strong sense of how he wants to pitch, Stottlemyre said, a
distinct plan, like a pool player anticipating shots in advance.
None of his teammates who were asked can remember Hernandez
complimenting opposing hitters by name, referring to them only
according to their vulnerabilities. ``He's not afraid to give
credit,'' Stottlemyre said, ``but he doesn't ever want to be
intimidated, no matter how big a hitter it is. He believes if he
executes his plan, then his plan will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   At every point of decision in his post-season starts, he has
prevailed. He struck out Cleveland's Jim Thome with the bases
loaded and a full count in 1998, throwing a changeup. He struck out
the Rangers' Juan Gonzalez with two inside fastballs and a slider
last year. He struck out eight of the first 11 Atlanta batters he
faced in last year's World Series. Veterans like Bret Boone, Gerald
Williams and Eddie Perez swung and missed by 2 feet or more _ a
tribute, Martinez thought, not only to his deception, but also to
the quality of his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has this drill: He stands on his head. He can do this
for a full minute, swinging his legs back and forth. He does this
to relax, a form of yoga, something he learned nearly 10 years ago
from Euclides Rojas, his pitching coach in Cuba. Hernandez will do
handstands. No other Yankees pitcher does this. No other Yankees
pitcher is like El Duque.

COUTTS TAKES NEW ZEALAND REINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ For Russell Coutts, the long sea journey
that has brought him fame, fortune, Olympic gold _ and now, for the
second time, the America's Cup _ began at the helm of a touchy
little P-class dinghy off the windswept coast of Dunedin on New
Zealand's rugged South Island.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of the prodigal nautical sons of this sailing-obsessed
country, Coutts' first command was one of the technical, difficult
7-foot woodies unique to this island nation. If you can master the
P-class, it's often said here, you can sail anything. But Coutts,
who won his first P-class regatta at the ripe old age of 9, has
sailed better and farther than all of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 38, Coutts may face his greatest challenge yet. For,
after skippering Team New Zealand to a 5-0 sweep of Italy's Prada
Challenge in its first defense of the America's Cup, Coutts is
expected to fill, at least partially, the power vacuum left by the
departure of Sir Peter Blake, the Kiwi legend who spearheaded the
syndicate's fund-raising and shoreside efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Blake is off to head up the Cousteau Society, and the reins have
been passed to Coutts; his lieutenant and tactician, Brad
Butterworth, 40, and the navigator and design-team supervisor, Tom
Schnackenberg, 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their turn,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   A natural-born leader, Blake has navigated Team New Zealand
through the tricky, sometimes hazardous shoals of international
television-rights negotiations, sponsorship procurement and
internal squabbles. Some wonder if the new regime, whose sole
concern has been winning boat races, is up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear is that Coutts and Butterworth care more about
themselves than they do about the longevity and well-being of the
event,'' the American cup veteran, Paul Cayard, said in a recent
interview. ``But we have to hear their plans and, more importantly,
see what they actually do about them, not what they say they're
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Coutts and the others have kept their intentions to
themselves, insisting that they first had to tend to the business
at hand. It does appear that they will continue to operate under
the auspices of a single defense campaign. ``Certainly we'd have to
have good reason to change anything,'' Coutts said. ``It's
obviously worked pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Any doubts about Coutts' selflessness and leadership skills were
allayed when, in the decisive fifth race of the series, he replaced
himself at the helm with his understudy, Dean Barker, who was
steering the boat when the cup was defended.
</P>
<P>
   It was like Tiger Woods handing his putter to his caddy for the
tap-in on the 18th and final hole of the Masters. Many believe the
act of sportsmanship will earn Coutts a knighthood.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts says it was just teamwork. ``I think it showed our
strength,'' he said. ``It's not just about Dean or myself. There
are plenty of other young sailors coming through, too. They're part
of our long-term vision for this regatta.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the cup finals, Coutts said he'd like New
Zealand to hold the trophy for the next two decades or more. After
their Prada deconstruction, the notion may not be far-fetched. The
Kiwis' intricate local knowledge of the Hauraki Gulf proved to be a
devastating home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   And their design program, now riding the crest of consecutive
5-0 whitewashes in the last two cup regattas, seems exponentially
ahead of anything the challengers have created. ``The boat looked
even more impressive when I was off it for Race 5,'' Coutts said.
``When you're on board, you worry about little things, but when
you're off you can see the whole concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrisome for potential challengers, Coutts said the
Kiwis still had several things they could've done to improve their
boat, but they hadn't been pressed to reveal them. And perhaps just
as troubling for the competition, even with his greater role in the
program, Coutts isn't ready to relinquish his command permanently,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll still be involved in the sailing,'' he said. ``I'll still
be competing internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on the international match-racing circuit where the Kiwis
kept their edge sharply honed in the five years since liberating
the cup from San Diego. By admitting that his competitive fires
were still burning, Coutts was likely admitting that he'll be as
involved in the sailing program as he is in the shoreside
administration in the next cup defense scheduled for 2002-3.
</P>
<P>
   It has been his career, which has now spanned three decades,
claimed countless world championships in many disciplines, and an
Olympic gold medal in the Finn class in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Now Coutts is driving a ship much grander then the Finn or the
P-class dinghy of his youth, one that carries the hopes of his
entire country. Thus far, his course has been nothing but straight
and true.

A RENT-RULING SAGA ON 110TH STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anne Gilman, an artist and teacher whose works on
paper are quietly riveting, moved into her two-bedroom apartment on
West 110th Street 10 years ago with her husband at the time and
their daughter, who was then 7. It is in a well-maintained building
with polished marble floors and friendly doormen, in a neighborhood
more homey than chic.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, she became convinced that her landlord,
Marsid Realty, was overcharging for the rent-stabilized apartment,
so in 1990 she filed a rent appeal with the State Division of
Housing and Community Renewal, an agency that oversees rent
regulation. For four years, she heard nothing, but the silence
didn't really matter, because she and her husband, who had met as
teen-agers in Queens, could afford the $2,095-a-month rent.
</P>
<P>
   However, when they decided to break up after 20 years of
marriage, and she still hadn't received an answer, she filed a
request for a resolution of the case, called an Article 78. If the
rent was going to remain, neither she nor her husband could afford
it alone. She began looking for a smaller, cheaper place, and found
one across the street and down the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had no doorman, and the fire escape led right into the
apartment, which scared my daughter,'' she said. Still, it seemed
she had to move, and it had two bedrooms. But just as she was about
to sign the lease, she got a letter from the state agency telling
her that her rent had been too high and that it would be
essentially cut in half. So she decided to stay. The landlord was
also assessed treble damages of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has paid the amount established as her new legal
rent and specified in her lease, $1,011.12 at the time, and later,
adjusted upward by the legally allowable increases. So when she
received a letter two months ago saying that the rent decision had
been reversed on appeal six years after the first ruling, and that
she would now have to pay $2,223 a month, she was in shock.
</P>
<P>
   But that was hardly the worst of it. The state told her that she
also had to pay her landlord back rent, estimated at more than
$47,000. And it nullified the treble damages, which the landlord
had not been required to pay while the case was on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And so, instead of planning the surprise party she had hoped to
give for her father's 80th birthday in April, maybe making the
salmon with cilantro and tomatoes she had prepared for her parents'
50th wedding anniversary, she is now wondering whether she will be
evicted before that, and if she is, where she can go.
</P>
<P>
   Her family now includes not only her daughter, Lisa
Gilman-Rosen, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, but also her
husband of 11 months, a writer and translator, and his two
daughters, one at Hunter College High School and one living away
from home at college. She declined to give her husband's name,
saying she did not want potential landlords to know they were
married.
</P>
<P>
   The case, she said, has tainted her, making her appear as a bad
tenant, when in fact she has lived as a careful person, never
taking the big risks or rash steps that put people in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could call the credit bureaus today,'' she said. ``I pay
off my credit cards. I always have a zero balance. I find this
humiliating.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her new husband spend a lot of time at home; they cook,
they play Scrabble on their bed _ which is in the dining room so
their daughters can have the bedrooms. They live carefully and
quietly, and yet, she said: ``I feel inept. I feel like I've done
something wrong to get us in this position, and I've never lived
that way. I've never lived on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agency's ruling, she was supposed to begin paying the
new rent of $2,223 in January, plus $1,900 a month toward her
back-rent debt. She said she could not pay that much and continued
to pay her old rent. The landlord has gone to court to evict her,
and to collect the back rent.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to get help, she has applied to an arts organization for
an emergency grant. ``They say they help with catastrophic
events,'' said Gilman, who teaches at Pratt Institute and at
Purchase College, State University of New York. She exhibits her
work four or five times a year, and she recently had a piece bought
by the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of being evicted, and of having to declare
personal bankruptcy, has left her distraught. Sitting at her dining
room table, she said she found the situation unbearable and
mystifying. ``I had no evidence at that time that the ruling was
something I should doubt,'' she said. ``I have leases. Nowhere does
it say this is a provisional rent.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the latest ruling, she filed appeals of the
state decision and the eviction action through her newly hired
lawyer, Robert Levy, who has handled many tenant-landlord cases.
``I've been doing this for 30 years, and I've never seen anything
like this,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Gilman filed her fair market rent appeal, she was
challenging the rent under provisions that guide landlords in
setting new rents when apartments move from rent control to rent
stabilization.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the rent-control laws apply to apartments
that have been occupied by the same tenant since July 1, 1971, and
are in buildings of three or more units built before Feb. 1, 1947.
When such tenants vacate an apartment, its rent is generally
regulated by the rent stabilization laws.
</P>
<P>
   The previous tenant in Gilman's apartment had paid $605 a month;
the landlord then raised the rent to $2,000. Under the law, the
landlord can show rents for comparable apartments to justify the
establishment of the initial rent under stabilization laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years before the first ruling, Levy said, the
landlord presented no comparables. The decision was reversed last
year, Levy said, because the agency decided that a legislative
change in 1997 allowed the landlord to submit comparables that
would buttress his case, even though new evidence is typically not
allowed in an appeal unless it was unavailable the first time
around.
</P>
<P>
   Because the landlord in his appeal submitted evidence that
pertained to rental leases signed around 1990, it should have been
previously available to him, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feature that's so upsetting is that they changed the rules
in midstream,'' he said. ``They bent them beyond recognition.''
Gilman, he said, was right to assume that even if her landlord
prevailed in an appeal, any rent change would be minor.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reason, he said, for her to believe that the agency
could fully reverse itself. ``It's really a Kafkaesque situation,''
he said. ``You wake up one morning and you owe your landlord nearly
$50,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Harra, a vice president of ABC Realty and the managing
agent for the building on West 110th Street, said the landlord had
at one point voluntarily lowered Gilman's rent somewhat when she
and her first husband were having financial difficulties. The
landlord did not even get notice of the first challenge to the
rent, Harra said, until several years after it was filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DHCR apparently lost the papers for two years,'' he said.
Because of that, he said, the landlord did not have time to gather
the comparables that his case required. When the landlord was told
that the rent was being rolled back _ and that he was being
assessed the $50,000 in treble damages _ he appealed, and during
that process, the overcharge he owed Gilman was frozen.
</P>
<P>
   He has now taken her to court to get the back rent and to evict
her, Harra said, because she is still paying the old rent. ``She
chose not to pay the new legal rent,'' he said, ``and the landlord
said, `I got to take you to court.'''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Del Pino, a spokeswoman for the Division of Housing and
Community Renewal, said it would not comment on its procedures in
the case, or the time it took to issue rulings, because it cannot
talk about cases that are pending or on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gilman is wondering where she will go if her appeal
is unsuccessful, or even worse, if she is evicted before a ruling
on the appeal is issued. Most important to her is a safe place, in
part because she still remembers the terror of being assaulted at
knife point as a teen-ager in Queens. To her, a good neighborhood
is not fancy, but ``lively, well lit and well trafficked.''
</P>
<P>
   But she has talked to some real estate agents and says she is
gloomy about her prospects. ``There's no place to move to that is
comparable,'' she said. ``We're not lawyers. We're not doctors. How
do normal people pay the rent?''

 &HT;     BUSH AND McCAIN BATTLE IN NORTHEAST   
 &HT;     (EDS: Stands for Portland, Maine-dated item on budget)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain campaigned in northeastern states Saturday, with Bush
knocking McCain's record on education and McCain attacking radio
ads bought by Bush supporters in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates had their eye on Tuesday's Republican primaries
in 13 states including California, New York, Ohio and four New
England states. A total of 613 of the 1,034 delegates needed to
secure the GOP presidential nomination is at stake Tuesday _ the
largest delegate treasure yet in the hard fought battle for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, polls show the race tightening to a dead heat.
Among Republicans, a poll Friday by the Marist Institute of Public
Opinion showed Bush ahead of McCain by 45 percent to 42 percent.
Last Wednesday, the same poll showed McCain ahead of Bush 47
percent to 43 percent among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate selection in the New York and California primaries is
limited to registered Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls showed Bush widening his lead by small amounts in
California, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri and Ohio while McCain was
ahead of Bush in the New England states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning across upstate New York and into Connecticut,
participated in an early St. Patrick's Day parade in Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also launched a new radio commercial citing the Republican
debate in Los Angeles last week, where McCain referred to his
service on the House Education Committee 15 years ago as one of his
accomplishments in the education field during his 18 years in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ad cites the news account of the debate as reporting that
McCain gave a `vague, unfocused answer'' to a question about
education. `If John McCain has never made education a priority as
Senator, why would he as president?'' the ad asked.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Rochester, Bush highlighted his own
record on education in Texas and contrasted it to McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush pushed for higher educational standards,
accountability for schools where children do not achieve and
against promoting children to the next grade regardless of the
achievement level.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his criticism of McCain was fair in light of
McCain's service as a federal legislator and Bush's own view that
Washington should stay out of local and state education policy,
Bush said: `The senator's running for president. The man ought to
have a vision for the future. He ought to be able to articulate
ideas he's not running for legislator, he's running to be chief
executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stumped through New York with an entourage that included
Gov. George Pataki and former former American Red Cross President
Elizabeth Dole, herself a former presidential candidate and an icon
among Republican women.
</P>
<P>
   At a Rochester rally, Dole told the crowd of over 2,000 that the
`gender gap'' _ shorthand for the fact that women overwhelmingly
voted for President Clinton in the last election _ would come out
in Bush's favor this year.
</P>
<P>
   `That old gender gap in America is going to swing itself inside
out,'' Dole predicted.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in Portland, Maine, and Boston, cited the
$2.5 million in broadcast ads that Bush allies purchased for
weekend airing and urged New Englanders to reject an effort ``to
hijack an election.'' The ad being broadcast in New York, Vermont,
Ohio and California was paid for by a newly formed advocacy
organization, Republicans for Clean Air.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly, a Dallas entrepreneur and co-owner of two software
firms that recently sold for $7.9 billion, said he bought the
advertising blitz to draw distinctions between Bush and McCain on
environmental regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly's brother, Charles, also is a top fundraiser for Bush's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain decried the ``attack ad'' as one of the ``worst
examples'' of the need for the federal campaign finance reform and
ban on undisclosed, unlimited soft money campaign contributions
that he advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law limits the amount of money that an individual can
contribute to a political candidate. But there are no limits to the
amount of money that an individual or a corporation or a union can
spend to talk about issues. This so-called ``soft money'' is the
target of McCain and other political reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of sudden there's a proliferation of attack ads, of $2.5
million worth, in the last few days of this campaign, all over
America,'' McCain warned.
</P>
<P>
   Labeling the blitz ``a disgrace'' and ``shameful,'' McCain
added: ``I'm asking you to see through these cronies of George
Bush's that are perverting the political process with this $2.5
million in ads, see through it and reject that, reject that kind of
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Boston's Copley Square, McCain raised the issue by
quoting Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know if I might borrow the words of Bob Dole and
(say): ``Where's the outrage? Where's the outrage?'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing off the crowd's reaction, McCain asked: ``Are we going
to allow two Texan cronies of George W. Bush to hijack an
election?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' roared the crowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them to keep their dirty money in the state of Texas, my
friends,'' McCain continued. ``Don't spread it all over New England
and America.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd took it from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No new Texans; no new Texans,'' chanted the audience, much to
the delight of McCain and his wife Cindy, standing on a stage
surrounded by a sea of waving placards, small swaying American
flags and shouts, of ``Give 'em hell, John,'' and ``Don't give up
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted the Wyly ads were not connected to his campaign
and that he had no control over their content. Bush said he too had
been tarred by ads of the Sierra Club which he said `polluted my
record.''
</P>
<P>
   `In politics people have the right to freedom of speech, the
right to spend money the way they see fit,'' Bush said. `There's no
coordination'' with his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wife Cindy left her husband's campaign to make
appearances on his behalf in Rhode Island and Vermont.

VIOLENT CAST OF SCHOOL HAZING MIRRORS SOCIETY, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y., N.J., Conn., Ohio)  (jw) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a suburban Baltimore high school, 14 players on the boy's
varsity soccer team are suspended after dragging freshmen across a
muddy field and forcing them to stand against a wall while being
whacked by soccer balls that are kicked at close range. Two
students are injured during the punting incident, one of whom
suffers a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, N.Y., the season opener for the Great Neck South
High School football team is forfeited after 10 players are
suspended for beating a freshman soccer player, leaving him
severely bruised.
</P>
<P>
   At a football camp on Staten Island, N.Y., high school students
from New Jersey and Long Island are roughed up, paddled on their
rear ends and forced to box each other until they bleed.
</P>
<P>
   For those who monitor violent hazing, incidents like these _ all
of which occurred in the last year _ are disturbing evidence that
brutal initiation rites are no longer just the stuff of college
fraternities and military school barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Although juvenile stunts and punishing endurance tests have long
been a part of high school athletics, educators and students say
the rituals have grown more vicious in recent years, mirroring both
the rise in reckless college hazing and the overall escalation of
violence in society.
</P>
<P>
   A high school wrestling team in Trumbull, Conn., apparently had
a decades-long tradition of hazing, but this year, the ritual drew
the attention of the police after a 15-year-old team member's
bruises were noticed by his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Over the span of a month, investigators said, the sophomore had
been spat on, hogtied, imprisoned inside a gym locker, slammed into
walls and held down while other players forced the handle of a
plastic knife into his rectum. Three team members were arraigned
last week on adult charges, and five others have been charged as
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   To earlier generations, high school hazing meant scavenger
hunts, wearing beanies or fetching doughnuts for upperclassmen. But
these days, it is more likely to involve some form of humiliation
or physical abuse, say educators and law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no statistics on high school hazing, a survey
of major newspapers across the country found 28 serious incidents
since the start of the school year, many involving beatings, sexual
assaults with objects or instances in which students were
restrained with duct tape. During the same period a year ago, eight
such incidents were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hazing has changed from the goofy high jinks of the '50s and
'60s to something that is remarkably brutal and vicious,'' said
Gary Powell, a hazing expert in Cincinnati who writes a legal
newsletter for schools and fraternities. ``Like society itself,
it's become more violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Long cloaked in secrecy, the dark side of high school hazing has
only begun to emerge from the shadows. Once considered a harmless,
if unpleasant, part of high school team sports, hazing has also
come to be seen through a different lens, especially since the rash
of school shootings has shown America how violent its children can
be.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who might have once brushed off hazing rites as
adolescent foolery now see them as dangerous and sadistic bullying.
In many cases, it is parents, not students, who notify the
authorities after learning of a hazing incident. And school
officials, sobered by a spate of lawsuits that have found them
liable for the behavior of students, have started to confront
activity they may have ignored in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion of kids just being kids has changed,'' said
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer in Washington who has represented
several high school students injured during hazing. ``As a result
of high-profile incidents, parents have come to expect that when
they send their kids to school, they do so with the understanding
that the school will control and prevent wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in dozens of interviews at local schools, many students
and even some coaches said that initiation rites _ from compulsory
head shavings to beatings that leave victims bloodied _ persist in
high school sports. Tom Howard, the athletic director at
Farmingdale High School on Long Island, said many coaches saw
hazing as a rite of passage, an essential part of becoming an
athlete. ``They figure boys will be boys, and they just look the
other way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, it is boys. Although hazing also occurs in girls'
athletics, the more brutal and sexually oriented assaults often
involve male contact sports like football and wrestling, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   School officials at Trumbull have denied any knowledge of the
wrestling team's hazing tradition. But the 1999 high school
yearbook refers to _ and celebrates _ some of the practices, as
does a team videotape made of a wrestling match. A lawyer for one
of the defendants said that hazing, in some form, dated back at
least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Nuwer, author of ``High School Hazing,'' a book for
students published last month, said he first noticed violent and
sexual incidents in the 1980s. ``Before that, the worst of it
involved players dressed in diapers or hot ointment in jock
straps,'' he said. ``Now you see more cases of penetration or
extreme brutality, things that I think qualify as criminal
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While most of the pranks and horseplay at high schools tends to
be less hazardous than the well-publicized incidents of forced
fraternity-house drinking, they can be just as traumatizing, say
opponents of hazing. Such experiences, they add, also pave the way
for the more egregious initiation rites associated with college
sports and Greek organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The harsher the hazing, the more likely an initiate will become
sadistic when his turn to haze comes, said Brian Rahill, of
Columbus, Ohio, who runs a Web site, Stophazing.org. ``Hazing
doesn't bring people together,'' he said. ``It only breeds
animosity and separates people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a national study published last summer by Alfred University,
42 percent of those who endured hazing in college said they were
also hazed in high school. Of the 2,000 athletes surveyed, 80
percent said they had been hazed in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something terribly wrong with our society when abuse
becomes a means of bonding,'' said Dr. Nadine Hoover, the study's
principal investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Mention the word hazing to high school athletes, and most will
deny it exists. But ask them how they usher new players into their
ranks, and they readily describe a tradition of practical jokes and
organized roughhousing intended to disgrace, degrade and terrify.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the locker room of North Babylon High School on
Long Island on Monday, members of the football team said their
annual ``Freshman Friday'' was a way of inducting younger members
into their ``family.'' Jonathan Hines, 15, a starting tackle for
the Bulldogs, explained that with the locker room lights shut off,
freshmen players were roughed up, slapped around and slammed into
the lockers. ``They know we're playing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fall, after hitting one boy a little too forcefully
and making him cry, Jonathan said, he received a four-day
suspension. Asked if he regretted the episode, he said, ``I was
just mad because I got suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that spurt of violence each fall, newcomers to North
Babylon's football team are subjected to mundane acts of
submission, like serving water to seniors or being ridiculed at
team dinners while they stand on tables and sing. Each season
coaches warn against malicious behavior, the players said, but the
admonishment is generally ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Iovino, athletic director at New Canaan High School in
Connecticut, said the school began cracking down on hazing a few
years ago after a student who was forced to carry a cinder block
all day with his arms in chains dropped the block on his toe,
breaking it.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, he said, members of the girls' soccer team were
blindfolded, put on a train and told they were headed to Grand
Central Terminal. The train, in fact, was going to a seedy station
in nearby Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how mild the form of initiation, we feel that it's
demeaning to the kids and a distraction in the classroom,'' Iovino
said. Despite the ban on hazing, he said, the school newspaper
consistently runs editorials in objection, saying that initiation
rites build team unity.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Flemming, 20, a former football and wrestling team captain
at Columbia High School in Maplewood, N.J., agreed that hazing
promoted team cohesion but said it also helped establish a pecking
order. ``You have to pay your dues first,'' he said of the
freshmen. ``They don't always realize who is boss.''
</P>
<P>
   To educators, however, the rise in sadistic hazing is further
proof that America has lost its bearings.
</P>
<P>
   As family bonds weaken and relationships between adults and
children become more adversarial, teen-agers are desperate for
inclusion in groups that help fill the void, educators say. And
without the guidance and input of adults, children invent
initiation rites that use abuse and humiliation as a means of
proving loyalty and self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rachel Lauer, a psychologist at Pace University who has
studied hazing, said many students were so eager to belong to a
group that they submitted to treatment they knew was wrong. ``In
addition to companionship and comfort, there's a certain amount of
prestige in belonging,'' she said. ``And the harder it is to get
in, the more prestigious it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to be included is so intense, most of those
subjected to hazing refuse to talk about it. ``You rat out your
teammates and it's the end for you,'' said Nuwer, the author of
``High School Hazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those working to combat hazing say the best way to break the
cycle is by holding coaches and school officials accountable while
educating students about the dangers of such behavior. Eileen
Stevens, a Sayville, N.Y., mother whose son died of alcohol
poisoning in a hazing ritual in college 22 years ago, said the
ideal place to start was in high schools, even middle schools,
where mythological yarns about the glories of hazing are first
spun.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has spoken to 40 high schools, usually after a
disruptive hazing incident. ``It's become so deeply rooted in our
culture,'' she said. ``So many kids glamorize hazing, they almost
look forward to it when they get to college.''

MANY SUMMER RENTALS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SNAPPED UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I wish you had called me two weeks ago, because the
rentals are just zapping up,'' Kelly Lee, an agent with B&AMP;K Real
Estate in Bay Head, N.J., said regretfully to a caller one day in
early February.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought we were too early to call,'' the astonished
woman responded. In fact, though the snow was still on the ground
and the breeze off the ocean was chilly, the woman was anything but
early in her quest to rent a house in the picturesque Jersey shore
village.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the right house in the right areas, we probably have six
or seven people waiting,'' Benia Grygent, an agent with B&AMP;K, said
as she drove around town showing houses. ``We start in the fall, so
that by now 80 percent of the available properties are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the number of leases already signed and the swarms of
prospective tenants looking over houses, mansions, cottages or
condos everywhere from Nantucket to Connecticut to the Pocono
Mountains of northeastern Pennsylvania are indicative, it will be a
banner season for the rental market _ and a profitable one for
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in these areas have risen from 5 percent to 25 percent in
the last year, brokers say; in the Hamptons they have escalated by
at least 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Fire Island Pines, a community with some of Fire Island's
more lavish homes and many swimming pools, ``99 percent of the
seasonal rentals for this summer were spoken for by Columbus Day,
and now we are getting inquiries about shorter rentals,'' said
Carole Weissman, an owner of Island Properties Real Estate and
Management Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the Poconos, Rob Baxter, a broker and owner of C.R. Baxter
Rentals Unlimited, said: ``People who know the community often
started looking last summer. It seems like the market is up over
last year, and we have run out of homes in certain categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Rentals for the properties that Baxter represents generally run
from $500 to $3,000 a week, depending on size, amenities and their
proximity to a lake. Most of his rental houses are in two lakeside
communities, Arrowhead Lakes and Lake Naomi, and he also has town
houses, two-story homes attached in groups of three or four,
bordering a lake in Pinecrest.
</P>
<P>
   In Nantucket, Mass., ``the market is out of control,'' said
Joyce Montalbano, a sales associate with Congdon and Coleman Real
Estate. Rentals listed by her agency range from $1,000 a week for a
one-bedroom cottage in town to $17,500 a week for a six-bedroom
house in Brant Point that is coveted for its easy access to both
beach and town.
</P>
<P>
   And in Martha's Vineyard, Ann Floyd, the owner and principal
broker of Sandcastle Realty, said: ``The demand is still
extraordinary despite the fact that some people say we have priced
ourselves out of consideration. We got inquiries starting last
summer and now we are wondering what are we going to do about the
inquiries for the year 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, rents go from $1,000 a week for a rustic workshop on
a farm to $15,000 for a house that is on a saltwater lagoon, sleeps
10 and has a private beach and dock.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere is panic over renting more palpable than in the
Hamptons. ``You show people a rental for $50,000 and they say,
``Bring my check to the landlord immediately so I am sure will have
a house,''' said Judi Desiderio, the vice president of Cook Pony
Farm Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
   The number of houses rented through her agency, which has seven
offices from Westhampton Beach to Amagansett, is up by 18 percent
over last year at the same time, she said, and the average rent has
increased by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``One couple walked into our Bridgehampton office last weekend
and were distraught because there were no brokers available to help
them,'' she said recently. ``They pleaded with the manager, `We
must get a rental right now.' They would have taken anything we
would have shown them.''
</P>
<P>
   Given their experience, such desperation was not totally
irrational: They had lost bidding wars to other renters with fatter
checks. ``They made an offer on one house and the offer got
topped,'' Desiderio said. ``On the second one, they signed a lease
and mailed it to the landlord, but by the time the landlord
received it, an aggressive broker from another office had
hand-delivered a check for more money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are frantic,'' she continued. ``We tell them: `Pick one
of the houses you saw. It won't be here next week.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is possible to find a small house in the Hamptons for
as little as $12,000 for the season, oceanfront mansions command at
least $250,000. The highest rental that Desiderio has heard so far
is $410,000 for the season, and that was snapped up in January.
``It is a complete estate,'' she said, ``with everything known to
man but a helicopter pad.''
</P>
<P>
   According to George C. Ballantyne, senior vice president and New
England regional manager of Sotheby's International Realty,
responses to what only a few years ago would have been considered
astronomic rents are largely dependent on where people come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers are more used to spending and are more prepared to
do so,'' he said. ``Residential prices are still substantially less
expensive in Boston and New England, even in Back Bay and Beacon
Hill, than they are in Manhattan. For example, in the past month I
sold a town house in Boston for a new record: $5.9 million. Many
town houses in New York sell for more than $10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, does it make sense, no matter how unlimited the budget,
to plow hundreds of thousands of dollars into rent?
</P>
<P>
   For people who want grand mansions with breathtaking views,
tennis courts, swimming pools and other luxuries, that may be the
only choice, in the view of Timothy G. Davis, principal managing
director for Allan M. Schneider Associates, which has seven offices
in the Hamptons and Montauk. ``If you want to live in that kind of
a house, you can only rent it,'' he said. ``It is not available.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said: ``There is a house we rent in East Hampton
that has several guest houses and a pool on 30 acres and is
$400,000 for July 1 to Labor Day. If it were for sale it would be
$25 million, but it's not. There is no way to build it or buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   And though the economy has been soaring, there is no certainty
that it will continue its upward flight. That has bred a
live-for-the-moment attitude toward putting what would certainly be
the down payment on a house, and in some cases could buy a sizable
house, into rent.
</P>
<P>
   With all the bonuses on Wall Street, people find they have a
certain amount of disposable income,'' said Anne Orton, manager and
associate broker in the Southampton office of Cook Pony Farm. ``But
they don't know if they will have it next year, so they don't want
the responsibility of owning or maintaining the property, and they
don't want the continued overhead that kind of house would
command.''

 &HT;     BUSH AND McCAIN BATTLE IN NORTHEAST   
 &HT;     (EDS: Stands for Portland, Maine-dated item on budget)

<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain campaigned in northeastern states Saturday, with Bush
knocking McCain's record on education and McCain attacking radio
ads bought by Bush supporters in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates had their eye on Tuesday's Republican primaries
in 13 states including California, New York, Ohio and four New
England states. A total of 613 of the 1,034 delegates needed to
secure the GOP presidential nomination is at stake Tuesday _ the
largest delegate treasure yet in the hard fought battle for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, polls show the race tightening to a dead heat.
Among Republicans, a poll Friday by the Marist Institute of Public
Opinion showed Bush ahead of McCain by 45 percent to 42 percent.
Last Wednesday, the same poll showed McCain ahead of Bush 47
percent to 43 percent among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate selection in the New York and California primaries is
limited to registered Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls showed Bush widening his lead by small amounts in
California, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri and Ohio while McCain was
ahead of Bush in the New England states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning across upstate New York and into Connecticut,
participated in an early St. Patrick's Day parade in Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also launched a new radio commercial citing the Republican
debate in Los Angeles last week, where McCain referred to his
service on the House Education Committee 15 years ago as one of his
accomplishments in the education field during his 18 years in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ad cites the news account of the debate as reporting that
McCain gave a `vague, unfocused answer'' to a question about
education. `If John McCain has never made education a priority as
Senator, why would he as president?'' the ad asked.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Rochester, Bush highlighted his own
record on education in Texas and contrasted it to McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush pushed for higher educational standards,
accountability for schools where children do not achieve and
against promoting children to the next grade regardless of the
achievement level.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his criticism of McCain was fair in light of
McCain's service as a federal legislator and Bush's own view that
Washington should stay out of local and state education policy,
Bush said: `The senator's running for president. The man ought to
have a vision for the future. He ought to be able to articulate
ideas he's not running for legislator, he's running to be chief
executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stumped through New York with an entourage that included
Gov. George Pataki and former former American Red Cross President
Elizabeth Dole, herself a former presidential candidate and an icon
among Republican women.
</P>
<P>
   At a Rochester rally, Dole told the crowd of over 2,000 that the
`gender gap'' _ shorthand for the fact that women overwhelmingly
voted for President Clinton in the last election _ would come out
in Bush's favor this year.
</P>
<P>
   `That old gender gap in America is going to swing itself inside
out,'' Dole predicted.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in Portland, Maine, and Boston, cited the
$2.5 million in broadcast ads that Bush allies purchased for
weekend airing and urged New Englanders to reject an effort ``to
hijack an election.'' The ad being broadcast in New York, Vermont,
Ohio and California was paid for by a newly formed advocacy
organization, Republicans for Clean Air.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly, a Dallas entrepreneur and co-owner of two software
firms that recently sold for $7.9 billion, said he bought the
advertising blitz to draw distinctions between Bush and McCain on
environmental regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly's brother, Charles, also is a top fundraiser for Bush's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain decried the ``attack ad'' as one of the ``worst
examples'' of the need for the federal campaign finance reform and
ban on undisclosed, unlimited soft money campaign contributions
that he advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law limits the amount of money that an individual can
contribute to a political candidate. But there are no limits to the
amount of money that an individual or a corporation or a union can
spend to talk about issues. This so-called ``soft money'' is the
target of McCain and other political reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of sudden there's a proliferation of attack ads, of $2.5
million worth, in the last few days of this campaign, all over
America,'' McCain warned.
</P>
<P>
   Labeling the blitz ``a disgrace'' and ``shameful,'' McCain
added: ``I'm asking you to see through these cronies of George
Bush's that are perverting the political process with this $2.5
million in ads, see through it and reject that, reject that kind of
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Boston's Copley Square, McCain raised the issue by
quoting Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know if I might borrow the words of Bob Dole and
(say): ``Where's the outrage? Where's the outrage?'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing off the crowd's reaction, McCain asked: ``Are we going
to allow two Texan cronies of George W. Bush to hijack an
election?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' roared the crowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them to keep their dirty money in the state of Texas, my
friends,'' McCain continued. ``Don't spread it all over New England
and America.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd took it from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No new Texans; no new Texans,'' chanted the audience, much to
the delight of McCain and his wife Cindy, standing on a stage
surrounded by a sea of waving placards, small swaying American
flags and shouts, of ``Give 'em hell, John,'' and ``Don't give up
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted the Wyly ads were not connected to his campaign
and that he had no control over their content. Bush said he too had
been tarred by ads of the Sierra Club which he said `polluted my
record.''
</P>
<P>
   `In politics people have the right to freedom of speech, the
right to spend money the way they see fit,'' Bush said. `There's no
coordination'' with his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wife Cindy left her husband's campaign to make
appearances on his behalf in Rhode Island and Vermont.

 NEW YORK: would command.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to stock-market profits and hefty bonuses, second-home
sales have been unusually brisk, depleting the supply of houses
available for rent and driving up rental prices, brokers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who want to be in the Pines will pay whatever is
necessary, and there is no balking, because they have the
discretionary funds,'' said Weissman, the Fire Island broker. An
oceanfront house there would go for $75,000 for the period between
May 1 and mid-September, she said; a simple three-bedroom inland
cottage for $18,500 for mid-May to mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   In Nantucket, ``we're probably getting up to 50 new inquiries a
day,'' said Douglas Foregger, chairman of Country Village Rentals
and Real Estate, which conducts business there as well as in Stowe,
Vt.; Aspen, Colo.; St. Bart's in the French West Indies; and Lyford
Cay and Harbour Island in the Bahamas. ``We have doubled the number
of houses rented over the same time last year, and the phones are
ringing nonstop.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he added: ``The market in Nantucket is now very strong
for October and November, because prices go way down then. You can
figure that a rental that would be $10,000 for a week in August can
be as low as $5,000 a week in late October and November.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lake Wallenpaupack in the Poconos, prices exceed those of
last year by about 10 percent, said Peter Helms, president of Davis
R. Chant Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   The rental season in Lake Wallenpaupack does not go into full
gear until the beginning of March, ``but we are getting probably
twice as many calls already as last year,'' Helms said. ``A rustic
cottage with three bedrooms and a loft starts at $800 a week and
can go to $1,100. A four- to five-bedroom house can bring as much
as $1,600 a week. The $800 house would have been $750 last year,
and there has been no resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some house hunters have found they have to spend much more than
they planned. Others have made compromises, and still others have
found themselves shut out, so far.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick D. Hoff of Hackensack, N.J., who retired as director
of national accounts for the former Celanese Corp. five years ago,
was fully prepared to pay $22,000 a month for a long season rental
in Bay Head or Mantoloking, N.J. But when he went to look last
month, he found what he considered all the nicely appointed places
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead I saw a lot of yuck, smelly older places,'' said Hoff,
who was widowed and is now in the process of getting a divorce from
his second wife. ``Sure I could easily spend $100,000 and like what
I am in, but that is crazy. It is a down payment on something. I
want value for my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Millington of Manhattan, a 28-year-old financial
software account executive, has been renting group houses with
friends almost every summer in towns on the New Jersey shore like
Belmar, South Belmar, Sea Girt and Spring Lake since graduating
from college in 1993. She began looking in those locales in
November but didn't take anything then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was $20,000 to $24,000 for Memorial Day to Labor
Day, and we thought we would have a bigger group,'' she said. ``We
didn't have enough people who wanted to spend that kind of money or
make that kind of commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In January she resumed her search and found a house for $9,000,
but it was only for five weeks between Memorial Day and the end of
July. Finances were a major consideration. ``The price worked out
better for the partial summer, and we figure we will be more likely
to come down every weekend this way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Susan Kirshenbaum of Manhattan, a partner at Greenberg
Kirshenbaum, a recruiting firm for advertising agencies, and two
friends paid $24,000 for the Memorial Day to Labor Day season for a
three-bedroom, two-bath house on a cul-de-sac in Amagansett, Long
Island, that she found barely adequate. ``It had a Murphy-bed
version of a kitchen where if you opened the refrigerator door, it
hit the wall,'' she said. ``The broker told the owner he could get
$40,000 for it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead she and her friends will pay an amount she would only
describe as ``significantly more than $30,000'' for a small
three-bedroom house perched on a dune in Amagansett. ``Two years
ago we rented that same house for June and July because we thought
the rental for the whole summer was absurd, and now we are paying
it,'' she said. ``But how much is happiness worth?''
</P>
<P>
   That depends on the locale, on the size of the house, on the
amenities and the length of the rental _ but more than anything
else on its proximity to the water, preferably the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In Osterville on the south shore of Cape Cod, for example, Paul
Grover, senior vice president of Kinlin Grover GMAC Real Estate,
which has 14 offices on the Cape, said: ``A nice oceanfront rental
on a sandy beach could be $30,000 to $50,000 a month for July and
August. Across the street, you would pay $15,000 to $20,000 per
month, and if you are in the village, walking distance to the
beach, you can get a nice house for $10,000 a month, but then you
wouldn't have a private beach. If you have to drive to the beach,
then the rental could be $5,000 a month.''

 NEW YORK: a month.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Lake Naomi in the Poconos, prices range from $500 to $3,000 a
week. ``It's the lake that makes the difference in price,'' Baxter
said. ``Off the lake they don't bring in more than $1,100. Those on
the lake have their own private beach and maybe a boat docked, and
most of those are already booked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rents for houses in Litchfield County, where many artists,
writers and theatrical and political luminaries have homes, are
significantly less than on Long Island. ``If the Hamptons is upward
of $70,000 for the season,'' said Seymour Surnow, owner of the
Surnow Group at William Raveis Real Estate, ``then our top rent is
$50,000.''
</P>
<P>
   And there would be no roughing it at that price. ``That would
get you a four-bedroom, centrally air-conditioned house with a
heated pool on 10 acres with ponds and English gardens, if you're
lucky,'' he said. ``It is up 10 percent over last year, and several
years ago it went for $10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The range of rents in the area goes from $8,000 or $10,000 for
the season up to $50,000, he said. Surnow said last week that he
had just got a listing for a four-bedroom saltbox in Bridgewater
for $13,000. Another listing he described as modest is for a
three-bedroom house in Roxbury on 46 acres that is available for
$21,000 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the bargain _ relatively speaking _ prices, he said, the
area offers a more subdued lifestyle despite its high quotient of
celebrities. ``There is no scene here at all,'' he said. ``You
could see Mia Farrow, Stephen Sondheim, Dustin Hoffman and Arthur
Miller in the grocery store, and no one gives them a never-mind.''
(You won't see Whoopi Goldberg anymore; Surnow just sold her
farmhouse in Cornwall.)
</P>
<P>
   ``And you don't have to make restaurant reservations two weeks
ahead,'' he said. ``In fact there are not that many restaurants.
The big excitement on Saturday evening is having friends come
over.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as ambience is concerned, modernity seems to prevail over
charm, no matter what the locale. ``In the past a lot of people who
would go to Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket would want a great old
farmhouse with a lot of character,'' Foregger said. ``Now they want
new and shiny and not as much rustic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Nantucket has exceptionally strict rules on
architecture, style, color and trim _ the rules dictate, for
example, that in most circumstances houses must be gray _ ``you can
still make an old house new inside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, ``people may want a quaint New England
shingled cape with a rose-covered fence,'' Floyd said, ``but they
also want it to be well equipped. They ask for fax machines, a
second plug and phone for Internet access, Jacuzzis and nicely
equipped kitchens. We hardly ever get requests for swimming pools
or tennis courts.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the Hamptons, ``most people won't even look
unless something has a pool and is centrally air-conditioned,''
said Tina S. Fredericks, a broker who has been in business in the
Southampton to Montauk area for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think people came here for the beach and the air
quality,'' she said. ``If they could go swimming in the bay they
were very happy. Now everyone wants air conditioning, not air
quality.''

 LOS ANGELES: hasn't been.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both camps concede that McCain is not likely to catch up to win
the Republican vote in California, which means Bush would get all
the delegates. But McCain hopes to beat Bush in the popular vote,
which includes Democrats and independents. Rove said he believed
Bush may well surpass McCain in what it called the ``beauty
contest.'' Yet if there is such a split verdict _ if Bush wins the
delegates and McCain wins the popular vote _ the senator could
challenge the results and could make the case that he is more
electable because he attracts Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain camp is counting on a triumph in New York and a sweep
of the New England states. McCain seems to be running best among
Republicans in those states because they have more moderate voters
who are most hospitable to his message of campaign reform and his
attacks on religious conservatives. McCain is also competing
aggressively in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush campaign officials said they were confident
that besides California, they would prevail in New York and Ohio.
Just as McCain is running relatively uncontested in New England,
the same is true for Bush in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, the McCain campaign has seemed on the
defensive, and has been somewhat off stride because of internal
sniping and tactical blunders. For example, McCain had at first
dropped out of a nationally televised debate in Los Angeles on
Thursday with Bush and Alan Keyes. After the decision drew scalding
publicity in the state, McCain relented and agreed to participate,
but by a satellite linkup.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest question that will be answered Tuesday is
whether McCain can persuade traditional Republican voters to
support him. Both campaigns are concentrating their television
advertisements in New York, California, Ohio, Missouri and Maryland
as they make appeals to Republican voters. Here in California,
McCain has appealed to those voters in television commercials in
which he portrays himself as heir to the Reagan legacy. His
campaign has focused its energies _ and McCain's appearances _ on
Orange and San Diego Counties in Southern California. He has also
held rallies in inland cities like Stockton, Fresno, Bakersfield
and Riverside, which are more conservative than cities closer to
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But in many states, McCain's supporters said they had all but
given up trying to woo hard-core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, one of the most conservative states voting Tuesday,
the McCain campaign has essentially conceded the race to Bush. For
McCain, the state, with its increasingly urban population, was one
of his best hopes to break the governor's hold on the South. But
the candidate has not visited the state recently, and the
campaign's resources largely consist of volunteers and used, pasted
over campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   Kil Townsend, a veteran organizer who has volunteered to help
McCain's seat-of-the-pants effort in Georgia, groused at how the
candidate has neglected the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Up north in Minnesota, Bush also has a far more organized
campaign than McCain. That has left the senator's loyalists trying
to court independents who can vote in the caucuses on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials in the state said McCain had picked up
support in the area, but not among traditional Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional and core Republicans like we have here are going
to stick with the established candidate, Bush,'' said Chris
Jacobson, a local Republican official. ``As a rule, we're pretty
tried and true. One of our concerns is how many independents and
Democrats will be crossing the lines. But Bush seems to have a
stronghold on Republican voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides painting McCain as divisive and questioning his
Republican credentials, Bush has highlighted some of the more
moderate elements of his record in states where conservatives are
less of a factor in the primary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, for example, the Bush campaign produced a
statewide mailing, radio advertisements and telephone banks to
emphasize the candidate's position on such local issues as his
support of mass transit and of the Seawolf, a nuclear submarine
produced in Groton.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain organization appears far less organized. Richard
Foley, a former state Republican chairman who is a leading McCain
backer in the state, said after the New Hampshire primary, McCain
supporters collected weathered McCain placards to use back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw as many as we could in our cars after New
Hampshire,'' Foley said. ``We're not above it all. There's no room
for the guys in the expensive suits with the $20 cigars on our
team.''

 &HT;    BRADLEY INVOKES HARRY TRUMAN IN PREDICTING COME-FROM-BEHIND
VICTORY
 &HT;    For Sunday, March 5
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the latest polls showing him trailing Vice
President Gore by 20 points here, Democrat Bill Bradley invoked the
name of Harry Truman Saturday to galvanize voters for a come from
behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little behind, but it's not over,'' Bradley told 250
supporters standing outside in New York's Washington Square Park.
``You know, I came from Missouri. You know Harry Truman. They said
he was finished in 1948, that he didn't have a chance, and you know
what happened there? He came from behind and won.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley campaigned in four New York neighborhoods Saturday _ two
of its richest and two of its poorest _ before boarding a plane to
his native Missouri to deliver a speech to Democrats in Hannibal,
the birthplace of writer Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley plans to campaign in Buffalo, Cleveland and Maryland on
Sunday before winding up his campaign in New York again Sunday
night. He is scheduled to remain in and around New York City
through ``Super Tuesday,'' when 15 states and American Samoa cast
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls show him trailing Gore in all the Super Tuesday
states, Bradley insisted Saturday that he could ``surprise some
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of 250,000 people have voted in this country,'' Bradley
told a CBS interviewer on Manhattan's upper west side. ``I think
Tuesday will be a decisive time because eight and a half million
people will vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's New York city rallies in Washington Square Park and on
the upper west side drew small, but enthusiastic crowds. They
chanted the candidate's name and waved Bill Bradley posters.
</P>
<P>
   On the upper west side, Bradley was joined on stage by his wife,
Ernestine. Mrs. Bradley danced on stage to the rhythms of Latin
music provided by a live band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all going to dance our way into next Tuesday,'' she
told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate was joined at various stops by former New York
mayor Ed Koch, actor Harvey Keitel, Sen. Pat Moynihan , D-N.Y., and
a former New York Knicks teammate, Dave DeBusschere.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, several of Bradley's New York supporters said they
were relieved that the candidate was finally campaigning in New
York. Koch, who had publicly criticized the campaign's decision to
spend six days in Washington state before its March 29 primary, was
one supporter who said he was glad to have Bradley back in the Big
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question ... he's the underdog, but New Yorkers
love the underdog,'' Koch said after appearing with Bradley in
Washington Square Park. ``So I'm hopeful that we can turn it around
and make him a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koch also underscored the importance of the Empire State to
Bradley's chances of winning the Democratic nomination. ``If you
can't win New York, you can't win the country,'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley encountered some skepticism as he campaigned in
Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, a lower income
African-American community. Bradley shook hands with voters as he
walked along Fulton Street, which bustled with sidewalk vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you really, really do something for the community?'' Mary
L. Greene asked Bradley skeptically.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for me to do this if I am not going to do
something that is important to people,'' Bradley responded.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said nothing about Gore in any of his public speeches to
voters Saturday, but his campaign released a statement from Bradley
that again called on the vice president to explain more fully his
presence at a California fund-raiser in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley issued the statement in response to a story appearing in
the Philadelphia Inquirer. The newspaper account suggested that
Gore knew in advance that the event, held at a Buddhist temple, was
in fact a fund-raiser. The event has become significant because the
organizer of the event, Maria Hsia, was convicted last week of
campaign fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said only that he knew the event was ``finance
related.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president ``has yet to explain what his mistakes were
and why he made them,'' Bradley said in the statement. ``Now is the
time for Al Gore to be straight with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for the vice president's campaign,
said the charges were ``the most recycled story in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole issue has been gone through with a fine tooth comb
by the Justice Department and congressional committees,'' Hattaway
said. ``And they have found no wrongdoing on the vice president's
part.''

U.S. TO ESTABLISH STRICT NEW RULES FOR REGULATING ORGANIC FOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to correct next week to this week.) 
 (nk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than two years after the federal government's
first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win
public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much
tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified
ingredients in products carrying the organic label. The rules also
prohibit the use of irradiation to decontaminate the products and
the application of sewage sludge as fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, to be announced this week, could take effect by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 275,000 comments received in response to the
original proposal in 1997, virtually all of them opposed those
three processes, which the Agriculture Department had considered
allowing.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules indicate an about-face in the department's
attitude toward organic farming and represent one of several steps
it is taking to help the small- and medium-sized farmers who have
mainly been ignored or even discriminated against by the agency for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic
food abroad, where there has been substantial opposition to the use
of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could turn out to be the most important rule USDA has
issued in 20 years,'' said Dr. Margaret Mellon, the director of the
agriculture and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned
Scientists, an environmental advocacy group in Washington that had
urged the agency to toughen its earlier proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Agriculture Department's policies have made small farmers
an endangered species,'' Mellon said. ``Now it is trying to
construct a system to allow small farmers to help them survive, to
help them flourish. It is also a turning point in its relationship
to consumers. The agency has never before been responsive to
consumers' desires or demands.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said that if
the public thought the standards were too strict they should let
the department know during the 90-day comment period before the
agency enacts the final rules. ``I'd rather go from too strict
standards and ease them than going the other way,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is clearly moving towards stricter definitions of
what constitutes organic food. After initially ignoring many of the
recommendations of the National Organic Standards Board, which had
been set up to help the agency formulate the regulations, the
Agriculture Department has now taken all of the board's advice,
including total prohibition of antibiotics in animals raised as
organic; the use of 100 percent organic feed; and the requirement
of outdoor access for animals.

   Sales of organic food have been increasing about 20 percent a
year. When Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act in
1990, sales of organic food had reached $1 billion: projected sales
for 1999 are $6.46 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, raw products could carry the federal
agency's organic seal on the front of packaging if they were 100
percent organic, meaning that they are grown and manufactured
without the use of added hormones, pesticides or synthetic
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Processed food that is made from at least 95 percent organic
ingredients could also carry the seal. And processed food
containing at least 50 percent organic ingredients could be labeled
``made with organic ingredients'' and list up to three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Irradiation, genetic modification and the use of sludge would be
prohibited not only in the organic ingredients but in the
conventional ingredients in foods made partly with organic
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Products made with less than 50 percent organic ingredients may
use the word organic only in the list of ingredients on the side
panel; in this case, the prohibition against those three processes
would not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Several advocates of organic farming who have seen the revised
rules say that the standards are stricter than those developed in
any other country and have set the bar very high for organic
farmers in the United States, possibly discouraging rather than
encouraging them to grow organic crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The document is certainly much closer to meeting industry
expectations than the first one but the pendulum may have swung too
far,'' said Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic
Trade Association. ``The standards seem to be written in a vacuum
and do not take into account what supplies, ingredients and
production materials are actually available. I am afraid that some
people are not going to bother to be organic anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the areas of concern that has been left vague in the new
rules is how to treat organic crops that have been contaminated
with drift from nearby genetically engineered crops. An Agriculture
Department official said that no level for drift had been set but a
farmer would not be penalized if some low level of contamination
occurred as long as he had followed all of the organic procedures
required.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a larger effort to help the more than 12,000 organic
farmers, the administration's budget for the first time includes a
$5.5 million request for organic research. In addition, the
Agriculture Department has a pilot project for crop insurance for
organic farmers and is studying other things that might help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I want to preserve family farming,'' Glickman said.
``We need economic avenues for small- and medium-size farms and
this is one way to do this. Clearly organic agriculture is a way
farmers can make more money.''

GIULIANI SAYS CLINTONS MAKE RACE AN ISSUE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that President
Clinton appeared to have joined his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
in making police brutality and race relations a major issue in the
New York Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds as if the Clintons are trying to drive this as a
political issue,'' the mayor said, speaking to reporters before a
St. Patrick's Day parade in Queens. Giuliani was responding to the
president's remark on Friday night that he found it ``hard to
imagine'' that if Amadou Diallo had been white, and in a white
neighborhood, he would have been killed. Diallo, an immigrant from
Guinea, was killed in a Feb. 4, 1999, police shooting in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was also responding to criticism made on Friday
by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who said that Giuliani's administration
had failed to maintain the trust of people in some New York
neighborhoods while acting aggressively to reduce crime.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the president's comment, Giuliani said, ``With
all deference to the president of the United States, I think he
should give more deference to the jury forelady, an
African-American lady.'' The forewoman, Arlene Taylor, had said
that race was not a factor in the acquittal of the four police
officers in the Diallo shooting.

   NEW YORK _ The host and hostess, an affable husband-and-wife
team, stood erect and at the ready, she with a hotel desk bell in
hand. ``On your mark, get set, date,'' shouted Alan Weiss, and his
wife, Nikki, rang the silver bell.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty men and 20 women shook hands across morsel-size cafe
tables in the private back room of a Glatt kosher restaurant and
rapidly conversed. ``What do you do for a living?'' ``Where are you
from?'' ``What's the most exciting thing you've ever done?'' ``What
do you do in your spare time?''
</P>
<P>
   The questions came faster than a hungry greyhound. There was,
after all, only eight minutes to chat before the men were told to
rotate, round-robin style, to other tables, where women eagerly (or
apprehensively) awaited them. In the end, each person would have
seven ``dates,'' each eight minutes long.
</P>
<P>
   Seven dates? Eight minutes? What is this?
</P>
<P>
   It's called SpeedDating, and it's the latest wrinkle in the
Jewish singles scene. Its inventors at Aish HaTorah, an
international Jewish educational resource center, said they came up
with the idea over a year ago during a brainstorming session on how
to discourage intermarriage and preserve Jewish heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reach secular Jews, who are in danger of
assimilating and disappearing and not keeping their heritage
alive,'' said Rabbi Yaacov Deyo, the educational director of Aish
HaTorah in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Of course its founders are also trying to promote SpeedDating as
an alternative to seemingly interminable blind dates, in which men
and women with no chemistry struggle to make small talk.
</P>
<P>
   In SpeedDating, participants fill in a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer
on a rectangular card after each date indicating whether they would
like to see the person again. If a match is made _ if a man and
woman both decide they want to see each other _ coordinators
provide them with each other's phone number within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid-fire matchmaking was begun in Los Angeles and then
spread to 15 cities and five countries, including Australia and
South Africa. After two months in New York, there is a waiting list
for a chance to locate love in the asphalt canyon, for a fee of
$20.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said that 18 or 19 matches came out of the SpeedDating
session he held at Levana, a kosher French Mediterranean
restaurant. ``It's a novel idea, and I got the impression people
liked it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program's participants, on the other hand, gave it mixed
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two matches,'' said Rob, a handsome doctor with a
Pepsodent smile. He went out with both women. ``Let's just say I'd
like to meet someone on a more conventional basis. It's not for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Lowitt, a vice president at a national real estate
company, is wedded to the notion of SpeedDating, since he's still
seeing a woman he met at one of the events. ``You have to be
open-minded,'' said Lowitt. ``I'm not into bars or clubs or that
whole scene. It's interesting, different and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at a SpeedDating gathering at Levana, the
participants were in their 20s and early 30s. But there are also
events for people in their late 30s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Lissa, a graduate student in black pants and a green sweater,
had eight-minute dates just like the others, but three minutes
would have been sufficient. ``The women were very good-looking, and
the men were balding,'' she said. ``I was wondering where are all
the good-looking Jewish male genes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the night, the participants, all wearing
name tags, filled out an evaluation card with their names, phone
numbers and e-mail addresses. This being SpeedDating, they were
also asked to sum up each of their seven dates with yes or no
answers to two questions: ``Would I like to date this person?'' and
``Was this person polite and respectful?''
</P>
<P>
   After matches were made, the organizers asked men to place the
first call. This is no hard and fast rule, but research suggests
that women prefer men to initiate things, said Michelle Chandler,
an Aish spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Yitz Greenman, executive director of Aish New York, added,
``The Talmud says that it is the way of man to pursue a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   At these dating affairs, clients are not allowed to exchange
phone numbers themselves or give any indication that they have
amorous intentions toward any particular person What draws
SpeedDating participants? Clients say they are tired of the bar and
party scene and the awkwardness of asking for someone's number or
being pressured into giving someone theirs.
</P>
<P>
   On average, coordinators say the program has a 50 percent
success rate: Half of its clients make at least one match.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is quite different from the work of traditional Jewish
matchmakers, known as Shadchens, who generally set up Orthodox
Jews. ``Much more thought goes into traditional matchmaking,'' Deyo
confessed. ``But SpeedDating, because it's not just one person,
certainly increases the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides matchmaking, some Jewish singles, mostly Orthodox, meet
at Sabbath meals at the home of a rabbi, Weiss said. Other
unmarried Jews are finding their mates at Shabbaton, a Sabbath
dinner for as many as 150 people, most of them single. Shabbatons
are hosted by synagogues or other Jewish institutions, and are
sometimes held at a hotel or during weekend getaways.
</P>
<P>
   Lissa, a 28-year-old with blue-green eyes, curly brown hair and
catwalk cheekbones, was interested in only one man she met during a
SpeedDating session. She sensed that he was spiritual. She is a
Reform Jew and goes out only with Jewish men, because there is, she
says, ``a spiritual and cultural bond.'' Some of her Christian
friends don't understand. ``I have to reverse things for them,''
she said. ``I ask, `Well, would you go to synagogue with me? And
they say `No.'''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most people at the gathering, Lissa, who spoke only on
the condition that her full name not be used, came equipped with a
few written questions. ``I only had eight minutes, after all,'' she
said. ``I didn't want any dead airtime.'' Among her questions:
``What are you passionate about _ family, music, sports? And do you
believe in magic?'' Not the David Copperfield variety. But knowing
instantly that you have met your soul mate.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, SpeedDating has resulted in one marriage and an
engagement. ``In New York, in one case, we had a guy who wanted to
date all seven women he was paired with, and all seven wanted to
date him,'' said Greenman. ``At first, people think this is kitsch,
you know, cute. But we're fighting assimilation head on.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at SpeedDating events is devoted to the idea of
marrying a Jew. Consider Ren, who spoke only on the condition that
his full name not be used. He said it doesn't matter to him whether
his future wife is Jewish. He was born to a Portuguese Roman
Catholic father and a Jewish mother. ``My family is not interested
in being Jewish,'' he said. ``My grandmother, who was a Jew and a
communist in Vienna in the '30s, didn't sit well with the Nazis. So
she wanted her children to assimilate.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Ren, a tall, dark literary agent in Manhattan, meet his
match? He chose two women, but the interest was not reciprocal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he thought eight minutes was enough time for participants
to decide on whether to pursue a conventional date. ``It's all in
the body language,'' he said. ``And in the rhythms of your
conversational style. It's not good if there are long silences or
you're interrupting each other.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also not good if your date has logorrhea. Jennifer, a
willowy dark-haired 27-year-old, complained that one of her
companions talked the full eight minutes about himself.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Jennifer didn't select anybody at Levana. But like several
others who have tried SpeedDating, she said she would give it
another shot. ``I had a great time,'' she said. ``Even though I was
taller than 90 percent of those guys.''

MCCAIN TRIES TO STOKE ANGER OVER ENVIRONMENTAL ADS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ Borrowing a line from the Republicans' last
losing presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona thundered
``where's the outrage?'' Saturday as he tried to spur a backlash
against political commercials paid for by a Texas businessman whose
family members are big backers of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The question _ once Bob Dole's futile end-of-campaign outcry
against President Clinton's 1996 campaign fund-raising practices _
allowed McCain to return to his centerpiece issue as he barnstormed
through New England and upstate New York in the last weekend before
Tuesday's critical primaries.
</P>
<P>
   All across the Northeast, McCain tried to stoke rebellion
against Bush by pointing to the revelation that Sam Wyly, a wealthy
Texas businessman, and his family had paid $2.5 million for
advertisements criticizing McCain on the environment, an issue that
resonates among the kinds of moderate voters McCain is trying to
draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two cronies,'' McCain called out to a crowd in Boston's Copley
Square, ``two cronies of Governor Bush got together 2 and one half
million dollars and spent it on attack ads that are being run all
over America attacking me on environmental issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyly and his brother Charles gave more than $200,000 to Bush's
two gubernatorial campaigns; Charles Wyly is a ``Pioneer,'' the
name given to Bush's top fund-raisers, those who have brought in at
least $100,000 for the Bush presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that at first the origins of the commercials were a
mystery. Then they were linked to the Bush supporters. ``It is a
disgrace,'' he said, ``and I want to know, if I may borrow the
words of Bob Dole, `Where's the outrage? Where's the outrage?'''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd shouted back ``It's here,'' McCain asked ``Are we
going to allow two cronies of George W. Bush to hijack the
election?''
</P>
<P>
   He wound up, ``Tell them to keep their dirty money in the state
of Texas.'' The crowd, waving McCain signs, whimsically shouted
back, ``No new Texans, No new Texans,'' a variation of the usual
Republican chant of ``No new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, at whose side McCain campaigned in 1996, began shouting
out ``Where's the outrage?'' at the end of his losing campaign for
president after revelations that a fund-raiser for the Democratic
National Committee had raised questionable and in some cases
illegal contributions from overseas sources.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats ultimately returned several million dollars and
Clinton's fund-raising eventually came under intense scrutiny from
Congress. Just this week Maria Hsia, a fund-raiser close to Vice
President Al Gore, was convicted of laundering illegal donations in
the last presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   By Maine, McCain had dropped his ``where's the outrage'' cry but
not his condemnations of the last-minute ads, which he said
violated the spirit of the contribution limits in the campaign
finance law.
</P>
<P>
   In Binghamton, N.Y., Bush told voters Saturday that he was the
one Republican candidate for president who had both an impressive
record on education and a detailed vision for federal education
policy and repeatedly belittled McCain for speaking in what Bush
said was a vague, uncertain voice on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally at the airport in Rochester, Bush noted the many
young children whose parents had brought them to the event and
said, ``Seeing the faces of the future reminds me of how important
it is to have a nominee for the Republican Party and a president of
the United States who understands how to make sure that every child
is educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running against a person that, when asked about education
reforms, said, `Onetime, I was a member of the education committee
of the United States Congress,''' Bush continued, referring to an
answer McCain gave in a debate on Thursday. ``That's not good
enough to lead our party to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was trying to steer the focus away from the Wyly
advertisements that McCain and many political analysts have
criticized.

MAN CHARGED IN SEX ATTACKS BASED ON DNA MATCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A suspected serial rapist was charged in four sexual
attacks in and near Rosedale, Queens, late Friday after DNA from
blood on a knife linked him to two of the crimes, officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Rodolfo Beach, 31, of Rosedale was arraigned late
Friday on charges of rape, attempted rape, sodomy and robbery, said
Sherry Hunter, a spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney,
Richard A. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Beach was arrested Wednesday and charged after his DNA matched
DNA samples recovered in two rape cases and after a victim in a
third case identified him in a lineup, the police said. The fourth
case involved endangering the welfare of a child during a burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Beach had been a suspect in nine sexual attacks: eight in
southwestern Queens and one in Nassau County, police said. The DNA
tests cleared him of suspicion in one attack, but he now faces
charges in four and remains a suspect in four others, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   All the attacks occurred within five miles, and last year
officials said they believed the rapist was familiar with the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst kind of crime, one that leaves women afraid
in their own homes and looking over their shoulders in their own
neighborhoods,'' Brown said in an interview Saturday. ``Hopefully,
the filing of these charges will restore a sense of safety to the
Rosedale community.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives from the New York Police Department's Queens Special
Victims Squad began investigating Beach in the series of attacks
that began two days before Christmas 1998 and continued until last
November. Beach became a suspect soon after he was found in the
bedroom of a 12-year-old girl in Rosedale, according to Hunter,
Brown's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had broken into this woman's house and a 12-year-old girl
woke up and he was standing beside her bed, unbuttoning his
pants,'' Hunter said. ``She and her mother began screaming and then
the uncle came in and stabbed him.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncle, whose name was not released by the police, began
chasing Beach on 240th Street, but eventually lost him, officials
said. Police officers spotted him and arrested him outside a
friend's house on 240th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught him not far away in a driveway where he was
bleeding from the stab wound, but because nothing happened in the
house they could only really arrest him for the burglary even
though he fit the pattern of other rapes that had occurred,''
Hunter explained.
</P>
<P>
   Beach was charged with burglary and endangering the welfare of a
child. Law enforcement officials said that Beach was unable to post
the $250,000 bail on the burglary charge and was sent to Rikers
Island.
</P>
<P>
   His arraignment came two weeks after Gov. George E. Pataki
proposed the most aggressive laws in the nation for solving crimes
using DNA analysis. The proposals would require every person
convicted of a crime to provide a biological sample for a state
database.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That aspect of the proposal has come under fire from some civil
libertarians who say it is an inappropriate government intrusion.
But Brown said Saturday that Beach's case is the strongest evidence
yet to support the governor's proposal, adding that the collection
is ``something we should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that Beach did not immediately
become a suspect in the other attacks because the home invasion in
November did not fit the pattern, which involved a man following
women from cars, cabs and dollar vans and then attacking them in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But the DNA, taken from blood on the uncle's knife blade, linked
him to two Rosedale attacks in September and October. In the first
of those attacks, a 20-year-old college student was raped and
robbed after Beach followed her home from school, officials said.
In the second incident, a 55-year-old woman was attacked behind her
home, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Beach was later identified during a lineup by the 30-year-old
woman who was attacked in December 1998. Beach was on parole for
burglary until March 2001, but because his previous offenses were
not on a certain list of felonies that require DNA samples, his DNA
was not placed in the state databank, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cases like Beach's, civil libertarians have expressed
concern that the state might improperly use DNA samples collected
and that the sampling should be done only in the most serious
crimes, as opposed to cases like civil disobedience and turnstile
jumping.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, Brown said that Beach's case was an excellent
example of why ``it makes a great deal of sense to have the DNA of
everyone who commits a crime in the state's DNA databank.''

TOUGH CHOICES FOR NEW JERSEY POLICE LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ During his first four months as superintendent
of the New Jersey State Police, Col. Carson J. Dunbar Jr. has tried
to move the force beyond its racial-profiling scandal by
instituting several new procedures intended to deter future
discrimination by troopers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the coming months, Dunbar faces two far more incendiary
tasks that are likely to determine whether he can change the
culture of the force and restore public confidence in the agency.
</P>
<P>
   First, Dunbar must determine how harshly to punish officers
whose discrimination led to the profiling scandal. Then he must
decide how aggressively to investigate dozens of supervisors
accused of tolerating, and in some cases encouraging, racial
profiling and sexual harassment by troopers.
</P>
<P>
   This month Dunbar will begin hearing a backlog of nearly 100
disciplinary cases against troopers, many involving charges that
officers singled out or mistreated civilians based on the color of
their skin. The state attorney general's office is also reviewing
about 31 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints that
some troopers and supervisors harassed minority and female
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to weighing the evidence against officers and
punishing those who are guilty, Dunbar must also decide the
delicate issue of whether to hold the troopers' commanders
accountable for failing to supervise them. More than a dozen
lawsuits have been filed by troopers who say they were ordered or
taught to single out drivers based on their skin color, or were
subjected to racial or sexual discrimination on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those accusations have yet to be heard in court, but in
at least two cases, state judges have ruled that there was
compelling evidence that some supervisors contributed to an
atmosphere in which discrimination flourished. So in shaping the
force he hopes to lead into the future, Dunbar will have to pass
judgment on midlevel commanders who have been accused of a litany
of racial and sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   One sergeant accused of maligning black and female troopers
drove a pickup truck emblazoned with the words ``Coon Hunter'' for
more than a year, despite complaints from minority officers,
according to court papers. At least six supervisors are named in
lawsuits as encouraging troopers to single out black and Latino
drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Several supervisors who devised the training techniques that a
state judge blamed for encouraging racial profiling are still on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Most noteworthy is the case of Lt. Col. Robert Dunlop, now the
deputy superintendent, who has had significant input in Dunbar's
reorganization of the agency. Dunlop has been named as a defendant
in three discrimination suits, and one of the plaintiffs has said
he encouraged discrimination against blacks and routinely referred
to female troopers using a vulgar reference to female genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlop did not return repeated calls requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar has postponed more than 300 promotions that he had
scheduled for Friday _ partly, he said, because he needed more time
to review the accusations against supervisors and determine whether
their promotions should be denied.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar is left with some uncomfortable choices. He must bring
about enough change to win over the public, assure minority
officers that their rights will be respected and convince all
employees that they will be held accountable for their actions.
Meanwhile, he has to avoid inciting the politically powerful state
police union and alienating the 2,800 officers under his command.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dunbar has taken great pains to portray himself as a
reformer rather than a vindictive avenger.
</P>
<P>
   He has accelerated the state's campaign to install video cameras
in all patrol cars to monitor troopers' actions during traffic
stops. But he has also used the cameras to seek criminal charges
against civilians who falsely accuse troopers. Last month, Dunbar
announced that he would add equipment and staffing to Internal
Affairs, yet he has not transferred any of the 10 investigators
who, he said, performed shoddy investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar has also announced that he will impose stiffer penalties
on employees guilty of misconduct in the future. But last month,
when he was asked whether he would aggressively investigate the
supervisors accused of teaching profiling techniques, he seemed
uninterested in delving too deeply into the past. ``I have a hard
enough time looking forward now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar has since amended that statement, saying that he would
not initiate any intensive review of state police commanders, but
would investigate any new evidence suggesting that supervisors
encouraged or engaged in discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to look at the cases we have, almost 100 of them,
then follow the trail wherever it leads me, whether it involves
supervisors or anyone else,'' he said last week in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Those mixed messages make some civil rights advocates question
whether Dunbar has the will or political muscle to upset entrenched
members of the state police hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The State Troopers Fraternal Association has thus far been
supportive of his measured steps. But many police experts say
Dunbar could further alienate members of New Jersey's minority
community and undermine morale on the force if he leaves in place
commanders who committed or encouraged discrimination.

</P>
<P>
   Patrick V. Murphy, who took over the New York Police Department
in 1970 after the Knapp Commission found a widespread pattern of
systemic payoffs and corruption, said that without accountability
of supervisors, any reform plan would quickly become mired in
officers' cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If among that top command there are bad apples and everybody
knows it, the new superintendent does himself a disservice to
permit that kind of person to remain in power,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a handful of officers have faced departmental
punishment for racial profiling. The department would not say how
they had been disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   The two troopers who shot three unarmed minority men on the New
Jersey Turnpike in April 1998, making racial profiling the state's
dominant issue, now face criminal charges in the shooting and are
accused of misrepresenting the race of the drivers they stopped, in
order to conceal their racial profiling. Ten other troopers may
face prosecution for filing false documents about the race of
people they stopped, Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   To Dunbar, who spent over 20 years at the FBI, the highly
publicized troubles of the New Jersey State Police offer an
opportunity to establish a national reputation as a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent's performance also carries high stakes for
Gov. Christie Whitman. The governor belatedly acknowledged the
existence of racial profiling last year _ more than two years after
a Gloucester County judge found evidence of widespread
discrimination by troopers _ and now seems committed to changing
the culture of the force.
</P>
<P>
   If Dunbar makes only marginal progress, however, history could
well remember Whitman as the governor who acknowledged the problem
of racial profiling but failed to solve it.
</P>
<P>
   The governor forced the former superintendent, Carl A. Williams,
to resign last year for racial insensitivity, after he told a
newspaper reporter that minority groups were largely responsible
for the illegal drug problem. But some of the governor's more
recent statements suggest that she does not believe midlevel
commanders should bear the bulk of the responsibility for
institutionalized racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders, many of whom have praised Dunbar's
performance, say that the Whitman administration's reluctance to
focus on supervisors has made his job as superintendent more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, head of the Black Ministers
Council of New Jersey, pointed out that the attorney general's
office investigated the force for several months last year and
could have disciplined or fired the most troubled supervisors
before Dunbar became superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the attorney general's office put him in a tough
spot,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office has also been accused of
taking a lenient approach to harassment complaints. One trooper,
Jennifer Morse, filed a sexual harassment complaint and a civil
lawsuit claiming that she had been harassed and verbally abused for
years by a lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Morse's lawyer, Phil Moran, said the supervisor repeatedly
touched her hair and body, and humiliated her in front of
co-workers by making unwelcome sexual advances and forcing her to
listen to his sexually explicit fantasies about his stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Attorney General John Farmer found that most of her
charges were substantiated, although the lieutenant admitted to
touching her in a different way from what she alleged. Farmer
ordered the lieutenant to undergo counseling, but he remains on the
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret any inconvenience that you may have experienced as a
result of matters you expressed in your complaint,'' Farmer wrote
to Morse. ``It is my hope that you and the other employees involved
will be able to put these matters behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Shatzkin, a spokesman for the attorney general's office,
said the lieutenant could still be disciplined by the department.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar has taken steps to open up the historically secretive
state police discipline system, by releasing statistics on the
number of cases against officers, but he refuses to discuss
individual cases, so it is unclear whether the lieutenant will face
administrative charges. That reticence, a hallmark of the FBI
internal discipline system in which Dunbar worked for years,
worries some civil rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years the state police discipline system was veiled in
secrecy, the good ol' boys protected each other and it turned into
a civil rights disaster,'' said William Buckman, a lawyer who
represents several clients in racial profiling cases. ``If they're
allowed to continue that secrecy, there's no reason to believe that
anything will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar said that while he understood the public's desire for
more thorough disclosure of police disciplinary matters, they were
private personnel issues. No one _ in the state police or out _
should mistake his discretion for timidity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something is wrong, it's wrong,'' Dunbar said. ``And if I
see patterns of conduct that is improper, I'm not going to tolerate
it, even if it may make some people upset.''

THE HUNGER CONTINUES FOR FRANCO IN BULLPEN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ There is no single low point. When John
Franco looks back on the last 10 years, so many of which were so
forgettable, he cannot pick out rock bottom. The worst part, he
said, was that empty feeling, most acute on the afternoon drives to
Shea Stadium, the neighborhood park that was jumping before he
started working there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lowest point?'' the Mets reliever said, repeating a
question. ``When you're out of contention in June, driving to the
ballpark knowing that you have don't have a chance to make the
playoffs and World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   There was 1992, Franco remembers, and that was bad. The Mets had
made several expensive additions, and looked ready to return to the
postseason for the first time in four years. Instead, they lost 90
games, then lost 103 the next season. There were injuries, Franco
said, but the mix of players was just not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bunch of guys, it's a little different now,'' Franco
said, standing at his corner locker at Thomas J. White Stadium. The
stall to his left belongs to Al Leiter, who won the World Series
with Florida, and the stall on his right belongs to Robin Ventura,
who won a division title with the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seems a little more hungry,'' Franco said. ``Not to
say that we weren't hungry in '92, but maybe we're better prepared
now than we were then. Back then we still had a lot of guys from
the '86 team and the '88 team, when they won. But now we've got
guys from different organizations coming in, guys who haven't won
before, guys who have. Everybody's on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Franco's pages have been printed on Mets stationary since
Dec. 6, 1989, when the Mets acquired him from Cincinnati in the
deal that sent Randy Myers to the Reds. Franco had made three
All-Star teams in four years before the trade. The year he left,
Cincinnati won the World Series. Franco still laughs at the memory,
and shakes his head: that's life.
</P>
<P>
   Franco had a chance to move on again last winter. He had 19
saves when a finger injury in July sidelined him for two months.
When he returned, Armando Benitez was the closer. Franco played in
the postseason for the first time in his career, but he had
effectively lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   As a 10-year veteran who has played the last five years for the
same team, Franco controlled where the Mets could have traded him.
He wanted to know if contending teams had interest in him as a
closer. The Mets checked around: Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia,
St. Louis and Seattle were looking for closers, and Franco was an
appealing name.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wanted that, that could have happened,'' said Franco's
agent, Dan Horwits. ``That was the easy part.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard part was deciding if Franco really wanted it. The
advantages of staying were obvious: Franco is a Brooklyn native who
lives in Staten Island with his wife, Rose, and their two children,
and the Mets had just been two games short of a World Series berth.
But if the 39-year-old Franco and the 27-year-old Benitez both
stayed, Benitez was the obvious closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the toughest decision he's ever made in his
professional career, by far,'' Horwits said. ``Every night,
probably for several weeks, he and Rose and I would discuss the
pros and cons, the what-ifs. It was a very tough decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco's chance at the career saves record was a consideration,
Horwits said, though not a major one. Franco is second on the
career list with 416 saves, 62 behind Lee Smith, and with two good
seasons he could have the record _ and, perhaps, a shot at the Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I had to sit back and think about,'' Franco
said of his decision. ``You know, you're so used to doing something
for a long time. But it all comes back to winning.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips and the co-owner Fred Wilpon
assured Franco that the Mets were committed to making a big push to
win in 2000. Winning had meant so much to Franco in '99 _ ``You
could tell by his emotions, what he said and what he did; it wasn't
subtle,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said _ and he didn't want to miss
out if the Mets went all the way this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about him, not to ask for a trade when he's a
guy who has a really good chance to take over the saves record and
he doesn't know if he's going to be the closer or not,'' said the
Mets right-hander Bobby J. Jones. ``It just shows how he feels
about the organization and how much he wants to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco has not been told his role for this season, and Valentine
has been careful not to officially tag him a setup man. Valentine
said he has not seen Benitez throw in games yet, and points out
that Benitez is coming off knee surgery. But Benitez signed a
four-year, $22 million contract extension last month, and Mets
officials openly talked of him as their closer. Franco politely
insists he will do whatever is necessary to help the Mets win.
</P>
<P>
   The saves record may not be out of Franco's reach. He has no
plans to retire soon, and can be a free agent after the season. As
Horwits said: ``Obviously, teams are going to want him as a closer
next year. Probably the same teams that were interested over the
winter will be interested in having him back as a closer.''
</P>
<P>
   When Franco decided to stay, then, he was not saying he wanted
to be a Met forever. Or was he?
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is full of decisions,'' Franco said, ``and I'll just
worry about that when the time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Franco said, he is not looking back. ``I made the right
decision,'' he said. ``It feels good, the organization's been good.
I want to win. I got a taste of winning last year, and I think
we've got a real good shot of winning this year.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ A Bronx woman was in stable condition Saturday after
the man she lived with attacked her and her daughter with a knife
and hammer, then threw himself and their 9-year-old son off the
roof of the five-story apartment building where they lived.
</P>
<P>
   The man, David Pizarro, 38, died early Saturday at the scene,
and the couple's son, David Jacob Pizarro, was pronounced dead at
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, said a police spokesman,
Detective Walter Burnes.
</P>
<P>
   Pizarro and the woman he lived with, Anna DeValle, 35, fought
around midnight Friday in their apartment at 1819 Weeks Ave. in the
Bronx, Burnes said. They argued over $70 that she had taken from
him early in the day, the police said. Pizarro then attacked
DeValle, slashing her on the left arm with a knife, prompting the
woman's daughter, Annie Fernandez, 15, to intervene, the police
said. Pizarro then began to hit the girl in the head with a hammer,
the police said. The girl fled the third-floor apartment, and
Pizarro resumed attacking DeValle, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter ran downstairs, knocking on doors to try to find
help. She ran into the apartment where Sharees Nelson, 19, was
visiting his extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was on her knees, her clothes were ripped, and she was
saying, `Help, help! He's going to kill my mother! I tried to call
the cops, but they asked too many questions,''' Nelson said
Saturday. Police said they had no record of a 911 call coming from
the Pizarro apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter told Nelson and his family that as she was calling
the police from her apartment, Pizarro hit her in the head.
</P>
<P>
   DeValle managed to flee the apartment, despite several knife
wounds in her torso.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in the apartment, Pizarro grabbed their son, David, the
police said, and took the boy to the roof of the five-story
building, where he jumped.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that a small number of witnesses tried to
persuade Pizarro to come down from the roof's ledge. Arriving at
the apartment building, the police found the 15-year-old girl, who
was treated for her injuries at a hospital, then released, Officer
George Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   DeValle was treated for her wounds at a hospital, where she was
in stable condition Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that Pizarro had no history of domestic
abuse.

 &HT;    Presidential eggs in one early basket
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_ So big, so soon, such an anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   That's the short take on politics this week, when voters in 16
states and American Samoa go to the polls in the biggest day of
presidential primaries and caucuses in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   For those tuning in late on the race for the Democratic and
Republican presidential nominations, it may all seem like one big
balloon drop. With about 60 percent of the delegates needed up for
grabs, Tuesday could pretty much decide the nomination in one or
both parties _ before many voters have fully caught up with the
fact that it's a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   Even for loyal C-SPAN junkies, sorting through Tuesday's action
presents a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The big election day is not a planned event. It's the result of
an incremental process that began when several states, including
California and New York, took note of the success the South had in
attracting candidates in the 1980s with its big regional primary,
Super Tuesday, and moved their primary and caucus dates up even
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was already ahead of Super Tuesday, having moved its
primary date up at the behest of former Gov. Zell Miller to help
Bill Clinton in 1992. This year, the state has lots of company, not
concentrated in one region but spread all over the national map.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of differences among the states and between the
parties over how the delegates will be divvied up. Most states are
only concerned with presidential matters, but Ohio also has U.S.
Senate primaries. California, the most closely watched state, has a
confusing combination of an open primary with an election of
convention delegates confined to party members.
</P>
<P>
   It's so uncoordinated it doesn't really have a name. Some still
call it Super Tuesday, but that moniker has also been reserved for
the March 14 primary of six Southern and Southwestern states.
Titanic Tuesday has been used as a name, but it hasn't had time to
catch on.
</P>
<P>
   The same may be said for the primaries themselves. One thing to
watch for Tuesday is whether turnout falls below the record levels
set this year in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan. There
was also a lot of political advertising in those states that most
voters in Tuesday's battleground states didn't see.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout is very low, there will be more calls to do something
about the front-loaded primary system. If it's higher than
expected, we'll probably hear more arguments for a national primary
or a rotating system of regional primaries.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other things to watch for Tuesday, if the
nomination races don't provide enough suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Political insiders already know what the newscasters' body
language means when they go on the air before the polls close:
They've already seen early data from exit polls telling them the
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Advance word of the exit results usually sifts out into
political circles, but this year information has also been showing
up on the Internet for a much larger audience to see.
</P>
<P>
   This is touchy business for Bill Headline, executive director of
Voter News Service, which conducts the exit polling for a group of
news organizations. He declined to comment on what action VNS has
taken to discourage Web sites from publishing the information
before the polls close.
</P>
<P>
   One site where Web surfers won't get a sneak peak is Microsoft's
Web magazine, Slate, which last week declined to publish early
information on the Virginia and Washington state primaries, saying
that VNS had threatened legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``While my heart lusts for a battlefield pulped crimson with
bodies from the legal departments of Microsoft and VNS, we have
capitulated,'' Jack Shafer, a Slate editor, wrote. ``Although we
think VNS is stupid and wrong to want to keep this information
secret ... we stand censored.''
</P>
<P>
   For those concerned with letting the news out too early, the
continental ripple is another concern. Ever since Ronald Reagan's
victory over Jimmy Carter in 1980, there have been concerns about
voters on the West Coast staying at home because of early reports
from the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the problem has surfaced at the primary
level. It may not matter so much in the Democratic race, where
former Sen. Bill Bradley's campaign was clearly sagging across the
board. But there could be questions if, for instance, Sen. John
McCain were to have a disappointing day in New York and news about
it suppresses turnout in California.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidential name-drop game will be another feature to
watch for as the returns trickle in. Picking a running mate will be
the next big political question after the nominations are settled,
and the jostling won't take long to start Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And while most returns are reported in percentages, take note of
which party gets the most voters out to the polls. The parties
certainly will be. So far this year the Republicans have had larger
turnouts, which can be attributed to a more spirited contest for
their nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But starting this week, both parties will be watching turnout,
with an eye toward who might have the advantage in the fall.

NOISILY BUT FONDLY RECALLING CHINATOWN'S `MAYOR'

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the din of the festive banquet hall, it was
difficult to hear the elder statesmen praising Man Bun Lee, the man
who was popularly known as the mayor of Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed fitting that the crowd of more than 1,000 gathered
at a dinner last week to honor the memory of Lee, a man known for
urging the community to speak up for its rights, made so much
noise. It was fitting, also, that to reach the party at Jing Fong,
a restaurant on Elizabeth Street, most had to pass the Fifth
Precinct station house, which Lee had fought to keep open.
</P>
<P>
   Lee died of a heart attack at 75 last year, but in the
neighborhood, he remains a symbol of civic activism, the battle for
civil rights and the increased power of New York's Chinese
population.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent members of the Chinatown community, many of whom
considered Lee their civic compass, held the dinner on Tuesday _
Feb. 29, the day Percy E. Sutton, then Manhattan borough president,
proclaimed Man Bun Lee Day in 1976. The event was a fund-raiser to
support the building of a child care center in Chinatown bearing
Lee's name. The location of the center has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Chang Wang, a former commissioner of the city's Department
of Employment, considers Lee her mentor. She said she remembered
his effectiveness, even in the face of disappointment. In 1982, the
neighborhood lost a battle with the city over a detention center
because it lacked the clout to fight to keep it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extremely angry and hurt,'' said Wang, who was then
executive director of the Chinatown Manpower Project, the
employment and training group that sponsored the banquet. Lee was
its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Nora, you know what? It's a lesson for all of us in
the community. We lost for a good reason. We should form a voter
education alliance, to inform the community,''' she recalled. They
did, and 18 years later, the community has grown much stronger, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who emigrated from China in 1953 and earned a master's
degree in business and finance, helped lead two demonstrations of
20,000 people in the mid-1970s, in a march on City Hall against
police brutality, and in a fight to keep the precinct house.
</P>
<P>
   His concern for the young people of the neighborhood was well
known, and he was active in anti-gang efforts, even after he was
stabbed five times by a retaliating gang member, in the Kao Wah
Restaurant that he operated on Mott Street.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, Lee led many Chinatown institutions, including
the New York Lee Family Association, a fraternal and social
organization for members of the Lee family; the family
association's credit union, where he was comptroller; and the
Chinatown Consolidated Benevolent Association, the neighborhood's
largest civic organization. He also headed the board of Confucius
Plaza, a low-income housing complex in Chinatown, for which he
helped gain city approval.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the banquet, Sutton said he admired the way Lee
spoke out against injustices. ``Too often people who are recent
immigrants have a timidity, and do not speak up,'' Sutton said.
``He was concerned about children.''

   BBN-ASTROS _ The Houston Astros came close to eliminating the
Atlanta Braves from the 1999 postseason, winning the first game of
the division series before losing three straight. Expectations was
supposed to be high for the Astros this year as they move into a
new ballpark, but that was before the team lost key players Mike
Hampton, Carl Everett, Derek Bell and perhaps Moises Alou. What
happened to the team that was supposed to be a serious threat for
the National League pennant? (Stinson, Atlanta

   FBC-GIBBS _ The hiring of Gary Gibbs at the University of
Georgia has gone virtually unnoticed. Gibbs has been hired to help
strengthen Georgia's defense, but much of the talk surrounding the
hiring focused on the fact that Kevin Ramsey, the former defensive
coordinator, wasn't notified of the move and had a heated argument
with head coach Jim Donnan. Through it all, however, Gibbs has
tried to remained focused on the job at hand - helping the Georgia
defense. (Towers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. MOVED

 &HT;    OPTIONAL TRIM AT 800
 &HT;    For Sunday, March 5
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Vice President Al Gore is so confident of a ``Super
Tuesday'' primary victory over Democratic challenger Bill Bradley
that he began road-testing campaign themes against Republican
presidential rivals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, campaigning in New York City, invoked the name of
Harry Truman as he predicted a come from behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little behind, but it's not over,'' Bradley told 250
supporters standing outside in New York's Washington Square Park.
``You know, I came from Missouri. You know Harry Truman. They said
he was finished in 1948, that he didn't have a chance, and you know
what happened there? He came from behind and won.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show him trailing Gore in all 15 ``Super Tuesday'' states.
The latest polls in New York put Gore ahead by 20 points there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the former New York Knicks basketball star insisted
Saturday that he could ``surprise some people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of 250,000 people have voted in this country,'' Bradley
told a CBS interviewer on Manhattan's upper west side. ``I think
Tuesday will be a decisive time because eight and a half million
people will vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Saturday looked past Bradley and began auditioning
anti-Republican attacks he is expected to use in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   His most potent weapon against the GOP nominee, judging from his
emphasis during Saturday's appearances in New York and
Massachusetts, is what is widely agreed to be the strong economy in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue now is whether or not we're going to keep that
prosperity going or whether or not we're going to take the advice
of both Republican candidates and take a right wing U-turn back to
the old polices of the past,'' Gore said during a rally at Boston's
historic Faneuil (pronounced FAN-yuhl) Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also raised environmental issues in his criticism of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain, something he has
rarely done in the Democratic contest with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the environment, just remember two numbers _ zero and one,
since this is the digital age,'' Gore said of the GOP presidential
contenders:
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them in the Senate two years ago had a zero rating from
the League of Conservation Voters. The other one is the governor of
a state which he has just led to the position of number one in air
pollution, number one in water pollution, number one in land
pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   He also ripped Bush for his anti-abortion stand, noting that the
Texas governor had met privately in the past with televangelists
Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. He said the ``code'' language
Robertson and Falwell used following the meeting indicated Bush
would appoint Supreme Court justices committed to overturning Roe
v. Wade, the court ruling that granted abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're saying is they had a solid promise to give the
right wing extremist wing of the Republican Party control of our
Supreme Court and the interpretation of our Constitution,'' Gore
said. ``Let's stop that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore barely mentioned Bradley in a morning speech to several
hundred people who gathered on a sunny, brisk day in the square in
front of Faneuil Hall, which was built in 1742 and has provided a
forum for a number of historic figures, including Samuel Adams,
Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony and John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's passing reference to Bradley was to remind voters that
both he and his challenger have said that Tuesday's primary voting
in 15 states, including Massachusetts, ``will be the decisive
moment'' in the campaign for the Democratic campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You here in Massachusetts ... have an opportunity to close the
book on the Democratic nomination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' two senators, Ted Kennedy and John Kerry, joined
Gore on the stage and in the attacks on the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry ridiculed Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' with a
joke about Bob Jones III, president of Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, and John Rocker, the Atlanta Brave pitcher who made
inflammatory remarks about minorities, gays and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The definition of George Bush's compassionate conservative
(cq.) is Bob Jones III forgiving John Rocker,'' Kerry quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Bob Jones University prohibited inter-racial
dating, barred gays from its campus and regarded Catholicism as a
false religion.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, several of Bradley's New York supporters said they
were relieved that the candidate was finally campaigning in New
York. Former New York Mayor Koch, who had publicly criticized the
campaign's decision to spend six days in Washington state before
its March 29 primary, was one supporter who said he was glad to
have Bradley back in the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question ... he's the underdog, but New Yorkers
love the underdog,'' Koch said after appearing with Bradley in
Washington Square Park. ``So I'm hopeful that we can turn it around
and make him a winner.''
</P>
<P>

</P>

   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Koch also underscored the importance of the Empire State to
Bradley's chances of winning the Democratic nomination. ``If you
can't win New York, you can't win the country,'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said nothing about Gore in any of his public speeches to
voters Saturday, but his campaign released a statement from Bradley
that again called on the vice president to explain more fully his
presence at a California fund-raiser in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley issued the statement in response to a story appearing in
the Philadelphia Inquirer. The newspaper account suggested that
Gore knew in advance that the event, held at a Buddhist temple, was
in fact a fund-raiser. The event has become significant because the
organizer of the event, Maria Hsia, was convicted last week of
campaign fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said only that he knew the event was ``finance
related.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president ``has yet to explain what his mistakes were
and why he made them,'' Bradley said in the statement. ``Now is the
time for Al Gore to be straight with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for the vice president's campaign,
said the charges were ``the most recycled story in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole issue has been gone through with a fine tooth comb
by the Justice Department and congressional committees,'' Hattaway
said. ``And they have found no wrongdoing on the vice president's
part.''

RANGERS' YORK HAS OUTSIDE SHOT AT TOP ROOKIE HONORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Gomez of the New Jersey Devils will probably win the
Calder Trophy as the National Hockey League's rookie of the year,
and there are good reasons for this. Gomez leads all rookies in
total points, he plays for a top team and he appeared in the
All-Star Game. As the NHL's first Hispanic star, the 20-year-old
Alaskan enjoys a considerable marketing push from league
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But another American playing in the New York metropolitan area
also will merit strong consideration for first-year honors, also
for good reason. He is Mike York of the Rangers, a center from
suburban Detroit, who leads all rookies in goals while centering
two veterans on the second line. York scored a goal and had an
assist in Friday night's 4-2 victory over Florida in Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The result helped the Rangers keep their precarious hold on a
low-rung playoff berth as they head for the West Coast to begin a
four-game trip on Monday night in San Jose. Going into Saturday
night, York's goal total of 21 was five more than that of Gomez.
But York's 41 total points were 16 behind Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Other top rookies include Alex Tanguay of Colorado, Jan Hlavac
of the Rangers, Tim Connolly of the Islanders and Brian Rafalski of
the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   York's linemates are hardly rookies _ Adam Graves on the left
and Theo Fleury on the right. Including playoffs, these two have
combined for 1,952 NHL games and 747 goals over 25 seasons. Asked
after the Florida game what he likes about playing with York,
Fleury smiled and said: ``Oh, just about everything. He is going to
be a great player in this league. He competes. For a young guy, he
is good at all aspects of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves said York ``adds an element of speed. He sees the ice
well. He's good on defense and he's pretty good on the draws. He's
a smart player and a good kid, and he works hard.''
</P>
<P>
   York and Gomez met during a 10-day stint as roommates during
training camp for the U.S. junior team two years ago. ``We got to
know each other a little bit,'' York said. ``We don't talk on the
phone or anything like that. But when we see each other at the
rink, we'll say `hi' and talk a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Their routes to opposite banks of the Hudson River were
different. Gomez was a first-round draft choice who played as a
junior in the Western Canadian league. York was a sixth-round draft
choice who played four years in college at Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   York surprised everyone by winning a full-time job last autumn
with the Rangers. John Muckler, the coach, said he saw York play a
little last spring in the playoffs with the farm team in Hartford
and was not impressed then. But Muckler kept an open mind. His
evaluation improved in training camp and has stayed positive since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember when he's had two bad games in a row,''
Muckler said of York. ``He has that ability, if he does have a
stinker, to come right back. Earlier in the year I was concerned
about that, how a rookie gets into a rut and kind of drops off. But
he never did that.'' Muckler said York ``takes responsibility and
has leadership qualities'' and ``never wants to make a mistake and
he always wants to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has good quickness, good hands,'' Muckler said. ``Early on
in training camp we noticed the determination. He's just continued
to grow all year long.'' Muckler said that York ``has a good chance
of being in the final three'' for rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   York, 22, is from Waterford, Mich., the same town that produced
Pat LaFontaine. The area has a rich hockey culture. Near Canada, it
accommodates a top college league, a major junior team, two minor
professional leagues and, of course, the Red Wings, who have won
the Stanley Cup twice in the last three years for ``Hockeytown.''
Like LaFontaine, York is small for pro sports. At 5 feet 10 inches
and 185 pounds, York is slightly bigger than Fleury, somewhat
smaller than Graves.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fleury, York wears a goatee on his chin. Unlike Fleury or
Graves, he is not very verbal with the news media. When asked about
himself, York would rather praise his linemates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help me out a lot,'' York said. ``They tell me what to
expect from certain guys. They are excellent, both on and off the
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   He said LaFontaine was always his favorite player, that his
parents and an older brother knew LaFontaine, and that he met him
``a few times'' when he was growing up. York said he tried to play
LaFontaine's style. Regarding his personal success this season,
York said: ``I'm definitely surprised. I never thought I'd get this
many goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he is pleased or surprised by his Calder
candidacy, York said: ``Both. It would be a great honor. But the
biggest thing right now is to just get in the playoffs. The better
the team does, the better chance I'd have.''

EMOTIONAL REUNION FOR SOJO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ Spring-training games don't count in the
standings, but style points are tabulated, and on Saturday Jeff
Juden went a long way toward pitching his way out of the Yankees'
organization. Juden's disastrous outing occurred during a horribly
played 12-4 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Yankees' third loss
in three exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   Juden, who has bounced around many teams and is most noted for
his compilation of brawls, was signed to a $500,000 major-league
contract for the 2000 season, against the wishes of many club
officials. Juden needed to pitch effectively in spring training to
have a chance to be part of the Opening Day roster.
</P>
<P>
   In his first outing Saturday, Juden faced eight batters, walking
three _ including pitcher Jose Parra _ and hitting two while
surrendering five runs in two-thirds of an inning, as George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, watched from the
stands. If the Yankees release Juden early in spring training, they
would be obligated to pay him only one-quarter ($125,000) of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Bittersweet Hellos
</P>
<P>
   Luis Sojo mostly found reasons to laugh and enjoy himself in his
four seasons with the Yankees, but on Saturday, melancholy overcame
the veteran utility man when he was surrounded by the likes of
Derek Jeter, Chuck Knoblauch and Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo, trying to win a job as a utilityman with the Pirates,
visited with his old teammates before Saturday's exhibition game
and had to compose himself. ``Kind of sad,'' Sojo said, describing
his feelings. ``I spent almost four years there, and you're talking
about having a very good time. When you get a hug from your boys _
Jeter, Knoblauch and O'Neill _ you get emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Sojo was highly respected by his teammates, but the Yankees
decided in the off-season to use D'Angelo Jimenez in the utility
role. Sojo understood their rationale and signed with the Pirates,
the first team to make a firm offer. A week after Sojo agreed to
terms, Jimenez broke a bone in his neck in a car wreck _ he is out
for the year _ and the Yankees were forced to sign another veteran
utilityman, Rafael Bournigal.
</P>
<P>
   Before doing so, they asked the Pirates about making a deal for
Sojo, and were rebuffed, according to a major-league official.
</P>
<P>
   State of the Staff
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, hampered by bronchitis for more than a week,
reported to the Yankees' trainers on Saturday that he felt much
better _ a relief for Manager Joe Torre, who had begun to worry
about how the right-hander's condition never seemed to improve. Ed
Yarnall, nursing a sore back, will throw in the bullpen Sunday.
Torre figures that the rookie left-hander, who is expected to be
the No. 5 starter, will get about five starts in spring training.

STEWART PROPELS NIAGARA OVER MARIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Niagara's Demond Stewart, the nation's
ninth-leading scorer in the regular season, picked up where he left
off in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart poured in 31 points _ eight above his average _ and
Niagara took off from a three-point halftime lead for a comfortable
83-65 victory over Marist in the quarterfinals at Pepsi Arena.
Stewart, a 6-foot-3-inch guard, has scored 30 points or more in
eight games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Niagara (17-11) advanced to the MAAC semifinals for
the second year in a row, while extending its winning streak to
three. Fourth-seeded Marist (14-14) had its four-game winning
streak snapped. Joe McCurdy had a team-high 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara expanded its 31-28 halftime lead to 46-36 with 11
minutes 21 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in scoring 15 points in the first half, Stewart darted
around the perimeter looking for the ball, and as soon as he got
it, he either shot it or burst to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   He swished a short turnaround jumper and then a three-point bomb
from the baseline to build a 51-36 lead midway through the second
half. After a basket by Marist's Tom Kenney, Stewart popped into
the lane for an easy layup to keep the lead at 15.
</P>
<P>
   The cushion grew to 19 with less than eight minutes left, but
Marist climbed back within eight points before Terry Edwards lofted
in a three-pointer to restore Niagara's double-digit lead with less
than five minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Marist, which advanced to the conference semifinals last season,
has not been to the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament since 1987. The winner of the MAAC tournament receives
an automatic bid to the national tournament. Niagara has not won
the conference tournament in its 11 years as a member, and has not
qualified for the NCAA tournament since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara rode a 7-0 spurt to take a 16-6 lead early in the first
half. The Purple Eagles made a 6-1 run minutes later to pull ahead,
22-10.
</P>
<P>
   But Niagara, the MAAC's worst-shooting team at 41 percent, is
also not the most selective when it comes to shots. The Purple
Eagles began missing from afar, allowing Joe McCurdy to pull Marist
back into the game. With his team trailing by 11, McCurdy hit a
short jumper and two 3-pointers on consecutive possessions, and
Drew Samuels glided in for a layup to cut Niagara's lead to 27-26.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart ended the half's scoring by bursting through the lane to
draw the foul and then making the free throws. Stewart made four of
10 field-goal attempts in the first half and six of eight free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara looked complacent at times on offense when it relied too
much on Stewart, but he compensated with improvisation.

REAL ESTATE: NEW DOWNTOWN AREA TAKES ROOT IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With a 2.3-million-square-foot convention center as its
vanguard, a new commercial neighborhood with luxury housing is
emerging on Boston Harbor, which for almost four centuries has been
the heart of this compact city perennially in search of expansion
space. Nine projects valued at $3 billion are being developed in a
district once dominated by wharves, ship terminals, fish processors
and warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   On April 2, after almost a year of site preparation,
construction will start on the $700 million South Boston Convention
and Exhibition Center, the linchpin of this new downtown district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big gorilla that's about to sit down on the
waterfront,'' said Dean F. Stratouly, a Cambridge developer who is
directing the convention center project for the Massachusetts
Convention Center Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Once completed in 2003, ``It will legitimize the whole area.''
Stratouly said, creating ``a demand for 4,800 hotel rooms and
support services that will drive up real estate values.''
</P>
<P>
   The modernistic 120-foot-long, six-story convention center will
be large enough to attract the major meetings that have been
bypassing Boston. The eight other projects being developed nearby
include luxury hotels, offices and 1,200 residential units to be
built within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   They will complement the convention center as well as the 1990s
projects _ a new federal courthouse and hotel _ that sprouted on
this section of the waterfront, which is a 10-minute walk from
Boston's financial district and a six-minute drive to Logan
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gold rush already,'' said Stratouly, president of
Congress Group Ventures, referring to the new projects being
planned and the rising real estate values. The increased real
estate costs are raising housing prices in the surrounding
residential areas of South Boston. ``The waterfront,'' Stratouly
said, ``is going from lunchboxes to briefcases.''
</P>
<P>
   But some wonder whether this boon for developers and businesses
will hamper the operations of New England's premier commercial
port, which in 1999, according to port officials, transported $10
billion in goods through its newly dredged waterways.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have incompatible uses, something has to give,'' said
Vivian Li, president of the Boston Harbor Association, a private
maritime advocacy group. ``The conventioneers and firms moving in
from the financial district will displace the small businesses that
work the commercial port.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 92 mostly maritime-related businesses were relocated to
assemble the 62-acre convention center site. But the Port of
Boston, which since 1996 increased the value of the cargo it
handles by 30 percent, hopes to acquire more waterfront space for
support operations like warehouses. ``We're bursting at the
seams,'' said Georgeanne Tacelli, a spokeswoman for the port.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling the competition under way for space at the harbor,
Gillette Co., one of New England's largest manufacturers, with a
sprawling plant on the South Boston waterfront, also intends to
continue growing in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the factor that has made all this development
possible and will determine which players can efficiently use the
waterfront is access to a modern intermodal transportation system,
a network that integrates travel by land, sea and air. ``What makes
this area work for any particular user is transportation,'' said
Li, the maritime advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, about $20 billion in federal, state and
municipal funds has been earmarked to rebuild the land transport
network that runs through downtown Boston, linking the waterfront
and with the airport via a new tunnel under the harbor. During the
road construction, new sewer, water, electric and
telecommunications lines are being installed underground.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the funds has also been invested to upgrade facilities
at Logan Airport, as well as to clean and dredge the harbor waters.
</P>
<P>
   The convention-center site is at a crossroads where all forms of
the upgraded transportation network will intersect. It is within a
few blocks of what will be a rebuilt downtown highway, Interstate
93; a new extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike; a truck haul
road; a rapid transit line; and the Ted Williams Tunnel to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   However, while about $320 million in federal and state funds has
been allocated at the 500-acre commercial port for new terminals,
cranes and computerized truck-cargo processing, its transport
system is still missing a vital link.
</P>
<P>
   Modern ports need double-stack freight rail facilities so cargo
containers can be lifted off ships and loaded two high on freight
trains. In 1995 the state Legislature allocated $86 million to
modernize tracks and raise a few bridges to enable the double-stack
trains to pass underneath, but the funds have never been
appropriated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no more movement on double-stack rail,'' said David
Panagore, who is directing the convention center project for the
city planning agency. But a recent planning agency agreement with
CSX railroad will enable steel for the convention center to be
shipped to the site by rail, to lower construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Given these developments, shippers and truckers worry that they
may lose access to the area in a few years if roads are closed to
commercial traffic to make way for pedestrians, Li added.
Nevertheless, each year the port is generating $10 billion in
revenues and $3 billion in related economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the convention center, financed by $700 million in
state and municipal bonds and taxes, is likely to lose $15 million
annually in its early years while generating $500 million a year in
direct economic activity, according to Alan D. Reid, chief
financial officer of the convention center authority. ``The
convention center is a loss leader to fill the hotels and
restaurants,'' he explained.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The convention center has gone from concept to construction
quickly for a project of its size and complexity. In only three
years, a group of business leaders and politicians shepherded
enabling legislation through the Statehouse and agreed on a site
and a design; the city took the 62 acres by eminent domain; and the
South Boston community settled on a benefits package of about $10
million in housing, training and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The glass, steel and precast concrete convention center,
designed by Rafael Vinoly Architects of New York and HNTB
Architecture of Boston, will have a 600,000-square-foot exhibition
hall, 200,000 square feet of meeting rooms and parking for 1,000
cars in its first phase of 1.9 million square feet. Attached will
be a $265 million, 1,120-room Sheraton Hotel to be developed by
Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc. of White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   While many hotel projects here and across the country have been
stymied by a dearth of financing, Starwood expects that banks will
extend loans and that pension funds will invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a hot hotel market, we're attached to a
state-of-the-art convention center, our site is a mile from the
airport and so much new development is planned for the area,'' said
Andrew E. Zobler, a vice president at Starwood.
</P>
<P>
   Development prospects are bright, Stratouly stressed. After he
completes his unpaid tour of duty for the convention center
authority, even he may invest there. ``At some point, this is going
to be prime property,'' he said. ``I can't develop anything now,
but I hope to in the future.''

JAZZ: EFFECTIVE, ENDURING _ AND ANCIENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In February 1994, Jeff Hornacek boarded a flight for Salt Lake
City to play for his third team in three seasons. Traded from the
foundering Philadelphia 76ers to the veteran and, it seemed,
utopian Utah Jazz, the shooting guard was invigorated about having
a shot to win a National Basketball Association championship.
</P>
<P>
   The hope for Scott Layden, the Jazz general manager at the time,
was that Hornacek would blend in with Karl Malone and John Stockton
_ two original Dream Team members already over 30 _ before Utah's
shelf life as a contender expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the story going around about the trade,'' Hornacek
said last week. ``I got to town and it was: `They're getting
Hornacek to make their last run. This is it!' There was a sense of
desperation, like we had a season or two left, tops.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that, six years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Trudging in with gimpy knees and games from another century,
America's last old-school team plays Madison Square Garden on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz meets the Knicks for an NBC matinee at 12:30 p.m.,
after which most of them will immerse their ankles in ice and
attach electronic stimulators to aching joints and muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a MASH unit,'' said Armen Gilliam, the 35-year-old
journeyman forward. ``We even have a wellness guy that travels with
us. Reflexology. Chiropractic care. You name it, we got it in our
locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   They're as ailing and ancient as they are effective and
enduring.
</P>
<P>
   Utah is running a tight race with the San Antonio Spurs in the
Midwest Division, leading the defending NBA champions by half a
game. The Jazz (37-20) has the fourth-best record in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of Stockton, Malone and friends dispatching Portland,
the Lakers and the Spurs to advance to the finals for the third
time in four years is almost unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   But then, this aging Jazz team has a phenomenal 9-2 record in
the second game of games played on back-to-back nights, and Utah is
all about defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looks at how many years you play,'' Malone said.
``They forget about what you do to slow down Father Time. You can't
beat him. But you can sure slow him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, still a most valuable player candidate, is pushing 37.
Stockton, too stubborn and savvy to be fooled by a crossover
dribble, turns 38 later this month. Along with Hornacek, who will
be 37 in May, they are not only three of the five oldest starters
in the league but among a handful of NBA players born before John
F. Kennedy was assassinated. The average age of the Jazz starting
lineup is 34.4, the oldest in the league. Six Jazz regulars played
college basketball in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a young pup,'' said Olden Polynice, the
35-year-old starting center.
</P>
<P>
   ``My players don't like it when I use the word old, but it's
pretty plain to see we're not a young team anymore,'' said Jerry
Sloan, who has coached the Jazz to two Western Conference titles in
the past three seasons. ``Are we slipping? Some nights I think some
of us believe we can turn it off and turn it on, win games down the
stretch like we used to. That bothers me a little. And our bench
has been up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Sloan added, ``there's something to be said about the
fact they still come to work every day and give everything. I like
the idea of our guys thinking they can still do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah came close two seasons ago, pushing the Chicago Bulls to
six games before being stopped by the most indefatigable player of
all _ Michael Jordan. The Jazz took a step back last season,
falling to the Trail Blazers in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   As the league motored into the 2000s, Utah seemed left behind,
caught in some hoop time warp. Unselfish, comprised of players who
often pass before they shoot, the Jazz barely fits the mold of the
nouveau NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk to fans, they're not interested in back screens,
down screens and pick-and-roll,'' Sloan said. ``They're looking for
guys to get out and start running. Tough, sound, solid basketball
is a hard thing to sell. I understand that. But if you're not
winning with the other stuff, who's going to buy that? It's not
that our guys are boring. They just like to play a certain way: You
pass to me and I'll pass to you.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If its half-court style did not attract ratings, neither did the
perception that the Jazz clutched and grabbed too much, that its
players _ especially the future Hall of Famers _ were dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they have a few little tricks on the court that help them
gain a competitive edge?'' Gilliam asked rhetorically. ``Everybody
in the league does. The difference is, they do it better. I heard a
guy say one time, `If you're not cheating, you're not trying.' That
about sums it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice said: ``It's funny how people hate this team. Now that
I'm playing for them, I find myself asking people: `Why do you hate
them? Because they're good? Because they play hard?' I'm on the
inside, now, and I see what goes into making this team so good.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Charlotte, the Jazz, in the middle of an Eastern
Conference road swing, was given an optional day to practice.
Following the lead of Stockton and Malone, every player either
weight trained or showed up at the arena to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   In his 14-plus seasons, Malone has missed three games because of
injury. Neither he nor Stockton has missed a game this season. The
bench has given Sloan more angst than his veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says we're doing it the old-fashioned way,'' said
Polynice, who has no problem drawing a distinction between the Jazz
and many of the game's younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach has a simple rule that draw strings and shirts be tucked
in for the game,'' he added. ``What's wrong with that? I see all
these guys with headbands now and corn rows. I'm like, `Come on, do
you really know why you're doing that, what that means?' It's not
just black history, it's about guys on other teams having no idea
who Bill Sharman or Oscar Robertson was, how great Bill Russell was
as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping it real. Everybody else is faking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone and Stockton, both workout fanatics, have much to do with
the Jazz remaining contemporary. ``Instead of hanging out and
partying, I like to workout and go home,'' Malone said. ``I really
believe that has prolonged my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Layden, who was hired as general manager of the Knicks this past
summer, is one of the few people not astounded by the Jazz
longevity. Speaking by telephone from France on Thursday, he said
he planned to return home Sunday morning to watch the team he put
together come East for one of its final Garden appearances. He
still refers to the Hornacek acquisition as the best trade he ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people on the periphery were always more concerned about
their age than the group internally,'' he said. ``We'd go into
cities, and the media would have already written our obituaries. I
look at John and Karl today, and you can never count those guys
out. They're too mentally tough. They find ways to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   It bothers Sloan that the Jazz did not knock off the Bulls when
they had opportunities in 1997 and 1998. ``But I'm not obsessed
with it,'' he said. ``Sometimes these guys with a ring on their
fingers go out and pound their chests and then they don't go back
and play each year. These guys play every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd like to have a championship, but the bottom line is
that they walked off the court knowing they've given everything
they had. They know who they are and how hard they play this game.
To me, that's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek has already announced his plans to retire at the end of
this season. Stockton said he planned to play one more season.
Asked if this is indeed Utah's final run, Hornacek said: ``People
are going to say it is until it's finally over. Then those same
people will say, `Look, I told you so.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he added, ``they won't admit they were wrong the
last seven years.'' &QL;

STARKS DESERVING OF FREE AGENCY 
THE VINCE CARTER SHOW 
VAN HORN'S PASSION 
SEIKALY'S SKILL AT ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 BY MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From South Florida to New York last week, pro basketball zealots
were again talking about John Starks. Miami Heat fans were
salivating over the possibility of the team acquiring him for the
playoffs, if for no other reason than to stick it in the Knicks'
faces. Hard-core Knickies were telephoning WFAN Radio, begging to
know if it was true. Was Starks close to wearing orange and blue
again? Conjecture and gossip, always good for the game, abounded.
</P>
<P>
   Forget, for a moment, that Starks' best days are behind him, or
that the Knicks may have been saying they were interested because
it was the politically correct thing to say about a former player
who brought the franchise so many stirring memories. Shelve the
nostalgia and look at Starks for what he is today: 34 years old,
streaky and a step slow.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you take away the public emotion surrounding Starks,
there is still no good reason why Commissioner David Stern cannot
enforce his executive power and declare Starks a free agent, free
to sign with any playoff team he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Starks lost an arbitration hearing on Friday in an attempt to
preserve that right. The Chicago Bulls tried to do the former Knick
shooting guard a favor nearly 10 days ago. Knowing he wanted to
compete for a title and understanding Starks was not going to be
part of their rebuilding plans, the Bulls agreed to void the
remainder of Starks' contract that is worth $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Bulls attempted the move nearly a week before March
1 _ the date a player must be on a team's roster in order to
compete in the playoffs _ the hope for Starks was that he could
latch onto a contender. Starks and the Bulls seemed to be parting
amicably.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the hard-and-fast NBA. Shooting down the deal, the league
forced the matter to be heard by the arbitrator Kenneth Dam. The
players' union argued the league was circumventing an article in
the collective bargaining agreement that allows such a transaction
for a player in the last year of his deal. The league impressed
upon Dam that such a move could be made but only before Jan. 10 _
the last day to release a player before his contract is guaranteed
for the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   On a technicality, the NBA won.
</P>
<P>
   For all 29 teams, ground rules are ground rules. If players and
teams are allowed mutually to terminate contracts with less than
two months left in the regular season, what is to prevent Isaiah
Rider from doing all he can to make the Atlanta Hawks release him
from his deal and be rewarded by getting picked up by a playoff
team?
</P>
<P>
   Any disgruntled player could try to get out of a contract if he
knew his services were required elsewhere. For mercenary-style
reasons, the league did not want to set a dangerous precedent.
Mostly, it did not want to appear as a co-conspirator in funneling
a former Knick to a playoff team of his choice. What would Heat
Coach Pat Riley have said if the Knicks acquired Starks? Dave
Checketts' blood pressure would have shot up if Starks ended up
with Indiana or Miami, two teams with $1.1 million in reserve to
sign Starks for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the NBA could ever get past image and damage-control
concerns, it would see that Starks was neither malicious nor
conniving in his attempt to play for a playoff team. Shipped from
bad team to bad team the past two seasons, he quietly went about
performing his job for the Golden State Warriors and the Bulls
until he realized he would not be moved at the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Reinsdorf's frugal ways had a hand in Starks' fate. Starks
could have been a free agent had the Bulls chairman picked up the
tab for his contract instead of trying to negate it. Less than two
years after the Bulls won their sixth title of the 1990s, they have
another unhappy player on a last-place team.
</P>
<P>
   Starks is considering an appeal to a grievance arbitrator, but
that may take a week.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Stern could make an exception. He could look beyond
the legalese, beyond the unclear language in the collective
bargaining agreement and give Starks what he deserves after 10
years of exemplary service, what anyone who went from a grocery
checkout line to an NBA layup line deserves: one final chance to
play in front of a crowd that genuinely cares.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Stern's wisdom and sentimentality will prevail. Maybe the
omnipotent commissioner will see that few players have ever
exhibited the same heart and soul of John Starks, and maybe Stern
will exhibit some of his own in declaring Starks a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long shot. But then, so was the chance of Starks playing
in Stern's league.
</P>
<P>
   The Vince Carter Show
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off Vince Carter's 51-point detonation against Phoenix
last Sunday, NBC is tearing up the schedule. The network has added
two regional games featuring the Toronto Raptors and their
acrobatic forward. NBC will televise a March 12 game between
Seattle and Toronto and also the Raptors' game against Indiana on
April 2. In network promo language, that's Vince vs. Gary Payton
and Vince vs. Reggie Miller.

   Van Horn's Passion
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but the left-for-dead Nets are four games out of
the Eastern Conference's final playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   After victories at Denver and Dallas last week, New Jersey crept
up on Milwaukee. Stephon Marbury's determination and resilience are
the biggest reasons for their climb, but not enough can be said
about Keith Van Horn when he plays with passion. He hit the
game-winner over Dennis Rodman against Dallas on Thursday, pumping
his fist and rejoicing with his teammates. When he's not passive,
Van Horn is a completely different player from the slumping one
questioning his place in the league. He still may not be a bona
fide power forward, but he has the tools to be one of the NBA's
most complete players.
</P>
<P>
   Seikaly's Skill at Issue
</P>
<P>
   The Rony Seikaly arbitration case gets under way Tuesday. In
order to avoid paying Seikaly, the Nets are going to have to show
the reason they terminated Seikaly last year was essentially
because of his lack of skill. Considering the Nets' desperate
straits at the center position, an arbitrator may find that hard to
believe.

THE TIMES ENDORSES MCCAIN AND GORE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The editorial page of The New York Times on Sunday endorsed Sen.
John McCain and Vice President Al Gore in Tuesday's Republican and
Democratic presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their very different ways,'' the editorial said, ``each of
these two men communicates a greater capacity for overarching
presidential leadership than his opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times, noting that it does not always offer primary
endorsements and last did so in 1992, had praise for Gov. George W.
Bush and former Sen. Bill Bradley, but said their opponents were
preferable.
</P>
<P>
   Newsday yesterday also endorsed McCain and Gore. The newspaper,
which circulates on Long Island and in Queens, called McCain a
``genuine American hero'' who has ``exhibited a trait that has been
sorely missed in our politics: character.'' It cited Gore's
experience and said Democrats had found him ``willing, even eager,
to stretch himself to win the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News last week endorsed Gore, calling him ``the
candidate who has a firm command of all the issues and is best
prepared to take on the Republican challenger.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post last week endorsed McCain, saying he
``represents the nation's best hope for the future.'' It added,
``Not since Ronald Reagan has a leader so resonated with the
American public.''

FLY-FISHING AFICIONADO DISCOVERS OTHER PLEASURES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the dead of winter, snow belt anglers are prone to review
what they learned when leaves were still aloft and their quarry was
both present and cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   My own ruminations on the 1999 season reminded me that I had
gotten into a fly-fishing rut. Last October, I clambered out of
that rut and rediscovered the pleasures of one-handed bait casting
rods and revolving spool reels, a confession that will disturb
fly-fishing aficionados. Let them wince. It's possible _ given the
weird impulses of advancing years _ that I may revert to boyhood
and once again go after trout with earthworms.
</P>
<P>
   The striped bass of Tisbury Great Pond on Martha's Vineyard
Island were responsible for my leaving my fly rod in the woodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, northward-migrating stripers moved into the pond
from the ocean via a man-made opening that is created two or three
times a year. In months or weeks, onshore storms or winds close
that cut and the pond is reopened, one of the purposes of this
being to keep the salinity high enough for its oysters to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Striped bass in Tisbury Great Pond are nothing unusual. Year
after year, they come in from the ocean in April or May and some
stick around all winter. What was different in 1999 was the numbers
of them: thousands of fish that could often be seen feeding on the
surface in swaths 100 yards wide and half a mile long.
</P>
<P>
   Early in summer of 1999, the bellies of the few legal-sized fish
_ 28 inches _ that I took from the pond were crammed with blue claw
crabs, plus an occasional sand eel or silverside minnow. By
October, young menhaden, having also entered the pond via the
opening, were their main forage.
</P>
<P>
   The pond remained closed during most of summer. I thought most
of the bass would depart offshore and south when a new cut was
made. I was wrong. The pond was opened in early fall but closed
again in about two weeks, and, as far as I could judge, most of the
bass remained in the shallow, brackish water gorging on menhaden.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, I went after those stripers with a fly rod. I had
first fished for the species with a fly rod right after World War
II, and more than two decades ago began to use that approach almost
exclusively. I am not sure why that happened. I don't feel that
fly-fishing is a superior way to angle; I simply favor that
approach. Perhaps it's the minimal amount of gear one has to carry
in addition to rod and reel: a book of flies and some leader
material. I also enjoy the rhythm of fly casting, particularly when
I am wading, when the wind is coming from the right direction, when
the fly is small and when there is plenty of room for a backcast.
</P>
<P>
   On my first visits to the pond in the summer of 1999, I had good
luck fishing from shore along the inside edge of the barrier beach.
After that, the bass usually were far out in the pond and I had to
pursue them from one of my canoes.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, I kept a big, old 20-foot aluminum Grumman canoe
at my home on the Vineyard and had no qualms about stand-up
fly-fishing from it. It now rests in the eternal shadows of spruces
at my family's wilderness lodge in Maine. Both of the canoes I have
at home are smaller and less stable.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to do a good job of fly-fishing for Tisbury Great Pond's
stripers from one of those smaller canoes left me seething with
frustration. The seacoast is rarely without wind, the fly
fisherman's nemesis. You can make adjustments for the wind if you
are wading, but doing the same from a sitting position in a small
canoe is often impossible.
</P>
<P>
   After several such excursions I decided to try something that
would work in half a gale. Defying my addiction to fly-fishing, I
plucked a long-idle one-handed bait casting outfit from the
rafters, found a few surface-swimming plugs _ the bait casting
equivalent of the dry fly _ for it, and sallied forth.
</P>
<P>
   So armed, I caught more bass and more big bass. I soon found out
that an old Smithwick Devil's Horse, a classic surface swimmer with
propellers mounted fore and aft, was effective, but it, designed
for fresh water fishing, couldn't take the punishment. Its hooks
were either torn off or straightened out after a few good-sized
fish. I switched to a fresh water Heddon Zara Spook, and it
suffered the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to Cooper Gilkes' tackle shop in nearby Edgartown turned
up a few Rebel Jumpin' Minnows _ salt water plugs with a surface
action much like that of the Zara Spook. They, with their heavier
hooks and superior hook linkage to the plug, proved to be what I
needed when the bass were chasing menhaden.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon in late October was one of my best days of the 1999
season on the pond. Pushed by a stiff southwest wind, the surf
moaned on the outer beach a half mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of gulls were wheeling over the center of the pond.
Drifting down among the gulls, I raised a bass on my first cast. It
wasn't hooked, but it knocked my plug four feet into the air. I was
fast to a 30-inch fish on the next cast, and that was the way it
went until sundown when I quit.
</P>
<P>
   Bass _ some that I failed to hook were in the 30-pound class _
slashed at the plug right up to the canoe and often what appeared
to be the same fish would make four or five passes on a single
cast. Intoxicated by the frenzied activity about me, I frantically
hooked and released stripers for the better part of two hours until
the sun's descent behind a dark, ragged cloud brought me to my
senses. I'd caught enough fish.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped casting and _ drifting across the darkening salt pond
through schools of breaking bass and fleeing menhaden _ reflected
that there clearly were times when a fly rod should be left at
home. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON TO JOIN OTHERS SUNDAY IN RE-ENACTING SELMA MARCH
 &HT;    550 &AMP; ADD
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (a) national

<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ In 1965, a young black man named John Lewis
was severely beaten by white state troopers who attacked more than
600 nonviolent civil rights marchers trying to cross Selma's Edmund
Pettus Bridge on their way to the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 35 years later, U.S. Rep. John Lewis will be joined
by President Clinton, former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young and a
bipartisan group of 30 members of Congress and other luminaries who
will cross the bridge again in the Third Annual Congressional Civil
Rights Pilgrimage .
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Alabama state troopers will act as
supportive escorts. And a racially mixed crowd of onlookers is
expected to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the president of the United States and some of my
colleagues from Congress walking across that bridge with me is the
impossible dream, the unthinkable,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat serving his seventh term in Congress,
has often returned to commemorate the ``Bloody Sunday'' attack. The
troopers used tear gas, bull whips and billy clubs to turn back the
unarmed marchers who were protesting poll taxes, literacy tests and
other tactics aimed at intimidating black voters.
</P>
<P>
   The vicious beatings, shown on national television, appalled and
galvanized much of America. Within months, Congress had passed the
1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing the poll tax and requiring that
Americans, regardless of race, be permitted to freely cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, only 2 percent of voting-age blacks were registered to
vote in Dallas County, where Selma is located. Today, nearly 60
percent are registered.
</P>
<P>
   This year's re-enactment, with the worldwide media attention
generated by Clinton's participation, is a special pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   It started Friday evening with a tour of the Civil Rights
Institute here in Birmingham. Saturday's events began with a tour
of the Kelly Ingram Park, which is dedicated to those who died in
the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   The participants then visited the 16th Street Baptist Church,
the city's first black church, where four young girls were killed
in the fall of 1963 when it was bombed by white segregationists.
</P>
<P>
   The group also made a 90-minute trip to Montgomery and toured
the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, once headed by Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. His widow, Coretta Scott King, briefly reflected on the
life of the slain civil rights leader. His, Martin Luther King III,
was in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Congress found the experience moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``My presence here is to honor all those who we've heard of and
those whose names I don't know,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee,
D-Texas, an African American. ``Because of them I am educated, I am
an elected official and I am a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the pilgrimage will serve as an important tool for
each participating member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old lawmaker said it can educate and sensitize
people his colleagues to the problems of race and ``just maybe all
of us can go back to our districts, our own states and get people
discussing race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a great deal to recognize those who made it possible,
but it can't continue if we don't pass it on to the youth,'' agreed
Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio.

</P>
<P>
   Lewis remembers his ``Bloody Sunday'' march across the Edmund
Pettus Bridge ``like it was yesterday.'' There was a cool breeze
blowing that Sunday afternoon, on March 7. Lewis wore a beige coat.
In his back pack he carried two books, an apple, an orange and a
toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to be arrested and be sent to jail,''
said Lewis, who already had been arrested 40 times while pushing
for civil rights. ``So I wanted to have something to eat, something
to read. And since I was going to be in close quarters with my
friends and neighbors and colleagues, I wanted to be able to brush
my teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators first saw the sea of state troopers when the
marchers got to the crest of the bridge Although Lewis expected to
be arrested, ``something didn't seem right this time,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell because if they were going to arrest us, they had
no way to take us to jail, no wagons, transporters, nothing,''
Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no turning back. After all, the civil rights
activists had already trekked 54 miles from Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The state troopers ordered them to disperse. But the marchers
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 100 armed troopers began to push the marchers, who
resisted. The troopers reacted with force.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and others were sprayed with tear gas, trampled by police
horses and beaten with billy clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some ran back. But others, including Lewis, were severely
injured. He suffered a fractured skull. Lewis doesn't remember how
he got to a hospital, but feels very fortunate to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to die. I think on that day I saw
death,'' he said. ``So when I go back (Sunday), I will feel very
blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   The state troopers' actions angered many people, who watched the
assault on television. Even Alabama's segregationist Gov. George
Wallace reprimanded the troopers for their actions. President
Johnson also condemn the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bloodshed and struggles of the civil rights
movement, people today don't exercise their voting rights, Lewis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me very sad, it troubles me a great deal when so many
people do not understand the significance of what Selma was all
about,'' he said. ``It makes me sad when we don't go out and vote
when people died for that right. And that's why I think during an
election year all Americans, not just blacks, should get out and
register and vote like they never voted before. It's a precious
right. People sacrificed, people died, people gave a little
blood.''

   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain campaigned in northeastern states Saturday, with Bush
knocking McCain's record on education and McCain attacking radio
ads bought by Bush supporters in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates had their eye on Tuesday's Republican primaries
in 13 states including California, New York, Ohio and four New
England states. A total of 613 of the 1,034 delegates needed to
secure the GOP presidential nomination is at stake Tuesday _ the
largest delegate treasure yet in the hard fought battle for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, polls show the race tightening to a dead heat.
Among Republicans, a poll Friday by the Marist Institute of Public
Opinion showed Bush ahead of McCain by 45 percent to 42 percent.
Last Wednesday, the same poll showed McCain ahead of Bush 47
percent to 43 percent among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate selection in the New York and California primaries is
limited to registered Republican voters.
</P>

   Other polls showed Bush widening his lead by small amounts in
California, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri and Ohio while McCain was
ahead of Bush in the New England states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning across upstate New York and into Connecticut,
participated in an early St. Patrick's Day parade in Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also launched a new radio commercial citing the Republican
debate in Los Angeles last week, where McCain referred to his
service on the House Education Committee 15 years ago as one of his
accomplishments in the education field during his 18 years in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ad cites the news account of the debate as reporting that
McCain gave a `vague, unfocused answer'' to a question about
education. `If John McCain has never made education a priority as
Senator, why would he as president?'' the ad asked.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Rochester, Bush highlighted his own
record on education in Texas and contrasted it to McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush pushed for higher educational standards,
accountability for schools where children do not achieve and
against promoting children to the next grade regardless of the
achievement level.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his criticism of McCain was fair in light of
McCain's service as a federal legislator and Bush's own view that
Washington should stay out of local and state education policy,
Bush said: `The senator's running for president. The man ought to
have a vision for the future. He ought to be able to articulate
ideas he's not running for legislator, he's running to be chief
executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stumped through New York with an entourage that included
Gov. George Pataki and former former American Red Cross President
Elizabeth Dole, herself a former presidential candidate and an icon
among Republican women.
</P>
<P>
   At a Rochester rally, Dole told the crowd of over 2,000 that the
`gender gap'' _ shorthand for the fact that women overwhelmingly
voted for President Clinton in the last election _ would come out
in Bush's favor this year.
</P>
<P>
   `That old gender gap in America is going to swing itself inside
out,'' Dole predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Hartford, Conn., New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman, who favors abortion rights, became the 29th Republican
governor to endorse Bush. There are 31 GOP governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share a conservative Republican philosophy that transcends
litmus tests and invites everyone to join us to make America the
greatest and strongest nation on earth,'' she told a Bush rally.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, speaking at LeMoyne University in Syracuse, N.Y., told
supporters: ``I'm the only person who can beat Al Gore in the
general election. George Bush, in a debate with him, will have
nothing to say because he's doing the same things,'' referring to
controversial fundraising practices that he said both Bush and Gore
indulge.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, McCain, campaigning in Portland, Maine, and Boston,
cited the $2.5 million in broadcast ads that Bush allies purchased
for weekend airing and urged New Englanders to reject an effort
``to hijack an election.'' The ad being broadcast in New York,
Vermont, Ohio and California was paid for by a newly formed
advocacy organization, Republicans for Clean Air.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly, a Dallas entrepreneur and co-owner of two software
firms that recently sold for $7.9 billion, said he bought the
advertising blitz to draw distinctions between Bush and McCain on
environmental regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly's brother, Charles, also is a top fundraiser for Bush's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain decried the ``attack ad'' as one of the ``worst
examples'' of the need for the federal campaign finance reform and
ban on undisclosed, unlimited soft money campaign contributions
that he advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law limits the amount of money that an individual can
contribute to a political candidate. But there are no limits to the
amount of money that an individual or a corporation or a union can
spend to talk about issues. This so-called ``soft money'' is the
target of McCain and other political reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of sudden there's a proliferation of attack ads, of $2.5
million worth, in the last few days of this campaign, all over
America,'' McCain warned.
</P>
<P>
   Labeling the blitz ``a disgrace'' and ``shameful,'' McCain
added: ``I'm asking you to see through these cronies of George
Bush's that are perverting the political process with this $2.5
million in ads, see through it and reject that, reject that kind of
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Boston's Copley Square, McCain raised the issue by
quoting Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know if I might borrow the words of Bob Dole and
(say): ``Where's the outrage? Where's the outrage?'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing off the crowd's reaction, McCain asked: ``Are we going
to allow two Texan cronies of George W. Bush to hijack an
election?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' roared the crowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them to keep their dirty money in the state of Texas, my
friends,'' McCain continued. ``Don't spread it all over New England
and America.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd took it from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No new Texans; no new Texans,'' chanted the audience, much to
the delight of McCain and his wife Cindy, standing on a stage
surrounded by a sea of waving placards, small swaying American
flags and shouts, of ``Give 'em hell, John,'' and ``Don't give up
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted the Wyly ads were not connected to his campaign
and that he had no control over their content. Bush said he too had
been tarred by ads of the Sierra Club which he said `polluted my
record.''
</P>
<P>
   `In politics people have the right to freedom of speech, the
right to spend money the way they see fit,'' Bush said. `There's no
coordination'' with his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wife Cindy left her husband's campaign to make
appearances on his behalf in Rhode Island and Vermont.

<P>
   The brushfire over Sen. John McCain's use of the anti-Asian slur
``gooks'' flared and faded within a few days late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized for describing his North Vietnamese captors with the
racial epithet, McCain at first defended its use as justified when
applied to his jailers (though not other Asians), given the abuse
he and his fellow prisoners had suffered at their hands. On Feb.
18, however, perhaps with an eye to the California primary on
Tuesday, the Arizona Republican apologized and pledged never to
utter the word again.
</P>
<P>
   End of story. Indeed, voters got to hear or read little about
the episode. Some say that's only because by and large the media as
well as McCain have a tin ear when it comes to Asian-Americans and
their sensitivities. For it turned out that McCain had used the
slur repeatedly over several months while regaling reporters on his
campaign bus with harrowing recollections of his prisoner-of-war
days. And few had reported the fact.
</P>
<P>
   (The New York Times first reported his use of the slur at the
end of a news article on the presidential campaign on Feb. 18, and
noted his apology in a one-paragraph item on Feb. 25.)
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans were left to wonder, if only among themselves:
Would McCain have gotten more adverse publicity if he had uttered a
slur against blacks or Hispanics? The following excerpts, primarily
from Internet and e-mail forums directed at Asian Americans,
capture this and other sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ANTHONY RAMIREZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The issue got the attention of
Asian-Americans in e-mail forums after an article in the Jan. 3
issue of The Nation, the liberal weekly, began circulating via
e-mail about a month ago. It said in part: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking example of the media's unwillingness
to challenge McCain's air of moral authority is when he shocks
listeners by casually calling the Vietnamese ``gooks.'' The racist
and disparaging term, popularized by GIs during the war, occurs
repeatedly in a 1973 U.S. News &AMP; World Report account penned by
McCain after his release from prison. ``The `gooks' were bombarding
us with anti-war quotes from people in high places back in
Washington,'' he wrote, referring to the propaganda that his
captors gave him. A quarter of a century later, while speaking with
reporters aboard the Straight Talk Express in October, McCain was
still calling Vietnamese ``gooks'' _ and according to a reporter
who was there, no one called him on it. It's enough to make you
wonder whether the reporters were thinking: Well, this guy spent
five years in a prison camp, so he can say anything he wants.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In the Internet forum
``soc.culture.vietnamese,'' one participant responded bluntly: (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Just a thought, but if McCain had been caught by Africans while
fighting in Somalia, would he feel as comfortable calling his
torturers ``niggers'' as he does using the word ``gook''? If his
torturers had been Iraqi, would he use the word ``sand nigger''
with such conviction? Or had he been a human rights worker tortured
in Guatemala, would he call his captors ``spics''? Seems to me the
real issue isn't McCain's racial beliefs, but the fact that
Asian-Americans as a voting group aren't formidable enough to make
McCain wary of offending them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Jocelyn Dong offered similar criticism
(before the McCain apology) in an e-mail forum aimed at
Asian-American journalists: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   John McCain would do well to rethink this case of ``straight
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The English language is rife with words to express a former
POW's feelings towards the men who tortured him: barbarians,
sadists, savages and other epithets far more choice.
</P>
<P>
   But the slur he's sticking to is the racial one. Not one that
zeroes in on the unconscionable cruelty of his enemies, but one
that expresses hatred of ``differentness'' _ skin color, facial
features, culture.
</P>
<P>
   As a presidential candidate, McCain should take a broader view
of his remark by realizing how harmful it is to use  &UR; any &LR;  racially
derogatory term, in any context. Straight talk sometimes needs to
be revised. It probably wouldn't be personally easy for him, but he
could set a moral example by apologizing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But in the same forum, Stanton Tang was
willing to cut the senator some slack: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Having been raised in Arizona and having followed the senator's
career fairly closely, I cannot recall any instance of McCain
showing racial prejudice. I prefer to judge him, not on one
instance, but on his actions. If the term was used in context of
those individuals who tortured him for five years in a prisoner of
war camp, it may not be palatable to us, but that does not mean it
is not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I also am against political correctness for a very
simple reason. Would you prefer to know who holds racist views and
agendas openly, or would you prefer that they carry such biases in
secret?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, such terms offend me. However, if that person expresses
their views, then the public can judge for itself (and perhaps
condemn as well) those prejudicial views.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Vera Chan was also sympathetic to the
senator: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think we younger Americans who haven't lived through
a major war or significant civil unrest just can't fathom and
therefore understand how dehumanizing war is. . . . After all, how
many, say, Korean- or Chinese-Americans have parents or
grandparents who continue to condemn all Japanese because of their
wartime experiences?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) McCain gets further support in a letter to
the editor of the San Francisco Chronicle from Frank Koucky, a
reader: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Those who attack McCain (who defended an Asian nation with his
life) should go read ``When Hell Was in Session'' ((by a former
American prisoner of North Vietnam)) and learn a little about what
he went through before they open their mouths. To attack McCain for
speaking badly of his friends' murderers is as foolish as attacking
Jews for speaking badly of SS death camp guards.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) But in the Internet forum
``soc.culture.asian.american,'' another presumably Asian-American
participant put forth no doubt a widely held view: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that his torturers are ((expletive)) who deserve
to be cursed. But the fact that he chooses to use a racial slur, in
a public forum, and as a presidential candidate. . . . indicates
that he is more ignorant about the issues than someone in his
position should be. Although the term is meant for his torturers
only, the fact that it is race-based will naturally impute all
members of the Vietnamese ethnicity. And of course, it will
concurrently be imputed to all A-As _ since, you know, they can't
tell us apart anyway.

   (NYT27) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- CAMPAIGN-RDP-2 --
Massachusetts is among 13 states holding primaries on Tuesday, and
Vice President Al Gore feels confident about his prospects against
former Sen. Bill Bradley. Bradley campaigned in the Bronx at the
Bay Plaza mall Saturday; his wife, Ernestine, gave him a kiss as he
finished his handshaking duties. (Nicole Bengiveno/The New York

   (NYT26) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- BKN-EWING -- Patrick Ewing
might be the most important player in franchise history. Almost
single-handedly, he has kept the team competitive from one year to

Ewing reacted after missing a shot during a game against the
Charlotte Hornets in December. (Barton Silverman/The New York

   (NYT25) TAMPA, Fla. -- March 4, 2000 -- BBA-ARATON-COLUMN --
Though Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte's father, Tommy, is only 50,
he nonetheless gazes in the mirror and demands an explanation for
what his body in recent years has put him through: Three years ago,
doctors removed two feet of his colon; the following year, they
unclogged the main artery to his heart. Pettitte watched his son at
spring training Friday afternoon in Tampa. (Barton Silverman/The

   (NYT24) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- BBO-ANDERSON-COLUMN -- Last
Tuesday Gil Hodges' candidacy for the Baseball Hall of Fame died,
at least for another year. Again. Some friends even sent his widow,
Joan Hodges, flowers, as if in mourning. But the campaign won't
die. ``I need an explanation,'' said Mrs. Hodges, standing by a
portrait of her husband, Gil, in the same house in which she has
lived since his playing days with the Brooklyn Dodgers. ``Ever
since Tuesday, I've had people come up and kiss me like he just
died.'' (G. Paul Burnett/The New York Times)

Orlando Hernandez's stuff is quite ordinary, in its raw form - a
fastball of 88 to 90 miles an hour, a nice little curve, a
wide-breaking slider. But the Yankees pitcher knows how to throw
and how to win. (Barton Silverman/The New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT22) TAMPA, Fla. -- March 4, 2000 -- BBA-YANKS-HERNANDEZ-1 --
The drills that Orlando Hernandez, the Yankees pitcher, does are a
mystery to the other Yankees. In one routine, he stands on his
head, swinging his legs back and forth, as a form of yoga,
something he learned 10 years ago in Cuba. (Gary I. Rothstein/The

<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest buzzphrase circulating among politicians and computer
industry executives these days is the digital divide, the gulf
between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who do not. Poor people and minorities, or so the thinking
goes, are in danger of being shut out of what promises to be the
most important mode of gathering and exchanging information, and
what is emerging as a common way of making and spending lots of
money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, there is a growing recognition among those
dealing most closely with the issue that the term digital divide,
while clever and provocative, has become a catchall phrase for
politicians with conspicuous agendas and that the divide is a
complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement can fully explain.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, it seems that the nation is actually facing a
multitude of digital divides, not one limited to race or income or
education. While it is true that millions of people are still
without access to computers or the Internet, those who are counted
as connected fall along a spectrum: Some are dialing into the
Internet through antiquated rural phone lines that cannot handle
high data speeds, while others use ultra high-speed connections
from both work and home. Millions of others are getting their
connection only occasionally from public libraries, classrooms or
community centers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was a busy time for those in the digital
bridge-building business. First, Vice President Al Gore visited a
San Francisco nonprofit group to deliver a speech on the divide.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, the Rev. Jesse Jackson opened a branch of his
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Silicon Valley, with the goal of closing
the divide among the poor. The same day, Jackson delivered a speech
at the University of California at Berkeley in which he pronounced
access to technology ``the newest stage of the civil rights
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, results of a survey conducted by National Public
Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government corroborated earlier studies that
found that at higher income levels there is virtually no racial
gap. More good news: Of those who bought computers in the last two
years, about one-third are from low-income or minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the survey found a persistent racial divide among
low-income households when it comes to computer ownership and
Internet access at home.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings may not spell out the problem as much as help
reveal its thorniness. It helps to start by looking at the ways in
which people connect to the Internet. Plenty of people have
connections at work, but some of them are not wired at home. In
addition, connecting to the Internet from work, a library or school
is quite different from connecting from the privacy of one's living
room. Experts say that the only way to fully appreciate the Web is
to experience it and that the most useful experience, unfettered by
the constraints of an institutional setting, comes with using the
Internet from home.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a high-speed cable modem connection gives a
Web surfer a far different view of cyberspace _ one that's
lightning quick and rich with sound and motion _ than that seen via
a slower link from a traditional modem.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, much of the digital bridge-building has focused on
schools. At first blush, the gap there doesn't seem especially
alarming. According to Market Data Retrieval, a company that has
surveyed the nation's public schools, 94 percent of schools in
wealthy districts have access to the Internet, compared with 84
percent of schools that serve poor populations.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures are deceptive. ``Those numbers fail to address
the nature of those connections,'' David Gollaher, chief executive
of the California Healthcare Institute, a nonprofit group in La
Jolla, Calif., told a group of health care experts who gathered
last week at Berkeley to discuss the digital divide and e-health
(industry shorthand for the delivery of health information and
services on the Internet).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the poorer schools, Gollaher said, connect to the
Internet using a relatively slow 56 kilobit-per-second connection,
which may be fine for sending e-mail but prevents a large
population of potential users from experiencing the full scope and
power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gollaher later said it was not until he got a high-speed
connection at his home that his own children grew interested in the
Web. ``They download a lot of music, and they listen to radio
stations online,'' he said. ``Many of the uses they prefer are uses
that depend on high-speed connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have claimed in recent weeks that the digital
divide is actually a myth, that income at all levels might play a
greater role than race in disparities between the digital haves and
have-nots, though the two are often connected.
</P>
<P>
   The NPR survey disproved that claim with a finding that among
households of all income levels, 57 percent of whites under the age
of 60 have Internet or e-mail access from home, compared with 38
percent of blacks. In households where income is less than $30,000
a year, the study found, 34 percent of whites have access from
home, compared with 19 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-DIGITAL-DIVIDE-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: of blacks. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That divide narrows drastically when online access takes place
outside the home, especially in the workplace. ``The gap largely
disappears everywhere except at home,'' said Molly Brodie, a vice
president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who oversaw the NPR
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you start to look a little deeper, you see that the
biggest problem is at home,'' said Donna L. Hoffman, a professor of
management at Vanderbilt University and the co-author of a 1998
study with results similar to those in the NPR survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can understand what it can do for you
unless you use it,'' she said of the Internet. ``You have to try
it, then you can see the meaning it can have in your own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting to the Internet from outside the home makes having
such an experience more difficult, she said. ``I just think it's
very hard to do that when you have a 30-minute limit, or when you
have to wait in line, or with others around.''
</P>
<P>
   David Greenbaum, a researcher at Berkeley who works with
community groups in Oakland to address the digital divide, suspects
that the problem of access from home might be one of cause and
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One premise that underlies all of this is that if someone had
the right kind of access at home, they'd be much more involved in
the whole wired and online world,'' Greenbaum said. ``But if they
already had the impulse and interest to be part of that world, then
they'd have the kind of motivation to have a machine at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the NPR survey found no significant difference
between whites and blacks at low-income levels when it came to
owning other home electronics, like cable television and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum said that at a recent digital divide conference in
Oakland, a number of people asked: ``Why is it people are willing
to spend $500 on a big wide-screen TV? How can we instill that same
kind of economic pull to a desire to being online?''

<P>
   The latest buzzphrase circulating among politicians and computer
industry executives these days is the digital divide, the gulf
between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who do not. Poor people and minorities, or so the thinking
goes, are in danger of being shut out of what promises to be the
most important mode of gathering and exchanging information, and
what is emerging as a common way of making and spending lots of
money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, there is a growing recognition among those
dealing most closely with the issue that the term digital divide,
while clever and provocative, has become a catchall phrase for
politicians with conspicuous agendas and that the divide is a
complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement can fully explain.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, it seems that the nation is actually facing a
multitude of digital divides, not one limited to race or income or
education. While it is true that millions of people are still
without access to computers or the Internet, those who are counted
as connected fall along a spectrum: Some are dialing into the
Internet through antiquated rural phone lines that cannot handle
high data speeds, while others use ultra high-speed connections
from both work and home. Millions of others are getting their
connection only occasionally from public libraries, classrooms or
community centers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was a busy time for those in the digital
bridge-building business. First, Vice President Al Gore visited a
San Francisco nonprofit group to deliver a speech on the divide.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, the Rev. Jesse Jackson opened a branch of his
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Silicon Valley, with the goal of closing
the divide among the poor. The same day, Jackson delivered a speech
at the University of California at Berkeley in which he pronounced
access to technology ``the newest stage of the civil rights
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, results of a survey conducted by National Public
Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government corroborated earlier studies that
found that at higher income levels there is virtually no racial
gap. More good news: Of those who bought computers in the last two
years, about one-third are from low-income or minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the survey found a persistent racial divide among
low-income households when it comes to computer ownership and
Internet access at home.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings may not spell out the problem as much as help
reveal its thorniness. It helps to start by looking at the ways in
which people connect to the Internet. Plenty of people have
connections at work, but some of them are not wired at home. In
addition, connecting to the Internet from work, a library or school
is quite different from connecting from the privacy of one's living
room. Experts say that the only way to fully appreciate the Web is
to experience it and that the most useful experience, unfettered by
the constraints of an institutional setting, comes with using the
Internet from home.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a high-speed cable modem connection gives a
Web surfer a far different view of cyberspace _ one that's
lightning quick and rich with sound and motion _ than that seen via
a slower link from a traditional modem.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, much of the digital bridge-building has focused on
schools. At first blush, the gap there doesn't seem especially
alarming. According to Market Data Retrieval, a company that has
surveyed the nation's public schools, 94 percent of schools in
wealthy districts have access to the Internet, compared with 84
percent of schools that serve poor populations.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures are deceptive. ``Those numbers fail to address
the nature of those connections,'' David Gollaher, chief executive
of the California Healthcare Institute, a nonprofit group in La
Jolla, Calif., told a group of health care experts who gathered
last week at Berkeley to discuss the digital divide and e-health
(industry shorthand for the delivery of health information and
services on the Internet).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the poorer schools, Gollaher said, connect to the
Internet using a relatively slow 56 kilobit-per-second connection,
which may be fine for sending e-mail but prevents a large
population of potential users from experiencing the full scope and
power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gollaher later said it was not until he got a high-speed
connection at his home that his own children grew interested in the
Web. ``They download a lot of music, and they listen to radio
stations online,'' he said. ``Many of the uses they prefer are uses
that depend on high-speed connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have claimed in recent weeks that the digital
divide is actually a myth, that income at all levels might play a
greater role than race in disparities between the digital haves and
have-nots, though the two are often connected.
</P>
<P>
   The NPR survey disproved that claim with a finding that among
households of all income levels, 57 percent of whites under the age
of 60 have Internet or e-mail access from home, compared with 38
percent of blacks. In households where income is less than $30,000
a year, the study found, 34 percent of whites have access from
home, compared with 19 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-DIGITAL-DIVIDE-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: of blacks. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That divide narrows drastically when online access takes place
outside the home, especially in the workplace. ``The gap largely
disappears everywhere except at home,'' said Molly Brodie, a vice
president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who oversaw the NPR
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you start to look a little deeper, you see that the
biggest problem is at home,'' said Donna L. Hoffman, a professor of
management at Vanderbilt University and the co-author of a 1998
study with results similar to those in the NPR survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can understand what it can do for you
unless you use it,'' she said of the Internet. ``You have to try
it, then you can see the meaning it can have in your own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting to the Internet from outside the home makes having
such an experience more difficult, she said. ``I just think it's
very hard to do that when you have a 30-minute limit, or when you
have to wait in line, or with others around.''
</P>
<P>
   David Greenbaum, a researcher at Berkeley who works with
community groups in Oakland to address the digital divide, suspects
that the problem of access from home might be one of cause and
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One premise that underlies all of this is that if someone had
the right kind of access at home, they'd be much more involved in
the whole wired and online world,'' Greenbaum said. ``But if they
already had the impulse and interest to be part of that world, then
they'd have the kind of motivation to have a machine at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the NPR survey found no significant difference
between whites and blacks at low-income levels when it came to
owning other home electronics, like cable television and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum said that at a recent digital divide conference in
Oakland, a number of people asked: ``Why is it people are willing
to spend $500 on a big wide-screen TV? How can we instill that same
kind of economic pull to a desire to being online?''

Though Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte's father, Tommy, is only 50,
he nonetheless gazes in the mirror and demands an explanation for
what his body in recent years has put him through: Three years ago,
doctors removed two feet of his colon; the following year, they
unclogged the main artery to his heart. Pettitte watched his son at
spring training Friday afternoon in Tampa. (Barton Silverman/The

   (NYT24) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- BBO-ANDERSON-COLUMN -- Last
Tuesday Gil Hodges' candidacy for the Baseball Hall of Fame died,
at least for another year. Again. Some friends even sent his widow,
Joan Hodges, flowers, as if in mourning. But the campaign won't
die. ``I need an explanation,'' said Mrs. Hodges, standing by a
portrait of her husband, Gil, in the same house in which she has
lived since his playing days with the Brooklyn Dodgers. ``Ever

Jude Mignon, an owner of a barber shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn,
said a police presence has been good for business. But at night, he

officers who seem more like a rude gang. ``I don't hate all cops.
But some have too much power.'' (Edward Keating/The New York Times)

EPISCOPALIAN-RIFT -- The Rev. Charles H. Murphy III, of All Saints
Episcopal Church, was consecrated a bishop by the head of the
Anglican Province of Rwanda. The ceremony vividly showed an unusual
alliance that has developed between conservative Episcopalians in
the United States and the like-minded heads of some Anglican
churches overseas, who share a perception that the Episcopal Church
has come to rely less on Scripture than on ideas from secular
American culture, especially on issues of human sexuality. (Wade

   (NYT27) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- CAMPAIGN-RDP-2 --
Massachusetts is among 13 states holding primaries on Tuesday, and
Vice President Al Gore feels confident about his prospects against
former Sen. Bill Bradley. Bradley campaigned in the Bronx at the
Bay Plaza mall Saturday; his wife, Ernestine, gave him a kiss as he
finished his handshaking duties. (Nicole Bengiveno/The New York

   (NYT26) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- BKN-EWING -- Patrick Ewing
might be the most important player in franchise history. Almost
single-handedly, he has kept the team competitive from one year to
the next, as the players - and coaches - around him have changed.
Ewing reacted after missing a shot during a game against the
Charlotte Hornets in December. (Barton Silverman/The New York

   (NYT25) TAMPA, Fla. -- March 4, 2000 -- BBA-ARATON-COLUMN --
Though Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte's father, Tommy, is only 50,
he nonetheless gazes in the mirror and demands an explanation for
what his body in recent years has put him through: Three years ago,
doctors removed two feet of his colon; the following year, they
unclogged the main artery to his heart. Pettitte watched his son at
spring training Friday afternoon in Tampa. (Barton Silverman/The
New York Times)

   (NYT24) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- BBO-ANDERSON-COLUMN -- Last
Tuesday Gil Hodges' candidacy for the Baseball Hall of Fame died,
at least for another year. Again. Some friends even sent his widow,
Joan Hodges, flowers, as if in mourning. But the campaign won't
die. ``I need an explanation,'' said Mrs. Hodges, standing by a
portrait of her husband, Gil, in the same house in which she has
lived since his playing days with the Brooklyn Dodgers. ``Ever
since Tuesday, I've had people come up and kiss me like he just
died.'' (G. Paul Burnett/The New York Times)

   (NYT23) TAMPA, Fla. -- March 4, 2000 -- BBA-YANKS-HERNANDEZ-2 --
Orlando Hernandez's stuff is quite ordinary, in its raw form - a
fastball of 88 to 90 miles an hour, a nice little curve, a
wide-breaking slider. But the Yankees pitcher knows how to throw
and how to win. (Barton Silverman/The New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT22) TAMPA, Fla. -- March 4, 2000 -- BBA-YANKS-HERNANDEZ-1 --
The drills that Orlando Hernandez, the Yankees pitcher, does are a
mystery to the other Yankees. In one routine, he stands on his
head, swinging his legs back and forth, as a form of yoga,
something he learned 10 years ago in Cuba. (Gary I. Rothstein/The
New York Times)

   (NYT21) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- SPEED-DATING -- It's called
SpeedDating, and it's the latest wrinkle in the Jewish singles
scene. The bell rings and couples pair off to chat for eight
minutes - not a second more - at a recent SpeedDating session at
Levana, a kosher French Mediterranean restaurant on the Upper West
Side of Manhattan. (Susan Farley/The New York Times)

   (NYT20) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- DIALLO-VOICES-3 -- In the
year since Amadou Diallo died in his doorway in a hail of police
bullets, New Yorkers' attitudes about the police have begun a
subtle shift. Anita L. Halton, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan,
said she was almost oblivious to the police: ``I actually feel very
ignored by the police. It's almost an invisible force to me.''
(Edward Keating/The New York Times)

   (NYT19) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- DIALLO-VOICES-2 -- In the
year since Amadou Diallo died in his doorway in a hail of police
bullets, New Yorkers' attitudes about the police have begun a
subtle shift. At Pennsylvania Station, Sherry Gellis, a Long
Islander from Lynbrook, said: ``I do not think police do things
carelessly. I think they can become unnerved, like most human
beings.'' (Edward Keating/The New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT18) NEW YORK -- March 4, 2000 -- DIALLO-VOICES-1 -- In the
year since Amadou Diallo died in his doorway in a hail of bullets,
New Yorkers' attitudes about the police have begun a subtle shift.
Jude Mignon, an owner of a barber shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn,
said a police presence has been good for business. But at night, he
said, he has been pushed against a wall and frisked by plainclothes
officers who seem more like a rude gang. ``I don't hate all cops.
But some have too much power.'' (Edward Keating/The New York Times)

   (NYT17) PAWLEYS ISLAND, S.C. -- March 4, 2000 --
EPISCOPALIAN-RIFT -- The Rev. Charles H. Murphy III, of All Saints
Episcopal Church, was consecrated a bishop by the head of the
Anglican Province of Rwanda. The ceremony vividly showed an unusual
alliance that has developed between conservative Episcopalians in
the United States and the like-minded heads of some Anglican
churches overseas, who share a perception that the Episcopal Church
has come to rely less on Scripture than on ideas from secular
American culture, especially on issues of human sexuality. (Wade

   (NYT16) SCRANTON, Pa. -- March 4, 2000 -- BIG-FAMILY-2 -- Torn
apart after an eviction, the 19-member Smith family has been put
back together in a 10-bedroom home of their own in Scranton, with
the help of hundreds of volunteers and Habitat for Humanity.
``These days the government can't handle it when you have 17
kids,'' said Robert E. Quinn, the director of Habitat for Humanity
for Lackawanna County. Charlie Smith was on the porch of the new
house with several members of his brood. (Keith Meyers/The New York

Charlie Smith had his children's names tattooed on his left arm,

The Army has decided to limit overseas deployments of these units
in peacekeeping and other military operations to a maximum of six
months, Pentagon officials said. The Army's chief of staff, Gen.
Erik K. Shinseki, is expected to announce the decision on Tuesday
at a ceremony handing over command of the American sector of NATO's
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia to the 49th Armored Division of
the Texas National Guard. A member of the 49th waited to board a

AFGHANISTAN-HEIST-2 -- On Jan. 13, thieves made off with more than
$200,000 in cash from Kabul's main money bazaar. They met no
opposition from the Taliban soldiers who stood watch over the
deserted bazaar at night, indicating an inside job. Despite the
severity of Taliban punishment, the bazaar has been looted twice in
a small crime wave. Currency traders filled its courtyard recently.

$200,000 in cash from Kabul's main money bazaar. They met no
opposition from the Taliban soldiers who stood watch over the
deserted bazaar at night, indicating an inside job. In Kabul a man
carried a stack of notes worth 10,000 Afghanis each, or about 20
cents, the largest denomination. The thieves would have had to
carry 24 tons of currency had they chosen to take their loot in
notes worth 5,000 Afghanis. (Barry Bearak/The New York Times)

Sen. John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush are different in both
style and substance when they talk about foreign policy, coming to

 &HT;    This week's top newsmaker
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a seamless transition from coach to spinmeister
last week, Bob Hartley assured everybody not to be alarmed at the
Colorado Avalanche's atypical fall in the Northwest Division
standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with a championship race this time of
year,'' the Avalanche coach said. ``The only problem is that we in
Colorado are not used to that this time of year. We had the
division trophy won by January. But this is not a bad thing. We
wanted some excitement in our locker room, and now we have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Excitement didn't quite capture the moment. Expecting a soft
touch in its schedule, Colorado was stunned 4-3 by the Thrashers, a
team that hadn't won in 16 games. The Avs, arguably the most
talented team in the Western Conference, continued its tumble,
going winless in five games to fall within one game of .500, before
Thursday's win over New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement? If boos are a measuring stick, Colorado fans clearly
are not thrilled with going from a Stanley Cup contender to a team
that might finish second to Edmonton and is not necessarily a
certainty for the playoffs. Going into the weekend, the Avs were
one of five teams within seven points of each other for the final
two playoff spots. If you think the chances of Colorado missing the
postseason are remote, what were the chances that a team with
Patrick Roy, Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic, Milan Hedjuk, Chris Drury,
Adam Deadmarsh and Sandis Ozolinsh would even be in this position?
</P>
<P>
   The Avs have been dented by injuries all season, particularly to
Forsberg and Sakic. But they always have had the depth to overcome
injuries in the past. One reason they might not this year is a
shortage of veteran leadership. General manager Pierre Lacroix did
not re-sign several of the team's free agents in the offseason,
most notably Valeri Kamensky, Sylvain Lefebvre and Theo Fleury.
That is the biggest reason the team has pursued Kelly Buchberger
from the Thrashers in trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix thought it was time for the youth on his team to take
over. But the youth is not certain it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Peter and Joe out, the younger players have been getting
more ice time than they're used to,'' rookie Alex Tanguay said.
``When you're a rookie, you make a few more mistakes. We're working
hard, but we're not getting the wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado/Quebec franchise has won five divisional
championships in a row and finished between 13 and 17 games over
500. But Lacroix remains confident about a turnaround,
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the criticism,'' he said. ``To be honest, we
have not performed as well as we have in previous years. But we're
not going to hide behind a curtain. People expect a lot of this
franchise, and that's normal. But we still believe we can turn it
around.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Eleven NHL goalies make at least $3 million per season. They are
ranked by how big a bargain they are for their team, with victories
through Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   Goalie/Team/Salary/Wins/Per win:
</P>
<P>
   Olaf Kolzig _ Washington _ $3,000,000 _ 30 _ $100,000
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur _ New Jersey _ $4,130,687 _ 36 _ $114,741
</P>
<P>
   Ed Belfour _ Dallas _ $3,500,000 _ 27 _ $129,629
</P>
<P>
   John Vanbiesbrouck _ Philadelphia _ $4,289,756 _ 21 _ $204,274
</P>
<P>
   Guy Hebert _ Anaheim _ $4,500,000 _ 21 _ $214,286

</P>
<P>
   Dominik Hasek _ Buffalo _ $7,000,000 _ 6 _ $1,166,667
</P>
<P>
   Includes wins with San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   THE TOP FIVE
</P>
<P>
   The best teams in the NHL with five weeks left in the season:
</P>
<P>
   1. St. Louis. The Blues have won 14 of 16 without Pierre
Turgeon. It should quiet questions about their depth for a while.
</P>
<P>
   2. Toronto. The Maple Leafs followed a six-game winless streak
by winning four in a row. Chances are, they won't have another
slump.
</P>
<P>
   3. New Jersey. Mark Messier? George Steinbrenner would make the
trade in a second. But he doesn't own the team yet _ and might not
before the March 14 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   4. Dallas. So, if the Stars have been so decimated by injuries,
how come they have so many wins? And what happens if and when they
get healthy in the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   5. Florida. Pavel Bure will win the Maurice Richard Trophy for
being the league's leading goal-scorer. But Anna Kournikova _ is
that a power-play move or what?
</P>
<P>
   THE BOTTOM FIVE
</P>
<P>
   The worst teams in the NHL with five weeks left in the season:
</P>
<P>
   28. Atlanta. So you think this is bad? The Thrashers still have
games left against New Jersey (two), Philadelphia (two) and
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   27. Tampa Bay. The good news is that goalie Dan Cloutier is back
from a groin strain. The bad news is that goalie Dan Cloutier is
back from a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   26. Boston. Now goalie Byron Dafoe is out. Somehow, general
manager Harry Sinden will find a way to blame it on coach Pat
Burns, the Scapegoat of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   25. N.Y. Islanders. After showing brief signs of life with a
season-high three-game winning streak, topping the Thashers' record
two-gamer, the Islanders won only one of their next eight, 1-5-2.
</P>
<P>
   24. Chicago. Try to explain this: The Blackhawks lose at home to
Nashville, then go on the road and beat Dallas and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   Detroit at Dallas, 8 p.m. today, ESPN: With college basketball
tournaments dominating, there is only one NHL game on ESPN or ESPN2
this week, but it is a good one. Dallas scored four third-period
goals to win 5-2 on Feb. 23 and take a 2-1 lead in the season
series between the Western Conference powers. Brett Hull of the
Stars and Steve Yzerman of the Red Wings each had two goals.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey at Atlanta, 7:30 p.m. Friday, WUPA: The expansion
Thrashers are 0-9-1 at home since Jan. 14 and things don't get any
easier. The Devils have the best record in the Eastern Conference
and are a definite Stanley Cup contender. New Jersey is 2-0 against
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Colorado at Edmonton, Friday: The Oilers went into Denver on
Tuesday and won 3-1 to stretch their lead in the Northwest
Division. If the Avalanche is going to snap out of it, this is the
time. One key is Joe Sakic, who is on pace to score just 15 goals,
which would be the lowest total of his career.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE/UNQUOTE
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL goalies are like Formula One cars. They have to be
perfectly tuned up so you can put your foot on the gas and go. If
you have two wheels on the side of the road, you are not faster
than a Volkswagen.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Anaheim goaltender coach Francois Allaire, who is trying to
help Guy Hebert shake a slump in which he allowed 19 goals in a
four-game span.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   Calgary's Jarome Iginla stretched his point streak to 14 games
and had a hand in half (21 of 42) of the Flames' goals in February.
But Iginla never has been a favorite of coach Brian Sutter, who
offered this backhanded compliment: ``If he had played the first
two months the way he played the last one, we wouldn't be in this
position (fighting for playoff slot).'' Gee, thanks.

for Bourque and Al MacInnis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buffalo is shopping Brian Holzinger and Michal Grosek, who is
feuding with coach Lindy Ruff. Now that Dominik Hasek is back, the
Sabres may be aggressive in patching holes for the playoff stretch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edmonton is considering making a pitch for Montreal's Shayne
Corson, whose $4 million option next season would simply be passed
on by the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Panthers would be taking risk if they swing a rumored
trade for the Islanders' Kenny Jonsson and center Claude Lapointe
for Oleg Kvasha and another player. Jonsson would help the team on
the blue line, but he's a restricted free agent after the season
and will seek over $2 million. Lapointe is an unrestricted free
agent. Kvasha is slumping now but he's a 21-year-old with skill.

GIULIANI SAYS CLINTONS MAKE RACE AN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to expand)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that President
Clinton appeared to have joined his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
in making police brutality and race relations a major issue in the
New York Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds as if the Clintons are trying to drive this as a
political issue,'' the mayor said, speaking to reporters before a
St. Patrick's Day parade in Queens. Giuliani was responding to the
president's remark on Friday night that he found it ``hard to
imagine'' that if Amadou Diallo had been white, and in a white
neighborhood, he would have been killed. Diallo, an immigrant from
Guinea, was killed in a Feb. 4, 1999, police shooting in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was also responding to criticism made on Friday
by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who said that Giuliani's administration
had failed to maintain the trust of people in some New York
neighborhoods while acting aggressively to reduce crime. Mrs.
Clinton was expected to make a major policy statement on police
conduct at Riverside Church in Manhattan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said of the
mayor's comments, ``I think it's a shame that at a time when the
city is desperate for healing and reconciliation, all the mayor can
offer is more finger pointing and attack politics.'' Of the notion
that the Clintons were conspiring to turn the Diallo case into a
campaign issue, Wolfson said, ``It's not even worth commenting on,
and it's an evasion of the mayor's responsibility for him to even
suggest it.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the president's comment, Giuliani said, ``With
all deference to the president of the United States, I think he
should give more deference to the jury forelady, an
African-American lady.'' The forewoman, Arlene Taylor, had said
that race was not a factor in the acquittal of the four police
officers in the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Friday that while he would not
``second-guess'' the jury, it was appropriate for the Justice
Department and the civil rights division to examine the verdict.

 &HT;    Happy ex-Hawk blazing new trail
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Watching the Hawks sink does not make Steve Smith feel
good. But the renowned nice guy is not feeling sorry for them,
either.
</P>
<P>
   As Smith and his Portland Trail Blazers continue to compete for
the best record in the NBA, the Hawks sink into an abyss that Smith
might have been able to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 guard, part of a trade last year that brought
malcontent Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson, realizes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't foresee this for that team,'' Smith said last week.
``I thought they'd be better. But they took the heart and soul away
from that team.... And now they're paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   With salary-cap room, the Hawks dealt Smith to Portland for
Rider and Jackson. Jackson has been solid, but Rider has been more
disturbing than advertised, to the point that the team has
considered releasing him.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks moved Mookie Blaylock for the No. 10 pick in the
draft, which was used to select Jason Terry. Terry got his first
start Friday in a win against the Knicks. Also, the Hawks could not
come to terms with Grant Long, a backup forward who provided a
physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just me and Mookie,'' Smith said. ``It was Grant Long and
Tyrone Corbin, too.... I thought we were doing well; we just had a
lot of injuries. I try to catch (the Hawks) whenever we aren't
playing. I feel for half the guys on that team. It's unfortunate
that they broke up our team. We were playing well as a team. But
injuries hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks were swept in the second round of the playoffs by the
New York Knicks, which sparked the changes. ``The sweep wouldn't
have happened if we were healthy,'' Smith insisted. ``We didn't
have Alan Henderson (out with eye injury) or LaPhonso Ellis, and
that was big. I'm not saying we would have beaten the Knicks, but
we had shown we could beat them in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we had played Indiana well, too, beat them in their place.
So, I thought we were close.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a chance with the Hawks with a healthy complement of
players and a few key additions. ``But the Hawks thought getting
younger meant getting better,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser guy would gloat over how things turned out. Not Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``After nine years in the league, it's just a blessing to get to
Portland, with an organization that's committed to winning,'' Smith
said. ``We have a mixture of veteran guys and young guys, and
leadership with me and Scottie (Pippen). We're all willing to
forfeit shots to get that (championship) ring at the end.''

WASHINGTON: of engagement.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The growth in Army operations other than war has led to calls
for increasing the total number of active troops, something that
Army leaders have echoed, but that the Department of Defense
opposes, citing the expense and the difficulties in recruiting
enough soldiers today.
</P>
<P>
   Critics on Capitol Hill, including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson,
R-Texas, complain that the real problem is the number of
peacekeeping missions to which President Clinton has committed
American troops. Hutchinson said an increased reliance on the Guard
and Reserves should not become a routine policy because of the
impact such deployments have on reservists and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army's effort to ease the burden of these deployments is
encouraging,'' she said, ``yet fails to address the underlying
problems caused by deployments that are not in our national
interest and appear to have no end.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the trend appears likely to continue _ and even
grow.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Pentagon report, the Reserve Component Employment Study
2005, predicted that five years from now there would still be at
least two peacekeeping missions like Bosnia and Kosovo. The report
also called on the services to do more to use the Guard and
Reserves, including giving them a significant role in defending the
nation against possible terrorist attacks and the national missile
defense system the Pentagon is planning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered the services
to remove ``all structural barriers'' to integrating Guard and
Reserve units into active-duty operations. It may be one of his
lasting legacies as secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Since the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia began in 1995, more
than 33,000 of the 150,000 troops who have served there _ 22
percent _ have belonged to the Guard and Reserves many of them in
specialties that exist primarily in the Army's Reserve components,
such as public affairs, medics, transportation and psychological
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the 49th's headquarters company represents a
further expansion of the Guard's role in Bosnia. The Army has
already scheduled deployments in Bosnia of headquarters units of
the 29th Infantry Division from Virginia and the 28th Infantry
Division from Pennsylvania, as well as combat brigades from North
Carolina, Oklahoma, Georgia, Idaho and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Army and Pentagon officials say they have not yet fully measured
the long-term ramifications of an increased reliance on the Guard
and Reserves. They hope that steps like the Army's will assuage
some of the concerns. In recent years, the Pentagon has also
offered new benefits to reservists, including expanded dental care
and access to government rates on airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's decision to shorten rotations for its Guard and
Reserve units applies only to operations other than war. In the
event of a conflict, the Army will still be able to mobilize its
Guard and Reserve units and send them overseas for the 270 days
allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   The policy brings the Army closer in line to the other services.
Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units, for example,
generally deploy no more than three months, though some individual
commanders and specialists serve as long as six.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Army officials described the shift as a matter of fairness,
since active Army units generally deploy from their home posts for
only six-months. They concede that over time the policy could
increase the number of Guard and Reserve units called to serve, but
added that shortening deployments could ease the impact on
individual reservists, especially with their civilian employers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Army limited deployments of doctors, nurse
anesthetists and dentists to 90 days after more than a third of the
doctors ordered to Bosnia from 1995 to 1998 quit the Reserve rather
than risk being called away from their civilian practices again.
Officials said they realized that most doctors could not afford to
be away from their patients more than 90 days without risking their
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Robert J. St. Onge Jr., the Army's deputy chief of
staff for operations and plans, said the demands of rising
deployments also affected soldiers on active duty. Like their Guard
and Reserve counterparts, the active-duty soldiers faced repeated
tours and months away from home, something officials believe has
eroded morale and hurt recruiting and retention of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, however, is that members of the Guard and
Reserves sign up for military duty expecting to serve 39 days a
year _ one weekend a month and two weeks each summer _ not for 270
days. And expectations have been slow to change.
</P>
<P>
   St. Onge recalled hearing a radio advertisement for the New
Jersey National Guard recently that extolled the benefits of
joining, including extra pay and college grants. ``I kept waiting
to hear the shoe drop: `And you can serve in exotic places,''' he
said. ``It never came.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing use of the Guard and Reserve has challenged many
assumptions about the Army, from its strategies to its structure to
its budget. ``The whole dynamic has changed,'' St. Onge said. ``And
frankly, if it goes south, we're going to have to look at a new way
of doing business.''

ANALYSIS: BACK IN CHILE, PINOCHET IS A REAL NOWHERE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ When Gen. Augusto Pinochet traveled to London
16 months ago on a diplomatic passport, he was still a powerful
force on the Chilean political scene. He was a leader of
conservatives in Congress as a senator for life who could pick up
the telephone to weigh in on crucial military matters.
</P>
<P>
   No one seriously suggested that the former dictator would ever
be prosecuted for his past.
</P>
<P>
   But when he returned home Friday _ benefiting from a British
decision that he was too infirm to stand trial in Spain on charges
of gross human rights violations during his 17 years in power _ the
84-year-old was a shadow of his former self.
</P>
<P>
   His political future is being negotiated by military and
civilian officials who do not even consult him. Several of his
closest former aides are under arrest, and he himself faces months
if not years of legal proceedings to escape prosecution here.
</P>
<P>
   His own seat in the senate, which he was granted under a
constitution written during his 17-year military rule, now appears
to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For Pinochet, it is a bleak panorama.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Lavin, the star of the Chilean right, who nearly won the
presidential election in January, did not attend the small airport
ceremony honoring Pinochet's return. The few conservative
politicians who did come were quick to tell reporters that they
were there as private citizens, not as representatives of their
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Ricardo Lagos, the first Socialist president of Chile
since Pinochet overthrew Salvador Allende in 1973, have let it be
known that Pinochet is not invited to his inauguration March 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a great majority of the population,'' an editorial in the
daily La Tercera argued on Friday, ``Pinochet is now part of the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was at the height of his powers, Pinochet bragged that
``not a leaf shakes in Chile without my knowledge.'' And people
believed him, even after he gave up the presidency in 1990. The man
who ruled Chile for 17 years only stepped down after losing a
plebiscite, but he was able to negotiate a sweet deal from his
civilian opponents: He remained commander of the army until 1998,
then became a senator for life, thus gaining legal immunity and
lasting influence.
</P>
<P>
   But during his months under house arrest in Britain, he became,
in Chile, something akin to the emperor with no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something incredible has happened,'' said Armando de Ramon, a
noted historian. ``They humiliated him and did what they wanted to
him. And that is the reason this country has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the taboo subjects of disappearances and torture
became the daily grist of the news media as journalists covered the
charges made against Pinochet by prosecutors in Spain, Belgium,
France and other quarters. Local rights groups resuscitated
themselves, and torture victims began to organize. And younger
military officers _ concerned that Pinochet's legal woes would
damage the armed forces _ began to distance themselves from his
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's absence opened a vacuum, and the man who filled it
was a previously obscure appeals court judge in Santiago, Juan
Guzman. Early last year, Guzman came up with an inventive legal
interpretation that has jolted the military's impunity, opened the
way for the arrests of 40 former military and police officers and
forced the military to begin a dialogue with rights lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman's ruling, which has been upheld by the supreme court,
found that an amnesty declared by the Pinochet regime to protect
officers involved in political crimes between 1973 and 1978 could
not be applied to cases involving people who are still missing,
since the victims may still be alive as victims of ongoing
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly finding the eissing people alive is unlikely. But this
interpretation has put pressure on the military to offer
information to family members who would like to bury their dead.
Otherwise, the officers face years of embarrassing prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman is now pushing ahead with the unthinkable: prosecuting
Pinochet himself. He has been assigned to investigate 60 criminal
complaints against the general, and he appears to be concentrating
on a possible connection between the former dictator and a
helicopter-borne death squad known as the Caravan of Death, which
removed 75 political prisoners from military and police prisons in
the month after the 1973 coup for summary executions and
clandestine burial.
</P>
<P>
   Since more than a dozen of the victims are still missing _ and
at least theoretically could be alive _ an investigation into the
death squad has already led to the prosecution of a retired general
who was a close aide to Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Before Guzman can indict Pinochet in the case, he will have to
seek the revocation of his senatorial immunity. That will not be
easy, especially because legislators are pushing a constitutional
amendment to allow the former dictator to step down from the Senate
but retain his immunity.
</P>
<P>
   But an indictment is not entirely out of the question, and Lavin
and other conservatives have said they will not stand in the way.
The conservatives still say they respect the former dictator's
economic accomplishments, but they read the opinion polls. And the
polls show that well over half of Chileans believe Pinochet should
face justice in Chile.

CLAXTON LEADS HOFSTRA TO TOURNEY SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRANDON LILLY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, Del. _ The Hofstra Flying Dutchmen, behind the
conference player of the year, Speedy Claxton, built an early
double-digit lead and did not look back Saturday, defeating Boston
University, 80-62, in the quarterfinal round of the America East
tournament at the University of Delaware. The victory moved Hofstra
(22-6) into the semifinals against Drexel on Sunday. Behind Stephen
Starks' 25 points, fifth-seeded Drexel (13-16) beat Vermont, 71-59.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Claxton finished with 14 points, well below his
average of 23.2 points a game, but made up for it with six assists
and only two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates really stepped up today,'' Claxton said. ``I had
a tough time scoring, so I was looking to get them shots and they
were knocking them down or they were making other plays to get
someone else a great shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra put the game away early in the second half. Boston
University rallied after the halftime break, chipping into
Hofstra's lead with a more fluid offense effort than it had
displayed. But each time Boston University seemed to be on the
verge of a run, Hofstra responded with a 3-point field goal or a
3-point play, demoralizing the Terriers, who got no closer than 11
points.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra guard Jason Hernandez scored nine of his 15 points
during that second-half surge.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra tried to apply the knockout punch early. The junior
forward Norman Richardson hit two 3-pointers as the Dutchmen scored
10 of the game's first 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra coach Jay Wright employed a man-to-man press to force
Boston University to start farther from the basket. The strategy
seemed to work as Boston University (7-22) never seemed to get in
sync on the offensive end, leading to easy transition baskets for
Hofstra.
</P>
<P>
   Poor outside shooting by Hofstra allowed BU to stay within
striking distance. The Terriers pulled to 19-15 on a 3-pointer by
Mike Costello with eight minutes remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't played in a week and we were a little tentative and
a little sloppy at first,'' Wright said. ``I think as the game wore
on, they got a little tired and we were a little fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when Claxton took over.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was used more as a decoy in the Dutchmen's set
offense in the first half, the senior point guard was particularly
effective in transition. Claxton's driving, 3-point play late in
the first half keyed a 12-2 Hofstra run that gave the Dutchmen a
14-point lead with four minutes left in the half. Hofstra went into
the locker room with a 42-29 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchmen took control in the lane early in the second half.
Hofstra began to dominate the glass. Forwards Roberto Gittens and
Lars Grubler combined for 15 rebounds, 12 of those coming after the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson finished with a game-high 21 points. Boston
University was led by forward Paul Seymour, who finished with 19.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Flying Dutchmen could play host to the
championship next Saturday if they get that far. The Flying
Dutchmen have never advanced past the semifinal round in their six
years in the America East Conference. But this is the first time
they have been top-seeded.

 &HT;    Tri-state water war not nearing truce
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Georgia, Florida and Alabama kicked off
negotiations two years ago to settle their acrimonious water war,
the states believed they would have an amicable settlement within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having blown two deadlines and facing a third, negotiators
say that immense complexities unforeseen at the start of the
negotiations could doom efforts to devise formulas for sharing the
waters of two major river basins whose headwaters are in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the negotiations) fail because of the complexities, I
won't be surprised,'' says former Georgia Congressman Lindsay
Thomas, who represents more than 10 federal agencies at the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Without a settlement, the fracas likely will end up in the U.S.
Supreme Court, which could have serious repercussions for
Georgians. Litigation could cost Georgia $4 million to $6 million a
year, and the legal process could continue for years. The court
also likely would appoint a special master to oversee water use in
each state until a decision is reached.
</P>
<P>
   The special master could put on hold requests from
municipalities and industries for more water withdrawals, which
could shut down growth in metro Atlanta and North Georgia. ``The
(adverse) economic impact could run into the billions of dollars,''
warns U.S. Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   THE STAKES ARE HIGH
</P>
<P>
   Even if the states reach a settlement themselves, the stakes are
huge for Georgians. In exchange for guarantees of enough water for
metro Atlanta's growth in the next 30 to 50 years, Georgians may
have to pay higher electricity rates as hydropower production is
reduced. Southwest Georgia farmers face caps on irrigation, and
navigation at Georgia's inland ports at Bainbridge and Columbus may
be curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   Industries and municipalities _ and the people they serve _ may
have to pay more to treat waste discharged into rivers because of
less water to treat the effluent. In metro Atlanta, permanent
restrictions on outdoor watering and other stern conservation
measures may be put into place.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict, which began as a water fight between states, has
grown to include complex issues of science, agriculture,
environment, economics and, inevitably, politics.
</P>
<P>
   One potentially deal-breaking complication is the heavy use of
groundwater for crop irrigation in southwest Georgia _ reflected by
a controversial bill pending in the state Legislature that would
pay farmers in the area up to $30 million not to water their crops
during droughts.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have learned that the intensive irrigation can
substantially affect water flow in the Flint River, which, in turn,
may adversely affect the Chattahoochee and Apalachicola rivers.
Together, the rivers form the so-called ACF basin.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Alabama and Florida are haggling over water rights in
the ACF. On a second front, Georgia and Alabama are feuding over
the Alabama, Coosa and Tallapoosa basin, or the ACT.
</P>
<P>
   A DECADE OF BICKERING
</P>
<P>
   When Alabama triggered the water war 10 years ago by suing the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over metro Atlanta's water use, the
irrigation issue and other now high-profile problems seemed of
little consequence.
</P>
<P>
   What was of burning importance to Alabama at the time _ and
still is _ was fear that a mushrooming metro Atlanta would hoard
most of the water in the ACF and ACT and leave little for Alabama's
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's fear seemed confirmed in 1989 when the Corps announced
a plan to reallocate 20 percent of the water normally reserved for
power generation in Lake Lanier to drinking water. The plan was
designed to ensure Atlanta an adequate water supply through at
least 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The decision triggered an uproar in Alabama. Then-Gov. Guy Hunt
demanded that the reallocation plan be suspended until the Corps
conducted a detailed analysis to determine the impacts on
downstream users, including Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, however, went ahead with another controversial plan: In
June 1990, Georgia asked the Corps for a permit to build a
4,200-acre reservoir on the Tallapoosa River only five miles
upstream from the Georgia-Alabama line. The lake would be the first
of a dozen or so state-built regional reservoirs that would
encircle metro Atlanta and ``drought proof'' North Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Corps received Georgia's request, Alabama
sued the Corps in federal court. Georgia's plan, Alabama said,
would vest Georgia with expanded water rights at the expense of
downstream users. Georgia countered that Alabama was trying to
interfere with its right to use water within its borders as it saw
fit. Florida sided with Alabama, contending that metro Atlanta's
unquenchable thirst would jeopardize growth in northwest Florida,
as well as Apalachicola Bay's world-famous oysters that depend on
nutrient-laden freshwater coming down the Apalachicola.
</P>
<P>
   DEADLINES FOR AGREEMENTS COME AND GO
</P>
<P>
   The water war quickly became bitter. At one point, Georgia
threatened to withhold permits for some Alabama companies to
withdraw water from the Chattahoochee, which Georgia contends lies
wholly within its borders through a right it claims as one of the
original 13 states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the governors of the three states called a truce,
effectively putting Alabama's lawsuit on hold. Each state pledged
to help devise a plan to share the waters of the ACF and ACT.
Georgia pledged to put on hold its plans for regional reservoirs.
The states also agreed to use the results of a comprehensive study
of the river basins, which has cost more than $22 million so far,
to devise water-sharing formulas.
</P>
<P>
   With the study nearing completion in 1997, the three states
agreed that the best way to work out a settlement was to set up two
commissions _ made up of the governor of each state or his
representative, and a federal representative appointed by President
Clinton _ under two interstate water compacts to work out
allocation formulas that would be in effect for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations began in February 1998 with an aim to reach an
agreement by Dec. 31, 1998. When that time limit slipped _
negotiators couldn't agree on water sharing formulas _ they set a
new deadline of Dec. 31, 1999. Now, still far apart, the
arbitrators are working toward a May 1 deadline for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In two sessions last week in Atlanta, the negotiators failed to
make headway. In the ACT talks, Alabama wants more water at the
state line than Georgia is willing to provide during droughts.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA WILLING TO 'SHARE THE PAIN'
</P>
<P>
   The two states have agreed to hold one more meeting this month.
Alabama's chief negotiator, Jim Campbell, said it could be the
final session for the ACT talks.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman has said that Alabama will ``see them
in court'' if Georgia is not willing to ease up on its stance.
</P>
<P>
   In the ACF talks, negotiators also are facing the prospect of a
stalemate. Florida is demanding more water at the state line at
certain times in the year than Georgia is willing to provide.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators said they might consider an interim
water-sharing formula that would be renegotiated within seven to 10
years after some of the complex issues hampering the talks are
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Environmental Protection Division has started
a massive project to locate farm wells in 10 southwest Georgia
counties _ the most agriculturally productive region of the state _
in order to determine how much water farmers may suck out of the
ground and from the Flint River during dry years.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators say they need to understand exactly how the
Flint's surface flow is reduced by heavy irrigation before they can
work out a satisfactory water-sharing formula for the ACF.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the federal representative at the negotiating table,
says the irrigation dilemma is part of an even larger issue that
has emerged since the talks began _ unyielding demands for more
water from a variety of interests, including hydropower,
navigation, agriculture, recreation and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``These groups will not go quietly into the night,'' warns
Thomas, who has the power to veto any agreement reached by the
states if he deems it incompatible with federal environmental laws
and other regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kerr, Georgia's chief negotiator, says Georgia is willing
``to share the pain'' of any water agreement, but the state must be
cautious not to sign on to 50-year contracts that it can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're upstream, and you're the one signing the contract,
you have to be very careful,'' he said.

VIOLENT CAST OF SCHOOL HAZING MIRRORS SOCIETY, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y., N.J., Conn., Ohio)  (jw) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a suburban Baltimore high school, 14 players on the boy's
varsity soccer team are suspended after dragging freshmen across a
muddy field and forcing them to stand against a wall while being
whacked by soccer balls that are kicked at close range. Two
students are injured during the punting incident, one of whom
suffers a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, N.Y., the season opener for the Great Neck South
High School football team is forfeited after 10 players are
suspended for beating a freshman soccer player, leaving him
severely bruised.
</P>
<P>
   At a football camp on Staten Island, N.Y., high school students
from New Jersey and Long Island are roughed up, paddled on their
rear ends and forced to box each other until they bleed.
</P>
<P>
   For those who monitor violent hazing, incidents like these _ all
of which occurred in the last year _ are disturbing evidence that
brutal initiation rites are no longer just the stuff of college
fraternities and military school barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Although juvenile stunts and punishing endurance tests have long
been a part of high school athletics, educators and students say
the rituals have grown more vicious in recent years, mirroring both
the rise in reckless college hazing and the overall escalation of
violence in society.
</P>
<P>
   A high school wrestling team in Trumbull, Conn., apparently had
a decades-long tradition of hazing, but this year, the ritual drew
the attention of the police after a 15-year-old team member's
bruises were noticed by his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Over the span of a month, investigators said, the sophomore had
been spat on, hogtied, imprisoned inside a gym locker, slammed into
walls and held down while other players forced the handle of a
plastic knife into his rectum. Three team members were arraigned
last week on adult charges, and five others have been charged as
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   To earlier generations, high school hazing meant scavenger
hunts, wearing beanies or fetching doughnuts for upperclassmen. But
these days, it is more likely to involve some form of humiliation
or physical abuse, say educators and law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no statistics on high school hazing, a survey
of major newspapers across the country found 28 serious incidents
since the start of the school year, many involving beatings, sexual
assaults with objects or instances in which students were
restrained with duct tape. During the same period a year ago, eight
such incidents were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hazing has changed from the goofy high jinks of the '50s and
'60s to something that is remarkably brutal and vicious,'' said
Gary Powell, a hazing expert in Cincinnati who writes a legal
newsletter for schools and fraternities. ``Like society itself,
it's become more violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Long cloaked in secrecy, the dark side of high school hazing has
only begun to emerge from the shadows. Once considered a harmless,
if unpleasant, part of high school team sports, hazing has also
come to be seen through a different lens, especially since the rash
of school shootings has shown America how violent its children can
be.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who might have once brushed off hazing rites as
adolescent foolery now see them as dangerous and sadistic bullying.
In many cases, it is parents, not students, who notify the
authorities after learning of a hazing incident. And school
officials, sobered by a spate of lawsuits that have found them
liable for the behavior of students, have started to confront
activity they may have ignored in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion of kids just being kids has changed,'' said
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer in Washington who has represented
several high school students injured during hazing. ``As a result
of high-profile incidents, parents have come to expect that when
they send their kids to school, they do so with the understanding
that the school will control and prevent wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in dozens of interviews at local schools, many students
and even some coaches said that initiation rites _ from compulsory
head shavings to beatings that leave victims bloodied _ persist in
high school sports. Tom Howard, the athletic director at
Farmingdale High School on Long Island, said many coaches saw
hazing as a rite of passage, an essential part of becoming an
athlete. ``They figure boys will be boys, and they just look the
other way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, it is boys. Although hazing also occurs in girls'
athletics, the more brutal and sexually oriented assaults often
involve male contact sports like football and wrestling, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   School officials at Trumbull have denied any knowledge of the
wrestling team's hazing tradition. But the 1999 high school
yearbook refers to _ and celebrates _ some of the practices, as
does a team videotape made of a wrestling match. A lawyer for one
of the defendants said that hazing, in some form, dated back at
least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Nuwer, author of ``High School Hazing,'' a book for
students published last month, said he first noticed violent and
sexual incidents in the 1980s. ``Before that, the worst of it
involved players dressed in diapers or hot ointment in jock
straps,'' he said. ``Now you see more cases of penetration or
extreme brutality, things that I think qualify as criminal
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-HIGHSCHOOL-HAZING-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: criminal behavior.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While most of the pranks and horseplay at high schools tends to
be less hazardous than the well-publicized incidents of forced
fraternity-house drinking, they can be just as traumatizing, say
opponents of hazing. Such experiences, they add, also pave the way
for the more egregious initiation rites associated with college
sports and Greek organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The harsher the hazing, the more likely an initiate will become
sadistic when his turn to haze comes, said Brian Rahill, of
Columbus, Ohio, who runs a Web site, Stophazing.org. ``Hazing
doesn't bring people together,'' he said. ``It only breeds
animosity and separates people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a national study published last summer by Alfred University,
42 percent of those who endured hazing in college said they were
also hazed in high school. Of the 2,000 athletes surveyed, 80
percent said they had been hazed in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something terribly wrong with our society when abuse
becomes a means of bonding,'' said Dr. Nadine Hoover, the study's
principal investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Mention the word hazing to high school athletes, and most will
deny it exists. But ask them how they usher new players into their
ranks, and they readily describe a tradition of practical jokes and
organized roughhousing intended to disgrace, degrade and terrify.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the locker room of North Babylon High School on
Long Island on Monday, members of the football team said their
annual ``Freshman Friday'' was a way of inducting younger members
into their ``family.'' Jonathan Hines, 15, a starting tackle for
the Bulldogs, explained that with the locker room lights shut off,
freshmen players were roughed up, slapped around and slammed into
the lockers. ``They know we're playing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fall, after hitting one boy a little too forcefully
and making him cry, Jonathan said, he received a four-day
suspension. Asked if he regretted the episode, he said, ``I was
just mad because I got suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that spurt of violence each fall, newcomers to North
Babylon's football team are subjected to mundane acts of
submission, like serving water to seniors or being ridiculed at
team dinners while they stand on tables and sing. Each season
coaches warn against malicious behavior, the players said, but the
admonishment is generally ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Iovino, athletic director at New Canaan High School in
Connecticut, said the school began cracking down on hazing a few
years ago after a student who was forced to carry a cinder block
all day with his arms in chains dropped the block on his toe,
breaking it.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, he said, members of the girls' soccer team were
blindfolded, put on a train and told they were headed to Grand
Central Terminal. The train, in fact, was going to a seedy station
in nearby Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how mild the form of initiation, we feel that it's
demeaning to the kids and a distraction in the classroom,'' Iovino
said. Despite the ban on hazing, he said, the school newspaper
consistently runs editorials in objection, saying that initiation
rites build team unity.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Flemming, 20, a former football and wrestling team captain
at Columbia High School in Maplewood, N.J., agreed that hazing
promoted team cohesion but said it also helped establish a pecking
order. ``You have to pay your dues first,'' he said of the
freshmen. ``They don't always realize who is boss.''
</P>
<P>
   To educators, however, the rise in sadistic hazing is further
proof that America has lost its bearings.
</P>
<P>
   As family bonds weaken and relationships between adults and
children become more adversarial, teen-agers are desperate for
inclusion in groups that help fill the void, educators say. And
without the guidance and input of adults, children invent
initiation rites that use abuse and humiliation as a means of
proving loyalty and self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rachel Lauer, a psychologist at Pace University who has
studied hazing, said many students were so eager to belong to a
group that they submitted to treatment they knew was wrong. ``In
addition to companionship and comfort, there's a certain amount of
prestige in belonging,'' she said. ``And the harder it is to get
in, the more prestigious it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to be included is so intense, most of those
subjected to hazing refuse to talk about it. ``You rat out your
teammates and it's the end for you,'' said Nuwer, the author of
``High School Hazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those working to combat hazing say the best way to break the
cycle is by holding coaches and school officials accountable while
educating students about the dangers of such behavior. Eileen
Stevens, a Sayville, N.Y., mother whose son died of alcohol
poisoning in a hazing ritual in college 22 years ago, said the
ideal place to start was in high schools, even middle schools,
where mythological yarns about the glories of hazing are first
spun.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has spoken to 40 high schools, usually after a
disruptive hazing incident. ``It's become so deeply rooted in our
culture,'' she said. ``So many kids glamorize hazing, they almost
look forward to it when they get to college.''

ESTABLISMENT CANDIDATES FAVORED TUESDAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a five-week political whirlwind that began
with the New Hampshire primary, the insurgent candidates, John
McCain and Bill Bradley, head into ``Super Tuesday'' facing the
same difficulties that have dogged them from the start with much of
the political establishment and party rules arrayed in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   With the notable exception of five New England states holding
elections on Tuesday, some of the biggest states going to the polls
on that day are so dominated by the party infrastructure and rules
favoring George W. Bush and Al Gore that some analysts refer to
Super Tuesday as Establishment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very steep hill to climb,'' said former senator Warren
Rudman, national cochairman of McCain's campaign against Bush, the
Republican front-runner. While predicting McCain will do ``very
well'' on Tuesday, Rudman said that under arcane party rules,
McCain could receive the most overall votes in the two biggest
states, California and New York, while receiving far fewer
delegates than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong with that,'' Rudman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Kaufman, who was political director for President George
Bush and is a friend of his son, said the Texas governor's
prospects look good Tuesday because of his campaign's expenditure
of tens of millions of dollars across the country and his ability
to earn the backing of party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain hurricane has been pretty impressive,'' said
Kaufman, a Republican national committeeman from Massachusetts.
``But Bush's investment is paying off. The McCain hurricane has
blown through'' and Bush ``is still standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bradley, who lost by just four points to Gore in New
Hampshire and then had to wait a month for the next primary, is
behind in the polls in every state that will vote Tuesday,
including New York, where he once played professional basketball.
It has been difficult to overcome Gore's advantage in local and
national organization, as Bradley found out when he lost last
Tuesday in Washington despite six straight days of campaigning
there. Bradley chalked up the loss to ``entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
   The very phrase ``Super Tuesday'' underscores the difficulty
facing the insurgents. It is a contest of more than a dozen states
_ 16 for Democrats and 13 for Republicans _ where money and
organization are supremely important. That is a marked contrast to
the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, when the focus was on
meeting voters and spending many days in the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make the argument that being associated with the
establishment is not a good thing in Iowa and New Hampshire,'' said
a Gore spokesman, Chris Lehane. On Super Tuesday, by contrast, he
said, ``You are talking primarily about the core Democrats in those
states, and there's not the independent influx you had in other
states. You are talking traditional base.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one has been more frustrated by the process, and
particularly the schedule, than Bradley. After narrowly losing New
Hampshire, he said his campaign was on the rise. Then he had to
wait a month for the next contest, the nonbinding Washington
primary that he lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be a vicious cycle,'' said a Bradley
spokesman, Mo Elleithee, who nonetheless says Bradley has some
bright prospects for Tuesday in the Northeast. ``The media wasn't
paying attention because we didn't have a contest, and then the
media would say no one was paying attention,'' Elleithee said.
</P>
<P>
   The five New England states apart from New Hampshire are thought
to be leaning toward Gore and McCain, although Bush has said he
hopes to win in Maine and perhaps Connecticut. The most obvious
exception to the importance of the GOP establishment is
Massachusetts, where McCain is far ahead in the polls despite
Bush's backing by Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   The race is expected to be decided in three crucial contests:
New York, Ohio, and California.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, a win in just one of those states might prompt him
to extend his campaign. New York is his best hope. But a strong
showing in several states would be helpful because most states,
including California, award Democratic delegates on a proportional
basis, Bradley spokesman Tony Wyche said.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, who had hoped to ride a national wave of momentum to
a blowout on Tuesday, the stakes are equally high. But his advisers
say privately that even winning New England and New York, where he
is even in the polls with Bush, may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   McCain defied the New York party leadership, which backs Bush,
and got his name on the ballot. But he may find that even if he
wins the popular vote, party leaders may still use their power to
help Bush. For starters, New York rules allow eight members of the
party leadership to appoint their own delegates, all of which
presumably would go to Bush. Other delegates are allocated by the
vote in each congressional district. So, while McCain is likely to
win by a landslide in New York City congressional districts,
possibly piling up a large enough margin to win the statewide
popular vote, he could lose many upstate congressional districts to
Bush, who would thus get a large share of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is even worse for McCain in California, which has
the biggest prize of 162 delegates. Under the state's Republican
Party rules, only the votes of Republicans count toward the
winner-take-all selection of delegates. The rule greatly hurts the
chances of McCain, who has relied on his crossover appeal among
independents and Democrats. McCain at least hopes to win the
state's ``beauty contest'' vote, in which any voter can
participate. Thus, McCain could win the overall vote without
getting a single delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Some McCain backers, while doubting there is any chance to win
the Republican vote, believe that a win in the no-delegate contest
could set the stage for a convention challenge of delegate rules.
Under this theory, a successful challenge could result in McCain
winning at least some of California's delegates, but the idea is
considered a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Ohio, where delegates are awarded by congressional
district, meaning that even a McCain win would not result in a
sweep of the state's delegates. The McCain campaign has compared
Ohio to Michigan, which McCain won with the votes of many Democrats
and independents. Indeed, 18 percent of McCain's Michigan vote came
from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a big difference between Ohio and Michigan. Ohio,
unlike Michigan, is holding a Democratic primary on the same day,
so there will be less incentive for Democrats and independents to
cross over for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio is a state where organization matters,'' said John Green,
an observer of the state's political scene and director of the
Bliss Institute at the University of Akron. ``We have eight
different media markets and different cultures. The fact that
Ohio's election is occurring on a day with so many other states
stretches resources thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Michigan, Green said, ``The Bush people have figured
out in this state how to use their organization. They are appealing
to independents as well as Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore similarly has a huge organizational
advantage that is likely to give him a major victory in Ohio, Green
said. Super Tuesday, he said, is probably the establishment's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation early on was that the primaries would be over
quickly because of the organizational prowess of Bush and Gore,''
Green said. ``It didn't work that way for a while. But we are back
to that now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has some hope of doing well in Missouri, where he is
within 10 points of Bush in the polls, but McCain is given little
chance in Minnesota, which has a caucus system that favors an
establishment candidate. There are also contests on Tuesday in
Maryland, which could be a tossup state, and Georgia, which is
leaning toward Bush.

PINOCHET RETURNS TO A CHANGED CHILE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ While General Augusto Pinochet was stuck in
London for 503 days, his beloved homeland did some things he never
would have allowed, such as:
</P>
<P>
   --Began a search with military officers and human rights
advocates to find the remains of thousands of people who
disappeared during Pinochet's 17-year dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   --Processed 60 lawsuits, filed by relatives of missing or
tortured Pinochet-era victims, that threaten to pull Pinochet into
a legal drama even more humiliating than the one he just endured in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   --And late last year, Chile elected its first socialist
president since Salvador Allende, the man Pinochet overthrew in a
CIA-backed coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Having Pinochet thousands of miles away has been both both
painful and liberating for this South American country of 12
million people.
</P>
<P>
   And now that their former leader is back, many Chileans wonder
whether Pinochet will return to the political stage he reluctantly
exited when he was placed under house arrest in Britain in October
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the country's new attitude was displayed this weekend,
when government officials roundly criticized the army's decision to
hold a homecoming ceremony, complete with a military band playing
patriotic songs, when Pinochet's plane touched down on Chilean
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes called the welcome
celebration ``a disgrace,'' and President-elect Ricardo Lagos said
the retired general's televised arrival had damaged the country's
image. Thousands more Chileans protested on the streets of Santiago
for a second day Saturday, demanding his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet's supporters, bolstered by having their hero back
home, said they hoped he would stay active in the political
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a senator for life,'' said Matthew Aylwin, a 55-year-old
salesman who waved a Chilean flag outside the military hospital
where Pinochet visited for medical exams. ``He has to help fix the
things that have gone wrong while he was away, to keep the
communists out.''
</P>
<P>
   There is growing curiosity on whether the 84-year-old general
will attend Saturday's presidential inauguration for Lagos, whether
he'll return to the Senate, or whether he'll rekindle ties with his
longtime associates in Chile's army.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty, most observers agree Pinochet's forced
absence brought two key changes: It opened the way for a socialist
president; and for the first time it elevated the issue of human
rights violations under Pinochet into a policy debate for
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Pinochet been here instead of Britain, chances are we
would not be talking today about lawsuits against him, a socialist
president or about whether he should retire from public life,''
said Armen Kouyoumdjian, who publishes a newsletter on Chilean
political and military affairs. ``He is someone who always has an
opinion and many people here are influenced by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger over Pinochet's return spilled over into a downtown march
Saturday by 3,000 protesters, who demanded that he be tried for the
same torture charges he avoided facing in Europe because British
doctors considered him too feeble.
</P>
<P>
   The British ``made the mistake of thinking he's too sick to
stand trial, but that doesn't mean he's innocent,'' said Diana
Lekis, 22, who joined in a rally held under a blazing late summer
sun outside the National Palace. ``Now it's up to us to resolve
this problem ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   News media from Chile to England, meanwhile, continued to
question British Home Secretary Jack Straw's decision to release
Pinochet from house arrest for medical reasons, especially after
the retired general appeared both steady and alert as he walked
away from his wheelchair and greeted family and friends after
returning to Santiago on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet left the military hospital Saturday &UR;  &LR; night under heavy
security and went to his suburban estate in the foothills of the
Andes. He must now wait word from an appeals court in Santiago,
which will decide whether to strip him of his parliamentary
immunity and make him stand trial for human rights torture in the
deaths and disappearances of some 3,000 people during his rule.
Polls show that most Chileans want Pinochet tried here.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Chilean citizen is above the law,'' President Eduardo Frei
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts such as Kouyoumdjian wondered whether Chile's army,
which suffers from low morale because of low pay and poor housing
conditions, might find inspiration from Pinochet's return. Another
military coup, they added, would be unthinkable because of the
effect it would have on Chile's world trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new, more polished generation in the military, but
they're mostly the sons of old officers,'' said Kouyoumdjian.
``Their biggest concern is money. And the real power is not the
military anymore but the business and industrial community.''

VILLAGERS FLEE FIGHTING BETWEEN SERBIAN POLICE AND ALBANIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALISHEVO, Yugoslavia _ A fierce firefight broke out early
Saturday morning between the Serbian police and Albanian guerrilla
fighters in an Albanian village in southern Serbia, causing an
exodus of villagers who fled by car into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the village, Dobrosin, was empty of inhabitants,
said its mayor, Rabit Saqipi, who had briefly returned there.
``Only soldiers are left,'' he said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting had flared up and frightened the last remaining
civilians, causing a new flight of Albanians from their homes in
southern Serbia, just beyond the Kosovo boundary.
</P>
<P>
   American troops of the peacekeeping force watching the border
with Serbia reported hearing periods of gunfire in the space of two
hours and then counted more than 70 villagers fleeing in cars in
the small hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-led peacekeepers and U.N. officials have recently expressed
concern about the volatile situation on Kosovo's eastern boundary
with Serbia, and the events around Dobrosin showed how unstable the
area is. In a sequence of events that Kosovo has seen played out
many times, Dobrosin is just the latest to suffer from skirmishes
between the Serbian police and self-appointed defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Armed men _ declaring themselves to be fighters of the
Liberation Army of Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja, Albanian towns
in southern Serbia _ went public last week saying they would fight
to defend the Albanian village of Dobrosin. The group, apparently
an offspring of the now disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army that
fought Yugoslav forces in Kosovo, vowed to defend the village from
Serbian aggression.
</P>
<P>
   But Saqipi, Dobrosin's mayor, sat in a cafe in Malishevo,
several miles into Kosovo from his village, and acknowledged that
the fighters had only drawn the ire of the Serbian police. He
looked crushed by the fate of his village. ``No one will return
now,'' he said. ``There is no way to persuade the villagers to go
back now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the shooting erupted just after midnight when the
Albanian fighters saw unknown figures on a ridge outside the
village and opened fire. For the next two hours they exchanged
gunfire with the Serbs from a distance. The Albanians suffered no
casualties, Saqipi said. The Serbian authorities have so far not
reported any casualties either.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of the mayor, Naip Rexhepi, a politician in Malishevo,
said a wolf or a wild boar could have frightened the men and caused
them to open fire.
</P>
<P>
   The fear and haste with which the villagers fled showed just how
they have been living on tenterhooks, expecting a catastrophe at
any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have constantly suffered maltreatment at the hands of the
Serb police,'' Saqipi said, adding that market day, when villagers
travel to the nearby town, has always caused problems. ``But things
got worse, so much so that we cannot think of going there
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   What started with harassment and bribery has escalated to death
threats and killings. Three villagers have been killed in the last
two months, and villagers are now frightened for their lives. ``It
is just how it happened in Kosovo,'' Saqipi said.
</P>
<P>
   One villager, who moved his family to Kosovo two weeks ago, said
his children had started asking if the Serbs were going to come and
kill them. ``They had seen a lot on television about massacres in
Kosovo and they asked me, `Are the Serbs going to come and kill
us?''' he said, his face sweaty with anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever caused the violence early Saturday, the results were
catastrophic for the village. Families bundled belongings into
their cars and set off in the middle of the night, as the guns
rattled around them, to escape into Kosovo, where American troops
have mounted a visible protection force on the boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Some 76 refugees had crossed by early morning, according to the
office of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees in the nearby
town of Gniljane. They have been quickly housed by local people,
and the refugee agency has some 90 families on standby to take in
people in such emergencies. It also has space ready for some 1,500
refugees in community centers, if the influx of refugees increases.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials have been bracing themselves for this sort of
crisis as tensions have been rising in the area east of Kosovo.
``It is a strange time, when we are winding down the emergency
relief operation in Kosovo,'' said Andrea Recchia, an area field
officer for the refugee agency. ``But here tension has definitely
increased.''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers are pinning their hopes on the peacekeeping force
in Kosovo, known as KFOR, hoping that it will move into the buffer
zone that reaches five kilometers _ a little more than three miles
_ into Serbia, and so provide them with security. They say KFOR
officers have told them that they cannot operate beyond Kosovo's
border, but they persist in hoping. ``The best solution would be
for KFOR to move into the five-kilometer zone,'' said Saqipi.
``Many times we have asked for security.'' And for lack of any
other protection, he said they had to rely on irregular Albanian
fighters. ``If our soldiers leave, then we will be left to the
mercy of the Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the whole village has fled, he looked defeated. The
only chance to return to their homes lay with the international
community, he said. ``All our hopes are on them,'' he said.

ANALYSIS: BACK IN CHILE, PINOCHET IS A REAL NOWHERE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert sentence in 4th graf about protesters in Chile.)  
 (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ When Gen. Augusto Pinochet traveled to London
16 months ago on a diplomatic passport, he was still a powerful
force on the Chilean political scene. He was a leader of
conservatives in Congress as a senator for life who could pick up
the telephone to weigh in on crucial military matters.
</P>
<P>
   No one seriously suggested that the former dictator would ever
be prosecuted for his past.
</P>
<P>
   But when he returned home Friday _ benefiting from a British
decision that he was too infirm to stand trial in Spain on charges
of gross human rights violations during his 17 years in power _ the
84-year-old was a shadow of his former self.
</P>
<P>
   His political future is being negotiated by military and
civilian officials who do not even consult him. Several of his
closest former aides are under arrest, and he himself faces months
if not years of legal proceedings to escape prosecution here.
Saturday, thousands of protesters marched in Santiago, demanding
that he be jailed.
</P>
<P>
   His own seat in the senate, which he was granted under a
constitution written during his 17-year military rule, now appears
to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For Pinochet, it is a bleak panorama.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Lavin, the star of the Chilean right, who nearly won the
presidential election in January, did not attend the small airport
ceremony honoring Pinochet's return. The few conservative
politicians who did come were quick to tell reporters that they
were there as private citizens, not as representatives of their
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Ricardo Lagos, the first Socialist president of Chile
since Pinochet overthrew Salvador Allende in 1973, have let it be
known that Pinochet is not invited to his inauguration March 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a great majority of the population,'' an editorial in the
daily La Tercera argued on Friday, ``Pinochet is now part of the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was at the height of his powers, Pinochet bragged that
``not a leaf shakes in Chile without my knowledge.'' And people
believed him, even after he gave up the presidency in 1990. The man
who ruled Chile for 17 years only stepped down after losing a
plebiscite, but he was able to negotiate a sweet deal from his
civilian opponents: He remained commander of the army until 1998,
then became a senator for life, thus gaining legal immunity and
lasting influence.
</P>
<P>
   But during his months under house arrest in Britain, he became,
in Chile, something akin to the emperor with no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something incredible has happened,'' said Armando de Ramon, a
noted historian. ``They humiliated him and did what they wanted to
him. And that is the reason this country has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the taboo subjects of disappearances and torture
became the daily grist of the news media as journalists covered the
charges made against Pinochet by prosecutors in Spain, Belgium,
France and other quarters. Local rights groups resuscitated
themselves, and torture victims began to organize. And younger
military officers _ concerned that Pinochet's legal woes would
damage the armed forces _ began to distance themselves from his
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's absence opened a vacuum, and the man who filled it
was a previously obscure appeals court judge in Santiago, Juan
Guzman. Early last year, Guzman came up with an inventive legal
interpretation that has jolted the military's impunity, opened the
way for the arrests of 40 former military and police officers and
forced the military to begin a dialogue with rights lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman's ruling, which has been upheld by the supreme court,
found that an amnesty declared by the Pinochet regime to protect
officers involved in political crimes between 1973 and 1978 could
not be applied to cases involving people who are still missing,
since the victims may still be alive as victims of ongoing
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly finding the missing people alive is unlikely. But this
interpretation has put pressure on the military to offer
information to family members who would like to bury their dead.
Otherwise, the officers face years of embarrassing prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman is now pushing ahead with the unthinkable: prosecuting
Pinochet himself. He has been assigned to investigate 60 criminal
complaints against the general, and he appears to be concentrating
on a possible connection between the former dictator and a
helicopter-borne death squad known as the Caravan of Death, which
removed 75 political prisoners from military and police prisons in
the month after the 1973 coup for summary executions and
clandestine burial.
</P>
<P>
   Since more than a dozen of the victims are still missing _ and
at least theoretically could be alive _ an investigation into the
death squad has already led to the prosecution of a retired general
who was a close aide to Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Before Guzman can indict Pinochet in the case, he will have to
seek the revocation of his senatorial immunity. That will not be
easy, especially because legislators are pushing a constitutional
amendment to allow the former dictator to step down from the Senate
but retain his immunity.
</P>
<P>
   But an indictment is not entirely out of the question, and Lavin
and other conservatives have said they will not stand in the way.
The conservatives still say they respect the former dictator's
economic accomplishments, but they read the opinion polls. And the
polls show that well over half of Chileans believe Pinochet should
face justice in Chile.

PITINO'S THE ONE TO BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless you're Rick Pitino's kid, these are not your father's
Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino and these Celtics do represent the resurrection of
truth in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   To the collective pique of many former franchise heroes, these
Celtics are the ironic predicament of last season's marketing
campaign. Looming above the streets of Boston were billboard
come-ons to fans from a team trumpeted as ``Rick Pitino's Boston
Celtics.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming them now requires guts.
</P>
<P>
   But to accuse the Celtics of being created in Pitino's image
would suggest the Boston coach is coyote ugly. They don't qualify
as hideous, but they are within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of their trip into the news this week is traced to
the tantrum Pitino unloaded after Wednesday's home loss to Vince
Carter's Toronto Raptors. Pitino's rant pointed the middle finger
at Boston fans and reporters, who in his estimation are negative in
the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because the Celtics used to be great in the
extreme. Such history created a level of expectation that would
terrify anyone who isn't receiving a pile of money to conquer it.
Rick banks about $7 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Celtics' president has attempted to
accelerate Pitino's success by hiring inappropriate players and
paying them grotesquely high piles of money.
</P>
<P>
   The president's name, of course, is Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, as the personnel boss, Rick stinks. The abridged version
of his blunders:
</P>
<P>
   -Drafting Chauncey Billups with the third pick in 1997 when
Tracy McGrady didn't go until the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   -Paying Antoine Walker even more money than the Celtics are
paying their president/coach.
</P>
<P>
   -Trading Andrew DeClerq and a first-round pick to Cleveland for
Vitaly Potakpenko. The Cavs used the pick to draft Andre Miller.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough for us.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino's disaster had nothing to do with judging talent and
everything to do with Ping-Pong.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons why the Celtics were able to lure Pitino
away from Kentucky where he was one of the nation's top sharpies
was the winning percentage he would inherit. That percentage
figured to qualify the Celtics for the first pick in the 1997 NBA
Draft, a pick that would yield some kid named Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtics were Ping-Ponged to pick No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the ego hasn't landed, but its wheels are
down.
</P>
<P>
   Motor City export
</P>
<P>
   According to most unsanctioned prophets, free-agent nominee
Grant Hill is expected to remain with the Detroit Pistons next
season.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one member of his buddy roster says Hill's desire
to win an NBA championship makes him a longshot to stay in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   His Duke education provided Hill with enough wisdom to calibrate
the distance between Detroit and another title.

   It's a hike.

<P>
   The lack-of-cap-room epidemic has infected the Pistons, whose
attempt to clear the salary of deserter Bison Dele off their books
may not provide enough relief to hire a big man who can make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons also are just good enough to eliminate the option of
being rescued by a high draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Another league source says Hill is keen on the idea of playing
for Michael Jordan's Wizards, whose renaissance is held hostage by
salary cap evils.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Sprite will obey Hill's thirst and sweeten their
endorsement deal to help mitigate the pain of signing for less than
the maximum market value. Nah.

   Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin continues earning support as the
early favorite to be the first college hotshot plucked in the 2000
NBA Draft. If you saw Thursday's game with DePaul, no explanation
is required. But you're probably howling over our tardy declaration
of this year's top Euro-prospect. Howl no longer. The name is
Iakovos Tsakalidis, and he's a 21-year-old, 7-foot-1 finesse
(skinny) center who plays for a Greek League team known as AEK.
Tsakalidis has yet to declare for draft inclusion, but could be
plucked in the middle of the first round when he does. ... Reports
of Miami offering Voshon Lenard and San Antonio dangling Avery
Johnson for Clipper Derek Anderson are swell fiction that's been
cannibalized by lazy reporters. ... Courtney Alexander, a
shoot-first, defend-never ``two'' guard at Fresno State, is making
scouts even more nervous than usual. Alexander, who's something of
a J.R. Rider rerun (on the court and off), challenged a few draft
inhibitions by dropping 40 points including the game-winning
35-foot bank in Wednesday's victory over San Jose State. But the
guy he was, ahem, guarding Spartan Cory Powell was 11 of 13 from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ... Vince Carter may be capable of dunking over a Macy's Parade
balloon, but refuses to slam during Raptors' practices. Must be a
commitment to conservation. ... According to high school watchdogs,
Cincinnati recruit Jerome ``Buddy'' Harper has been considering a
skip to the NBA for a while. The 6-5 shooting guard from South
Carolina may have little left to ponder. After Harper was charged
with assault last week, Cincinnati rescinded its scholarship offer.
Many informed witnesses rate Harper ahead of Fresno's DeShawn
Stevenson as the nation's best prep at the two-guard spot. One
scout said Harper's name could be called in the draft's first
round. ... It's no secret that second-year Clipper Brian Skinner is
attempting to replicate the hair style (and game) of Portland's
Brian Grant. But you may not know the 6-9, 260-pound Skinner began
his coiffure adjustment after receiving frequent autograph requests
by L.A.-area pedestrians who thought he was Laker Kobe Bryant.

   WASTE _ WASHINGTON _The reform movement, which has been
languishing in recent years, may be making a comeback in this
year's presidential elections. The war on waste and pork barrel
spending is seen as a powerful image in John McCain's insurgency
against politics as usual. Exit polls indicate that reform has a
strong appeal, especially for his backers. The message is one more
jarring one for the capital, where even Republicans have allowed
the crusade against waste and pork to languish in recent years.

States, Walker has the sometimes thankless task of heading the
agency that is the investigating arm of Congress. His General
Accounting Office is the chief watchdog for exposing waste and
mismanagement throughout the federal government. (Malone, Cox News

Now, facing their third deadline to reach an agreement, negotiators

negotiations may negate efforts to devise formulas for sharing the
waters of two major river basins. For instance, heavy use of
groundwater for crop irrigation in southwest Georgia has emerged as
a pivotal issue in the negotiations. The deliberators acknowledge
that so little is known about the impact of irrigation on river
flows in the region that several more years of intense study is
needed before they can some to a substantive agreement. When
Alabama triggered the water war 10 years ago by suing the Corps of
Engineers over metro Atlatna's water use, the irrigation issue was
not even regarded as a problem. (Seabrook, Atlanta

 &HT;    McCain the rebel could be facing last stand
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is the GOP primary equivalent of the Main Event:
Titanic Tuesday is coming, raising the question of whether it will
spell the end of the heavyweight bout between Gov. George W. Bush
and Arizona Sen. John McCain. Or will the competitors go another
round to March 14 or beyond?
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high: 613 delegates are up for grabs, more than
60 percent of the 1,034 needed to seize the nomination. Bush wants
to land a knockout punch in California, where he holds a wide lead
among Republicans. McCain's survival hinges on sweeping New England
and New York and perhaps winning a major state such as Ohio,
Tuesday's third-biggest prize with 69 GOP delegates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's rebel candidacy, his proven appeal to Democrats and
independents, has made this Republican primary season anything but
run-of-the-mill. So unpredictable is it that even the most seasoned
party-watchers hedge about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds still very much favor Governor Bush as they have all
along, but many people, myself included, have underestimated
Senator McCain's appeal all the way through, and so I think it's a
bit premature to write off his candidacy,'' said Atlanta pollster
Whit Ayers, a Republican who doesn't work for either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   California is the Holy Grail for Republicans. During the 1970s
and '80s, winning the state was a virtual lock on the White House.
Richard Nixon won in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984.
President Clinton changed that in the 1990s, taking California in
1992 and in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the state's top Republicans, including members of the
congressional delegation, are behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Republican in the nation who has done more to
reach out to women, Hispanics, Asians, African-Americans and
independents and Democrats than George W. Bush,'' U.S. Rep David
Dreir said in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can cast ballots Tuesday, but only Republican votes
count toward choosing California's 162 GOP delegates. With Bush's
overall lead far slimmer than his lead among Republicans, McCain
could wipe the glow off a Bush delegate win by seizing the popular
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp recognizes the possibility, but is more occupied
with counting delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lay of the land is that Governor Bush enjoys
strong support from the people who will be deciding the Republican
primary,'' said Bush adviser Mark McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist, said
that as much as Bush needs to win the ``beauty contest'' popular
vote in California, McCain needs it more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain wins the popular vote while Bush wins all the
delegates, and then McCain also has a Northeast slate of victories,
that just sets up a situation where party leaders will have to ask,
`What sense does it make to nominate somebody who has less of a
chance to win in November than McCain does?''' Buchanan said. ``All
those scenarios do is add more electoral weight to that very
pregnant question, which is the last hope of John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument is resonating with some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Mayor Susan Golding, one of the few high-profile
California Republicans backing McCain, said her man would be a
better November contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans have to remember that if California wants
to beat Al Gore, that the right candidate to do that with is John
McCain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's other super prize, New York, the outcome is
anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   It's a state where McCain had difficulty getting on the ballot,
given the state's complex election requirements. But the New York
GOP establishment, after the New Hampshire primary and with Bush's
belated blessing, finally agreed to let McCain on the ballot in all
counties.
</P>
<P>
   That was just in time for Bush to raise the ire of Catholics, a
huge part of New York's Republican Party, when he visited Bob Jones
University in his desperate bid to win South Carolina. McCain has
seized on that visit to appeal to Catholics, especially in New
York, forcing Bush to send an apology to New York's Cardinal John
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has since said he regrets not taking advantage of his visit
to Bob Jones to condemn that school's anti-Catholic views, and
Tuesday's vote may illustrate how Catholics have responded to
Bush's statements of regret.
</P>
<P>
   McCain either leads slightly or is in a dead heat in three New
York polls. The state's primary, open only to GOP voters, would be
an embarrassing one for Bush to lose, because he has been running
strong among Republican primary voters. A loss in New York could be
fatal, however, for McCain, who desperately needs a big state win
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers gives the McCain campaign points for doing ``a remarkable
job with the resources they've had,'' but he isn't putting money on
a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the laws of political gravity are about to assert
themselves,'' Ayers said. ``You can't win a Republican nomination
if you can't get Republican votes. The establishment does matter.
Money matters, especially in wars of attrition. None of those
political laws have been repealed.''

PITINO THE STAR IN BOSTON FOLLIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Boston coach Rick Pitino had a motto, it might be, ``I
confess, he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has been unwilling to take responsibility for virtually
anything during his misguided reign as Celtics coach, and finally,
things are beginning to fall apart in Beantown.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino, who has been under assault from the Boston media since
trying to trade Danny Fortson to Toronto for Alvin Williams last
month, is starting to wilt under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Pitino said he would not have left Kentucky and come
to Boston if he had known the Celtics would not finish high enough
in the draft lottery to select Tim Duncan or Keith Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   He must have forgotten to add a clause in his
multimillion-dollar deal with the Celtics that the ping-pong balls
had to be rigged in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're sitting on top of a national championship at
Kentucky and someone tells you you're not going to get Duncan - and
you have a championship-caliber team coming back - I think you'd be
pretty astute and say, well, maybe you'd be a little crazy and
maybe you should get examined at Mass. General if you're going to
walk into that situation,'' Pitino said. ``I think that's stating
the obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, who exactly was holding the gun to Pitino's head to
leave Kentucky? No one really knows.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino's heartfelt comments came a day after he lost his cool
while talking to the Boston media.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this negativity in this town sucks. ... It makes the
greatest town, the greatest city in the world, lousy,'' Pitino
said. ``The only thing that will turn this around is being upbeat
and positive, like we are in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bird, McHale and Parish, Cousy and Russell are not walking
through those doors. What is walking through those doors are young
players who are going to be prone to mistakes at times until they
get experience, who are going to play hard and try to play exciting
basketball - and not always succeed at doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   It all seems to make sense, until you examine what Pitino has
done in Boston since being deprived of Duncan or Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   He wasted the third pick in the '97 draft on Chauncey Billups,
then traded him to Toronto. He drafted Ron Mercer with the sixth
pick, and traded him to Denver for Fortson.
</P>
<P>
   He acquired Vitaly Potapenko. He signed Travis Knight to a $22
million deal before shipping him back to the Lakers. He sent Eric
Williams to Denver in '97, then brought him back in '99. He did the
same thing to Fortson last month.
</P>
<P>
   It's the horrible wheeling-and-dealing, not the draft lottery,
that is responsible for Pitino's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzly situation: The back-stabbing has begun in Vancouver,
just as the Grizzlies are showing promise as a franchise.
``Consultant'' Dick Versace is secretly sending his own handpicked
scouts to games that official Grizzlies scouts are already
attending.
</P>
<P>
   GM Stu Jackson is expected to be fired soon, a move that will
result in dissension. Star forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim has said
that if Jackson's contract is not extended, he wants to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Not giving up: The Wizards, or more importantly, Michael Jordan,
are expected to make another run at Toronto guard Doug Christie
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Washington nearly completed a deal sending Ike Austin and Tracy
Murray to Toronto in exchange for Christie and guard Dee Brown, but
it fell apart just before the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Wizards coach Darrell Walker, who coached Christie in Toronto,
would like to be reunited with the shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   Add Wizards: Magic Johnson always has an opinion on Jordan's
dealings, and had this to say when asked about Jordan's grand plan
for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what he's going to do? He's going to unload
everything and wait for Vince Carter! Ha ha!'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Canada: In what other country could curling outdraw Vince
Carter in the TV ratings?
</P>
<P>
   It's true, but don't blame Canadians as failing to appreciate
the Raptors' superstar forward. NBA rules limit the Raptors'
broadcast market to 120 kilometers from Toronto. That has
restricted the growth of the Raptors - and Carter - throughout
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences for Raptors games are limited to 55,000-80,000 viewers
because of the access problem.
</P>
<P>
   New owner? Frankie Muniz, the 14-year-old star of the new Fox
series ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' is also a basketball fan, or at
least a fan of bad basketball.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared on CBS' ``The Early Show'' this week and was asked
by Jane Clayson if he has a ``backup plan'' should he leave acting
one day.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz: ``I'd like to be a geographer, own the L.A. Clippers, be
on the PGA Tour or be in the Blue Man Group.''

TRUE GRIT IN LEGACY OF FAMILY'S CALAMITOUS SCORE OF DEATHS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Mo. _ When 82-year-old Rosetta Frakes Parks died of
diabetes in a nursing home in nearby Waverly three years ago, her
obituary noted that she had been preceded in death by several
brothers, sisters, half brothers and half sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Several? How about 20 _ lost one by one over the years to
tetanus, dropsy, tuberculosis, snakebite, meningitis, bad
mushrooms, auto accidents, suicide, appendicitis, murder,
influenza, brain tumors and cholera.
</P>
<P>
   And of all of them, only two brothers, Lincoln Frakes, who died
at 72 in 1968, and Grant Frakes, who died at 92 in 1994, and one
sister, Lulu Frakes Lockwood, who died at 88 in 1986, lived
anywhere close to a long life.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty out of 25 siblings in what one relative calls a ``family
tragedy.'' The family in this case began with a man who in the
course of his life had married two women, having 13 children with
one and 12 with the second.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a tragedy that _ through a stack of death certificates
and newspaper clippings _ opens a window to another side of the
20th century American experience.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, what happened to the Frakes occurred a mere 70 miles
from the bright lights of Kansas City, a place for most of this
century considered a refuge from the hardscrabble ways of rural
Missouri. In Kansas City were medical treatments, a modicum of
safety and 9-to-5 jobs that took people away from the dangers of
living off the land.
</P>
<P>
   Those 70 miles might as well have been a thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Frakes still are living. Charles ``Hap'' Frakes, 82,
lives in Grand Pass, Mo. Illness in his middle years robbed him of
most of his memories about the past.
</P>
<P>
   But Daisy Frakes Campbell, 68, who lives east of here near
Orearville, remembers all too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen,'' she said. ``You can't be bitter. You can't
blame anybody for all the troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Tyler of Kansas City, a daughter of Hap's, said she
stumbled onto what she calls the Frakes' ``calamities'' while
researching the family genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about Job,'' she said. ``This family had sufferings most
of us can't imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Tyler said, she's been inspired by what she can only
describe as their grit and tenacity, qualities the Frakes somehow
coupled with an incredible dignity. She recalls that Rosetta _ two
years before her death and just after her husband died in a highway
accident in which she also was injured _ proclaimed: ``All us
Frakes are tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch was Aaron Albert Frakes, farmer, Missouri River
fisherman and occasional moonshiner. A photograph taken of Aaron
with his first wife, Mary Elizabeth Parsons Frakes, shows him with
three revolvers in his belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was rough and tough,'' Daisy said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron died at home in 1950 of stomach and intestinal cancer at
age 78. The death certificate noted he had no Social Security
number.
</P>
<P>
   Mary died in 1922 at age 44 while giving birth to her 13th
child, Jimmy, who weighed, according to family memory, 23 pounds
and was stillborn.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Mary's children died young. Viola, 2, died of a
snakebite in 1895; Cindia, 10 months, cholera, 1909; Ella, 8 days
old, tetanus, 1911; and Elmer, 3, mushroom poisoning, 1915.
</P>
<P>
   After Mary died, Aaron, widowed and with youngsters at home
sometime in late 1922 or 1923, headed south to Hickory County.
There he ``bought'' Hazel Girtha Adams, then 15 or 16, for $25. And
married her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember talking to her mother and my grandmother,'' Daisy
said, ``and she said that money was all that was between them and
starvation. Things like that happened in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazel would have 12 children by Aaron before she died in 1947 of
a throat infection at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   By then, though, other misfortunes had befallen the family. Soon
after Aaron arrived back home with his new bride, his 19-year-old
son from his first marriage, Willie, became smitten with his
stepmother. In September 1923, Willie committed suicide by putting
a shotgun to his heart and pulling the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Bessie Frakes Foote, injured by a fall from a horse in the late
1920s or early 1930s, was committed to a state hospital in
Missouri, diagnosed with an unspecified mental illness. She
remained institutionalized until her death from tuberculosis in
1954.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Frakes Sanderson, 31, died at home in 1936 in Miami
Station, Mo., of a stomach infection, nine months after undergoing
an appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth Frakes, 11, died of a brain tumor in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy recollected Mary Elizabeth's burial. At the cemetery,
Daisy recalled, the casket was lowered into a grave partly filled
with seep water that gurgled and bubbled as it covered the coffin.
Amid that came the weeping and protestations of the child's mother,
Hazel, who said, ``God, please don't put her in that awful water.''
</P>
<P>
   Girtha Frakes, 14, died in 1939 in Kansas City of what was
called dropsy.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Dale Frakes, who was named for his stillborn half brother,
was stillborn in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Inez Marie Frakes simply disappeared. Daisy thinks she may have
been killed in a car accident in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   After Hazel's death, the misfortunes continued.
</P>
<P>
   Della Frakes, 15, was fatally injured in 1948 when she was
struck by a bullet as she walked into the line of fire of her
brother, Aaron Louis Frakes, while he was target shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Lee Frakes, 30, working as a gas station attendant in
Kansas City, was shot to death in 1954 in a botched armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Cindia Ellen Frakes Morrow, 30, was killed in 1958 when the
rifle she was carrying while berry hunting discharged, the bullet
striking her in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Donnell Frakes, 25, died in a car crash in Independence in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Louis Frakes, 34, injured in an industrial accident and
suffering what he termed ``constant pain,'' killed himself with a
handgun in North Charleston, S.C., in 1969. Family members said he
never recovered from the shooting accident that took the life of
his sister, Della, 21 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Frakes, 37, was shot to death at Malta Bend, Mo., after
what apparently was an argument over hunting dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Frakes McComber died in Marshall in 1984, the victim of a
stroke at age 54.
</P>
<P>
   A snapshot, which years ago people called a ``Kodak,'' shows
five of the Frakes youngsters among schoolmates sometime in the
1930s. Four are Frakes girls, wearing feed sack dresses. Their
faces are clean, their hair combed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look here,'' said Daisy, pointing at the photograph. ``See
Cindia Ellen. See she has a dark sock on one foot and a light sock
on the other? That's how poor we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in letters before her death, Rosetta would describe a happy
childhood, one with plenty of food, abundant game down in the
Missouri River timber, and how every spring meant not only a run of
fish for the men and bounty in the big garden, but flowers blooming
for the women. Spring along the river, Rosetta wrote, was like
Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy says the Frakes were never victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my family,'' she said. ``There's an empty place in my
heart. I go to the cemetery and I wish I could hold my mother in my
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't blame nobody. Things just happen.''

HERSHISER: TOO EARLY TO GET SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. - Even though Orel Hershiser is competing
for a spot in the Dodgers' starting rotation, he has a message:
Don't even start evaluating for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first spring start of Hershiser's Reunion Tour, the
right-hander allowed two wind-aided solo homers in one inning -
including one to ultra-light hitting Rey Ordonez - and had to pitch
out of a bases-loaded,none-out jam in his other inning of work
against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But Hershiser said none of that matters because he threw mostly
fastballs with a few sinkers mixed in. He'll incorporate a few
breaking balls and change-ups into his next outing, possibly throw
all breaking balls the next time out before easing into his
repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing glorified BP (batting practice),'' Hershiser
said Saturday. ``This will be fun for three more weeks and then
it'll get serious. The last couple of outings it will come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 17-year veteran with a vast knowledge of pitching and
coming off a 13-win season with the Mets, Hershiser's provided the
type of slack that doesn't exist for Carlos Perez, the closest
competitor for a starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of the rotation is set with Kevin Brown, Chan Ho
Park and Darren Dreifort. It leaves Hershiser, Perez and rookie
Eric Gagne to fill the last two spots. While Gagne is a near-lock
to start, Hershiser could begin the season in the bullpen, which he
knew when he signed as a free agent during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orel was just getting his work,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``He knows what day it is. The first time out, the
second time out, it's just getting your work in. Hopefully, the
guys are throwing strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Center of attention: Knowing who wins the center field job -
Todd Hollandsworth or Devon White - is a long way away, but if
Johnson's prognostication is accurate, the veteran White will have
to play well to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my pick to click this spring,'' Johnson said of
Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers suggest there is another possibility. Though neither
Johnson nor general manager Kevin Malone care to address the issue
at this point, a platoon seems possible. The left-handed-hitting
Hollandsworth has a .272 career average with a .325 on-base
percentage. The switch-hitting White was much better from the right
side last season. He hit .288 and had a .367 on-base percentage
against left-handers compared to .260 and .323, respectively,
against right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Garth: Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw considers himself a huge
Garth Brooks fan, but not big enough to groove a fastball so the
country music star can get a hit. Instead, Shaw struck out Brooks
on a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julie (Shaw's wife) and I were talking about it just this
morning and then I heard the crowd and I'm like, `Oh, my God,' `'
Shaw said. ``He didn't even smile. He just came in there and got
ready. I struck him out twice, but (the umpire) didn't call it a
strike the first time. Then I threw the same pitch and he had to
ring (Brooks) up. Guess he didn't wantto do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Right-hander Chan Ho Park allowed one run in two
innings and struggled with his control. ``He was flying open
occasionally and air-mailing the ball up, but when he didn't I
thought he looked pretty crisp,'' Johnson said.... After stressing
fundamentals for two weeks, the Dodgers committed two more
blunders. A day after having two baserunners thrown out, Shawn
Green was picked off first and Mark Grudzielanek was late covering
second on a stolen base.... Righty Robinson Checo, who filed
insufficient documentation for a visa, has been cleared to leave
the Dominican Republic and should be in camp Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS vs. METS
</P>
<P>
   When/Where: 11 a.m.; at Holman Stadium, Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Channel 5; XTRA 1150 AM
</P>
<P>
   Today's game: Staff ace Kevin Brown makes his first spring start
and will be followed by righty Eric Gagne, the leading candidate
for the fourth spot in the rotation. Lefty Al Leiter starts for the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's result: For the second straight day the Dodgers
surrendered four homers and lost to the Mets 7-3 on the road. Chan
Ho Park gave up a solo homer and Orel Hershiser allowed two homers.
Angel Pena homered for the Dodgers.

AT THE 11TH HOUR, BRADLEY CRANKS UP THE ENERGY  
 GORE LINKS GOP TO FAR RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just before 10 a.m. Saturday, on a chilly morning in
Washington Square Park, former Sen. Bill Bradley returned to the
neighborhood where he had come the day after his narrow loss in New
Hampshire. Back in early February, Bradley was greeted by hundreds
of supporters, cheering him on as he turned his fight from New
Hampshire to the New York primary. But on Saturday, with the
primary three days away, Bradley gazed over a sparse crowd of
students scattered over expanses of empty concrete.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley was dispirited by the turnout, he did not reveal it.
Instead, he plunged into the speech that got him where he is today,
reprising some of the same jokes he had used in his last
appearance. And from there, he embarked on an exhausting day that
took him to Brooklyn, the Upper West Side, the Bronx and, finally,
to Missouri for a political dinner. Bradley's schedule called for
him to return to Buffalo, N.Y., to be ready for two early-morning
Sunday talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   There is little optimism in Bradley's camp this weekend, as his
aides gird for the series of primaries on Tuesday that most
Democrats believe will dispatch Bradley from the race, leaving Vice
President Al Gore the Democrats' presumptive nominee for president.
But that does not seem to have discouraged Bradley, who is
campaigning this weekend with the kind of blind energy usually
exhibited by a candidate locked in the tightest of races.
</P>
<P>
   The creases on Bradley's baggy face suggest the fatigue of a
candidate who has been at this for close to a year, yet on Saturday
he raced from stop to stop, handshake to handshake and storefront
to storefront, lingering to answer questions from anyone who wanted
to talk to him about education, Medicare, the IRS or, inevitably,
the New York Knicks. He gave a speech on foreign policy on Friday
and is planning to be in three states on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in short, acting as if a display of sheer energy in these
potentially final hours will, if not win him any elections, at
least leave a graceful impression on the public, assuming it is
even paying much attention to this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help me out on Tuesday!'' Bradley bellowed in Brooklyn, in the
Bronx and in front of Zabar's, a famous food emporium on the Upper
West Side of Manhattan. ``What's your name?'' he inquired again and
again, as he hustled to keep pace with his energetic wife,
Ernestine.
</P>
<P>
   He posed happily with Edward Koch, the former mayor and one of
his chief New York supporters, at the Washington Square Park rally,
which was about two blocks from Koch's apartment. (Koch said he
would have gone to the end of the world to campaign for Bradley on
Saturday morning _ well, at least, he quickly added, ``to the end
of the borough.'') Bradley listened as his other top New York
supporter, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., compared the
reception Bradley found on the Upper West Side to what Moynihan
said he had witnessed when Franklin Delano Roosevelt visited the
same neighborhood when running for president 60 years before.
</P>
<P>
   And he went into Zabar's, sweeping into the store with a wave of
reporters and Secret Service agents. Once inside, he shed his
jacket, donned a Zabar's cap and apron, and headed for the deli
counter to pose for the kind of photograph that tends to play well
to Jewish voters who are so prominent in the neighborhood and in
the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   All seemed to be going fine until a few of Bradley's more
politically experienced New York supporters _ starting with Ronnie
Eldridge, a member of the City Council _ suddenly noticed that a
reporter had noticed that Bradley was happily slicing away at a big
ham, as the cameras clicked away. ``It's turkey! It's turkey!''
Eldridge whispered urgently, if perhaps disingenuously.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bradley's aides quietly took the candidate by the arm.
``Senator, we're going to go cut some lox.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE LINKS GOP RIVALS TO FAR RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Vice President Al Gore said Saturday that both major
Republican presidential candidates were in league with the party's
``right-wing extremist wing.''
</P>
<P>
   He painted a sinister picture of both candidates conspiring with
the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out and Falwell and Robertson slap `em on the back
and say, `We heard everything we wanted to hear,''' Gore told 2,000
people packed into the narrow cobblestone streets around Boston's
Faneuil Hall. ``Let me break that code for you. What they're saying
is, they heard a solemn promise to give the right-wing extremist
wing of the Republican Party control of our Supreme Court and the
interpretation of our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in New York, Gore attended a fund-raiser on the Upper
East Side of Manhattan where he raised $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few days from now, New York will have the decisive vote
in picking the Democratic nominee,'' he said. ``Both Senator
Bradley and I agree that it's the vote on Tuesday that will
determine the nomination. And so, New York's voice is louder than
ever before and that's saying something,'' Gore said.

LANGHAM CLOSER TO FIRST VICTORY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Franklin Langham has never won on the PGA Tour. Yet,
after Saturday's steady third round, Langham will begin Sunday with
his best chance for victory.
</P>
<P>
   Langham shot a four-under-par 68 to take a three-shot lead into
the final round of the Doral-Ryder Open. He is at 19 under par
(197). Jim Furyk, who also shot 68, was in second place at 16 under
par, while Stephen Ames was in third place at 15 under.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Langham handles the pressure
of being the man to catch at the Doral Golf Resort and Spa, because
until you have won on tour, doubt can easily creep in. However,
Langham responded Saturday when he was challenged, shaking off an
early double-bogey on No. 3 and playing solid golf thereafter. Will
anyone be able to catch Langham? Those in pursuit were not waiting
for him to fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll be able catch him just making a bunch of
pars,'' said Furyk, who is pursuing his fifth career victory. ``He
has been playing great golf, and I've always felt more comfortable
with a lead heading into the final round, rather than having to
make up ground. He's in good position, so somebody will have to
make a run at him. Hopefully, it will be me, but one of us probably
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Shigeki Maruyama (14 under par) and Nick Price (13 under par)
were also within striking distance. Langham, who started the day
with a 3-stroke lead, has played three rounds in the 60's _
66-63-68 _ and in his 101st start on tour, he may finally be able
to break through.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't win, I'm sure I'll be disappointed,'' said Langham,
31, a native of Augusta, Ga. ``I'm sure I'll be nervous, excited,
all of those things. I expect it. I expected it today. That's one
of the reasons why I played well. Whether I was three ahead or
three behind, I have put myself in position to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Langham showed his resiliency after the par-4 No. 3, when he
pulled his tee shot, then hit his second shot into the water, which
led to his double-bogey. Many players who have never won would have
folded at that point. But not Langham. After Price went to 15 under
par and briefly took a one-stroke lead, Langham responded with
birdies on Nos. 6, 7 and 8 to reach 17 under par, and he maintained
his composure from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never panicked,'' said Langham, who has shown a steady
putting stroke on his ride to the top of the leader board. ``One
reason why I stayed calm is that I'm playing so well. It's
different when you're struggling and something bad happens to you.
But when you're playing well, you feel confident.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child living in the Augusta area, Langham worked several
Masters tournaments as a scoreboard operator, and he has dreamed of
playing in that fabled tournament. But unfortunately for Langham,
he will not qualify for next month's Masters even if he wins on
Sunday. Tour winners used to automatically qualify for the Masters,
but the qualifications have been changed, and the world ranking is
now used as one of the qualifications for the Masters. Langham is
171st in the world ranking, nowhere near the top 50 who will
automatically qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure would be nice to get in the Masters, but maybe if a
local boy wins, they'll think about changing it back to how it used
to be,'' Langham said. ``But the way I look at it, if I do well
here, it will move me closer to making the Masters next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ames was in close pursuit of Langham for most of the day, but a
double-bogey on No. 16 cost Ames dearly. It was the toughest day of
the tournament at the Blue Monster, as the long-awaited wind
finally arrived and made the course far more challenging. A 65 by
Robert Damron was the day's best score, but the barrage of birdies
died down, and players had a far more difficult time with club
selection.

   Price was eight under through 15 holes, but he bogeyed Nos. 14
and 17 to give away key strokes. Though he hit the ball
beautifully, putting remained a problem for Price, as he missed
several putts within striking distance on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   But while Price left the course wondering what might have been,
Langham left the course wondering what would happen Sunday. Often,
the first victory is the hardest to get, and Langham hoped his
first victory would come Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they'll be firing at me, because I'm a marked man
now,'' Langham said. ``I have to expect that. But if I play well,
I'll have a great chance.'' &QL;

 &HT;    CONFIDENT OF NOMINATION, GORE ROAD TESTS ANTI-GOP CAMPAIGN
THEMES
 &HT;    For Sunday, March 5
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Vice President Al Gore, confident of a ``Super
Tuesday'' primary victory over Democratic challenger Bill Bradley,
road-tested campaign themes against Republican presidential rivals
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   His most potent weapon against the GOP nominee, judging from his
emphasis during a swing through Massachusetts and New York, is the
economy, the strongest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue now is whether or not we're going to keep that
prosperity going or whether or not we're going to take the advice
of both Republican candidates and take a right wing U-turn back to
the old polices of the past,'' Gore said during a rally at Boston's
historic Faneuil (pronounced FAN-yuhl) Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also raised environmental issues in his criticism of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain, something he has
rarely done in the Democratic contest with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the environment, just remember two numbers _ zero and one,
since this is the digital age,'' Gore said of the GOP presidential
contenders:
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them in the Senate two years ago had a zero rating from
the League of Conservation Voters. The other one is the governor of
a state which he has just led to the position of number one in air
pollution, number one in water pollution, number one in land
pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   He also ripped Bush for his anti-abortion stand, noting that the
Texas governor had met privately in the past with televangelists
Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. He said the ``code'' language
Robertson and Falwell used following the meeting indicated Bush
would appoint Supreme Court justices committed to overturning Roe
v. Wade, the court ruling that granted abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're saying is they had a solid promise to give the
right wing extremist wing of the Republican Party control of our
Supreme Court and the interpretation of our Constitution,'' Gore
said. ``Let's stop that.''
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed Bush's recent concession that he would allow
voluntary trigger locks on firearms. ``That's not the issue,'' Gore
said. ``The issue is we want to make mandatory child safety
locks.''
</P>
<P>
   And later, during a speech in Buffalo, he criticized the two
Republican candidates for opposing health care reforms and hate
crime legislation backed by Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore barely mentioned Bradley in a morning speech to several
hundred people who gathered on a sunny, brisk day in the square in
front of Faneuil Hall, which was built in 1742 and has provided a
forum for a number of historic figures, including Samuel Adams,
Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony and John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's passing reference to Bradley was to remind voters that
both he and his challenger have said that Tuesday's primary voting
in 15 states, including Massachusetts, ``will be the decisive
moment'' in the campaign for the Democratic campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You here in Massachusetts ... have an opportunity to close the
book on the Democratic nomination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' two senators, Ted Kennedy and John Kerry, joined
Gore on the stage and in the attacks on the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry ridiculed Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' with a
joke about Bob Jones III, president of Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, and John Rocker, the Atlanta Brave pitcher who made
inflammatory remarks about minorities, gays and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The definition of George Bush's compassionate conservative
(cq.) is Bob Jones III forgiving John Rocker,'' Kerry quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Bob Jones University prohibited inter-racial
dating, barred gays from its campus and regarded Catholicism as a
false religion.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a Catholic, also took note of Bush's appearance at Bob
Jones and McCain's criticism of the Christian right's influence on
the GOP's nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that the only thing these Republican candidates
can talk about is religion,'' Kennedy said. ``But neither one of
them has a prayer against Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy added to the general election atmosphere of Gore's final
weekend of campaigning before ``Super Tuesday'' by making jokes
about possible running mates for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had found a note in one pocket asking him to remind
Gore that New York has 33 electoral votes. He said it was signed,
``Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he found another note addressed ``Dear Dad,'' asking him
to remind Gore that Rhode Island has only 8 electoral votes. He
said the note, supposedly from his son, Rep. Patrick Kennedy of
Rhode Island, cautioned the senator against reminding Gore that the
younger Kennedy is only 32, too young under the U.S. Constitution
to be vice president.

PROSPECTS FOR BRADLEY, MCCAIN IN MISSOURI VOTE LOOK BLEAK

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Her index finger tracing a horizontal line
across a printout of Independence voters, Bowen Hinton matches name
to number and punches another seven digits into the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello,'' she begins, the smile on her face seeping into her
voice.
</P>
<P>
   She's a local volunteer for the Bill Bradley campaign, Hinton
tells one caller after the next. ``May I,'' she asks, ``talk to you
about the senator?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, she says hurriedly, would be the first president from
Missouri since Harry Truman and is of ``the highest
integrity....Can the senator count on your vote?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the calls end up on answering machine tape. Nearly as
many are cut short. The person is Republican, or anti-abortion, or
simply not in the mood for politics.
</P>
<P>
   A few times she actually finds Democrats who plan to vote in the
Tuesday primary. Sometimes they like Bradley. Sometimes...
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh...and you're in support of the vice president.''
Disappointment fights against enthusiasm in her voice. ``Well,
thank you so much for your time.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurgency campaigns of Bradley and Sen. John McCain, his
Republican counterpart, limp toward the Missouri primary with
political insiders betting ever heavier on their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Polls in this Midwestern bellwether suggest that especially
among people most likely to vote Tuesday _ the core of activists in
the respective parties _ Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush reflect the sheen of probable victors.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the political regulars, analysts say, both Bradley
and McCain must draw people to the primaries who do not walk a
party line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who is campaigning as an outsider, primarily without
the support of leaders in his own party, must appeal to people who
don't normally get involved,'' said Robert Salisbury, a professor
of American politics at Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost by definition, those are the hardest voters to
energize,'' he said. ``They're not involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's effort is undercut because even though only a handful
of delegates to the nominating convention have been chosen, he has
yet to notch a single victory. It has been hard to get traction as
the other maverick has drawn away many of the independents and even
some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has won a few primaries, but he's lost more. And his
standing in the polls and with the press suffered recently when the
``Straight Talk Express'' at first denied and then owned up to
being behind a hard-hitting phone bank assault that hinted that
Bush was anti-Catholic. Then came his attack on Christian
activists, who have been pounding him.
</P>
<P>
   At their core, however, the intra-Republican and -Democrat
splits in Missouri and the country are between party establishments
and renegades. The resources that organize voters and attract
publicity are nearly all with Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a midtown Kansas City news conference held by Bradley
supporters at noon Friday. The campaign played two Bradley
television commercials, though it was uncertain whether the spots
ever would run in Kansas City. And it called on two college
students, a professor, a member of the Missouri Democratic
Committee, a woman who grew up in Bradley's hometown of Crystal
City and a former union official.
</P>
<P>
   Although they all argued that Bradley was energizing the
disaffected, they came up short on evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown an hour later, Gore backers filled the Jackson County
legislative chambers with union painters, firefighters, electrical
workers and Teamsters. The room held at least a dozen elected
officials, including a member of the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   And former Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver recounted a series
of major local projects _ the Bruce R. Watkins Drive, repair of the
Chouteau Bridge, development of the 18th &AMP; Vine District _ and gave
Gore credit for sending federal money for each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver didn't bother to compare Gore with Bradley, choosing
instead to look to the general election in November. He noted that
McCain had opposed some of those grants in the Senate and argued
that Bush was an untested executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need,'' Cleaver said, ``somebody who is polished.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who stumped in St. Louis and Springfield on Wednesday, was
bringing out a host of big guns to bolster his efforts in Missouri.
Former GOP Chairman Haley Barbour was in St. Charles County on
Friday. Former presidential contender Elizabeth Dole was booked for
Cape Girardeau in southeast Missouri and Callaway County in
mid-Missouri on Saturday. And Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri was to
barnstorm across the state for Bush throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have quite a lot of stuff going on,'' said Catherine
Hanaway, Bush's executive director in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has campaign organizations in more than 80 of the state's
114 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my chances here in Missouri,'' Bush said when he
visited Kansas City last week. Upshot of speech
</P>
<P>
   Meantime the McCain cause staggered in southern Missouri's
``Bible Belt'' following his harsh criticism of Christian
conservative leaders Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as ``forces of
evil.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Mark Wright, a Springfield Republican, said McCain's
comments were a hot topic in his die-hard conservative district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minimal support that he had, he lost because of those
comments,'' Wright said. ``I think there's zero support for him in
this area now.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Some southwest Missouri Republicans were
particularly incensed at the comments directed at Falwell, a
graduate of Baptist Bible College in Springfield, a school that
Wright also attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in this area,'' Wright said, ``are very, very
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Once impressed with McCain's life story, Mike Cierpiot of
Independence also is switching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way over the line,'' Cierpiot said of the denunciation of
Robertson and Falwell. ``There was no reason to do that stuff. He
was doing well until that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The signals for McCain were mixed. Polls continued to show the
senator from Arizona behind. Yet two Zogby surveys indicated McCain
had cut a 34-point gap to only nine by Thursday. Similarly, a poll
commissioned by The Kansas City Star taken last weekend had the
race at 48 percent to 36 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Missouri chairman, Rolla lawyer David Steelman, spoke
of a groundswell for the senator that keeps his phone ringing and
makes it hard for him to get any work done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a nuclear bomb going off,'' said Steelman, a
longtime GOP activist. ``It's fun. I've never seen anything like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steelman said the divide between elected politicians, who are
almost all backing Bush, and those rank-and-file voters who back
McCain, has never been more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Only one member of the General Assembly, Steelman's wife, Sen.
Sarah Steelman, has endorsed McCain. Bush boasts of endorsements
from eight state senators and 43 House members.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has no paid staff members working the state,
Bush will have nine by Tuesday. Late campaigning
</P>
<P>
   Bradley backers in Missouri said enthusiasm for the former
senator remained high, although more than a few expressed doubts
that he ultimately could upend Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a last-minute surge, but it's unlikely,'' said
Rebecca Cook, the Missouri secretary of state who is one of the
former senator's best-known supporters.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Bill Skaggs, a Kansas City Democrat, pointed to The
Star poll last week that had Bradley trailing Gore 53 percent to 33
percent in Missouri, Bradley's native state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's true, then I think Bradley is in trouble across the
country,'' Skaggs said. ``It sure looks like Bradley and McCain
have both fallen on hard times the last couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was to make a stop Saturday evening in Hannibal, where
Democrats were holding one of their annual Democrat Days
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also made some last-minute plans to campaign in Missouri,
with an election eve stop Monday night in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the vice president's campaign planned to fan out
throughout Kansas City on Saturday to pass out literature. Weekend
telephone banks were expected to be operating full-tilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley will make a final push here, so we need to stay
on our toes,'' said Gavin Lodge, who was leading Gore's Kansas City
office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, evidence that Bradley or McCain were on the verge of
scoring upsets in Missouri has yet to surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk of them fighting over independent
voters, but those voters are hard to get in primaries to begin
with,'' said Stephen Caliendo, an expert on public opinion
research, at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ``It's
especially hard to get those people when people don't think you
have much chance of winning to begin with.''

REORGANIZATION BRINGS WRENCHING CHANGES TO CREATIVE WORKERS AT
HALLMARK CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hallmark Cards Inc., keeper of one of the
world's best-known brands, is shedding many of its old ways in a
drive to triple sales to $12 billion by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Some changes, such as consolidating various marketing
departments and shifting some production jobs to more modern
facilities, already have been made. Other changes are designed to
make the enormous, 90-year-old Kansas City company more nimble and
responsive to modern-day customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new structure allows Hallmark to focus clearly on the
consumer, bringing relevant products to the marketplace more
quickly,'' Chief Executive Officer Irvine O. Hockaday said last
month when Hallmark announced record 1999 sales of $4.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus on the consumer, combined with new products, new
business ventures and synergies among Hallmark's family of
companies, will help us achieve our growth targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Hallmark management is reorganizing the company's
1,100-person creative department _ the lifeblood of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Although that department makes up only 10 percent of the
company's North American work force, those artists _ illustrators,
sculptors, calligraphers, writers, photographers and others _ give
the company its soul. Their ideas are translated into Hallmark
greeting cards, gift wrap, party favors, picture frames, photo
albums, collectibles and more.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization of the creative department includes a new
``team'' approach to its creative process. The department has been
evaluated, collectively and individually. Top management says the
reorganization will require a different mix of creative skills.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Barker, Hallmark's senior vice president of creative
product development, said some employees would no longer have a
place in the new department. That prospect has fueled fear in the
ranks of the privately owned company, which has a longstanding
reputation for job security and an unusually comfortable corporate
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star interviewed a dozen of Hallmark's creative
employees with the agreement that their names would not be
published. All said they feared reprisals ranging from write-ups in
their personnel files to being fired if they spoke on the record.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark spokesman Steve Doyal, while saying that no one would
have been so punished, said he understood the desire for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed work at varying job levels in an array of
artistic disciplines _ photography, illustration, product planning
and others.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed, although a small sampling of the creative
department, used strikingly similar terms to characterize the
emotions sweeping the department: fear, anxiety, paranoia, even
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is, `Apply so much pressure, and see who breaks.'
If you don't break, you get to stay another year.''
</P>
<P>
   And, ``it's not the change _ it's whether or not you're going to
have a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker said he understood that some employees were anxious. He
also acknowledged some shortcomings in management's handling of the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask people to be patient,'' Barker said.  &LR; brk:External
pressures
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark first committed itself to a wide-ranging reorganization
in 1995. Shortly thereafter, it formed what it calls its North
American Management Team.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several years _ when the company saw sales gains
slip from 11.8 percent in 1995 to 5.5 percent in 1996 and 2.7
percent in 1997 _ it set out to think beyond traditional
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Hallmark announced that it intended to triple sales
by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   To reach that goal, Hallmark identified six business areas that
earned a total of $120 billion in annual U.S. sales. The aim is to
gain 10 percent of that total to reach Hallmark's $12 billion goal.
</P>
<P>
   The six areas: greetings; caring gifts; memories (including
albums, scrapbooks and a recently acquired chain of portrait
studios); life celebrations (party wares, gift wrap, ornaments and
more); personal development (products that help develop
creativity); and family entertainment (television and cable
production). The creative staff will support the first four areas
primarily, the two others to a lesser degree.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning the horizon, Hallmark saw a rapidly changing world.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark remains the dominant player in the sentiment industry,
claiming 55 percent of the revenue in the greeting card market.
</P>
<P>
   But new competition is everywhere, from the Internet to smaller
companies grabbing chunks of market share to free-lance
illustrators who are getting products in the marketplace at
lightning speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would encourage (the creative staff) to take a hard look at
what's happening on the outside,'' said Barker, displaying a
newspaper article about Vicky Howard, an Overland Park artist whose
decorative products business does about $35 million in annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is happening everywhere,'' Barker said. ``I want to have
a work process where we can unleash the creative capabilities that
I know are there ...and I know that our work flow today doesn't
allow that to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time Hallmark's product development has been linear.
For instance, after an idea for a Mother's Day card is conceived, a
designer might give the idea to an illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   After the illustrator does the main artwork, the card might be
handed off to a writer to do the card's text. Further design work
and committee review would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a process sometimes took two years to get a product to
market. In today's fast-moving marketplace, such a lag could spell
corporate doom.
</P>
<P>
   To reorganize its creative staff, Hallmark is changing from the
linear process to a team approach. A core group of creative people
will bring in others as needed and then see a product through from
concept to completion.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for increasing use of new technology,
including millions of images that Hallmark has digitally archived
for almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   A recent pilot project using the new model moved one product to
market in 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   Using that model for the 1,100-person creative staff, Hallmark
officials say they will need fewer workers for some positions, such
as illustrators, and more for others, such as designers.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting the reorganization, Hallmark conducted a talent
assessment of the department to show how strong _ or weak _ the
creative staff was.
</P>
<P>
   Employees were asked to put together two display panels of their
best work. Employees were told the panels would be used only to
assess the depth and breadth of the talent pool, not to compare
each employee's talent against their peers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, such comparisons were made.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Barker said management didn't think the
process through, which he regretted, but the process was new to him
and the rest of management. Although individual employees are
evaluated regularly, Hallmark had never done a departmental
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   After the work samples were pulled together, managers judged
each creative employee's work on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being
the strongest. Employees were then told how they ranked relative to
their peers.
</P>
<P>
   That last element was not part of the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that we did not think through the communication at
the time,'' Barker said. ``I owned up to that and I apologized.''
</P>
<P>
   But a tone was set. Other changes soon exacerbated some workers'
worries.
</P>
<P>
   To figure out where employees should be placed in the new
organization, everyone was asked to fill out a job preference form.
The form includes the language: ``Please Note: All staffing
decisions will be driven by the principle to do what is right for
Hallmark business needs to support the...work process and
reorganization. Business needs will be the primary consideration in
the placement of candidates; employee preference is second.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker said he expected to have the same number of people in the
creative division when the reorganization is completed by the end
of next year. But he added that it would be a different mix of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Annual turnover in Hallmark's creative department is 2 percent
to 3 percent _ remarkably low compared with turnover of about 15
percent for all employers _ but Barker expects it to reach 5
percent, perhaps higher, as the company reconfigures the creative
department.
</P>
<P>
   It has been Hallmark's practice to ``surplus'' employees whose
jobs were eliminated. In essence, employees are put in a pool of
workers and may fill in for others or try out a variety of
positions until they find a new one within the company.
</P>
<P>
   And if that doesn't work out in the coming reorganization?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will handle those like we have other situations,'' Barker
said. ``In many cases that will be, `It doesn't look like there is
a role here at Hallmark for you _ let us build a bridge for you to
the outside.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Wrenching change
</P>
<P>
   Don Blohowiak, a New Jersey-based consultant who has helped
manage change for corporate giants ranging from AT&AMP;T to Exxon,
empathizes with Hallmark and its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not worked with Hallmark, he said it wasn't hard
to imagine how many creative employees might feel. The various
changes might seem like ``judgment day,'' with livelihoods and
self-worth at stake.
</P>
<P>
   On the corporate side, Blohowiak said, it's essential that
companies change, and the model that Hallmark is moving toward has
proved effective, efficient and profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Blohowiak said, based on his experience, such a process often
means paring 5 percent to 10 percent of the work force and
replacing them with others who are a better fit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these cultural changes are shocking, Blohowiak said,
``particularly if Hallmark has had...a culture of entitlement,
security, a nicey-nicey country club environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Blohowiak said, Hallmark is likely to emerge a
stronger, more nimble, more formidable competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years from now, you will find that people have adjusted
and that they've attracted a different kind of person to the
payroll who wants to work this way,'' Blohowiak said. ``But
managing that transition is going to be hell on everyone.''

ROCKETS PULL AN INSIDE JOB, AND THE NETS HAVE A BIG LOSS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For the Nets to visit the Compaq Center and have their
victory plans foiled by a Houston Rockets big man is nothing new.
Hakeem Olajuwon, one of the greatest centers in the history of the
game, has been doing that for years.
</P>
<P>
   But for the final 20 minutes of Saturday's tight and tense
contest, the 37-year-old Olajuwon was on the bench with asthma-like
conditions. Even so, the Rockets' inside dominance continued
unabated, as Olajuwon's understudy, the backup Kelvin Cato, turned
a game that seemed to be evolving into a Nets' victory into a
costly defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Cato, a 6-foot-11-inch center who averages 8.8 points and 6.1
rebounds a game, eclipsed his scoring average in the last 6 minutes
and 25 seconds of play. Scoring 9 of his 11 points, grabbing 4 of
his 7 rebounds and recording 3 of his 5 blocks in that span, Cato
led the Rockets to a 99-92 overtime victory over the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest basket came on a ferocious two-handed dunk with the
Nets rookie Evan Eschmeyer draped over his shoulders with 1:03 left
in overtime. Just a 61 percent foul shooter, Cato sank the ensuing
free throw to give the Rockets a 95-92 lead that the Nets would
never cut into.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelvin Cato came up with some big dunks,'' Nets forward
Kendall Gill said. ``I think he was the key toward the end. That
was it right there. Those two words _ his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Cato's performance stalled the ascent of the Nets, who were led
by Stephon Marbury's 35 points and 6 assists, in the Eastern
Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   With just 2:42 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Nets (24-35)
led by 5 points and looked to be headed back to New Jersey with at
least three road victories. Now, they must upset the defending
champion San Antonio Spurs on Monday to finish the trip above .500.
</P>
<P>
   While Cato took advantage of Eschmeyer at the end, the Nets
rookie played admirably, grabbing a career-best nine rebounds and
blocking two shots in 28 minutes. His large amount of playing time
resulted from a lower back bruise that limited Jim McIlvaine to
just 12 minutes. McIlvaine, who did not play in the second half, is
questionable for Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Though Coach Don Casey and his players praised Eschmeyer's
overall performance, Eschmeyer was disappointed with himself in the
end.
</P>
<P>
   After Kerry Kittles (17 points) failed to answer Cato's 3-point
play by missing a 13-footer with 46.3 seconds left, Eschmeyer
absent-mindedly fouled Cuttino Mobley near halfcourt 12 seconds
later.
</P>
<P>
   It was Eschmeyer's sixth foul and sent Casey into a rage because
he did not want the Nets to foul in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, one of six Rockets scorers in double figures with 14
points, made both free throws to make it 97-92 and all but finish
the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to foul then,'' Casey said. ``I don't know
where he got it in his mind. He's not a designated fouler anyway.
He just brain-locked. When you've got five, you don't foul. But he
was confused and he's a rookie. But for a rookie, he did a pretty
good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Eschmeyer said: ``We had every chance to win and obviously, I
was involved in a big play down the stretch. I screwed up. I messed
up. I cost us big down the stretch. It was obviously the wrong
thing to do and I lapsed and screwed up. I've been playing the game
my whole life and I should know better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In actuality, the Nets should have put Houston (24-35) away in
regulation. They struggled early and Marbury, who shot 14 of 26
from the field on the strength of 10 layups, kept them in it with
27 points through the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn (24 points, 12 rebounds) and Kittles provided
help in the fourth with 6 points apiece, and the Nets gained two
6-point leads and three 5-point leads in the final 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But after hitting their first 16 free throws, they missed 3 of
their last 6 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury made 1 of 2 foul shots to put the Nets ahead, 82-77,
with 2:42 left, but confusion in their defensive rotations left
Shandon Anderson open for a 3-pointer just 15 seconds later.
Anderson buried the shot, then Gill missed a jumper, and the
Rockets tied the game on two free throws by Kenny Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Cato took over from there and with 40 seconds remaining gave
Houston an 86-84 lead. When Marbury missed a 3-pointer on the next
possession, the Nets seemed through.
</P>
<P>
   But Eschmeyer grabbed the rebound and fed Marbury, who drove to
hit a 6-foot running jumper with 15 seconds left to send the game
into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets led by 90-88 early in the extra session, but Cato, who
was 3 of 3 from the foul line, scored 5 points as the Rockets
finished with an 11-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the ball down the stretch,'' Cato said. ``Don't worry
about what the stats say. It's all about what your heart says at
the end. Stats don't mean anything when it comes to crunch time.''

 &HT;    The power struggle
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. Indiana Pacers: A three-game Western trip was hard on them,
but they remain the best the conference has to offer. They have
been the most consistent.
</P>
<P>
   2. Miami Heat: Without injured Alonzo Mourning, the Heat beat
the Knicks and Seattle _ impressive. Miami's found enough offense _
except for a 69-point debacle at San Antonio _ while maintaining
its tough defense.
</P>
<P>
   3. New York Knicks: The Miami loss was telling, but the Knicks
will get stronger with the returns of Marcus Camby and Charlie Ward
from injuries. Meanwhile, Patrick Ewing continues to find his game.
</P>
<P>
   4. Philadelphia 76ers: Toni Kukoc is getting more acclimated to
his new teammates, which means the team is getting better. When
Allen Iverson plays off Kukoc consistently, the Sixers can be
formidable.
</P>
<P>
   5. Toronto Raptors: They pass Charlotte on the strength of the
ascending Vince Carter. In a week, he scored 51 against Phoenix and
beat Boston at the buzzer with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. Los Angeles Lakers: The win at Portland solidified their
position atop the league. Both Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant are
getting better, which is scary. Significantly, the bench,
especially guard Brian Shaw, is adding a punch.
</P>
<P>
   2. Portland Trail Blazers: They were fortunate to have three
days off after the disappointing Lakers loss. They were able to get
it out of their system and resume their strong play.
</P>
<P>
   3. Utah Jazz: If there's anyone in the league who appears
ageless, it's Karl Malone. He just continues to get it done, with
ample help from seasoned pros John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek and
Bryon Russell.
</P>
<P>
   4. Phoenix Suns: Jason Kidd is the ignition, but the pistons are
many. Penny Hardaway is quietly going about his business doing a
little of everything, while Rodney Rogers contines to be a force
off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   5. San Antonio Spurs: Except for a strong effort over Miami, the
Spurs have struggled on both ends of the floor without Tim Duncan
(abdominal strain).
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   Toronto forward Vince Carter: Since establishing himself with
the dunk championship, Carter has led the league in scoring since
the break with 29 a game. His 51 against Phoenix and game-winning
3-pointer at the buzzer in Boston illustrate his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles center Shaquille O'Neal: He led the Lakers over
Portland by doing the unthinkable _ going 9 for 13 from the foul
line. If that becomes the norm, look out.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's Michael Dickerson: The second-year player gets
overlooked with Shareef Abdul-Rahim there, but he has been
outstanding. He was the reason the Grizzlies had a 6-7 record in
February, the best month in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   FREE FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen and Sam Cassell: The
self-proclaimed most-potent trio in the league has been terrible.
The Bucks never could defend, but now they can't score, either.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's John Starks: After winning over the fans with the
Bulls, Starks has tried to force his release. Speculation is that
he missed games last week to advance the cause to cut him and not
because of bad knees.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING HEADLINES
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter catapulted himself atop the NBA as its primary
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE OUTS
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks fired vice president for personnel Ed Tapscott,
supposedly because Tapscott bought his own ticket to the NBA
All-Star Game and was seen sitting with Milwaukee general manager
Ernie Grunfeld, who was fired by the Knicks last year. Both
Grunfeld and Tapscott were fired by team CEO Dave Checketts.
</P>
<P>
   BIG, BAD MASON
</P>
<P>
   Hornets forward Anthony Mason was charged with third-degree
assault outside a New York nightclub after being involved in an
early-morning fight. Witnesses said a hassle began inside and
carried into the street. Mason, who has had several run-ins with
the law, says he was breaking it up. He was late for the Hornets'
game with the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   NBA-champion San Antonio Spurs make their only visit to Atlanta
on Thursday when they face the low-flying Hawks. By then, All-Star
Tim Duncan probably will be healthy enough to return to action from
a strained stomach muscle.
</P>
<P>
   BLAZERS HIT THE ROAD
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Trail Blazers go on a four-game Eastern road trip _
to New Jersey, Indiana, Detroit and Washington _ that could
solidify their place among the best in the NBA or help widen the
Lakers' gap in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   OLAJUWON GETS TREATMENT
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon should return to action after learning
he has an asthmatic condition. Olajuwon grew concerned when he
would get winded after just a few minutes. Three days of tests
discovered a reactive airway problem that restricts the flow of air
through his bronchial passages during heavy exercise. It is treated
easily with an inhaler.
</P>
<P>
   ROOKIE RATINGS
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, the Clippers' Lamar Odom emerged as the
most impressive rookie. Then, it was Houston's Steve Francis as the
front-runner for rookie of the year. Lately, Chicago's Elton Brand
has come forward. A statistical look at a very close race:
</P>
<P>
   Player/Team/Scoring/Rebounds/Assists
</P>
<P>
   Elton Brand _ Chicago _ 19.0 _ 9.8 _ 1.9
</P>
<P>
   Steve Francis _ Houston _ 17.1 _5.1 _6.8
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom _ Clippers _ 16.3 _7.8 _3.1

   BRADLEY LIKENS HIMSELF TO TRUMAN
</P>
<P>
   An upbeat Bill Bradley brushed aside long odds facing his
Democratic campaign Saturday and reminded his volunteers in
Greenwich Village, N.Y., that another Missouri native, Harry
Truman, defied the polls to win an election more than 50 years ago.
``You know Harry Truman. They said he was finished in 1948, he
didn't have a chance,'' Bradley said accompanied by supporter
former New York City Mayor Ed Koch. ``And you know what happened
there. He came from behind and won.'' Polls show him trailing
opponent Vice President Al Gore in all 15 ``Super Tuesday'' states.
The latest polls in New York put Gore ahead by 20 points there.
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR BACKS BUSH
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, Conn., on Saturday, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman added her name to the long list of Republican governors
backing Gov. George W. Bush. Whitman, unlike most Republican
leaders, supports abortion rights, an issue on which she differs
with Bush. ``As a Republican, I endorse him because we share a
conservative Republican philosophy that transcends litmus tests and
invites everyone to join us to make America the greatest and
strongest nation on Earth,'' Whitman told a packed hotel ballroom.
Bush called Whitman ``a good friend.''``I am proud to have her on
my team,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   GORE TRIES OUT ANTI-GOP ATTACKS
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Vice President Al Gore on Saturday looked past
Bradley and began auditioning anti-Republican attacks that he is
expected to use in the general election, while campaigning in New
York and Massachusetts. His most potent weapon against the GOP
nominee: the strong U.S. economy. ``The issue now is whether or not
we're going to keep that prosperity going or whether or not we're
going to take the advice of both Republican candidates and take a
right wing U-turn back to the old polices of the past,'' Gore said
at a Boston rally. Gore also criticized Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Senator John McCain on environmental issues, something he has
rarely done in the Democratic contest with opponent Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY PRESSES GORE ON FUNDRAISER
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley called on Vice President Al Gore to fully explain
his role in the 1996 campaign fundraising scandal surrounding an
event at a Buddhist temple. Bradley cited new information in a
Knight Ridder Newspapers report that appears to contradict Gore's
earlier claims about his ignorance of a 1996 fund-raising event at
a Buddhist temple. ``Now is the time for Al Gore to be straight
with the American people,'' Bradley said. Last week, longtime Gore
friend Maria Hsia was indicted on campaign law violations relating
to the temple investigation. Gore has denied that he knew that the
temple luncheon was staged to raise money for the Democratic Party,
but a previously unreleased Secret Service memo prepared around the
time that Gore flew to Los Angeles for the event describes it as a
political fund-raiser, Knight Ridder reported.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK TIMES ENDORSES MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   The editorial page of The New York Times on Sunday endorsed Sen.
John McCain and Vice President Al Gore in Tuesday's Republican and
Democratic presidential primaries. ``Each of these two men
communicates a greater capacity for overarching presidential
leadership than his opponent,'' the editorial said, noting that it
does not always offer primary endorsements and last did so in 1992.

   BBN-ASTROS _ The Houston Astros came close to eliminating the
Atlanta Braves from the 1999 postseason, winning the first game of
the division series before losing three straight. Expectations was
supposed to be high for the Astros this year as they move into a
new ballpark, but that was before the team lost key players Mike
Hampton, Carl Everett, Derek Bell and perhaps Moises Alou. What
happened to the team that was supposed to be a serious threat for
the National League pennant? (Stinson, Atlanta

 &HT;    McCain blasts Bush ad blitz `that knows no depths'
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ Facing millions of dollars in negative
advertising before a potentially decisive round of primaries, John
McCain assailed George W. Bush on Saturday for running a campaign
``that knows no depths.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush campaigned through New York and New England on a
tense final weekend before Tuesday's primaries. McCain is hoping
for a strong showing in the five New England states and New York to
help offset Bush's expected strength in California, Georgia,
Missouri and Ohio. Bush leads in polls in those states.
</P>
<P>
   As he sought to blend his reaction to the ads with his call for
campaign finance reform, the Arizona senator used strong language
throughout the day to describe television and radio advertising
from the Bush campaign and an independent group that is backed by a
wealthy Texas businessman with ties to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The newest radio ad from Bush criticizes McCain on education.
</P>
<P>
   Using McCain's rambling answer about his record on education in
Thursday's Republican debate, the ad asks, ``If John McCain has
never made education a priority as senator, why would he as
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Told of the new ad as he headed from a Portland hotel to his
chartered airplane, McCain shook his head and said, ``They know no
depths, do they? They know no depths.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has come under attack in recent days in radio and
television ads that question his commitment to breast cancer
research and his record on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental ad, which also praises Bush, is the most
controversial because it is not paid for by the Bush campaign but
by a new group called Republicans for Clean Air.
</P>
<P>
   Most environmental groups have been harshly critical of Bush's
stewardship of the environment during more than five years as
governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly, a wealthy Texas businessman with ties to Bush, said
Friday he is spending $2.5 million to air the ad in California, New
York and Ohio, all of which hold primaries Tuesday. Wyly is not
identified in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly and his brother Charles gave more than $200,000 to Bush's
gubernatorial campaigns in 1994 and 1998. Charles Wyly also is a
Pioneer, a designation given to Bush supporters who raised at least
$100,000 for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to allow two cronies of George W. Bush to hijack
this election?'' McCain said at a rally in Boston's Copley Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them to keep their dirty money in the state of Texas, my
friends. Don't spread it all over New England and America.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, talking to reporters, McCain said the situation shows the
``incestuousness of the Bush campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that the ad also presents a case study in the need
to regulate such independent ads. ``What do the Wyly brothers have
to do with the New York pri- mary?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who campaigned Saturday in New York and Connecticut,
continued to deny any prior knowledge of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no coordination, none whatsoever. It was an
independent expenditure,'' Bush said in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Sierra Club has slammed his environmental
record in an another independent ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They polluted my record. They're running independent ads, too.
In politics, people can have the right to freedom of speech,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's vehemence on the subject, McCain adviser Mike
Murphy conceded there was little the campaign could do about the
ad. ``Raise hell is all we can do,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he is hoping ``for a giant backlash against this
scurrilous behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad that has raised the ire of McCain and his top aides
is a radio ad that points out McCain's opposition to breast cancer
research projects on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   McCain voted against the cancer research projects, and many
others, as part of a larger spending bill that McCain said
contained wasteful spending and did not include enough money for
salary increases for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's staff issued a release documenting many votes in
favor of cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   The issue took on a personal aspect because McCain's sister,
Sandy McCain Morgan, was diagnosed two years ago with breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has refused to discuss his sister's illness. But when
reporters asked whether he still considers Bush a friend, McCain
sat silently for several seconds before replying with a
tight-lipped ``Yes.''

THE HUNGER CONTINUES FOR FRANCO IN THE BULLPEN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ There is no single low point. When John
Franco looks back on the last 10 years, so many of which were so
forgettable, he cannot pick out rock bottom. The worst part, he
said, was that empty feeling, most acute on the afternoon drives to
Shea Stadium, the neighborhood park that was jumping before he
started working there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lowest point?'' the Mets reliever said, repeating a
question. ``When you're out of contention in June, driving to the
ballpark knowing that you have don't have a chance to make the
playoffs and World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   There was 1992, Franco remembers, and that was bad. The Mets had
made several expensive additions, and looked ready to return to the
postseason for the first time in four years. Instead, they lost 90
games, then lost 103 the next season. There were injuries, Franco
said, but the mix of players was just not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bunch of guys, it's a little different now,'' Franco
said, standing at his corner locker at Thomas J. White Stadium. The
stall to his left belongs to Al Leiter, who won the World Series
with Florida, and the stall on his right belongs to Robin Ventura,
who won a division title with the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seems a little more hungry,'' Franco said. ``Not to
say that we weren't hungry in '92, but maybe we're better prepared
now than we were then. Back then we still had a lot of guys from
the '86 team and the '88 team, when they won. But now we've got
guys from different organizations coming in, guys who haven't won
before, guys who have. Everybody's on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Franco's pages have been printed on Mets stationary since
Dec. 6, 1989, when the Mets acquired him from Cincinnati in the
deal that sent Randy Myers to the Reds. Franco had made three
All-Star teams in four years before the trade. The year he left,
Cincinnati won the World Series. Franco still laughs at the memory,
and shakes his head: that's life.
</P>
<P>
   Franco had a chance to move on again last winter. He had 19
saves when a finger injury in July sidelined him for two months.
When he returned, Armando Benitez was the closer. Franco played in
the postseason for the first time in his career, but he had
effectively lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   As a 10-year veteran who has played the last five years for the
same team, Franco controlled where the Mets could have traded him.
He wanted to know if contending teams had interest in him as a
closer. The Mets checked around: Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia,
St. Louis and Seattle were looking for closers, and Franco was an
appealing name. ``If he wanted that, that could have happened,''
said Franco's agent, Dan Horwits. ``That was the easy part.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard part was deciding if Franco really wanted it. The
advantages of staying were obvious: Franco is a Brooklyn native who
lives in Staten Island with his wife, Rose, and two children, and
the Mets had just been two games short of a World Series berth. But
if the 39-year-old Franco and the 27-year-old Benitez both stayed,
Benitez was the obvious closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the toughest decision he's ever made in his
professional career, by far,'' Horwits said. ``Every night,
probably for several weeks, he and Rose and I would discuss the
pros and cons, the what-ifs. It was a very tough decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco's chance at the career saves record was a consideration,
Horwits said, though not a major one. Franco is second on the
career list with 416 saves, 62 behind Lee Smith, and with two good
seasons he could have the record _ and, perhaps, a shot at the Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I had to sit back and think about,'' Franco
said of his decision. ``You know, you're so used to doing something
for a long time. But it all comes back to winning.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips and the co-owner Fred Wilpon
assured Franco that the Mets were committed to making a big push to
win in 2000. Winning had meant so much to Franco in '99 _ ``You
could tell by his emotions, what he said and what he did; it wasn't
subtle,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said _ and he didn't want to miss
out if the Mets went all the way this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about him, not to ask for a trade when he's a
guy who has a really good chance to take over the saves record and
he doesn't know if he's going to be the closer or not,'' said the
Mets right-hander Bobby J. Jones. ``It just shows how he feels
about the organization and how much he wants to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco has not been told his role for this season, and Valentine
has been careful not to officially tag him a setup man. Valentine
said he has not seen Benitez throw in games yet, and points out
that Benitez is coming off knee surgery. But Benitez signed a
four-year, $22 million contract extension last month, and Mets
officials openly talked of him as their closer. Franco politely
insists he will do whatever is necessary to help the Mets win.
</P>
<P>
   The saves record may not be out of Franco's reach. He has no
plans to retire soon, and can be a free agent after the season. As
Horwits said: ``Obviously, teams are going to want him as a closer
next year. Probably the same teams that were interested over the
winter will be interested in having him back as a closer.''
</P>
<P>
   When Franco decided to stay, then, he was not saying he wanted
to be a Met forever. Or was he?
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is full of decisions,'' Franco said, ``and I'll just
worry about that when the time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Franco said, he is not looking back. ``I made the right
decision,'' he said. ``It feels good, the organization's been good.
I want to win. I got a taste of winning last year, and I think
we've got a real good shot of winning this year.''

MIXED RESULTS FOR ANGELS PITCHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- Ken Hill started for the Angels and was followed
by Ramon Ortiz in the Angels' 12-4 loss to the Oakland A's Saturday
afternoon at Tempe Diablo Stadium, and the results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz was perfect in his two innings, and Hill wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz retired all six batters he faced in the third and fourth
innings, including strikeouts of Jason Giambi, Olmedo Saenz and Ben
Grieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good fastball, good location, good changeup, good
slider and control of my pitches,'' Ortiz said. ``My plan is to
throw first-pitch strikes and hit my spots and I did that today. My
arm's good and my body's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who has declined to speak with reporters all spring,
wasn't quite as sharp as Ortiz while pitching the first and second
innings. He gave up two runs and four hits in two innings,
including an RBI single by Jeremy Giambi and an RBI trible by Ramon
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia, however, said Hill is making progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed much better command than he has,'' Scioscia said.
``He looked sharp and he'll get sharper.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's broke the game open with an eight-run ninth inning
against Angels relievers Lou Pote and Steve Mintz. David McCarty
hit two home runs in the inning for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina, battling for the starting catcher's job, hit a
three-run homer and singled in three at-bats. Molina, however,
knows that winning the job will be based on how he handles the
pitchers and not his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about hitting at all,'' Molina said. ``Maybe
moving runners over, but not hitting. Just pitching. But once the
bat is in your hands, obviously you want to get a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia keeps an eye on the number of the runs the opposition
scores when each particular catcher is playing, much like a
pitcher's ERA. Saturday, Molina caught six innings during which the
A's scored two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina has always been known as a glove man
because of his defense. Now, DiSarcina will wear batting gloves for
the first time in his career. Until now, DiSarcina, who has a .257
lifetime average, didn't wear batting gloves even on the coldest
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to save my hands,'' DiSarcina said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jason Dickson threw two scoreless innings, allowing two
singles while striking out two in a ``B'' game against the A's
Saturday morning. Dickson, coming off shoulder surgery and trying
to win a spot in the starting rotation, said he felt no pain and
was encouraged by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first time out there in a year-and-a-half, so it was
nice to get over the competition jitters,'' Dickson said. ``I
spotted my fastball and my breaking ball will be there when it's
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson has been throwing live batting practice and threw in an
intrasquad game earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of times out my stuff was as good or better
than I had in '97 (when he was an All-Star),'' Dickson said.
``Primarily my fastball. My main thing is trying to sink the ball,
and I didn't have it at all in '98. Now it's back to what it used
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson's fastball was clocked between 86-90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's game: The Oakland A's snapped a 4-4 tie with eight
runs in the ninth inning on their way to a 12-4 win. Oakland's
David McCarty hit two homers in the big inning, and the Angels'
Bengie Molina hit a three-run homer for the Angels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today's game: The Angels travel to Phoenix to take on the A's
again. Kent Mercker starts for Anaheim against Oakland's Kevin
Appier.

MAN SOUGHT FOR QUESTIONING IN 5 BRONX SLAYINGS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Detectives investigating the slayings of four members
of a Bronx family and the fiance of one of the victims want to
question a Miami man who they say knew the victims and had been
seen at the three buildings where the bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   The man was seen with some of the victims on Thursday, officials
said. The bodies were found later that night and early Friday. As
detectives searched the Bronx neighborhood where the killings
occurred, officials announced a $1,000 addition to the $10,000
reward for information in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for assistance from the public, from anyone who
might have information in this case,'' said Capt. Geryl McCarthy,
the commander of the Bronx major crimes unit. She said the Miami
man goes by the name Lou and is missing his left index finger. He
is about 35 to 40 years old, 220 pounds and 5 feet 9 inches to 5
feet 10 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:30 a.m. Friday, detectives in Bronxdale had found the
bodies of four members of the Santos family and the fiance of one
of the victims in three residential buildings near the New York
Botanical Gardens and the Bronx Zoo. All five had been slain, and
some had been stabbed and shot in a manner that was consistent with
torture, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of 14-year-old Ishmael Santos, who was shot in the
head, his uncle Eduardo Santos, 34, and Ervin Aguilar, 33, were
found at 2975 White Plains Road.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim, the boy's aunt Denise Santos, 30, was found
lying face up in the kitchen of her home at 2934 Radcliff Avenue. A
large carving knife was lodged in her neck, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister Evelyn Santos, 39, who was the fiancee of Aguilar,
was found shot and stabbed in the elevator of her apartment
building at 2825 Olinville Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Saturday afternoon, McCarthy would not say
when the man had been seen at the locations and added that any
suggestion of a motive was ``pure speculation.''

FOULS DOOM CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In yet another season of dubious conquest, the
Clippers established one more standard of ugly.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was personal fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had foul trouble we couldn't overcome,'' said interim
coach Jim Todd, whose whistle-whipped team helped turn Staples
Center into a construction site at high noon. ``That's the nicest
way I can put it without getting myself into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   There was trouble enough from the Cleveland Cavaliers, who -
with the assistance of an unforgiving officiating crew -- turned 38
Clipper personal fouls into 54 free-throw attempts. The Cavs made
42 within the margins of Saturday's 109-99 victory before 12,522.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips, who may have become the first team in NBA history to
attract more whistles than its dance team, led by a dozen points
(32-20) when a 3-pointer from Charles Jones opened the second
quarter. But the familiar stew of poor defense and Vogue-posing on
offense was bitter enough for their 47th defeat in 59 games.
</P>
<P>
   The post-game spin cycle kept returning to the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed to be called more closely than usual,'' Todd
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor (13 points and 8 rebounds in only 27 minutes),
was officially accused of committing his third foul before the game
was four minutes old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like I was getting' rung up for heavy breathing,''
said Taylor, who was attempting to play king-of-the-hill with a
donut-enhanced version of Shawn Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers (24-34) weren't exactly exempt from scrutiny,
collecting 34 fouls the Clips turned into a 27-of-34 effort from
the line. Cleveland crusaders Kemp (22 points) and ex-Clipper
Lamond Murray (18 points, 9 rebounds) were ably assisted by rookie
point guard Andre Miller (15 points, 7 assists), the former Verbum
Dei High star who looked swell in his homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Clipper Lamar Odom scored a team-high 17 points in only 19
minutes, before receiving a bonus technical with his sixth personal
foul. Center Michael Olowokandi (13 points, 12 rebounds)
participated for 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't beat anybody with those guys getting those minutes,''
Todd observed.
</P>
<P>
   One Clipper who spent his time well was point guard Jeff
McInnis, who was rescued from the CBA eight days ago. With Troy
Hudson (stomach virus) in civilian uniform, the former North
Carolina floor leader had the starting role and produced 9 points
and 3 assists in 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some great players here,'' McInnis said after a
glimpse of the Clipper psyche, ``but we just gotta know that we can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   McInnis, who's expected to be retained after his first 10-day
contract expires Monday, made it his business to, ``Come out and
bring some energy. Since I got here for the Atlanta game, everybody
seemed dead out there.''
</P>
<P>
   With 72 fouls called Saturday, both teams only seemed beaten up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty's in the eye of the beholder,'' said Todd, attempting
to define the vision of this particular officiating crew.
</P>
<P>
   The beholders, who know beauty when they see it, may want to
keep their eyes closed. The next Clipper date is with the Lakers on
Monday.

JAGR HELPED BY NEELY'S HURTFUL HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT

<P>
   Fearing that a charley horse in Jaromir Jagr's left thigh could
turn into a debilitating, perhaps career-threatening mess, doctors
in Pittsburgh last weekend cut into the superstar's leg and drained
a pool of thickening blood. The team's medical personnel felt it
could turn into myositis ossificans.
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound hauntingly familiar, Bruins fans? It should. Cam
Neely's career was launched into the abyss when a charley horse in
his left thigh turned into a bonelike mass during the summer of
'91. Some four years since his last game, the 34-year-old Neely
read with interest the accounts of Jagr's injury and hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the bits and pieces that I've seen on the Internet,''
said Neely. ``Other than that, I don't know much about it _ but it
sort of sounds like the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The key difference, Neely noted, is the timing of the injury and
the context of the times. Jagr was hurt in the thick of the season
and began receiving professional medical help immediately. Neely
was injured in Boston's last game of the season _ via a hit on Ulf
Samuelsson in Game 6 of the '91 Stanley Cup semifinals _ and
figured all he needed was an ice pack to take care of the pain.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Jagr benefitted from Neely's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't that much knowledge back then about what could
happen with that kind of injury,'' said Neely, who missed all but
nine games of the next season but worked himself back into shape
and played four more seasons, including his 50-goal campaign in
1993-94. ``At least there wasn't for me, and I don't think anyone
else. You just kind of figured, `Ah, it's OK, I'll ice it.' I
wasn't going to be back playing until September anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   By training camp, the charley horse in Neely's left thigh had
hardened into an ugly mass that was 9 inches long, 3 inches wide
and 1 1/2 inches thick _ approximately the size of a brick. He
hasn't had an X-ray lately but he knows the mass has shrunk only
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of strange,'' said Neely. ``I can still feel it. If
you take your hand and push into your (quadriceps), normally you'll
feel muscle there. If I do that to my left quad, all I get is
bone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins aren't saying how long Jagr, one of the game's most
exciting talents, will be sidelined. He also is hindered by a
pulled hamstring. Jagr was initially injured when Buffalo's Michael
Peca slammed a knee into his thigh Feb. 16. He played another five
periods over the next five days before the charley horse began to
bother him. If Jagr is out for much of the final quarter of the
season, there's a good chance Pittsburgh won't make the playoffs.
One top star is that vital. Consider: Neely last played in the
postseason in '95; the Bruins have won only one playoff round since
'94.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened to me,'' said Neely, ``it probably woke
some people up. I'm happy to see that with Jagr they're taking some
precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Equipment check
</P>
<P>
   A hot topic at last week's general managers meetings in La
Quinta, Calif., was injuries caused, rather than prevented, by
equipment. Pads for elbows, shoulders, and legs often can be used
more for assault than protection. The Lords of the Boards have
formed a committee of players, GMs, and union reps to assess
possible changes. Don't look for any big change right away, because
the investigaton will have to be thorough and, ultimately,
equipment manufacturers might have to be asked to make changes on
the production line . . . Look for gritty Islander checker Claude
Lapointe to be grinding elsewhere no later than the March 14 trade
deadline. One rumor last week had him headed to Florida, along with
defenseman Kenny Jonsson, for forward Oleg Kvasha. An ex-Nordique,
Lapointe will turn 32 at the start of next season and is exactly
the scrappy kind of center, excellent on the draw, the Bruins
desperately needed on their checking line this season. It would be
a nice break for the dependable Lapointe to land on a real playoff
squad. In nine seasons, he has played in only 13 postseason games.
Another possible Islander deportee: skilled center Olli Jokinen, an
underachiever since arriving on the Island in the Ziggy Palffy swap
. . . Some in the Colorado media, amid the Avalanche's second-half
slump, refer to Bob Hartley as the club's ``future former head
coach.'' Tough crowd. But it's hard to figure a club with
Colorado's abundance of talent struggling to make the playoffs. A
Hartley successor may be needed . . . Mark Tinordi, Atlanta
property via last June's expansion draft, is expected to land with
another club prior to the trade deadline (with the Thrashers owed a
draft pick). Tinordi, 34 in May, made more than $3 million last
year with the Capitals. He might not see half that now, but
interest should be keen, given a dearth of hard-hitting defensemen
and the mounting injuries as the postseason approaches . . . The
International Ice Hockey Federation will meet this week in
Barcelona to try to sort out all issues _ on its side _ pertaining
to NHL participation in the 2002 Olympics at Salt Lake City. Among
the sticking points: the IIHF's attempt to get the NHL to improve
transfer fees for young Europeans who make their way to the NHL _
even if they play junior or college hockey. The chance of making
huge money in North America, soon to sport 30 NHL teams, continues
to drain the European leagues . . . Vancouver GM Brian Burke
insists he has not initiated talks aimed at dealing Mark Messier.
However, he's left the door open for Messier to request a deal.
According to Burke, Messier hasn't asked out yet. One reason: The
Canucks have gone an impressive 7-3-2 (through Friday) since the
All-Star break, renewing playoff hopes. The Canucks have six games
in the 10 days leading up to the trade deadline. If they don't
collect, say, 8 or 9 of those 12 available points, it would be no
surprise to see the 39-year-old Messier ask for a last shot
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Below-average idea
</P>
<P>
   The Lords of the Boards remain intrigued about expanding the
number of clubs eligible for the playoffs, possibly bumping it from
16 to 20. Not a good idea, at least not from the look of the recent
standings. Both the Rangers and Penguins are holding postseason
berths with below-.500 records . . . NHL look-alikes of the week:
Ex-Bruin Craig Billington, still backing up for the Capitals, and
Woody, the lovable cowboy from ``Toy Story'' in the Disney on Ice
tour . . . Anyone else feel that the curtain closed on the Bruins'
season with Tuesday night's 5-3 loss to the Senators? . . .
Hurricane Gary Roberts is one of the more interesting players
headed for unrestricted free agency July 1. Among the game's
nastiest forwards, Roberts, even at 34 years old, likely will draw
significant interest. Given how the market was discounted late last
summer, however, it's doubtful Roberts will get the $2.5 million he
is making this season. Carolina's Sean Hill and Paul Coffey also
will be unrestricted as of July 1. Hill, only 30, has the right to
walk because he's now in his 10th season and is making $750,000,
well below the $1.4 million average . . . Lost in this car wreck of
a Bruins season has been the exemplary play of Don Sweeney. Nearly
as lost: The fact that Sweeney, making $1.2 million, can walk as an
unrestricted free agent July 1 . . . Agent Jay Fee said he has been
given permission by Oilers boss Glen Sather to look for a suitor
for right wing Alex Selivanov, the streaky scorer who was red-hot
in October. Selivanov is also the son-in-law of ex-Bruin Phil
Esposito, once his boss in Tampa Bay . . . Boston University's Mike
Eruzione was invited to the Penguins-Rangers game in Manhattan Feb.
22, 20 years after the Yanks defeated Mother Russia in the '80
Olympics at Lake Placid. By and large, MSG gave Eruzione and some
of his pals from the squad, including ex-Terrier Dave Silk, a
hero's welcome. But Ken Morrow, who won four Cups with the
Islanders, was heckled with the standard chorus of boos reserved
for all Islanders. ``Kenny knew that was going to happen,'' said
Eruzione. ``At one point he said to me, `I'm just glad I'm not
(Denis) Potvin.' '' . . . Nice building in Los Angeles, the Staples
Center, but players generally consider it to have the worst ice
surface in the NHL. For all the millions spent on these
state-of-the-art buildings (read: cash cows), you'd think they
could master the art of freezing water. They seem to do a fine job
of filling those $3.50 soft drinks with decent ice . . . Look for
the Coyotes to be sold this week to a California-based construction
company, Ellman. Word is that Wayne Gretzky was offered the chance
to buy up to 35 percent in the venture but the Great One passed on
the shot . . . They take traffic laws seriously in Canada. To wit:
Darius Kasparaitis recently was written up for jaywalking in
Calgary (he was hailing a cab), and initially refused the ticket.
His tone changed when the cop tossed him in the cruiser and asked
to see his work visa or passport. On a personal note: Your faithful
puck chronicler, hurrying to get to a news conference during the
'88 Olympics at Calgary, was pulled over by one of Calgary's
finest. ``You're not from Canada, are you?'' he said, as I rolled
down the window of my rental. ``In Canada, we wear seat belts.''
Buckled up, I drove along _ safe, sound, and late for the briefing
. . . For the record: Yes, Donald Brashear, who switched
effortlessly from English to French during his news briefing
Monday, was able to speak French before Marty McSorley cracked him
in the head . . . Good guy Roger Neilson, coach of the Flyers, is
expected to undergo a stem cell transplant, perhaps as early as
Monday, for treatment of multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer). In
the meantime, ex-Bruin Wayne Cashman and Mike Stothers will serve
as assistants under interim coach Craig Ramsay. Earliest possible
return for Neilson: mid April . . . Lou Nanne, the ex-North Stars
general manager who shoveled Brad Palmer and Dave Donnelly to the
Bruins in 1982 _ compensation for the Bruins selecting Gord Kluzak
first in the draft instead of Brian Bellows _ needs surgery for
prostate cancer. Nanne, 59, is being treated by the same Mayo
Clinic doctor who helped golfing legend Arnold Palmer . . . Look
for the Sabres to move potential power forward Michal Grosek in the
next few days. Grosek, 6 feet 2 inches and about 210 pounds, has
the skill to be a 60- or 70-point scorer, but this is his seventh
season and he has lacked the day-to-day determination to get the
job done. Transplant Peca's transmission into Grosek and you've got
something . . . Hmm, life after Ray Bourque. It had to happen
sometime. And there's nothing wrong with Bourque moving on. Just
wondering, if he wins the Cup elsewhere, will he pull off his new
sweater _ a la Phil Esposito night _ and reveal another with the
spoked B on the chest?

PITINO PICTURE NOT TOTALLY INACCURATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a grain of truth to what Rick Pitino said last
Wednesday night. We're quick to find the negative here in just
about anything.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where politics, sports, and revenge rule the day, we
can dissect anything to find the most depressing element. Maybe it
wasn't the best idea to put a football stadium on the South Boston
waterfront. But it was dead on arrival the moment it came out of
Bob Kraft's mouth, as much as anything because of the way Kraft
haplessly handled the situation. Maybe there isn't taxpayer support
for using public money to build a new Fenway Park. But we haven't
even heard what the Red Sox will want and people already are saying
no.
</P>
<P>
   It almost seems everyone here has to have a say. Proposals don't
move quickly, as they do elsewhere, but at a glacial pace. How long
did it take to build the FleetCenter? The new convention center?
</P>
<P>
   In sports, our Calvinist leanings have conditioned us to expect
the negative, especially with the Red Sox. The only team that
didn't meet our lower expectations over all those years was the
Celtics. They won. Maybe that's why their current plight is so
upsetting.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the weather. We're in a lovely springlike weekend,
but how many of us wonder when the next snowstorm will arrive?
</P>
<P>

   The race for No. 1 is over. Unless, of course, the Bulls
(crafty) or the Clippers (clueless) get the top pick in the 2000
draft. Anything goes in those cases. But Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin
put on a virtuoso performance Thursday night against DePaul,
cementing his stand as the top player in the land. In front of 18
NBA scouts, including Celtics general manager Chris Wallace, Martin
was a monster. He had 33 points, 21 in the second half, and 10 in
the final 3 1/2 minutes. The 6-foot-8-inch forward, best described
as a Bo Outlaw-type with offense, also had 9 rebounds, 2 blocks, 2
steals, and the first 3-pointer of his career. ``He was the
favorite going in unless someone else was going to draft strictly
for need,'' Wallace said. ``Even though it's still early, with the
NCAAs and the camps still ahead, I think the league would
unanimously agree that this kid is the best prospect.'' Now, if the
Bulls get the No. 1 pick, they may go elsewhere because Martin is
projected to be a power forward and Chicago seems safe with Elton
Brand. The Clippers? Who knows? It was a veritable cornucopia for
GMs at the game. Not only did they get to see Martin, they also saw
Cincinnati freshman DeMarr Johnson, who many feel is a lock to come
out because he has had the NBA on his screen since the age of 10.
Another possibility for the draft is DePaul sophomore Quentin
Richardson, who toyed with the idea of coming out last year . . .
After delivering his usual quota of one-liners regarding Pitino's
rant, Kevin McHale offered the following: ``The hardest thing to
have in this league is patience. It's a Nintendo league. We'll play
four or five pretty good games and I'll think, `All right.' Then
we'll play a couple of games and I'll be there saying, `What was
that?' Then I step back and look at the whole thing and say, `I
guess we're getting better.' '' . . . John Starks wants a shot at
another ring and he's willing to pay for it. Starks offered to
forfeit the remainder of his $4 million salary so he could go to
Miami or New York. The rub is this: Any player waived after March 1
who signs elsewhere is ineligible for the playoffs. So, not only
does Starks want the Bulls to release him (which, under normal
circumstances, would make the Bulls liable for the money) but also
to have it done retroactive to March 1. Not surprisingly, the union
supports Starks, while the league says there's nothing in the
collective bargaining agreement to support it. The matter went to
arbitration and Starks lost . . . You're going to start hearing a
lot of talk about Pitino going elsewhere. He denies it and says he
intends to stick around. But the relationship with chairman of the
board Paul Gaston is strained and no one would be surprised if the
two came to an agreement on a parting . . . And this from Antoine
Walker: ``I think we've got to stay with the nucleus we have and
add a piece or two. We can't keep adding five or six new players
and have players jumping ship at the end of the year, because that
will just kill us.'' . . . Lakers coach Phil Jackson said last
Tuesday's game in Portland represented the biggest regular-season
game he's been involved in since he left college 33 years ago. The
Lakers won and are the team to beat. ``We're still getting
better,'' said Robert Horry in a sobering assessment. ``Now that we
have the trade deadline behind us, guys can relax and play loose.
We just need to stay positive and strong.'' And healthy. The Lakers
still have a giant hole in the middle that could be critical in a
long series against Portland or San Antonio. But they also have
Shaquille O'Neal, who, as McHale noted, ``is playing the way
Orlando and Los Angeles hoped he could and the way we all feared he
could.'' Travis Knight was with O'Neal as a rookie and he's back
with him again. He says the arrival of Jackson is a factor in
Shaq's play, but the bigger reason is much simpler. ``He's
healthy,'' Knight said. ``That's the main thing.'' . . . Garry St.
Jean says he intends to stick around and coach the Warriors next
season. The only other applicant was Orson Bean.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Orlando magic
</P>
<P>
   Here's a lead you didn't expect to see in the Orlando Sentinel
in March: ``It's time to officially start the playoff chase.'' Yup,
the Magic are right on the heels of Detroit and Milwaukee _ and
ahead of the Celtics _ as they make their first appearance in
Boston Sunday afternoon. Orlando starts a stretch of seven straight
games against teams with losing records. Sunday's game marks Ron
Mercer's FleetCenter debut in a Magic uniform. Mercer told Orlando
reporters ``the hype is already gone'' about playing against his
old team. He's right. The only time we hear Mercer's name is when
Pitino says he couldn't afford to re-sign him . . . McHale on
Pitino's plea for veterans: ``They're critical. When we got (Terry)
Porter and (Sam) Mitchell in here, I sat down with them and I told
them the whole story. I laid it out for them. You empower guys like
that and you know what? That's one less thing for the coach to
worry about.'' That's typical of McHale's easy-come-easy-go
management style. ``He hires people to do jobs and gives them the
freedom to do it,'' GM/coach Flip Saunders said. ``He has a great
mind. He understands what he wants to do and boils things down to
simplicity. No one feels that they can't talk or say anything.
Kevin's never going to look down at anyone. Everyone understands
he's going to play his golf, do his fishing, and we've got people
in place when he does that to cover for him. He knows what he does
well. The things he doesn't do well, he gets people to do those
things.'' . . . Toronto coach Butch Carter keeps hoping
(fruitlessly?) that more legend-enhancing performances like last
Wednesday from Vince Carter will convince Tracy McGrady to stick
around. The skinny seems to indicate McGrady would prefer Orlando,
but the Raptors can pay him more than anyone and also have Carter
as an undeniable lure. ``We need to create an atmosphere where we
win, where Tracy will say, `I like it here, I like the guys. I want
to stay,' '' Coach Carter said. ``Tracy's not a bad guy. We've
grown together, we've been here since Day One. The only time it
gets tough is when we don't talk. I've told him I don't want to
read about his problems in the paper or hear them from other
players. Right now, the challenge is to keep him out there at the
end of close games because he's still not a very good free throw
shooter. It's a challenge for me to give him a chance to fail at
the end of a game.'' . . . Speaking of free throws, longtime
bricklayer Eric Montross went to the line last Wednesday for the
first time this season and tried jump shots. He still missed both.
Montross went into the weekend having played 188 minutes for
Detroit, spread out over 28 games. That's about seven minutes a
game . . . Retired Numbers Dept.: The Mavericks retired Rolando
Blackman's No. 22. He joins Brad Davis as the only Maverick to have
his number retired. (What, no Bill Garnett?) Meanwhile, the Harlem
Globetrotters will retire a uniform for the first time in their
74-year history when Wilt Chamberlain's No. 13 is put on permanent
display at Chamberlain's high school, Overbrook in Philadelphia.
Chamberlain began his pro career with the Globetrotters in 1958,
playing one season. In one of the last interviews before his death
last Oct. 12, Chamberlain called that year one of the most
enjoyable of his career . . . On a recent stop in Charlotte, Tim
Duncan was asked if he thought there was any way a team from the
Eastern Conference could win the NBA title. ``I don't see it
happening,'' Duncan said. ``The West is incredibly strong, one
through eight. I'm sure there are some good teams in the East, but
I just don't see it happening. This may come back to haunt me, but
I don't see how.'' Neither does anyone else . . . The Knicks'
victory over Milwaukee Thursday night marked the first time in six
years they swept the Bucks in a season series. Not only that, the
Knicks trailed by 10 points or more in all four games . . . How bad
was Indiana's 31-point drubbing in Phoenix Thursday? Larry Bird
said it was the worst game he'd seen in three years on the Indy
bench. (There also was a 31-point loss to Detroit in his first
season.) To give you an idea of how the game went, the Indiana
coaching staff had the Pacers down, 29-0, in fast-break points. The
Pacers are on a brief, three-game Western swing that concludes
Sunday night in Golden State. The Pacers are 26-2 at home but have
a losing record on the road. In fact, no Eastern Conference team
has a winning record on the road. Miami is 5-15 heading into
Sunday's biggie with the Lakers. In the West, the Lakers and
Blazers are 14 games over .500 on the road.

SCALES TIPPED AGAINST GAMACHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The aftermath of Joey Gamache's last fight lingered on this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Seven days after he was knocked unconscious in two rounds by an
opponent who outweighed him by 19 pounds, his head continued to
pound and he was scheduled to revisit a New York neurologist.
</P>
<P>
   But medical concerns are not the only thing bothering the junior
welterweight from Maine. He has retained an attorney and may sue
the New York State Athletic Commission, claiming it failed to
ensure that his opponent, Arturo Gatti, ever weighed the 141 pounds
that was announced at the weigh-in the night before their fight at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scales never balanced,'' Johnny Bos, Gamache's manager,
insisted Friday. ``Gatti stepped on and the arrow went up and never
came down and he jumped off and started drinking water and they
called out 141. What was I supposed to do then?''
</P>
<P>
   What Bos could have done was insist that Gatti get back on the
scale until the arrow balanced. Bos says he did but a commission
official told him to forget about it because Gatti had made the
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran trainer Teddy Atlas theorized last week that Gatti
perhaps did not gain 19 pounds in 36 hours but may have already
been several pounds heavier than 141 when he got on those scales.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do in that case is say, `He gets back on the scale or
there's no fight,' '' Atlas said.
</P>
<P>
   Bos was faced with that question Friday and responded in the way
those on the outside edges of the sport often do. He said he and
Gamache had little choice but to accept the commission's handling
of the situation, although now Gamache is threatening to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time the arrow on the scale moved from the top was
when Gatti threw up his hands,'' Bos now claims. ``Then it bounced.
I complained, but we had three options: Demand he weigh in again
and give him two hours to make weight if he couldn't do it then,
prove he was overweight and negotiate for more money, or refuse to
fight. Joey had already said this fight wasn't about the money, so
he wouldn't do that. The commission refused to reweigh him, so
what's left?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pull out, they pull Joey's license and he can never
fight again and I'm not in much of a better position, either. So
what can you do? I didn't know Gatti was 160 until we were walking
toward the ring and a guy from HBO told us. What do I do then? Turn
around and go back to the dressing room?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, what you do is sue after the fact. Gamache may have
a case of negligence by the commission or he may not. Certainly
proving it will be as difficult as trying to make a conspiracy
argument based on the refusal of Gatti's people originally to agree
to a weight of 145 or 146, which would have made it easier for him
to make but only if he in fact ever intended to make 141 in the
first place.
</P>

   Charging conspiracy or negligence is one thing. Proving it is
quite another. If in fact Bos and Gamache were concerned about how
the weigh-in was conducted, the time to raise the issue was then.
If the commission refuses to put Gatti back on the scale, then you
walk out and take your chances.
</P>
<P>
   Bos and Gamache say they didn't do that because they didn't want
to threaten their futures. Fact is, nothing threatened Gamache's
future more than walking into that ring a week ago to face a
power-punching opponent carrying 19 more pounds of ammo than he
had.
</P>
<P>
   Bos and Gamache were worried that walking out on that fight
might result in a loss of license and an end to his career. As
things turned out, walking in is what did it.

   No odd couple reunion
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Felix Trinidad was set to face World Boxing
Association junior middleweight champion David Reid Friday night,
he lost an even bigger fight with Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks the two have sparred more over the terms of a rematch
contract than they did during the 12 rounds of their first fight.
Both sides had agreed long ago to evenly split $40 million in purse
money, and the push was on this week to tie the entire deal into a
two-fight contract _ one fight in June and another in September.
But one issue hung them up: weight.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya finally pulled out Monday and ordered his promoter,
Bob Arum, to make a deal with undefeated former lightweight
champion Shane Mosley for a June 10 or June 17 fight. The deal, all
sides say, is done, with Mosley collecting $5 million and De La
Hoya the same $20 million he would have gotten for Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage, though, is all with De La Hoya. Despite Mosley's
great speed and skill, he will be the little man in the ring.
Although both may weigh 147, Mosley is a lightweight masquerading
as a welterweight, and once he gets hit, he will learn what that
means. If he can survive that shock and continue to use his skills,
it could be an interesting night, but De La Hoya has sparred with
him many times and believes he knows what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sparred a lot in LA,'' someone close to De La Hoya said.
``Oscar admits Shane is quicker than he is. But every time they
sparred, once he landed a few punches Shane started running. That's
what he still believes will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's right, De La Hoya made the best business move of his
career by telling Trinidad that if he wants to fight at 154, go
find someone his own size to do it with.

   World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko
faces once-dangerous Razor Ruddock April 1 in Berlin in an effort
to force his name into the big-time heavyweight picture. The
6-foot-8-inch Klitschko will be making his third title defense
while Ruddock will try to show he has something left of what made
him a household name in two losses to Mike Tyson. This will be
Ruddock's first title shot in 18 years of boxing. After being off
three years, Ruddock has won eight straight fights under the
careful matchmaking of Mike Acri and is now 36-5-1 with 28 KOs.
What Ruddock will bring to Berlin is a big name. Whether he still
has a big punch is suspect . . . Beginning next month, the New York
Athletic Commission will no longer allow standing-8 counts. The
theory is that if a boxer has sustained enough punishment to
receive a standing 8, he's received enough to be asked to sit down
. . . America Presents CEO Mat Tinley has bought the long-term
commercial rights to Golden Gloves boxing and hopes to return the
tournament to past glories. He hired Jon Franklin, a former
executive with IMG, to market the event, and Fox will televise the
finals on May 14, delayed a week from the May 7 event in Detroit at
Joe Louis Arena . . . In case you were wondering why Julio Cesar
Chavez didn't appear as scheduled on the Reid-Trinidad card, the
reason was an old one. They paid him some money in advance. Chavez
was supposed to fight a meaningless opponent in hopes of
positioning himself for one last title fight vs. World Boxing
Council junior welterweight champion Kostya Tszyu. But, as he has
often done in the past, Chavez demanded his pay be increased the
week of the fight and Don King refused, so Chavez stayed in Mexico,
claiming he had a bad ankle . . . Riddick Bowe's claim that brain
damage caused him to kidnap his estranged wife and children got him
a big win and a big loss. Bowe avoided a lengthy jail sentence in
North Carolina, receiving only 30 days and an order that he seek
treatment for his brain injuries. But that claim also cut off any
chance Bowe had of getting back into the ring. The 32-year-old Bowe
had started to train again in hopes of regaining the heavyweight
title he once held, but Marc Ratner of the Nevada commission said,
``A claim of brain damage like that would have to be taken
seriously into account if he applied for a license in Nevada. I
would doubt Riddick would be allowed to fight again.'' . . . IBF
junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas has hired Washington
Redskins conditioning coach John Philbem to prepare him for his
April 15 showdown with Ike Quartey.

   Chelsea heavyweight John Ruiz was in Las Vegas for a photo shoot
with Evander Holyfield last week to publicize their May 20 showdown
. . . Ruiz's representatives will also attend a WBA meeting seeking
to have Lennox Lewis stripped of that title for fighting Michael
Grant instead of Ruiz. If they are successful, Ruiz-Holyfield will
be for the WBA title. Don't count on it . . . Lowell's Micky Ward
travels to London next weekend to take on World Boxing Union junior
welterweight champion Shea Neary (22-0, 17 KOs) underneath Prince
Naseem Hamed-Vuyani Bungyu on HBO. If Ward can pull off the upset,
he could get into the big-money picture.

REDSKINS RIVALRY REVIVAL FINE WITH CAMPO
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be the ultimate insult, but first, there has to be
validity attached to a story that goes this way:
</P>
<P>
   Little Danny Snyder, boy owner of the Redskins, successfully
scammed Jerry Jones when the Cowboys traded for and signed receiver
Joey Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Although Washington had minimal, if any, interest in Galloway,
the Redskins drove up the price by deceiving Jones into believing
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Redskins coach Norv Turner said on Friday.
``We wanted Joey Galloway, except not at the price the Cowboys
paid, with the two No. 1s and all that money. Jerry wasn't going to
let us get Galloway. He needed Galloway at that position more than
we did, and Jerry got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aw, shoot. The other version makes for a better story, and also
adds credence to the theory that Snyder wants to reopen those old
wounds which once made Cowboys-Redskins a storied rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, now that part of it, you might be on to something,''
Turner added, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   A national publication recently listed Jones vs. Snyder as a
budding NFL owners' feud worth watching for potential fireworks. At
the moment, however, it's more about Snyder seemingly being
obsessed with advancing the Redskins to the prominence the Cowboys
have always known, even with the latest slippage on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, of course, has to be honored that anyone still takes his
Cowboys seriously enough to want to start a feud. And particularly
the owner of the Redskins, a team that can be listed as the early
favorite to win the next Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, of course, knows both participants very well. If his
current boss and his former boss are headed for feudville, Norv is
going to be involved in the football part and nothing else. That's
just the Turner personality.
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Campo, the new Cowboys coach, was almost overcome with
glee on Friday when discussing the possibility of Cowboys-Redskins
and Jones-Snyder turning a bit nasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to be a little excitable anyway, and that wasn't going
to change,'' Campo said. `But something like this is just what we
need, the Redskins need, the NFC East needs. I do ``want'' a big
rivalry with the Redskins again. Let's get that stirred up.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to a Chan Gailey, Campo brings a feisty personality
to the head-coaching post, and he promises to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two areas where I hope to have an impact,'' he said.
``I come from the defensive side, but I want my input as far as
offensive philosophy. The head coach has to be able to game manage
on both sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, I will put a big emphasis into the motivational
areas. I'm not one of those guys who thinks since the players are
pros they don't need motivating. Some don't; those are the
self-starters. Then there are those you couldn't motivate with a
stick of dynamite. But somewhere in the middle, I feel there's
always a group you can reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing, Campo added: ``The way it once was, nobody ever worried
about motivation when the Cowboys played the Redskins. Those are
the best kind of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Campo was an honored guest at a banquet in his
native Connecticut. But most of the ceremony that evening was to
recognize the New York Yankees as the team of the century. ``I'm
sitting there watching this film of the old Yankees right up to
their current team, and suddenly it hit me,'' Campo said. ``I got a
knot in my chest. The film was on the Yankees, but I'm thinking
about the Cowboys. The Cowboys are the only other team in the world
as well-known as the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a Dan Snyder be coming after us? Because we're the
Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, however, appears to now be holding the superior football
hand. He was heavily irritated at losing both games to the Cowboys
last season, but the Redskins had a better overall record and
should prosper greatly in the April draft. Through trades,
Washington has the second and third picks in the first round, and
will probably add an impact linebacker and offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   If the Redskins don't take a receiver with either pick, and
Turner says they won't, then that might confirm their not having
had a large interest in trading for Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Campo has off-season defensive worries after the big
splash in adding Galloway. ``We have to get some things done on
defense, but come draft day I'm still going to be very happy with
our No. 1 pick,'' he said, meaning, of course, Joey.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the bonus for Campo would come next fall if the
Cowboys-Redskins rivalry has been stirred by an eager Snyder.
``Wouldn't that be fun,'' he added, sounding like a coach willing
to help Danny boy in getting the process started. nn

JURY STILL OUT ON GRIER AND HIS PICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gil Brandt, the architect of five world championships with the
Dallas Cowboys, rated the Patriots' 1999 draft the fifth-best in
the NFL, based on the percentage of players who made rosters and
how many games they started.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks around here might disagree with Brandt. Some might
think Bobby Grier's draft was closer to fifth-worst than
fifth-best. But the reality is, people like Brandt respect Grier's
work.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Patriots rookies had a total of 30 starts, most of
them accounted for by Damien Woody and Andy Katzenmoyer. Only the
Browns (83), Eagles (48), and Redskins (32) had more. Brandt rates
the drafts of the Browns, Eagles, Colts, and Bears ahead of New
England's.
</P>
<P>
   If Grier's drafts in '97 and '98 were considered poor, he came
back strong last year _ at least according to Brandt, who by the
way is a friend of Bill Belichick _ though not strong enough for
Grier to keep his power. He no longer has the final call on
selections, but according to Belichick, Grier will be very much
involved in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Will he set up the draft board?
</P>
<P>
   Likely, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Will he make the selections?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a meeting I have scheduled coming up in the near
future,'' said Belichick. ``We haven't gone over some of the
specifics. We've talked about some of the things we want to do in
the draft generally, but we haven't talked specifically. Bobby has
addressed it but we haven't talked about that yet. He may have the
answer to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has certainly gone out of his way to indicate that
Grier is still a big part of the front office. How long that lasts
remains to be seen. Can the guy who used to be in charge coexist
with the person who is now in charge? Usually, those situations
don't work out. It may come down to how long Grier can tolerate his
new role. After all, the Patriots also have in-house former Jets
pro personnel man Scott Pioli, who was handpicked by Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've been the general, it's hard to be a soldier again.
This was the crux of Bill Parcells's beef with Bob Kraft when the
owner put Grier in charge of personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby and I have worked together for a year (1996) and we had
a good relationship,'' said Belichick. ``I think it'll go fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were whispers at the scouting combine last week in
Indianapolis that Grier would stay on through the draft (April
15-16) and then be ``on the bubble.'' Those same whispers indicated
that Pioli, despite having a title of assistant director of player
personnel, may already have more power than Grier.
</P>
<P>
   While many have condemned Grier's draft choices the past three
years, Belichick said those players are going to have a chance to
play significant roles.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Floyd could be the starting fullback; Rod Rutledge will at
least split time with Eric Bjornson at tight end; Tebucky Jones
will get a chance to start at cornerback; Tony George and/or Chris
Carter will play free safety; Tony Simmons will get ample time at
receiver; Sean Morey will be in the mix more; Michael Bishop will
be introduced into the offense; Derrick Fletcher will get a crash
course on left guard with the idea that he'll start; Brandon
Mitchell will be a starting defensive lineman, inside or out;
Katzenmoyer will start at outside linebacker, Woody will stay at
center, and Ed Ellis may be forced into a tackle spot.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean all of these players will perform at a high
level, but we will get a better indication of Grier's eye for
talent when his players are actually playing. Grier stated at the
end of last season that the young players didn't play enough, which
was interpreted as a dig at Pete Carroll. Time will determine
whether Grier was right, and with the Patriots having so little
room to work with under the salary cap, Belichick will have to use
those players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll get great opportunities,'' said Belichick. ``Sometimes
it's hard to evaluate a player in a different system. They'll get a
good opportunity to see what they can do. I don't know if starting
is a big thing but they can create a substantial role for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier will always be known for selecting Chris Canty and Jones
with first-round picks. But he also selected Woody, Katzenmoyer,
Robert Edwards, and Terry Glenn with first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   Grier has declined interviews, but he defended his picks late
last season when he said, ``The picks haven't made an impact?
That's not true. When we've needed a guy to step in and start,
we've produced those players. Robert Edwards stepped in and played.
We needed and played Damien Woody at the toughest position. Andy
Katzenmoyer moved inside and played and (Kevin) Faulk has played.
People ask about Chris Canty and whether he's a bust. Personally, I
don't think he was. What got Chris Canty in trouble here was his
personal life and off-the-field stuff. He was the 29th pick, which
is basically the top of second round. He was supposed to be a
nickel and dime guy for us after we had signed Steve Israel to be
our starter. Chris is in Seattle playing very well as a nickel and
dime guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished they would have played more because you build your
team through the draft and you supplement your team with free
agents. Because of the salary cap and free agency, you have to play
the picks to see if they are what you think. You play them because
you have to find out whether they can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier's wish may come true. Carroll may have been afraid to play
young players because he felt his job was on the line, but
Belichick shouldn't be. He'll play them often in preseason, seeing
who is and who isn't a player. He'll also bring in another two or
three veterans to push the young guys.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Grier has been drafting players based
on Carroll's coaching style and philosophy. Now he's going to
recommend players based on Belichick's style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go in any direction,'' said Belichick. ``We need help
at every position.''
</P>
<P>
   As for moving up into the first round, perhaps by trading a
package of picks, the coach said, ``I think it's possible, but that
would probably only happen on draft day. If we saw a player we
wanted that we could reach by making a trade, we'd try to do it,
but that's so hard to predict. I could see us trading up to that
spot. How likely? Probably below 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had to give up their No. 1 pick to the Jets for
Belichick, but because of free agents they lost, they do have four
supplemental picks to work with.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They're all invited
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has written to all players about showing up for the
March 15 kickoff meeting for the strength and conditioning program
but has not heard back from any players who have other plans. ``I
would expect all the players to be here,'' he said. ``I've written
to all of them. I haven't heard back from anyone, but it doesn't
mean I won't between now and two weeks from now. If someone has a
conflict or a problem, we can talk about it.'' Asked about Ty Law,
who usually takes part in Bob Kersee's program, Belichick said,
``I'm sure Ty will be here.'' Glenn also will be there on the 15th
. . . Belichick will have a camp April 29-30 for rookies and other
invitees; his first official minicamp will be at the end of May.
He'll also have two ``get-togethers'' with players in May to ``do
some things in groups'' rather than having a full-squad mini-camp,
to which he's entitled as a first-year coach . . . Mike Shanahan's
proposal for a ``soft cap,'' under which teams would count only 50
percent of salaries for players with 10-plus years, has not
received much support from owners or commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
Perhaps owners should reconsider. Successful coaches like Shanahan,
Parcells, Joe Gibbs, and Bill Walsh understand the importance of
having older players on a team. Shanahan won two Super Bowls with
older players because they, in Parcells's words, ``get it.'' But in
this era when about 10 players per team get the big money and the
rest are just fill-ins, the older players are getting chopped off
rosters. Asked prior to the Super Bowl about a ``soft cap,''
Tagliabue said, ``Well, you know, I asked a number of people about
their reaction to it, and not to be too flip because Mike's got a
lot of good ideas, but I think the overwhelming reaction was that
it was for the birds and that we're not going to get into
exceptions to our salary cap.'' The Patriots have been hurt by this
trend of older players leaving. It used to be that a Bruce
Armstrong could keep younger players in line, that a Ben Coates
could offer great insight to the tight ends and receivers. Said a
former Patriot, ``I remember when Sam Gash walked into that locker
room and he heard garbage pouring out of younger guys' mouths he'd
say, `Shut the (expletive) up,' and not one guy would utter a word.
As soon as Sam and Curtis (Martin) left, it wasn't the same. These
guys kept other guys in line.'' . . . At the combine, the Patriots
spent a lot of time with Miami of Ohio's Travis Prentice, a big,
powerful running back. His stock is rising but the Patriots may be
able to get him by Round 3 . . . The Cowboys may make a run at
Coates, which would be ironic since it was Ernie Zampese's system
that was blamed for Coates's lack of production last year. Zampese
is now a consultant in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Going for Gogan
</P>
<P>
   When guard Kevin Gogan was cut by the Dolphins, Troy Aikman
called Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to see if they'd consider signing
Gogan, who is a close friend of the quarterback's. Gogan played
left guard with the Dolphins, but at 35 the only position he can
play is his natural right guard spot . . . The Berlin Thunder of
NFL Europe named Westwood native and former Holy Cross head coach
Peter Vaas, 47, their head coach. Vaas spent two years under Jack
Bicknell in Barcelona. ``I'm very excited about being a head coach
again,'' said Vaas. ``Berlin offers an exciting opportunity because
it's only been in existence for a year. We have a chance to
establish football in Berlin.'' Vaas, a 1974 Holy Cross graduate,
spent four years as the Crusaders' head coach and had stints at the
University of New Hampshire and Allegheny College . . . Jack Mula
is getting more involved in contract negotiations for the Patriots.
Like Green Bay's Andrew Brandt and Oakland's Bruce Allen, he is an
ex-agent who brings a unique perspective to the job. Brandt and
Mula, both formerly of Woolf Associates in Boston, have taken on
other football operations and administrative duties. Having dealt
with players on the other side of the fence appears to make a big
difference . . . An NFL offensive line coach calls Alabama's Chris
Samuels the only ``sure thing'' in the draft among offensive
linemen. The coach said others are a tad risky and teams must do
their homework to see which players would be best-suited for their
specific schemes and system . . . The combine is an exercise in
numbers, most of which don't mean a whole lot once the players make
it to the NFL. But here are this year's winners. Strongest:
Texas-El Paso defensive lineman Leif Larsen, who set a combine
record by bench-pressing 250 pounds 45 times. Fastest receivers:
Southern Cal's R. Jay Soward and Texas A&AMP;M's Chris Cole, who ran
the 40 in 4.35. Fastest running back: Arizona's Trung Canidate, who
ran a 4.39. Fastest defensive lineman: Virginia Tech's John
Engelberger, with a 4.65. Fastest linebacker: New Mexico's Brian
Urlacher, who ran a 4.6. Fastest defensive backs: Wake Forest's
Reggie Austin and Oklahoma's William Bartee, who ran a 4.4. Fastest
quarterback: Hofstra's Giovanni Carmazzi, at 4.7. Biggest player:
Oklahoma offensive tackle Stockar McDougle, at 6 feet 5 1/2 inches,
361 pounds . . . There's no question the trend is toward bigger
tight ends. As coordinators spread out offenses and utilize four
wide receivers, you see the tight end being used more to block than
to receive. Miami's Bubba Franks, at 6-6, 265 pounds, will likely
be the first tight end taken in the draft, and there's a great
chance he'll go to the Jets. The Jets may look to package their two
first-rounders and move higher rather than pay first-round money to
two players.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doing their share
</P>
<P>
   Interesting mechanism in place in the NFL, as the league and its
31 teams all share in the payment of $2.4 million to the state of
Connecticut for costs incurred in the ill-fated attempt to lure the
Patriots, who bowed out of a $380 million stadium deal. Methinks
the Patriots likely paid out more than the Cincinnati Bengals . . .
There must be something more to Bishop not playing in NFL Europe
than the confusion of a different system. Most quarterbacks who
play in NFL Europe have to play in different systems. Bishop didn't
want to go to Europe from the beginning, and it appears he got his
way . . . The next step in a new contract for Drew Bledsoe might be
a Leigh Steinberg-Robert Kraft meeting. Steinberg is looking for a
new deal that would include a signing bonus in the $15 million-$20
million range. It's either that or take the $8.66 million hit on
the salary cap this year . . . Press the button when you're excited
by the following list of free agents the Patriots have brought
through Foxborough: DE Tim Morabito, DE Bobby Hamilton, DT Shane
Burton, LB Jim Schwantz, LB Marcus Buckley, CB Robert Bailey, WR
Leslie Shepherd . . . There's a good chance Armstrong will end up
playing in his hometown of Miami. He's been there for a physical,
and it certainly doesn't hurt that former Patriots offensive line
coach Paul Boudreau is there. There seems little chance of the
Dolphins paying incumbent Richmond Webb the $4.1 million he is due
as a franchise player. The Dolphins will likely seek a deal for
Webb. Armstrong once said of Boudreau, ``I learned more from him
than any coach I've ever played for.'' . . . Carroll may be
involved in an Internet pregame show, breaking down the top five
games of the week in terms of coaching strategy, decisions, etc.
His attorney, Harry Manion, is putting the deal together. ``Pete
wants to do more than just be an analyst,'' said Manion. ``He loves
computers and wants to get involved in that end of things.'' . . .
He wasn't a high-profile player, but Marty Moore, who is now a
Cleveland Brown, was one of those guys who understood the game and
played it with every ounce of blood and guts he had . . . Good
draft talk on Patriots.com Wednesdays from 12-1 p.m. with CBS
Sportsline draft guru Frank Coyle and Patriots Football Weekly
editor Bryan Morry and writer Paul Perillo . . . Former Patriot
offensive lineman Scott Rehberg, a 13-game starter with the Browns
last year who was ripped for not playing in a Nov. 28 game because
of the flu, went to NFL hell for that sin, signing a two-year deal
with the Bengals . . . The Houston Texans, the Houston Apollos, the
Houston Stallions, the Houston Wildcatters, the Houston Bobcats _
they're all finalists for the new Houston franchise's nickname. Any
of them roll off the tongue like, say, the Houston Oilers? . . .
The Saints actually cut some ticket prices for end zone and
``terrace'' seats, but elevated the price of the better seats. The
Saints were last in the league in ticket sales, selling only 73

CLARKE A CHAMP OF LIGHTHEARTERD APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long after his impressive victory over David Duval in the
semifinals of the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship last
Saturday, Darren Clarke was simply trying to savor the moment when
a thought occurred to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What time tomorrow?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The final match against Tiger Woods, he was told, would start at
7:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why so early?'' asked Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because, Darren,'' said his manager, Andrew ``Chubby''
Chandler, ``the final is 36 holes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of a handful of exchanges that brought levity to
a sport that sometimes forgets to factor in human elements. More
and more players are becoming so deadly serious _ what with purses
so outrageous _ that they can't play a good round without wondering
how to make it better, or play a bad round without wondering
whether they'll ever play well again, or play at all without
wondering whether their pants are perfectly creased.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Clarke, who readily conceded that Woods was the best
player in the world, though it wouldn't stop him from showing up.
Though he had played beautifully to dispatch five opponents _
including Ryder Cuppers Duval, Mark O'Meara, and Hal Sutton _
Clarke spent his press conference following the semifinals talking
about his physical appearance. It is, he conceded, not in the mold
of Woods or Duval, arguably leaders of the new breed that believes
the key to great golf is a fine-tuned body.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys keep trying to get me to the gym,'' kidded Clarke,
when asked if he would have the stamina for the 36-hole finale. His
weight has been reported at between 245 and 260 pounds, and
Chandler, himself a former pro, said there is concern, but not
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not fit, but he's strong,'' said Chandler. ``He could
stand to lose 20 pounds, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect that to come from pumping iron, a la Duval, who
lifts before or after his round, depending on tee time. There's a
simple reason why Clarke avoids weights. They are heavy, he said.
And besides, he lifted during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``My right arm is stronger than my left,'' he said, indicating
he had raised many a Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   Which should make Clarke a hero to the majority of the golfing
population. Particularly since he proved in the final that the
promise many held out for him was justified. The big guy can play _
and have fun at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   At the 13th hole of his match with Woods, Clarke had a 6-footer
for birdie, a putt he figured to hole. He missed it, and Woods,
standing well to the back of the green, was slow to offer the
concession par.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Clarke knocked in the putt, then turned and said
something to Woods, who laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Are we playing medal?' '' Clarke later revealed.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked what he would do with the $1 million prize, there
wasn't even a hint of hesitation. ``Spend it,'' said Clarke, who
has a widely publicized passion for fast cars and expensive cigars,
which he smokes while playing.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the result that put Clarke in a good frame of mind; he
was lighthearted from the start. On the driving range at 7 a.m.,
Clarke didn't get much attention from his swing coach, Butch
Harmon, who was occupied with his main student, Woods. ``That's OK,
Butch,'' Clarke yelled down to Harmon, ``I'm fine. I don't need
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Harmon had to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clarke's approach is the only way to tackle competition
against Woods. Keep it light. Keep it simple. Keep it in
perspective. Clarke said he had to play his best and hope Woods
didn't play his best, which is the truth. It's also what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The result did nothing to convince anyone that Woods isn't the
best player in the world. It did everything to remind us that the
game's foundation is still intact.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tiger factor
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem, during an informal gathering
with reporters at the Match Play, touched upon a variety of
subjects, among them TV ratings that have been quite impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a ratings-driven sport,'' said Finchem, ``but good
ratings are awful sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Finchem isn't naive; he knows the key ingredient is Woods. It
was Woods's stretch duel with Ernie Els at the Mercedes that
established a cable TV ratings record for golf, and it was Woods's
chase for a seventh straight win that enabled the Buick
Invitational to score higher in the ratings than the NBA All-Star
Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lift he is generating is by getting more and more eyeballs
on the TV,'' said Finchem.
</P>
<P>
   How big a lift, said the commissioner, is ``hard to quantify,
but what is pleasing is that when he hasn't played, the tournaments
have held up well.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour is reaping benefits of a huge TV pact negotiated
not long after Woods's historic victory at the Masters in 1997, and
talks will open next summer on a new contract, said Finchem.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the World Golf Championships events, they remain a
somewhat contrived bunch, though certainly a presence:
</P>
<P>
   --Andersen Consulting Match Play. Finchem conceded that next
year's event in Australia may not get all Top 64 players. It's a
long way to go for such a format, and the timing (first week of
January) is not attractive. ``Either they go or they don't go,''
said Finchem. ``We won't entice them.''
</P>
<P>
   --NEC Invitational. A mess, thanks to a stubborn Ken Schofield,
Finchem's counterpart with the European Tour. The eligibility, as
drawn up two years ago, was simple: the most recent Ryder Cup and
Presidents Cup players made it. Schofield, in an effort to keep his
stars on European soil, is threatening to change the eligibility to
the Top 12 players on the Order of Merit. Since 1999 Ryder Cuppers
such as Jesper Parnevik, Sergio Garcia, Paul Lawrie, and Jean Van
de Velde will play a lot in the United States, chances are they
won't qualify. Schofield could be headed for a showdown he may
regret.
</P>
<P>
   --American Express Championship. It's set for Valderrama, Spain,
again this year, though the date moves up a month to September,
which will please US players who wanted their Tour Championship to
remain the season's finale. Next year, the event comes to the
United States (site to be determined), but will not conflict with
the Ryder Cup at The Belfry. It will probably head to Ireland for
2002.
</P>
<P>
   --EMC World Cup. It will be played in December in Buenos Aires.
There will be two-man teams playing foursomes and four-ball, and
the top-ranked player in each country will qualify and get to
choose his partner (the early guess is that Duval accepts Woods's
offer).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arnie's guest list
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Baddeley, the Australian teenager who surprised by winning
his country's Open championship last November, will have a pretty
good event at which to tune up for his Masters debut: the Bay Hill
Invitational. Baddeley, 18, accepted a sponsor's exemption into
Arnold Palmer's little gathering in two weeks. Sponsor's exemptions
also went to, among others, Gary Nicklaus, Irishman Padraig
Harrington, Billy Andrade, Peter Jacobsen, Curtis Strange, and
Casey Martin. Martin was an interesting selection since Palmer was
among those who testified for the PGA Tour in its court fight
against Martin's request for a cart. Martin put up his best
performance last week in Tucson, finishing T-17, and is 115th on
the money list with $51,015 . . . John Daly has signed a
sponsorship agreement with SoBe Beverages, a South Beach (Miami)
company that produces herbally enhanced refreshments. Its slogan?
``Grip it and sip it.'' But these ``wellness beverages'' aren't
exactly the kind Daly has been known to embrace, though for
goodness sakes perhaps he should try them. The deal was announced
Thursday, after which Daly shot 79 at Doral on a day that 44
players broke 70. He has entered five tournaments in 2000 and the
linescore reads as if there are still some problems: one WD, three
MCs, T-72 . . . The Massachusetts Golf Association's spring
conference will be Thursday at the Westin Copley Place. For
information, call 781-449-3000 . . . A roast to pay tribute to Jack
Burke Jr. was held the other night in Houston, and the legendary
player/instructor/golf course owner went toe-to-toe with an
impressive list of dignitaries _ Steve Elkington, Phil Mickelson,
and Sutton among them _ who were more than happy to challenge him
to barbs. About one of the roasters, Ben Crenshaw, Burke said:
``Ben cried on the 18th green when he won the Masters and he's been
a water hazard ever since.'' Widely considered one of the great
putting instructors around, Burke has tutored Mickelson for the
past year, and the lefthander related a story told to him by Billy
Ray Brown: ``Billy said he missed his first putt, and Jackie came
over and whapped him on the side of the head. And Jackie said,
`Son, I want you to feel pain when you miss a putt.' ''

BRUINS INVISIBLE IN LOSS TO FLYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bizarre 1999-2000 Boston Bruins season took on a surreal
quality Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they were overwhelmed by the Philadelphia Flyers, 3-0, at
the FleetCenter, which seemed to hold as many Flyers fans as it did
Bruins rooters.
</P>
<P>
   But the game, which was just another reminder that the season is
already lost, was a mere subplot to the situation surrounding
Boston captain Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   The scoresheet said Bourque logged 23 minutes, 30 seconds over
25 shifts, finishing with four shots in what many believe is the
last game that he will play in a Bruins uniform. Bourque was given
the puck by an official at the end of the game, which furthered the
belief that Bourque will be traded imminently, perhaps Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   An NHL source said Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden
spent Saturday fielding offers for the 39-year-old defenseman, from
the Flyers, Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings, and St. Louis
Blues.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Bourque remained in the back area of the
dressing room for a prolonged period, then emerged to tell a huge
media contingent only that he wasn't talking. ``Sorry, guys,'' were
his only words.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the room was funereal. Other players did
speak, but the sad state of the team, the distraction caused by the
Bourque situation, and the constant losing seemed to take a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Embattled coach Pat Burns, who has done his best to remain
upbeat and therefore keep his team the same, was only slightly less
terse than Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did our best,'' said Burns, his voice quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the Bruins are a shell of their former selves. In
the press box, seated together, were 32 goals and 43 assists in the
persons of Jason Allison and Anson Carter, both of whom are out for
the year with injuries. Next to them were five goals and 16 assists
in the form of gritty winger Rob DiMaio, whose real value rarely
shows up on a scoresheet.
</P>
<P>
   At home recuperating from surgery was goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself was nothing to write home about. Simon Gagne
gave the Flyers all the offense they would need with a goal at
14:42 of the first period. Eric Lindros, making his return from
injuries, finished off a nice feed from John LeClair at 3:39 of the
second for his 25th goal of the season, and Keith Jones closed it
out later in the period with his sixth at 16:08.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Boucher picked up his second career shutout, making 21
saves, but the fact is he was rarely tested. The Bruins were simply
in way over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any easier,'' said goalie Rob Tallas, who made
21 saves, several tough ones. ``Ottawa comes back in town (Monday
night). We just have to stay confident. We keep saying that but we
have to continue to work, it's still our job, we're still getting
paid. It's pride, it's personal, we have to play for each other and
not worry about other things in our surroundings. We need to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. The players have tried to go about their
business, but the likely departure of Bourque was hanging in the
air, signaling a storm on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, we can't look at that,'' said Tallas. ``We've got to
worry about ourselves as a team in here and what we're going to do
and if that happens, that happens and then we deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have struggled since opening day, but it was sadly
obvious Saturday that they just couldn't compete against the
bigger, stronger Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at this team and there are so many young guys on
here, including myself,'' said Tallas. ``Other teams see confidence
in playing us. They're excited to play against us and right now,
that's a big team to go up against.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lack of experience, too, that's hurting us a little bit.
We have a team that's working pretty hard. You look at our
chalkboard in their dressing room (listing the lines and defensive
pairings) and you look at theirs in ours and they're intimidating.
(The Flyers look at the Bruins' roster) asking, `Who's this?',
`Who's that?' and it's not as intimidating. That confidence in the
dressing room goes out the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only 17 games remaining in the year that mercifully
will end April 9 and the Bruins will have to play with half an NHL
lineup and half an AHL lineup and likely without the man who has
patrolled the blue line for the last 21 years. That's a pretty tall
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing a ton,'' said Tallas, who wasn't figuring the
loss of Bourque into the equation. ``Anson Carter was having a
career-high year. Even Byron getting hurt, he brings confidence.
Losing Jason Allison, that's a blow to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at all the ties and the one-goal games. He might have
been the difference in getting a tie or a win. That's tough, that's
really tough. But there's been a cloud over the Bruins this year.''

IT SURE LOOKS LIKE BOURQUE IS GONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Bourque is about to go, his skates not packed, his ticket
not punched, but his days in the Hub at an end nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   How do we know this? Only by appearance. Bourque refused to
speak to the media following the Bruins' 3-0 loss to the Flyers
Saturday at the Vault, the second straight day he has remained mum
on the subject of moving. Some 45 minutes after the game ended, he
walked hurriedly through the dressing room, shaking his head, and
offering only a terse, ``Sorry, guys,'' as he headed for the door.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, flanked by a couple of Fleet security guards,
Bourque was ushered past the third-floor press room, afforded safe
passage to his car. It had that ``Baby Doc departs Haiti in
Mercedes'' feel to it.
</P>
<P>
   These are strange times on Causeway Street, even stranger than
usual. Bourque is leaving, but he continues to play on for a club
that most nights and afternoons is grossly overmatched by the
opposition. While Boston president/general manager Harry Sinden
collects offers from Cup challengers far and wide, the 39-year-old
captain continues to take his spot on the backline and shoot and
skate as if it's just another day on the job, albeit 21 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as professional as can be,'' said winger Ken Belanger,
who was one of the four other Boston skaters on the ice with
Bourque for the closing seconds of Saturday's loss. ``Before the
game, after the game, he didn't say anything about what's going on
with him. I think, more than anything, he didn't want any
distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Any hour now, the hockey world expects Bourque to be swapped to
a club like the Flyers or Red Wings. How strange that will be from
a Boston perspective. It would be like waking up one day and
finding out that the Swan Boats had been sold to a Florida theme
park. What if Arthur Fiedler hadn't put down the baton while with
the Pops, and surfaced in Boise leading a barbershop quartet?
</P>
<P>
   Bourque in Detroit, a winged wheel masking his spoked B? What
next, someone covering the Golden Dome with Day-Glo orange?
</P>
<P>
   There were no fewer than 19 NHL scouts, representing 13 teams,
at the Vault for what might have been Bourque's last game in Black
'n' Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to Columbus,'' kidded Doug MacLean, general
manager of the expansion Blue Jackets, who open for business in the
fall. ``I can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   If the crowd was thinking this could be Bourque's Causeway
serenade, they certainly didn't shake down the thunder for the
aging icon. Only two seats beyond where Bourque sits on the Boston
bench, a fan occasionally held up a small sign that read, ``Good
Luck, Ray, Wherever You Play.'' In the closing seconds, another
fan, standing just behind the glass near head coach Pat Burns, held
up another cardboard testimony, ``NO RAY. NO PAT. NO FAN.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, the crowd called little attention to what could
have been a landmark game. When the final horn blew at 4:04 p.m.,
few noticed Bourque skate over to an on-ice official and ask for
the puck. Absent flair or even so much as a nostalgic final glance
over his shoulder, he hopped off the ice near the Boston bench and
made the penguin-like waddle down the hall with the rest of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to discuss it,'' said veteran blue liner Don
Sweeney, reluctant to speculate over where Bourque's trails may
lead him now. ``It brings up feelings that obviously haven't been
addressed. It brings up words like if and when and if ever . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something, if it happens, I'd prefer to address then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston dressing room, remarkably, was hauntingly quiet. The
TV was off. There wasn't a CD pumping through the speakers. While a
crowd of some 40 reporters and photographers waited patiently for
Bourque to appear from his shower and shave, three ceiling fans
whirred, a hum almost audible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about it,'' said netminder Rob Tallas.
``Obviously, we've read a little and, hey, if it happens, it
happens. I can tell you it would be a sad day for a lot of
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Sunday's noon workout in Wilmington, the Bruins return
to Causeway Street Monday night to face the Senators. If he hasn't
been dealt by then, Bourque will be expected back on the blue line
for another night (Adieu, Part Deux) that could be his last with
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds strange, doesn't it, keeping the future former
Bruin in uniform? Given the awkwardness of the situation, and given
how the Bruins are now out of the playoffs _ spiritually, at least
_ it could make sense for Bourque to ask out of the lineup while
Mssrs. Sinden and O'Connell work the phones. If come March 14 they
still haven't found a suitable trade partner (highly unlikely),
they then could let Bourque play out the string here.
</P>
<P>
   In those final seconds Saturday, Tallas stood in net and Bourque
was paired on defense with Darren Van Impe. Up front, Shawn Bates
centered Steve Heinze and Belanger. The stands were half-empty when
the horn blew. There was the usual smattering of applause and the
standard obligatory booing, the latter all too familiar in recent
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   No. 77, puck tucked away for posterity, silently made his way to
the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sad,'' said Belanger, standing just outside an area that
is off-limits to the media, only feet from where Bourque reportedly
was signing pucks for teammates. ``But at the same time, I'm happy
for whatever decision he makes. The Stanley Cup is hard to win. And
if anyone deserves it, it's Ray.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    McCain the rebel could be facing last stand
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is the GOP primary equivalent of the Main Event:
Titanic Tuesday is coming, raising the question of whether it will
spell the end of the heavyweight bout between Gov. George W. Bush
and Arizona Sen. John McCain. Or will the competitors go another
round to March 14 or beyond?
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high: 613 delegates are up for grabs, more than
60 percent of the 1,034 needed to seize the nomination. Bush wants
to land a knockout punch in California, where he holds a wide lead
among Republicans. McCain's survival hinges on sweeping New England
and New York and perhaps winning a major state such as Ohio,
Tuesday's third-biggest prize with 69 GOP delegates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's rebel candidacy, his proven appeal to Democrats and
independents, has made this Republican primary season anything but
run-of-the-mill. So unpredictable is it that even the most seasoned
party-watchers hedge about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds still very much favor Governor Bush as they have all
along, but many people, myself included, have underestimated
Senator McCain's appeal all the way through, and so I think it's a
bit premature to write off his candidacy,'' said Atlanta pollster
Whit Ayers, a Republican who doesn't work for either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   California is the Holy Grail for Republicans. During the 1970s
and '80s, winning the state was a virtual lock on the White House.
Richard Nixon won in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984.
President Clinton changed that in the 1990s, taking California in
1992 and in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the state's top Republicans, including members of the
congressional delegation, are behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Republican in the nation who has done more to
reach out to women, Hispanics, Asians, African-Americans and
independents and Democrats than George W. Bush,'' U.S. Rep David
Dreier said in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can cast ballots Tuesday, but only Republican votes
count toward choosing California's 162 GOP delegates. With Bush's
overall lead far slimmer than his lead among Republicans, McCain
could wipe the glow off a Bush delegate win by seizing the popular
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp recognizes the possibility, but is more occupied
with counting delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lay of the land is that Governor Bush enjoys
strong support from the people who will be deciding the Republican
primary,'' said Bush adviser Mark McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist, said
that as much as Bush needs to win the ``beauty contest'' popular
vote in California, McCain needs it more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain wins the popular vote while Bush wins all the
delegates, and then McCain also has a Northeast slate of victories,
that just sets up a situation where party leaders will have to ask,
`What sense does it make to nominate somebody who has less of a
chance to win in November than McCain does?''' Buchanan said. ``All
those scenarios do is add more electoral weight to that very
pregnant question, which is the last hope of John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument is resonating with some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Mayor Susan Golding, one of the few high-profile
California Republicans backing McCain, said her man would be a
better November contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans have to remember that if California wants
to beat Al Gore, that the right candidate to do that with is John
McCain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's other super prize, New York, the outcome is
anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   It's a state where McCain had difficulty getting on the ballot,
given the state's complex election requirements. But the New York
GOP establishment, after the New Hampshire primary and with Bush's
belated blessing, finally agreed to let McCain on the ballot in all
counties.
</P>
<P>
   That was just in time for Bush to raise the ire of Catholics, a
huge part of New York's Republican Party, when he visited Bob Jones
University in his desperate bid to win South Carolina. McCain has
seized on that visit to appeal to Catholics, especially in New
York, forcing Bush to send an apology to New York's Cardinal John
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has since said he regrets not taking advantage of his visit
to Bob Jones to condemn that school's anti-Catholic views, and
Tuesday's vote may illustrate how Catholics have responded to
Bush's statements of regret.
</P>
<P>
   McCain either leads slightly or is in a dead heat in three New
York polls. The state's primary, open only to GOP voters, would be
an embarrassing one for Bush to lose, because he has been running
strong among Republican primary voters. A loss in New York could be
fatal, however, for McCain, who desperately needs a big state win
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers gives the McCain campaign points for doing ``a remarkable
job with the resources they've had,'' but he isn't putting money on
a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the laws of political gravity are about to assert
themselves,'' Ayers said. ``You can't win a Republican nomination
if you can't get Republican votes. The establishment does matter.
Money matters, especially in wars of attrition. None of those
political laws have been repealed.''

WHEELS OF FORTUNE SPIN AT LAS VEGAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Las Vegas oddsmakers have installed NASCAR Winston Cup Series
champion Dale Jarrett as a 9-2 shot to win Sunday's CarsDirect.com
400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Bobby Labonte, the winner of last
week's race at Rockingham, N.C., is 6-1, Jeff Gordon 5-1, Rusty
Wallace 12-1, and Dale Earnhardt 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   You want a long shot? Try Darrell Waltrip at 300-1.
</P>
<P>
   The smart money would be on Roush Racing's Mark Martin (7-2) and
Jeff Burton (9-2). They are the only two drivers _ both behind the
wheel of a Ford Taurus _ who have won a Winston Cup race at the 1
1/2-mile Las Vegas track. Martin won the inaugural event two years
ago, beating Burton, who won last year's Las Vegas 400 ahead of
older brother Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think it's one of the best racetracks we go to,''
said Jeff Burton, who finished second to Jarrett in the Daytona 500
but had a subpar effort at Rockingham, dropping him to 14th in the
standings. ``It is a racetrack where you saw last year with Ward
and me racing that will provide an opportunity for some great
side-by-side racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a racetrack like that, there's really no excuse
in having cautions. We ought to be able to race each other really
clean. There's enough room to do it. There's enough different
grooves to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ward had the better car for the majority of the race last
year, Jeff wound up pulling it out in the final 20 laps. Jeff took
the lead with 10 to go and withstood a furious charge from Ward. It
was the first of six victories for Jeff Burton, three at the
expense of Ward, who finished runner-up at Las Vegas, the Pepsi
Southern 500 in Darlington, S.C., and the Pop Secret 400 in
Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can certainly enjoy it, but it does have a negative sense
to it in a way,'' Jeff Burton said. ``I don't think I enjoy winning
races as much when I beat Ward as I do when we're beating somebody
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the emotion of that was it was an early win for us, it was
the earliest we had ever won a race since I'd been at Roush Racing,
and it felt good to get that win behind us. We had gone to
Rockingham the week before and run well (starting second and
finishing fourth) and then we came (to Las Vegas) and won. It was
just a really good start to the year for us after a terrible
Daytona start (35th place).
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, having to beat Ward, you felt great that you won the
race, but you felt bad that you beat your brother. That's the only
way I know how to describe it. I take a lot of pride in being able
to say that, even though it is Ward, I still tried as hard as I
could try and didn't try any harder because it was Ward or didn't
try any less because it was Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, it was just another car, but it is difficult
when you have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next test awaits
</P>
<P>
   While there was much hubbub over NASCAR's new shock/spring rule
at Daytona and how it favored the redesigned Ford Taurus over the
new Chevrolet Monte Carlo and the unchanged Pontiac Grand Prix,
Labonte's victory in the Dura-Lube/Kmart 400 last week at
Rockingham showed that GM may not be lagging that far behind the
Fords, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's victory in his Joe Gibbs Racing Pontiac, which vaulted
him to second in the standings behind Jarrett, led a GM sweep of
the first four spots, which was quite a departure from Daytona,
where Fords took the top five spots. To their credit, NASCAR
officials resisted the repeated complaints of GM drivers and owners
to implement aerodynamic changes, saying they needed to collect
more data on the track and in the wind tunnel before taking any
drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that Chevrolet has not been up to our standard is not
true,'' Jeff Burton said. ``They struggled down at Daytona, but
that's because they built too much drag in their car. That's the
same thing we did down there three years ago. We're coming here (to
Las Vegas) to race and to win and so I don't worry about the whole
Ford-Pontiac-Chevrolet issue a whole lot, other than I think a lot
of people should look at the facts and not make presumptions on
just one or two races.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chevys really complained at Daytona, and rightfully so,
but at the same time we knew that going to Rockingham they'd be
awfully tough, and they were.''
</P>
<P>
   While Daytona and Rockingham are vastly different tracks that
yielded inconclusive evidence, NASCAR officials will be watching
the performance of the GM cars vs. Ford at Las Vegas, which is
similar to many of the 21 other venues on the circuit with its 1
1/2-mile span and 12-degree banking in the corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what NASCAR is going to be looking at real
hard,'' said Martin. ``They've taken some cars to the wind tunnel
already, and they've heard everybody complaining and arguing about
who has what and telling them what to do about it. But it looked to
me like Rockingham was a pretty good race. NASCAR might change some
rules before too long, but right now all we can do is race what
we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crash course
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart has certainly experienced his share of ups and
downs at Las Vegas. In his first Indy Racing League event four
years ago, Stewart suffered severe hip injuries from a crash. He
returned in 1997 and wound up clinching the IRL championship. Last
year, in his Winston Cup rookie season, Stewart crashed again, but
wound up 36th. ``Obviously the high was winning the IRL
championship at the last race of the year in '97,'' Stewart said.
``The low definitely would've been in '96 in the first IRL race we
ever had out there. I had the worst crash I've had in 21 years of
racing. It was something that I didn't have any control over and
couldn't have predicted that it would happen. There was no warning.
The tire just went. I hit the wall backward at about 215 miles per
hour. That was a painful experience. Vegas has just been one of
those places that's either been really good or really bad. I either
wreck there or win a championship. It's a place where we haven't
found a happy medium yet.'' . . . After he finished third at
Daytona, where he lost the lead on the last lap to eventual winner
Mike Wallace, Andy Houston captured his first victory of the season
in last weekend's NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at
Homestead-Miami Speedway . . . Barry Bodine, the 22-year-old son of
NASCAR veteran Geoffrey Bodine, climbed behind the wheel of the No.
15 Ford F-150 truck that his father demolished in a fiery 13-truck
crash at Daytona, and finished 13th. Said Barry, ``Dad's still not
feeling good; he's pretty sore. But he's feeling a lot better than
he did.'' The elder Bodine suffered a concussion and fractures to
his wrist, ankle, and a vertebra.

   Formula One teams wrapped up testing this week in Spain in
preparation for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix March 12
in Melbourne. The F1 circuit will make its first US stop in more
than a decade at the US Grand Prix Sept. 24 at Indianapolis Motor
Speedway. In the final test session at Spain's Jerez circuit,
Jaguar-Cosworth R1 drivers Eddie Irvine and Johnny Herbert were
fastest, with Irvine turning a quick lap of 1 minute 23.2 seconds
and Herbert a tick off the pace at 1:23.3. Reigning F1 champion
Mika Hakkinen drove only on the first day, in the West
McLaren-Mercedes MP4-15, before turning over the test to teammate
David Coulthard and test/reserve driver Olivier Panis, who drove
all three days of testing and was seventh at 1:23.9, a hair quicker
than Coulthard (1:24.0) . . . When he won CART's inaugural US 500
in 1996, which went head-to-head with the Indy 500 after CART and
the IRL split, Jimmy Vasser was defiant in victory, quaffing
champaigne while saying, ``Who needs milk?,'' a reference to the
Victory Lane tradition at the fabled Brickyard. It seems Vasser has
changed his tune now that car owner Chip Ganassi has announced
plans to field entries for Vasser and Juan Montoya, the reigning
CART champion, at Indy this May. ``I'm looking forward to the
competition, for sure,'' said Vasser, who has competed in four Indy
500s (1992-95) and recorded his best effort in 1994, finishing
fourth. ``I really enjoyed all the races I had here before. It's
still the Indianapolis 500, and it's something I want to add to my
credentials as a race win.'' In his last race at Indy, Vasser was
dueling Scott Pruett for the lead when he made contact with the
wall on Lap 170, forcing him to retire in 22d place. ``I remember
clearly the last lap I ran here at Indianapolis, I led,'' he said.
``And then I ended up in the fence. It was great racing. That
moment was the springboard for what was to come for me in 1996 and
the coming years. To think that was five years ago seems unreal.''
Team Target-Ganassi will test at Indy March 29. Though Montoya will
be listed as a rookie, he will not have to undergo the rookie
orientation program because of his previous experience on
high-speed ovals in CART. ``It doesn't matter to me if they make me
race in a school bus,'' said Montoya. ``I'm excited to finally see
the famous track that I've been watching on television since I was
5 years old.''

FANS SQUARELY IN DEFENSEMAN'S CORNER

<P>
   Ask Bruins fans if Ray Bourque should be traded to a Stanley Cup
contender and they answer with a resounding no.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Philadelphia Flyers fans _ and there were plenty of them on
hand at the FleetCenter Saturday _ and it's a whole different
story.
</P>
<P>
   Of 25 fans polled between the second and third periods of the
Flyers' 3-0 win over the Bruins, 20 of them, or 80 percent, said a
trade shouldn't happen. Yet, if a trade was Bourque's request, they
felt it should be honored. The other 20 percent said yes. And all
but one was a Philly fan.
</P>
<P>
   Unscientific to be sure, but a pretty good sampling of just how
highly Bruins fandom thinks of Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Westphal of Winthrop, who roamed the corridors bedecked in
a Bourque jersey, was the only Bruins fan who thought Bourque
should be traded, but if it happened, he said, it would bring him
to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they should trade him,'' said Westphal. ``I love the
guy. He's put in hard years with us here, but I believe he deserves
a shot at the Cup. He definitely deserves it. If he leaves, though,
I'll be heartbroken. He's given so much of himself to the town, to
the team, and to the game. But he deserves the chance to win it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling what other fans had to say.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Conches, 42, of Philadelphia: ``Absolutely not. It would be
like the Flyers trading Bobby Clarke or Eric Lindros. He is a
Boston Bruin and he should stay a Boston Bruin. I'd love to see him
with the Flyers, and if it happens, I'd be delighted, but I don't
think it would be right for the Bruins to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Pearson, 34, of Keene, N.H.: ``They should keep him. He's
been here a long time and he should end his career here. If it was
going to happen, it probably should have been done last year. I'd
hate to see him go, but if he does, I wish him the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken DiGuilio, 43, of Methuen: ``I'd hate to see him go, and I
hope it doesn't happen, but if it's a chance for him to get a ring,
well, maybe it's best for him. He deserves one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Jean, 35, of Pelham, N.H.: ``No, they shouldn't trade him.
If he requests it, maybe, but other than that, no way. He's a
legend here. This is his town and he belongs here. I'd be
disappointed if it happened, but I love Ray, and if it's a chance
for him to win a Cup, maybe it's best.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Schulman, 36, of Philadelphia: ``As a Flyers fan, they
should trade him. But only to Philadelphia. We'd only be renting
him for two months. After that, he'd be a free agent and could
return to Boston if he wanted. But at least he'd get a chance to
win a Stanley Cup. That's not going to happen with the Bruins.
Right now, we need puck-carrying defensemen and he'd fill that
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed DiMeo, 35, of Philadelphia: ``He's been in Boston so long
without winning and (Harry) Sinden owes it to him to give him a
shot at the Cup. I'd love to see him in a Philly uniform. We need
defensemen and he'd take a load off (Eric) Desjardins.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Plante, 30, of Attleboro: ``He came in a Bruin and I think he
wants to go out a Bruin. Detroit, though, not Philadelphia, has the
best shot. Either way, I hope it doesn't happen. I think he should
stay here in Boston, unless, of course, he asks to be traded.''
</P>
<P>
   Patty Canillas, of Everett: ``Should they trade him? No. But if
he wants to be traded to a contender, more power to him. I'd wish
him nothing but the best. I don't want to see him wear any other
uniform than what he's been wearing for more than 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Eva Aubin, of Biddeford, Maine: ``No way. No how. He's one of
the best players on the team and has been for so long. He shouldn't
leave this team. Sure, the Bruins need more offense, but he's a
fixture here. I think he's loyal and would never request a trade. I
think his roots here are more important to him than winning a
Stanley Cup.''

EVERETT SHOWS HE'S EAGER TO PLEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ The question of how Jimy Williams will deploy
Carl Everett in the Red Sox lineup won't be answered with any
certainty until sore-kneed Nomar Garciaparra is cleared to play in
exhibition games in another week or so.
</P>
<P>
   But Everett offered a pretty good reason why opponents can
expect to see him hitting third, with Garciaparra batting cleanup:
Nomar likes it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Nomar what he prefers and he basically said he likes
the 4 hole,'' Everett said. ``If he likes it there, that's fine
with me. It doesn't matter to me as long as the No. 1 and 2 guys
get on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett hit his first home run of the spring in Saturday's 7-1
win over the Minnesota Twins, a third-inning drive over the
right-center field fence with Trot Nixon aboard on a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was blowing about 15 miles an hour,'' Everett said.
``I knew it was going out.''
</P>
<P>
   No one should have been surprised that Everett's home run came
on the first pitch he saw from Jason Ryan, a 24-year-old
righthander who came to the Twins from the Cubs in the Rick
Aguilera deal. Everett is a first-pitch hacker in the Garciaparra
mold.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Everett hit .466 (34 for 73) when swinging on the
first pitch, and 40 percent of his home runs (10 of 25) came on
first pitches. Lifetime, he's hitting .368 when first-pitch
swinging, with 18 home runs. Garciaparra batted .421 with 6 home
runs last year on first pitches (114 at-bats) and is .398/20 HR
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the pitcher,'' he said. ``A lot of times I
take the first pitch. But if there are guys on base, I don't want
to fall behind in the count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep the pressure on the pitcher. If there's
somebody on base and they throw me a first-pitch strike, I'm going
to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett said he's feeling better than usual at this stage of
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing the ball, and I'm landing on time,'' he said. ``I
have a leg kick when I hit lefthanded, and right now I'm right on
time. I feel if the season started tomorrow, I'd be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who has been in big league camp with four teams, was
asked what he thought of the way the Sox run things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's similar to Houston,'' he said. ``It's nothing like it was
with the Mets and Marlins. The Mets and Marlins run boot camps.
You're tired in April and part of May. That's the downfall in those
camps. You did a lot of stuff. You're burned out in April. I
believe that's why those teams don't have success in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This camp allows you to be where you are. The responsibility
is on the player if you're out of shape. They're asking you to be
professional.''

GAME SEEMED LIKE DISNEY ON ICE

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday's Bruins game at the FleetCenter took on a surreal
quality. Everyone in the building was waiting for future Hall of
Famer Ray Bourque to switch jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   No, he didn't whip off an old Bruins sweater before the game to
reveal a new one underneath, as he did during Phil Esposito's
number-raising ceremony years ago. In those days of wine and roses
for the Bruins, Bourque, in deference to Espo, switched from No. 7
to No. 77. Sunday, there are just days of whine in Bruin country.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unnoticed was the fact that the Bruins were put to sleep
by Philadelphia, 3-0, for their third straight loss. These days the
Bruins should put a warning on all ticket stubs: ``Caution. This
game may impair the ability to drive or operate heavy machinery.
May cause drowsiness or dizziness.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing aspect of the first period was that the
scoreboard clock broke down. For a second, it even flashed
``Raptors 96, Celtics 94.'' The public address announcer had to
give updates on time remaining in the period. The period did not
even end with a buzzer, but with an announcement: ``Time has
expired.'' Seemingly so has the Bruins' season.
</P>
<P>
   It is a philosophical debate whether L'Affaire Bourque is
distracting the Bruins or whether the team is simply caught up in a
yearlong slide that cannot be stopped. Nevertheless, one thing is
certain: These are strange days on Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was on the ice during the final seconds and took a last,
desperate shot to avert the shutout.
</P>
<P>
   An official picked up the puck, and Bourque went over and took
it as a souvenir, possibly of his last game ever. A fan behind the
Bruins' net lifted a sign: ``No Ray, No Pat, No Fan.''
</P>
<P>
   It was right on the money. If you closed your eyes, you would
have sworn you were inside the First Union Center in Philadelphia.
The loudest chants were ``Let's Go Flyers.'' The grandest cheers
were after all three Philly goals. In the stands, there were more
Flyers jerseys than Bruins shirts.
</P>
<P>
   If all this had transpired in the old Garden, the building would
have collapsed in despair.
</P>
<P>
   So the soap opera continues for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year long something like this has been happening,'' said
defenseman Hal Gill.
</P>
<P>
   ``These trade rumors aren't the reason we lost. We're immune to
all that stuff by now. We had to take each day as it comes and play
each game, one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The players did not want to talk about the impending Bourque
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to speculate. I don't want to comment on the
situation,'' said Bourque's longtime teammate and fellow defenseman
Don Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support Ray in whatever he wants to do,'' said goalie Rob
Tallas. ``We're not out of the playoffs yet. We have to play hard
and focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque had very little to say. He kept the media waiting for
nearly an hour before making an appearance. Earlier, former
teammate and Flyers goalie coach Reggie Lemelin reportedly had
escorted Bourque's family out of the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   When Bourque appeared, he walked by the gaggle of minicams and
notebooks and with an embarrassed smile said, ``Sorry, guys.''
There would be no comment on this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player,'' said Gill. ``I hope that whatever
happens is the best for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he asks out, it's a personal decision. He has our respect
and I hope he does what's right for him.''

   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ They wear the same uniform as Stan-o and Tek,
have a locker just like Sabes and Val, sign autographs just like
Pedro and Nomar.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not as many as Pedro and Nomar.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so they sign for Mom and Dad and any little kid just happy
to have anyone who looks like a Red Sox player sign their programs
and scrap paper.
</P>
<P>
   They are the players who are in their first big league camp,
here with the Red Sox, tasting the big league life for the first
time and hoping it won't be their last.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you not be nervous?'' said Paxton Crawford, a
righthanded pitcher from Plummerville, Ark., (pop. 500) who last
season pitched for Double A Trenton. ``There are 40-50 big leaguers
here and we're the new kids on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Rick Riccobono was pitching in Lowell, his first
season of professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Riccobono, who is 20, is standing next to Crawford
when Pedro Martinez breezes into the clubhouse and extends his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `What's up, how you doin'?'' Crawford said. ``That
was real cool, that he came over and introduced himself to us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Crawford, who goes by Pac-Man, P.C., or
Pac-Dog, pitched against Boston College. The next time he is
scheduled to pitch, the Yankees are in town. ``Man, I hate them
Yankees, I hate them with a passion,'' said Crawford, who has a
tattoo of a wildcat on his right biceps and another exotic design
above his left ankle. (``That one hurt a little bit.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the schedule, and lo and behold, it's the Yankees,''
he said. ``I'd love to face (Derek) Jeter and (Paul) O'Neill.''
</P>
<P>
   Any time a team places a player on its 40-man roster, he is
automatically eligible to be in big league camp. That's what
happened with Crawford. For Riccobono, a sixth-round draft pick out
of Commack (N.Y.) High School in 1998, it was in his contract that
he'd be invited.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose thought Riccobono would be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I know I was,'' said Rose. ``I was with the guys that I'd
grown up watching on TV. I told him, `Get right in those drills,
take away the nervousness.' He said, `I'm not nervous.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember feeling like you just don't want to screw up a
drill while everybody's watching,'' Rose said. ``It's like your
biggest fear is to blunder the first time you're in front of
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Riccobono grew up about an hour's drive from Yankee Stadium.
Yes, he said, he was a Yankees fan. ``But I've seen the error of my
ways,'' he said. ``My blood is red.''
</P>
<P>
   Riccobono also pitched against Boston College on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nervous when I went out there because I've been
pitching BP against these guys for a week,'' he said. ``I'm here to
enjoy myself. I'm not going to make the team, so I'm not putting
pressure on myself. This is a great experience. I'm having fun with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first spring with the Seattle Mariners, Derek Lowe
pitched only one inning the entire exhibition schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought it would never end,'' he said. ``I pitched
against the Cubs, and I was trying so hard, I gave up five runs. I
thought I was terrible. I walked guys, hit guys. I walked a couple
of guys on four straight pitches. I felt like running up the white
flag. `Come get me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The new kids, they're usually here to be seen and not heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to play golf,'' Lowe said, ``but nobody ever asked
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley's first camp was with the Texas Rangers, who at the
time trained in Pompano Beach, Fla. Stanley grew up in nearby Fort
Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I got to stay at home,'' he said. ``Things happened
real fast. I didn't stay long. I hit a home run off John Cerutti,
who was with Toronto. I remind him every time I see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys didn't say boo to you. You were a rookie. Veterans didn't
talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck says he was lucky. When he attended his first camp with
the Giants, after going 18-5 the year before, veterans Jeff
Brantley and Dave Righetti schooled him in the big league life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took me under their wing,'' Beck said. ``You're trying to
make the club, it's nails from Day 1. They knew I was closing in on
their job, and they still helped me. That's why I think it's my
responsibility to help someone else out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Sox batting coach Jim Rice said, talent dictates
whether a player is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the rookie, how good he is,'' Rice said. ``I
came up, Freddy (Lynn) came up. There was nothing slack about us.''
</P>
<P>
   From the time he was a walk-on at Florida, David Eckstein has
almost always been on a team inclined to ignore him at first. He's
short, for one thing, with electric blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like Bart Simpson,'' said one Sox official. ``I
thought he was one of the clubhouse kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But on each level he has played in the minors, Eckstein has hit
.300: .301 at Lowell, .306 in Sarasota, .313 in Trenton. This
season, he figures to start in Pawtucket, where he should remind
fans of another Sox second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've heard them call me Jeff Frye's little brother,''
Eckstein said. ``Bart? Hadn't heard that one before. That's
sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Eckstein agreed, you come into your first big league camp
hoping to make an impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be perfect on every play no matter where I'm
playing,'' he said. ``But there's just a great atmosphere here,
very professional. Everybody goes about their business. You can
tell everybody is intense and focused on one goal: winning the
World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   For the new guys, making the team comes before being fitted for
a ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I see guys like Juan Pena and say, `Wow, he's my
competition?' '' said Crawford. ``These guys are tough. But I think
I can hang with them. I hope I can.''

PITINO OPTIMISTIC DESPITE CIRCUMSTANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Sunday's game with Orlando at the FleetCenter
appeared to be a good opportunity for a Celtics victory. The Magic,
after all, already had told their fans to wait until next season.
</P>
<P>
   But the tables appear to be turned. Team Green is in the midst
of a four-game slide and its season is quickly disintegrating. At
27-31, Orlando is happy to be in fourth place because nobody
expected it to be there. The Magic are playing as if they have
little to lose. And, as a subplot to the game, they are led by Ron
Mercer, the former Celtic who was Rick Pitino's No. 1 draft pick
nearly three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino, though unhappy about the Celtics' 23-35 record,
continues to defend his young team, albeit not in the same language
he used after last Wednesday's 104-102 loss to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I do look at life through rose-colored glasses,'' said
Pitino, after Saturday's practice. ``I'm not down at all. I'm
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team is a little short on overall talent. And
we've got to enhance the talent by getting a good draft pick this
year and make a smart move. We have to bring in a wise veteran. And
we have to mature because we're very young.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lifestyle is to be upbeat and positive. Encourage people
rather than discourage them. I believe that's how you get the most
our of your basketball abilities. If they are encouraged. Those
1-point losses turn to 1-point victories. You can't let people get
down. You have to want players to want to come here. I'm just a
believer in the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   While he hopes Celtics fans will cut the team some slack, he
can't expect much sympathy from Mercer, who was the odd man out
last summer when the Celtics chose between the salary demands of
Mercer and Paul Pierce. Mercer, a free agent after this season,
wanted a commitment. Instead he was traded to Denver in a deal that
brought Eric Williams and Danny Fortson here.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer is averaging 14.5 points and 3.9 rebounds in 11 starts
for the Magic and is 34th in the league in overall minutes played.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make a decision that Paul was better than Ron or
that Ron was better than Paul,'' said Pitino. ``It's just that at
the time we did not have the kind of money available that Ron
wanted. We had to make the best deal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was not surprised by his ejection Friday night by veteran
referee Joe Crawford, who also banished Antoine Walker in Boston' s
114-104 loss at Toronto. ``Antoine's was a lot quicker than mine
but I told (Walker) I deserved it a lot more than he did. There are
certain guys in the league _ referee-wise _ to whom you're not
going to say much. Young players, like the kind we have, are going
to have learn that.''

REID LEARNED HARD LESSON FROM TRINIDAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ After 15 fights, many boxers are still six-round
fighters. Friday night, so was David Reid.
</P>
<P>
   For that distance, the World Boxing Association super
welterweight champion was dominating undefeated welterweight
champion Felix Trinidad with his superior hand and foot speed. He
had knocked him down once with a perfect right hand to the chin and
twice more rattled his cage with similar punches. His jab was
landing and he was keeping his challenger at the distance he wanted
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   And then he made a classic amateur's mistake, the kind you learn
around this time in your career one way or another. Against a great
champion, you learn it the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's tutorial began in the seventh round when he was knocked
flat by a crushing left hook that Trinidad had made available to
himself by spending much of the first six rounds cracking Reid in
the ribs with the same punch to bring his opponent's hands down.
Reid staggered back, his hands falling to his sides, and his body
going limp. A full second or more passed before he actually
collapsed, a delayed knockdown that did not bode well for his
senses.
</P>
<P>
   When he got up, Reid's right eyelid was sliced open and swelling
and his tongue hung out of his mouth, signs that he was in a
confusing place he had not been before. He was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, the fight belonged entirely to Trinidad, who
hammered out a unanimous decision after knocking Reid down three
more times in the 11th round and battering him to the head and body
as Reid tried frantically to land one more wild right that might
flatten out his learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was right on the money up to the sixth round,'' said Al
Mitchell, who has trained Reid since he was an amateur. ``He lost a
little focus after that. That's experience. Young athletes got a
tendency to get away from the program. This was his 15th fight. By
the time he gets to 20, he'll be a hell of a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, young Reid was a hell of a fighter Friday night
against Trinidad, who had more than twice as many knockouts (31) as
Reid had fights (15). It was in the boxing department that he came
up short for the first time since long before he won the 1996
Olympic gold medal in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to fight,'' said promoter Don King. ``He knocked Tito
down and nearly won the fight. When he got knocked down, he got
back up and fought. He ain't got no heart trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Reid did not, but his record fell to 15-1 _ while
Trinidad's swelled to 37-0 _ because he could not maintain his
mental control when his more experienced opponent refused to buckle
from early troubles and kept moving forward, crowding the young
champion and making him feel uncomfortable until he broke him down.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the rest was easy for Trinidad, who looked far
stronger and more powerful at 154 pounds than he had in defeating
Oscar De La Hoya to win two-thirds of the welterweight titles last
September at 147.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt close to victory (in the third round) but I couldn't
hit him with the shots to finish him,'' Reid said from behind
sunglasses that hid badly swollen eyes. ``I should have boxed more
but I decided to stay on the inside and bang with him. I learned he
was a little too slick for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started slow and I then let him dictate the pace when he
picked it up. I was in control for a while but then his experience
got me.''
</P>
<P>
   His experience and his fists, both of which tattooed Reid and
took away first his legs, then his reflexes, and finally his
senses. It was a process that began in the seventh round as
Trinidad moved closer and closer to his opponent, whacking him with
digging lefts to the body that took the legs from Reid over time
and then delivering powerful rights to the head, three of which
knocked him flat in a terrible 11th round so lopsided that one
judge gave it to Trinidad, 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think David got a little too comfortable, especially after
he knocked Trinidad down,'' Mitchell said. ``Up to the sixth round
he was perfect. He stopped throwing the jab. He stopped throwing
his right hand but Felix kept throwing his left.''
</P>
<P>
   That left tore Reid apart and tore loose the 154-pound title,
which will now allow Trinidad to vacate the welterweight
championships, one of which will go automatically to De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   The two had been negotiating for months about a June rematch but
arguments over what weight they would fight at persisted, and after
seeing how strong Trinidad was at 154, De La Hoya's concerns about
that clearly are justified. That is why he will fight
ex-lightweight champion Shane Mosley instead on June 10 or 17 while
Trinidad pursues another piece of the 154-pound title or moves up
again to 160.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the new super welterweight champion of the world,''
Trinidad said. ``I will be waiting for De La Hoya here.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be waiting for him just as he was for Reid after he got
knocked flat in that third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was down on the canvas, I felt when I got up it would
be over for David Reid,'' Trinidad said. ``If you don't get me
early, the fight is over. When I get up, I'm dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous to an inexperienced champion ahead of his time, and
just as dangerous to one with as much experience as himself: Oscar
De La Hoya.

PROFESSIONALLY SPEAKING, IT WAS QUITE AN AT-BAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ The at-bat of the 1999 Boston Red Sox season
belonged to a 27-year-old rookie named Brian Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, it was ``Brian Who?'' But by the night
of Aug. 16, Brian Daubach had established himself as a serious
major league hitter, the kind of guy you'd like to see up there in
a pressure circumstance. And with his team trailing the Oakland A's
_ its chief wild-card competition _ 5-3, the bases loaded and two
away in the ninth, this was a certified capital C, Clutch
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland pitcher was hard-throwing Tim Worrell. Daubach had
faced him once before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was earlier in the season in a blowout situation,'' Daubach
recalls. ``He threw me a first-pitch changeup, and I hit it right
back to the box.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a spot like this, Daubach didn't expect to see anything
but a heater from Worrell. Bases loaded, game on the line, he
figured Worrell would stick with No. 1, clearly his signature
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch 1. ``A changeup,'' says Daubach. ``Up and away.'' That
gave Daubach something to think about. Count: 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch 2. Fastball. Another ball. Count: 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch 3. ``Another fastball. I fouled it back.'' Count: 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch 4. ``He threw me another fastball for a ball. I figured by
this time that with Nomar (Garciaparra) and the bases loaded behind
me I was going to see all fastballs.'' Count: 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch 5. ``A fastball down and in. I gave it a good rip and I
almost killed (first base coach) Dave Jauss.'' Count: 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch 6. ``Another fastball I fouled straight back.'' Count:
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch 7. ``Another fastball, I was jammed a little bit, and I
fouled it back. The crowd was screaming so loud that (catcher A.J.)
Hinch couldn't hear Worrell locate the ball for him and he got a
late start. The ball could have been caught.'' Count: 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch 8. ``He threw me another fastball, and I fouled it
straight back.'' Count: 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch 9. ``He threw me another fastball and I turned on it. I
hit the ball as hard as I could. It was heading down the right
field line and I remember thinking, `Hit the pole!' so there
wouldn't be any doubt. The ball went past the pole, and the umpire
called it foul. I still think it was fair. I know it was close, but
I almost lost it. I was screaming, and Jauss said, `Just don't get
thrown out!' I had to compose myself, and I remember saying
something to Nomar along the lines of, `Should I win it, or do you
want to?' I'm not sure exactly what I said, but it was almost
arrogant. But I do remember that Nomar said, `Just do your job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pitch 10. ``After eight straight fastballs, he threw me a
changeup away. I love going the other way in Fenway (editor's note:
Daubach hit five off and four over the Wall last year), and I hit
it real high off the Wall. The first two runners scored easy, and I
mean Offy (Jose Offerman) was really flying. He was crossing the
plate by the time I pulled into second.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those transcendent baseball moments, and it capped
a phenomenal stretch that earned Daubach Player of the Week honors
(13 for 26, 15 RBIs, .522 on-base percentage, 1.077 slugging
percentage). It was not just a good at-bat, or even a quality
at-bat. It was a totally professional at-bat, one that sent
Daubach's clubhouse stock, already high, to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   ``At-bats like those are very special,'' points out John
Valentin. ``Because after a while they get very personal. You want
to win the battle. We use the term `battling,' and after you foul
off a guy's best pitches two or three times, it really is a
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer it goes,'' agrees Mike Stanley, ``it's mano-a-mano.
Your senses are sharpened. You're more aware. You're heightened.
You're more acute.''
</P>
<P>
   What distinguished this particular at-bat were Pitches 7, 9, and
10. Someone long ago said, ``I'd rather be lucky than good,'' and
Daubach should have been out on the pop foul. What happened two
pitches later was electrifying. Daubach crushed, absolutely
crushed, the ball. From the instant it left the bat, the only
question was fair/foul, not distance. After the game, scores of
fans seated in the foul pole area swore it should have been a
game-winning grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the other great element of his at-bat,'' says Stanley.
``After losing the home run he had to grab hold of his emotions and
get back to work. That's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   We've all seen long-count at-bats, and we've all seen just-foul
home runs, and if there's one thing we can usually count on it's
that the batter is finished. He has just had his best chance. But
Daubach calmed himself down, stepped into the box, and smacked that
changeup off the wall in left-center to win the game. He did not
lose his concentration.
</P>
<P>
   About that changeup . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``As a catcher,'' says Stanley, ``I can tell you that in a
situation like that you want to get beaten on your best pitch.
Worrell must have decided after that near home run he'd try to
trick him. But I can tell you he would have slept much better that
night if he had lost on a fastball, rather than that changeup. He
was probably kicking himself in the ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen practically can guarantee it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to get beat,'' says Saberhagen, veteran of
many such battles, ``you want it to be with your best pitch. You
tip your cap if he beats you, but you can accept it better.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that Daubach, a guy with fewer than 300 big
league at-bats at the time, was able to make the superb adjustment
from dealing with eight consecutive fastballs, the last of which he
had tattooed, to taking a surprise changeup to the opposite field
in a clutch situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' salutes Valentin, ``a job very well done.''
</P>
<P>
   The big hit cemented his status as a minor folk hero, and it
represented his peak moment of the season. Almost immediately
thereafter, he went into slump from which he didn't emerge until
the last week or so in the season. He did some damage in the
playoffs, and now, as he starts his second big league season,
Daubach wants to be looked at as just another legitimate big
leaguer, and not the cutesy career minor leaguer, the
frog-turned-prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to tell the story over and over, in every city,'' he
says. ``It got old. This year I want to talk about 2000, not the 10
years in the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, if he chooses, he can talk about the best Red Sox
at-bat of the 1999 season. He's entitled.

 FLAGSTAFF TO DRAW LINE ON (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 BY KATHLEEN INGLEY 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  Editor's note: In the stormy debate
over growth, Valley residents could look north and south for
innovative ideas. Flagstaff is drawing growth boundaries, while
Pima County is creating a desert conservation plan. Today and
Monday, The Arizona Republic looks at each strategy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   (FLAGSTAFF) - Tired of seeing rooftops replace ponderosa pines,
Flagstaff residents are about to rope in development with an urban
growth boundary.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a preview of what's ahead for communities throughout
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``People very much care about hav ing a line between where
develop ment ends and nature starts,'' said Brad Ack of the
non-profit Grand Canyon Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The worry in this college town is the same as elsewhere in
Arizona: How to make sure growth doesn't destroy a region's special
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   In Flagstaff, that means clean moun tain air, dramatic views of
the San Francisco Peaks, a small-town at mosphere, easy access to
Northern Arizona University and quick get aways to the woods.
</P>

   ``One of the great values of Flagstaff is, without getting into
a car, I can walk, jog or ride a bike and get onto the Forest
Service service roads with ease,'' said astronomer Nat White,
president of the board of Friends of Flagstaff's Future.
</P>
<P>
   A growth boundary would brake the city's outward expansion by
limiting where houses and businesses were built. That's a big step
in a state known for its freewheeling, roll-out-the-welcome-mat
approach to devel opment.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a key part of competing plans to manage the number of
people flocking to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull's Growing Smarter Plus, which the Legislature
passed last month, specifically allows cities to limit how far they
extend services at public expense.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial Citizens Growth Management Initiative,
expected to be on the Nov. 7 ballot, includes strict growth
boundaries for both cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
   The tide of people rolling into Arizona is expected to raise the
population by nearly 50 percent over the next two decades. That
means the Flagstaff area will be home to 104,000 people, up from
71,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for all those people, the city and Coconino County
have been working on a land-use and transportation plan for the
past two years. Growth boundaries are a central point in the draft,
which is going through each government's approval process.
</P>
<P>
   As the residents of the Flagstaff area are discovering, the
debate over growth boundaries revolves around difficult trade-offs,
increased housing density and higher home prices.
</P>
<P>
   LIMITS MEAN TRADE-OFFS
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff has actually had a version of growth boundaries for
years, limiting the elevation to which it would extend waterlines
at public expense.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan goes a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to protect our open space,'' Flagstaff project
manager Ursula Montano said, ``and do it at a regional level, with
a unified approach between the county and city.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth boundary is drawn to include all private land in the
city and has enough room for growth over the next 20 years. It
would be reviewed periodically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if it's something that's a brick wall around the
city,'' said Earle Hoyt, a retired chemistry professor who was on
the land-use task force.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalist Ack considers the boundaries far too generous.
He prefers leaving room for just 10 years of growth, the limit set
in the Citizens Growth Management Initia tive.
</P>
<P>
   A drive through Lockett Ranch shows what planners are trying to
avoid. This stretch of meadow at the foot of Mount Elden, just
outside the city limits, is being sold off in large lots for
upscale homes. The view of abrupt mountainsides is stunning, the
scent of pine enticing.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Flagstaff has to get away from this type of
extremely low-density growth, with each home on 3 to 5 acres,
because it gobbles up a lot of land for relatively few people.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the region's 48,000 acres of private land are
already developed. Many fear that if the rest isn't developed
efficiently, there will be pressure to take land out of the
surrounding Coconino National For est.
</P>
<P>
   Ack said there's a seldom-discussed trade-off when development
moves to the urban fringe: ``You condemn some of your inner areas
to blight, which is crazy from the point of community interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunnyside neighborhood in east Flagstaff is a prime example,
he says. A once-thriving shopping center is now half-empty behind a
vast ex panse of asphalt. Retailers such as Kmart bailed out and
moved to the growing edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   The urban growth boundary is de signed to direct development
back into the center of town, where roads, sewers and other
services are already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In-fill'' is planning jargon for buq5$Nj kzn vacant or
underused lots within a town rather than on raw land at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to protect surrounding open spaces, growth has to
be developed in in-fill areas,'' Flagstaff planner Montano said.
</P>
<P>
   That means places that Flagstaff residents are used to seeing
empty.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan Mesa has long been a bit of green breathing space, an
undevel oped strip separating east and west Flagstaff. Now, it's
proposed to become a mixed-use neighborhood, with both homes and
business es.DENSITY DILEMMA
</P>
<P>
   An even hotter issue than where the houses go is how many are
built on each acre.
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff residents are used to an open, rural pattern in many
parts of town. More than half the existing houses are single family
homes on relatively large lots, with no more than five homes per
acre.
</P>
<P>
   The new land-use plan would set minimum residential densities of
at least five homes per acre in many places.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing out of the ordinary in Phoenix, where new
subdivisions are typically at that density, built on lots of 8,000
to 10,000 square feet or less.
</P>
<P>
   But for northern Arizona, ``I'm not keen on it at all,''
Flagstaff developer Dale Little said. ``It pretty much directs that
all future development within the town would be at much higher
densities than we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff planners, however, point out that the housing mix is
already changing. Only a third of the houses built in the past
decade fit the old low-density pattern, while 44 percent are
apartments and townhouses.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would put a mixed-use development in southeast
Flagstaff, right next to a ``county island,'' an unincorporated
area within the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what Flagstaff is all about, to have such density,''
said resident Betsy McKellar, who lives in that area.
</P>
<P>
   The lots there are 1-acre minimum, roads are unpaved and housing
styles are so eclectic that one yard includes a teepee. McKellar
can't imagine putting a slice of suburbia up against the back fence
of her neighbor, who has horses, ducks and a vast collection of old
silverware destined for offbeat artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, she said, is that the develop ment would be so close to
Walnut Canyon National Monument, where prehistoric archaeological
sites are tucked under limestone ledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canyon would be ruined, the wildlife would be driven off,
the place would be covered with graf fiti,'' said McKellar, who is
spokes woman for Friends of Walnut Canyon. The group is lobbying to
expand the boundaries of the monu ment, which would put it less
than a mile from the planned development.
</P>
<P>
   Planning officials disagree with such predictions and say
numbers don't tell the whole story. The minimum densities apply
only to larger parcels, when a rezoning is requested.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they say, trade-offs are inevita ble. The city has gone
north about as far as it can, and there's room to the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth has to be in somebody's neighborhood,'' said Bill
Towler, director of community development for Coconino County.
</P>
<P>
   It's logical, he added, to keep urban densities in the city,
which can support them. For its part, the county has drawn rural
growth boundaries, which basically take in all the unincorporated
private prop erty near Flagstaff. Those boundaries would make
little change in the pattern of development, except to highlight
the county's desire to pre serve public lands.RISING HOME PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Jean Richmond, executive vice presi dent of the Northern Arizona
Home Builders Association, says the den sity requirements should be
a city wide average, not applied to individual sites.
</P>
<P>
   She's concerned, too, that the limits and new requirements in
the pro posal, such as more master planning, would jack up the cost
of housing.
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff already has the typical housing crunch of a college
town. Only a third of residents can afford to buy a home at the
median price of $150,000, a price tag that is 25 percent higher
than in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond said Flagstaff parents worry that high home prices,
aggra vated by low wages, will drive their kids away.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Sandi Gilbertson, whose daughter moved
to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, last fall, where comparable houses cost a
third less.
</P>
<P>
   With another daughter already in Idaho, Gilbertson and her
husband ended up making the move, too, so they can be near their
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The couple regretted leaving Flag staff, but there's an upside:
``We can buy the same house for a lot less money.''
</P>
<P>
   If prices and densities both go up, home buyers in Flagstaff may
have to settle for smaller lots or attached units.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a plus, if it's done well, astronomer White said.
He hopes an imaginative developer will do in-fill in ways that
preserve the small-town atmosphere: perhaps with apartments above
stores and ``clus ter'' developments where dense hous ing is offset
by open space.
</P>
<P>
   White and others in Flagstaff have settled for lower salaries
than they could get elsewhere in exchange for living closer to
nature in a small-town setting.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that a compactly built city, with a well-designed trail
system, will continue to make their sacrifice worthwhile.

PARTY TAKES FIGHT TO MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, John McCain has been crusading against the
Republican Party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the critical Super Tuesday presidential primaries
looming, the establishment is striking back.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders are taking the battle to him on dozens of fronts
simultaneously while promoting front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, McCain's GOP colleagues, once accused in the
media of waging a ``whisper campaign,'' are turning up the volume.
Senators such as Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Robert Bennett,
R-Utah, depict the Arizona Republican as a pugnacious,
``polarizing'' figure who undermines his effectiveness by taking
issues personally.
</P>
<P>
   One group of senators from both parties says it even had to
develop a strategy for handling McCain's occasional explosions:
stand right next to him and get in his face until he calms down.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, governors are recording telephone messages in
Bush's behalf to be played to thousands of their constituents. Some
of the chief executives say they are insulted by McCain's railing
against state GOP ``machines.''
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota Gov. Ed Schafer said he was so motivated to help
Bush and so put off by McCain that he grabbed a flight to Arizona
on short notice to attend McCain's home state's primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew down commercially. I don't even know if the (Bush)
campaign is paying for it or not,'' Schafer, chairman of the
Republican Governors Association, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `I'm a reformer,' '' Schafer said of McCain. ``But I
don't think his negativism or his fighting or his methods _
browbeating _ get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, mayors are tailoring specific anti-McCain
messages they hope will resonate with their voters. For example, in
New York, the mayors of Yonkers, Rome and other towns denounced the
Arizona senator last week for voting against aid to help the poor
pay heating bills.
</P>
<P>
   New York, California and Ohio are the key states in Tuesday's
primaries, in which more than half the 1,034 delegates needed to
win the GOP nomination will be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   WAKE-UP CALL FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Bush's alarm became particularly acute after McCain's surprise
victory in Michigan when it appeared that the combined clout of
various governors was not enough to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain's campaign was struggling going into the weekend
before Super Tuesday, he has been in this situation before and
managed to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has been trying, not always successfully, to
line up all of its establishment troops in coordinated strikes
against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only senators, governors and mayors who are
concentrating their fire on McCain. A wealthy Texas businessman,
who is a big Bush contributor, paid $2.5 million for political
commercials in California, Ohio and New York that attacked McCain's
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the Arizona primary, Bush aides sent reporters
remarks from three Republican senators calling on McCain ``to stop
the smear campaign suggesting Gov. Bush is anti-Catholic.'' Bush
had come under criticism for delivering a speech at South
Carolina's Bob Jones University, which has attacked the Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   One of the senators, Ohio Republican George Voinovich, was
quoted in Bush's e-mail as saying, ``This smear campaign is beneath
contempt and beyond comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich never, in fact, made the comment. His aide, Mike
Dawson, said the quote was written by a Bush campaign staff member
with the expectation that the Ohio senator would sign off on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wish that things like that didn't happen,'' Dawson said.
``Campaigns are going at 500 miles per hour.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP ON DEFENSIVE?
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., a McCain backer, says the party's
brass is tripping over itself to try to oust McCain as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican establishment fell in love with and gave the
nomination to Governor Bush long before they determined whether he
was an electable national candidate and before they realized John
McCain might be a much more compelling candidate,'' Shadegg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once McCain became a clear threat to a Bush nomination, the
establishment was forced to aggressively oppose him to protect
their early endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic way, all of the establishment's rhetoric against
McCain may actually help him.
</P>
<P>
   He has won votes by depicting himself as a principled insurgent
raging against the machine. What better way to demonstrate his
maverick, reformist credentials than by pointing to the army of
politicians lined up against him?
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got all the establishment,'' McCain said in a Virginia
speech last week that he has repeated in various forms for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got all the governors, they've got the senators and
the Congress _ they got them all. And I've got all the foot
soldiers right here,'' he said. ``I'm telling you, we're just like
Luke Skywalker headed out of the Death Star. They're shooting at us
from every direction.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT BUYING THE MESSAGE
</P>
<P>
   But some of Bush's highest profile backers believe McCain's
populist appeals ring hollow. They say McCain unsuccessfully
pursued many of the same establishment figures who ultimately
endorsed the Texas governor instead.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for example, sought the backing last year of Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., who serves with the Arizonan on the Senate
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Gorton privately told a group of amused lobbyists
that McCain blew up at him when Gorton said he was supporting Bush.
McCain aides, however, insisted that the conversation remained
civil.
</P>
<P>
   Montana Gov. Marc Racicot says he believes McCain adapted his
campaign theme to fit his lack of party support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This didn't become a `machine' that he could opportunistically
seek to take advantage of until such time as no one was supporting
him,'' said Racicot, who has endorsed Bush. ``At that point in
time, he began these populist themes and this notion of running
against the establishment and against machines. I suspect he would
have been delighted to have some of what he describes as machines
on his side.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shadegg said McCain is a real reformer. ``McCain scares the
establishment because he is more willing to shake up Washington and
make meaningful changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's most significant reform proposal would ban ``soft
money,'' the unregulated contributions that flow into the national
Republican and Democratic parties. Soft money is supposed to build
support for parties instead of specific candidates, but both
parties bent the rules during the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As it always does, the Republican National Committee, which
might be considered the ultimate establishment group, is remaining
officially neutral in the GOP presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   But the RNC and McCain remain deeply split over the soft-money
issue, and that disagreement is a big reason why many committeemen
around the country won't back McCain.
</P>
<P>
   At its winter meeting earlier this year, the RNC endorsed a
resolution that said McCain's campaign finance proposal ``is a
scheme that amounts to unilateral disarmament by Republicans and
their allies while leaving the Democrats, unions and liberal
special interests untouched.'' &QL;

FLAGSTAFF TO DRAW LINE ON
 GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 BY KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
Editor's note: In the stormy debate over growth, Valley residents
could look north and south for innovative ideas. Flagstaff is
drawing growth boundaries, while Pima County is creating a desert
conservation plan. Today and Monday, The Arizona Republic looks at
each strategy. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (FLAGSTAFF) - Tired of seeing rooftops replace ponderosa pines,
Flagstaff residents are about to rope in development with an urban
growth boundary.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a preview of what's ahead for communities throughout
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``People very much care about hav ing a line between where
develop ment ends and nature starts,'' said Brad Ack of the
non-profit Grand Canyon Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The worry in this college town is the same as elsewhere in
Arizona: How to make sure growth doesn't destroy a region's special
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   In Flagstaff, that means clean moun tain air, dramatic views of
the San Francisco Peaks, a small-town at mosphere, easy access to
Northern Arizona University and quick get aways to the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great values of Flagstaff is, without getting into

median price of $150,000, a price tag that is 25 percent higher
than in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond said Flagstaff parents worry that high home prices,
aggra vated by low wages, will drive their kids away.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Sandi Gilbertson, whose daughter moved
to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, last fall, where comparable houses cost a
third less.
</P>
<P>
   With another daughter already in Idaho, Gilbertson and her
husband ended up making the move, too, so they can be near their
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The couple regretted leaving Flag staff, but there's an upside:
``We can buy the same house for a lot less money.''
</P>
<P>
   If prices and densities both go up, home buyers in Flagstaff may
have to settle for smaller lots or attached units.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a plus, if it's done well, astronomer White said.
He hopes an imaginative developer will do in-fill in ways that
preserve the small-town atmosphere: perhaps with apartments above
stores and ``clus ter'' developments where dense hous ing is offset
by open space.
</P>
<P>
   White and others in Flagstaff have settled for lower salaries
than they could get elsewhere in exchange for living closer to
nature in a small-town setting.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that a compactly built city, with a well-designed trail
system, will continue to make their sacrifice worthwhile.

THE NIGHT THAT BASEBALL
 LOST ITS A-PEEL

   I'd last spoken to Dave Bresnahan in September 1987, shortly
after he'd been tossed out of professional baseball for publicly
displaying a sense of humor, an offense more heinous to league
officials than spewing racist screeds or snorting dope.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 137th game of a 140-game season in the Class AA
Eastern League. The Williamsport (Pa.) Bulls, for which Bresnahan
was a catcher, were playing the Reading Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been talking to a lot of guys about pulling the stunt,''
Bresnahan remembers. ``It was the end of a long season and I
figured, `What the heck?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bresnahan once starred in Phoenix for Gerard High School and
Grand Canyon University. By 1987, he'd been in the minor leagues
for three years and still hoped to get into the majors with an
expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   That steamy night in central Penn sylvania, Bresnahan placed a
peeled potato inside his spare glove in the Bull's dugout. In the
fourth inning, with a man on third and two out, the young catcher
reached a crossroads in his career. He had to decide:
</P>
<P>
   Tuber, or not tuber?
</P>
<P>
   One of Bresnahan's relatives, great-Uncle Roger Bresnahan, was a
Hall of Fame catcher credited with introducing shin guards. Young
Dave's boss would later tell the`` New York Times,'' ``I guess
ingenu ity is in the Bresnahan bloodlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Bresnahan told the umpire he had a problem with his glove and
needed to get a new one. Back behind the plate, Bresnahan slipped
the potato into his throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   After catching the next pitch, Bres nahan reared up fired the
potato over the third baseman's head. It looked like a wild
pick-off play, causing the base runner to trot home. Bresnahan, who
had the real ball in his glove, casually tagged him out.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a potato in left field, the fans went wild. Then the
umpires went wild, tossing Bresnahan from the game. Then the team
went wild, dropping him from the roster.
</P>
<P>
   `'That was it,'' he says. ``That was my last game as a pro.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after getting fired, Bresna han delivered a bag of
potatoes to his manager with a note reading, ``This spud's for
you.'' Then, he returned to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after John Rocker's sus pension for racist remarks
was re duced, and after multiple drug abuser Darryl Strawberry was
suspended but not banned from baseball, I contacted Bresnahan.
</P>
<P>
   Painful as it may be, I asked if he'd mind rehashing the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since AA ball, he's sold real estate and worked as
a stockbro ker. He's married and has three young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career allows me to spend lots of time with my family,'' he
says. He's coached high school and plays in an over-30 league,
which he calls ``an excuse to drink beer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 197, the potato play finally yielded some gravy. Bresnahan
was asked back to Williamsport for the 10-year anniversary. That
appearance led a Japanese TV show to invite him to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I'd have liked to be remembered for something
better, baseball-wise,'' he says, ``but it was fun. I enjoyed my
time in the game. It makes me sad to see talented guys like Rocker
do such dumb things.''
</P>
<P>
   He has season tickets to the Dia mondbacks. He coaches his own
kids in peewee ball. He likes his work, his life.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, he's been called a ``catch'' potato. And, yes, he's
aware that in the grand scheme things that he's small potatoes.
And, yes, it's been pointed out to him that he's a ``cleat'' and
potatoes kind of guy. And, no, it doesn't bother him.
</P>
<P>
   The man has every right but, still, doesn't have a chip on his
shoulder. &QL;

RICE'S SLUMP CAUSES LITTLE CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few weeks ago, a slump by one of the Lakers' top
players might have triggered widespread panic. But a 14-game
winning streak has all but obscured the fact that Glen Rice has
recently disappeared again.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has gone three straight games without scoring in double
figures -- a first in his 88-game Lakers career -- shooting 35.7
percent (10 for 28) from the field and averaging 8.3 points during
the slide.
</P>
<P>
   But the statistical dropoff coincides with wins over Portland,
Vancouver and Indiana, and a resurgence from the Lakers' bench. So
coach Phil Jackson isn't expressing much concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really looked at that from that point of view, I
haven't really taken that as the most challeging thing,'' Jackson
said. ``We feel kind of like, if teams want to occupy themselves to
just denying Glen the ability to touch the ball, it allows other
people to be open, and it gives us greater spacing to play our
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there's situations in the game where we need him to
score, but we haven't had that since the Portland game, when we
really wanted him to score some points for us in that game. They
did a good job (defending him), and Rick (Fox) got off and hit a
couple 3s for us. So we haven't really just been focusing on that.
... He's someone we can rely on, but yet it's not so critical for
us that we feel the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq vs. 'Zo: Shaquille O'Neal's list of capable rivals is
dwindling, but today's opponent, Miami's Alonzo Mourning, is among
them. And for added spice, the two have a history of strong mutual
dislike. O 'Neal downplays any personal differences, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal, no,'' he said. ``But on the court, we're just two
competitive big guys that are trying to win. So it'll probably look
ugly at times , but in real life, it's nothing ugly at all.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal looks forward to the rare one-on-one challenge, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great defensive player. They're probably going to play
(me) as straight up as possible and then sag, force the outside
players to make some shots,'' he said. ``When I play against the
best, it brings the best out of me, so hopefully I can have a good
game. I've been playing pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson, ``I just don't want him to get in foul trouble, if
he's too keyed up, because there's not a whole lot of resources we
have behind him to stop Mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   Streakers: A win today would all but guarantee the Lakers a
second 16-game streak this season. They play the Clippers on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When the first streak died, players figured they got a bit
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that happening this time,'' O'Neal said. ``There's
only 20-something games left, so we want to keep it real tight.''
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS vs. HEAT
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff: 3 p.m., Staples Center
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: KNBC-Channel 4; KLAC-AM (570)
</P>
<P>
   Lakers (48-11) update: They play 15 of their final 23 games
against probable playoff teams, starting with Miami today. The
Lakers have beaten the Heat five straight times in L.A., but the
teams haven't p layed since the 1997-98 season, when they split the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Heat (37-21) update: Miami is well-rested. The Heat hasn't
played since Thursday, giving Alonzo Mourning (left ankle) time to
heal; he is expected to play today after missing three games. The
Heat has wo n five of its last six games, but is just 15-15 on the
road.

UCLA STUNS STANFORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD - With one shot, everything changed. With one sweet
stroke by JaRon Rush, UCLA's season - and perhaps the future of its
program - changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new season for us,'' Rush said. ``We got a big-time
win, we've got a four-game winning streak, we beat the No. 1 team
on its home court, our attitude's up, and now we're a team to be
reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll get no argument from top-ranked Stanford, which watched
its 13-game winning streak vanish Saturday when Rush buried a
last-second baseline jumper to give UCLA a 94-93 overtime victory
before 7,391 in rowdy Maples Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of its worst loss ever, UCLA - a 19-point underdog -
recorded one of its most memorable victories in years.
</P>
<P>
   This was a fabulous game, the best in the Pac-10 this season. It
was taut, intense and well-played. There were four lead changes in
the last minute of regulation and three in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It was so good, in fact, it ended twice: UCLA danced off the
court only to be recalled by the officials. When TV replays
confirmed Ray Young's jumper hit the rim with nine seconds left on
the game clock - thus resetting the shot clock - lead official
Charlie Range approved Rush's subsequent jumper and declared UCLA
the survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one great team, Stanford, and one team that's trying
to get back in the mix nationally,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
``Today was a good step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   It was giant step for the embattled Lavin, for his much-maligned
staff and for UCLA's NCAA Tournament hopes. If the Bruins (17-11,
8-8) simply beat last-place Washington State on Thursday in Pauley
Pavilion, they'll have the 18 wins necessary for an at-large berth.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's shocker wasn't about win totals or four-game
winning streaks. This was a seed victory - the kind of power-rating
push that turns a No. 9 seed into a No. 7, and that could mean
avoiding a No. 1 seed in the second round. After all, there's
nothing the Selection committee likes more than late-season road
wins over ranked teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to end the NCAA Tournament rumors,'' Bruins guard
Earl Watson said. ``Everyone predicted we'd beat Cal but lose to
Stanford. We were like, `Hold on, here.' Now, we've got the
Washington schools at home, and that's a good situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe this is the same team that lost at Arizona
State by 29 points two weeks ago. Or that lost to Arizona (without
Loren Woods) by 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's not the same. For one thing, Rush is back from
his 2-month suspension, and his impact was immediate. In 26 minutes
Saturday, he hit 7-of-10 shots and scored a team-high 19 points,
including a 3-pointer with 48 left in overtime and the game-winner.
No doubt, the Selection committee will consider Rush's return when
determining UCLA's seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told the players that we can't use (Rush's suspension) as
a cop-out for not being successful,'' Lavin said. ``But this gives
you an idea of the impact he can make on a team.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rush isn't the only difference. Since the disastrous trip to
the desert, the Bruins have practiced and played with increased
resolve. It showed Thursday, when they rallied from a 19-point
deficit to thrash Cal, and it was apparent again Saturday, when
Stanford charged to a 19-4 lead behind senior Mark Madsen, who was
playing his final home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same as Cal,'' Watson said. ``Cal prepped us for
this situation. It wasn't new territory... Where ever we go, nothin
This team is so mentally tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It took eight minutes to erase the 15-point deficit, and from
there the Bruins matched Stanford basket for basket, rebound for
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   When they weren't on the bench with foul trouble, big men Dan
Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso did as they pleased against Madsen and
the Collins twins. Moiso scored eight of UCLA's last 15 points in
regulation, including the tying shot with one second left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moiso was huge for them today,'' Jarron Collins said, ``and
unfortunately, I wasn't able to limit his high-percentage shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush made the game-winner and Moiso sent the game into overtime,
but no one played better than Watson, who had 13 assists and four
turnovers. Crafty and composed, he was the primary reason UCLA shot
54.5 percent from the field and scored on 14 of its last 17
possessions against the nation's best defensive team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great,'' Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said. ``They
were great today, and we were good.''

GENERAL CHALLENGE WINS BIG 'CAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- Trainer Ted H. West had just finished second in
Saturday's $1 million Grade I Santa Anita Handicap with Budroyale
when he was asked about the winner, General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Wa he surprised how well the inconsistent 4-year-old colt ran?
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprises me when this horse (begin ital)doesn't(end ital)
run good,'' West said. ``I've seen him train in the mornings, and
he does some spectacular things.''
</P>
<P>
   What General Challenge did in the 63rd running of the Big 'Cap
was pretty spectacular, laying next to last in the eight-horse
field for much of the way before uncorking a powerful move on the
outside to outfinish Budroyale by 1 1/4 lengths as the 2-1
co-favorite in front of an on-track crowd of 30,122.
</P>
<P>
   The California-bred son of General Meeting covered the 1 1/4
miles on a main track labeled good in 2:01 2/5 to give his owners,
John and Betty Mabee, their second Big 'Cap victory. Best Pal won
the race for the Mabees in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero finished third, one length behind Budroyale and 1
1/2 lengths ahead of stablemate Malek. Cat Thief, the other
co-favorite, set the early pace and faded to finish a disappointing
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge's victory also gave jockey Corey Nakatani and
trainer Bob Baffert their first Big 'Cap wins. Nakatani is 2-0 with
General Challenge after replacing Chris McCarron before last
month's Strub Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an engine in him that just doesn't stop,'' Nakatani
said. ``He took dirt and handled it just fine. He's maturing,
getting a lot better. I think maybe the confidence I have in him
might be helping a little bit. I just help him relax, let him get
in his stride.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when General Challenge wouldn't let anybody
help him relax. The big strapping colt won last year's Santa Anita
Derby and the Pacific Classic at Del Mar, but he also ran
disappointing races in the Louisiana and Kentucky Derbies and the
Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani might have discovered the secret to success with
General Challenge -- let him fall back and make one big run. He did
it in the Strub, romping home by 9 1/2 lengths, and Saturday he
handily beat one of the strongest Big 'Cap fields in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey is going to have to ride this horse all the time now,''
Baffert joked. ``He relaxes unbelieveably for him.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was joy in the General Challenge camp, Budroyale's
connections suffered another heartbreaking loss in a Grade I race.
The 7-year-old gelding has been runner-up in the Breeders' Cup
Classic and Hollywood Gold Cup in the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fires his best shot every time,'' West said. ``Consistency
is his key. He ran super. I can't be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Richard Mandella comebackers, Puerto Madero and Malek,
acquitted themselves well with their third and fourth-place
finishes. For Puerto Madero, the race was a huge improvement over
his past four starts dating back to last year's Big 'Cap.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella brought Malek into the race on workouts alone after his
disappointing fifth-place finish as the favorite in last summer's
Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both ran well,'' Mandella said. ``Puerto Madero got
carried wide and I think that cost him a little bit. And Malek ran
fine too off a layoff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Laffit Pincay Jr. rode Puerto Madero, his first Big 'Cap mount
since 1996 when he finished 11th aboard Urgent Request. He said the
wide trip might have cost Puerto Madero a chance for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was nice to get to ride in a Big 'Cap again,''
Pincay said. ``I got very excited coming down the stretch. I
thought I had a chance. I really thought I had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be wishful thinking. General Challenge, now
9-for-14 lifetime with two seconds and 5-for-7 at Santa Anita,
inched to the lead at the head of the stretch and drew clear from
Budroyale and the fast-finishing Puerto Madero.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said it's uncertain where General Challenge will run
next, that the horse's camp will sit down and map out a strategy
that could lead to Horse-of-the-Year honors if he shows he can win
outside California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to enjoy this win, go back and give him a lot
of loving,'' Baffert said. ``It's a long year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert seems convinced that General Challenge is a
different horse, that he'll be a better shipper now that he's
matured and has a jockey who fits him like a glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we finally got him going the right way,'' he said.
``We're definitely going to go out of town again, to the Breeders'
Cup and some other races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   If General Challenge handles it like he did Saturday's Big 'Cap
field, Baffert can begin work on an acceptance speech for Horse of
the Year.

CANDIDATES FOCUS ON BOSTON, N.Y.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John McCain, facing an uphill battle in the Super
Tuesday primaries, stepped onto a dais in Copley Square Saturday
morning to the theme song from ``Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, coasting in most Democratic polls, ate blueberry
pancakes and bacon at Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe in the South End
with local officials, then said at a rally outside Faneuil Hall
that voters can ``close the book'' and assure his nomination
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the contrasting symbolism of their Boston appearances
reflected McCain's and Gore's campaigns before Tuesday's votes,
Governor George W. Bush of Texas and former senator Bill Bradley of
New Jersey campaigned through New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried for a second day to dodge questions about a sudden
flood of anti-McCain advertisements paid for by wealthy
contributors to the Bush campaign. He instead hammered away at his
chosen topic for the day: education.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a news conference about the $2 million ad campaign paid
for by two Texas brothers, Sam and Charles Wyly, Bush said he saw
nothing wrong with it, despite his denunciation of negative
campaign tactics by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, barnstorming through New York's boroughs, kept up his
effort despite a poll finding that he trailed Gore in that state by
34 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Harry Truman,'' Bradley told several hundred
supporters in Greenwich Village. ``They said he was finished in
1948, he didn't have a chance. And you know what happened there. He
came from behind to win.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Gore appealed to New Englanders and to undecided
independents before each headed to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Corkum, an Attleboro engineer who listened to Gore at
Faneuil Hall, said he is still torn between the vice president and
McCain, but appreciates a third candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually like Bradley,'' Corkum said. ``But I don't think
he's got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued his message of taking on the establishment.
Gore's simultaneous appearance here seemed more about having that
establishment, and the nomination, behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy fired up the sparse crowd by asking
why ``all the Republican candidates can talk about is religion,
when neither one of them has a prayer of beating Al Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   At Copley Square, McCain gave his 15-minute stump speech. While
his line about President Clinton renting out the ``Lincoln Bedroom
like it was Motel 6 and he was the bellhop'' got laughs in New
Hampshire, it did not go over as well here.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, plenty of hoots, hollers and cheers, and a
couple of interruptions by people shouting, ``Go John, Go!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good. It was short. Nothing new or revelatory, but I
guess at this point in the campaign they don't want anything new,''
said Jim Beninati, 31, an engineer from Somerville, who recently
switched from Democrat to Republican to vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the lawn was John Eade, former director of Boston's
Inspectional Services Department and a self-described ``yellow-dog
Democrat'' who has never voted for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He won't start now, he said, but he added: ``This is a
phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the stage was Audrey Pierce, a 42-year-old
South End ``liberal,'' she said, who ignored Gore's event because
it was too far to walk. ``If he were president, it wouldn't bother
me,'' Pierce said with a nod toward McCain.
</P>
<P>
   As the candidate made his way to his campaign bus, one man
shouted that McCain had committed war atrocities in Vietnam. An
elderly woman shooed him away by flapping a McCain sign in his
direction. She had help from another man, who repeatedly screamed
``shut up'' to the protester.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Gore for breakfast in the South End were daughter Sarah,
a junior at Harvard, Kennedy, and Mayor Thomas M. Menino.
</P>
<P>
   Gore leaned over plates of eggs and French toast to greet
customers. He spoke with one man about Alzheimer's disease and
another about last week's initial public offering by Palm Inc.,
maker of the Palm Pilot. ``A great product,'' Gore said. He also
asked of a pregnant woman: ``You had a craving for blueberry
pancakes, did you?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then plunged into an enthusiastic crowd that had formed
along the street.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Irwin, out walking his dog, noted that Menino had recently
escorted Clinton to another South End eatery, Mike's City Diner.
``It's the new `in' area, I guess,'' said Irwin, who is 34.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush, at a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Binghamton,
N.Y., appeared comfortable and relaxed, especially in light of new
polls showing him ahead in several states that vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who picked up the endorsement Saturday of New Jersey
Governor Christine Todd Whitman, said there was ``no coordination''
between his campaign and the group airing the enviromental ads
against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after launching a harsh radio ad denouncing McCain's
support of breast cancer research, Bush released a television
commercial criticizing McCain's proposals for education. ``If John
McCain has never made education a priority as a senator, why should
he be president?'' the ad concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush also canceled a commitment to appear on CBS's
``60 Minutes'' after learning that the show had agreed to give
McCain equal time.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, on his bus after the rally in Copley Square, said Bush's
allies were trying to ``hijack'' the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should two Texans be able to inject $2.5 million in attack
ads into a political campaign in the last two days? There's
something wrong with the system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his aides Saturday were clearly angry about the
advertising, and seemed worried about the candidate's prospects in
the upcoming primaries, which looked much stronger a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is out of money,'' said a McCain aide, Mark Salter. ``He
has no money to buy his own ads, so he had to get his rich Texan
friends to buy them. But it's not going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was not as forthcoming on the issue of breast cancer and
the disclosure by his key supporter in New York that the senator's
sister has had breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a family situation that I don't want to discuss,'' McCain
said. ``I can't discuss it without talking about my sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he still considered the Texas governor a friend,
McCain thought for a moment. ``Yes,'' he finally said, and went no
further.

ISLANDERS PLAY SPOILERS AGAINST SABRES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Facing the final games of the season with
nowhere to go (except maybe 13th place instead of 14th), the
Islanders had a choice: they could exit quietly, or they could make
everyone else's lives miserable.
</P>
<P>
   They picked the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest victims were the Buffalo Sabres as Olli Jokinen
scored on a penalty shot and got two assists in the Islanders' 4-2
victory Saturday afternoon at Nassau Coliseum. The loss further
scrambled the Sabres' playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (26-30-10), which reached the finals of the Stanley Cup
last season, is tied for ninth in the Eastern Conference, 2 points
behind Pittsburgh and 3 behind the Rangers. The top eight teams
make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way our season is going, this is what we are playing
for,'' said center Dave Scatchard, who had two goals for the
Islanders (18-39-8). ``We're relishing the role of spoilers. You
think to yourself, if we had played this way all year, maybe it
could have been us instead of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scatchard sacrificed part of a front tooth in the effort; he was
hit by a flying puck early in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Scatchard opened the scoring for the Islanders, beating Dominik
Hasek off a centering pass from Jokinen to tie the score at 1-1 at
13 minutes 40 seconds of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres got a penalty shot at 17:58 after Mathieu Biron
tripped Miroslav Satan on a breakaway. But with goaltender Kevin
Weekes coming out to challenge him, Satan's shot flew wide left,
missing the post by inches.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Haggerty, recalled from Kansas City last Tuesday, put the
Islanders up by 2-1 early in the second period on his first
National Hockey League goal. Mariusz Czerkawski and Zdeno Chara
assisted.
</P>
<P>
   The 13,149 fans were then treated to a rare spectacle, which
also happened to be a first in Islanders history: two penalty shots
in a single game.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen, coming in on Hasek, was taken down from behind by Keith
Primeau and was awarded the shot.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Jokinen, who had scored three goals in the
previous four games, calmly beat Hasek with a backhander to put the
Islanders up by 3-1 at 3:09 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only move I have,'' said Jokinen, who got his
second assist of the afternoon when he fed Scatchard at 14:24 of
the same period to put the Islanders up by 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a tulip in the spring come blooming out,'' Coach
Butch Goring said. ``The last five or six games he really has
emerged as the player we thought he could be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres made it 4-2 on Vladimir Tsyplakov's second goal of
the game just 19 seconds later, and had a chance to come within a
goal midway through the final period when Stu Barnes put one past
Weekes but Primeau was called for interfering with Ray Schultz and
the goal was nullified.
</P>
<P>
   With just over a minute left, Hasek was pulled for a sixth
skater, and Scatchard had a chance for the hat trick when he took
the ice with 28 seconds left, but was unable to find the empty net.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game tells me a lot of good things about our club,''
Goring said of the Islanders, who skated to a 5-5 tie with the
Ottawa Senators Thursday night. ``We got a little bit robbed the
other night, but we played a strong game and that continued
today.''

GUNG-HO GABE KAPLER GROWS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates got his
first real introduction to his new right fielder this off-season at
a YMCA in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a winter caravan stop and we were supposed to just
mingle with the kids and sign autographs,'' Oates said. ``There was
a 13-year-old kid out on the basketball court who was supposed to
be the best player in San Antonio, averaging 40 points a game. Next
thing I know, I've got my right fielder out there playing
two-on-two with 13- and 14-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting after it, too. He's wearing blue jeans and
sneakers and sweat is pouring off his face. This guy was gung-ho,
soaking wet, high-fiving the other players, saying, `Good offense,
good defense.' He was getting into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler, unfazed at the prospect of replacing Juan Gonzalez
as the Rangers' right fielder, is that way: intense, driven and
determined to succeed in everything he attempts. This is a guy who
includes Pete Rose and Charles Barkley among his on-field role
models.
</P>
<P>
   He refuses to hold back. Two innings into the Rangers' first
scrimmage of the season, Kapler was diving after a pop fly down the
right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's him,'' said pitcher Justin Thompson, who came with
Kapler from the Detroit Tigers in the Gonzalez trade. ``He'll run
through the outfield wall; it doesn't matter if it's spring
training or the World Series. He just plays all-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler considers that high praise. There's little doubt he wants
to put up big numbers, but that's not what he wants Rangers fans
talking about when they watch him play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to say, `I've never seen a guy pour his heart out
on the field,''' Kapler said. ``I want them to get chills like I
did when I saw Pete Rose play. I want them to go: I can't believe
how high he got when he dove into second base. I want them to see
how bad I want it. I want them to see how passionate I am about the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers' new right fielder is more than just intense and
passionate. Study where he came from and what he's all about, and a
complex, almost contradictory personality emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler is obsessed with winning a World Series, yet he was once
kicked off a major-college baseball team because he was totally
unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   He is a thoughtful, intelligent person who alternates reading
three books at one time _ ``Tough Jews'', ``Easy Ways to
Meditation'' and ``Science of Hitting'' _ but became adept at
forging his mother's signature so he could cut classes in junior
high school.
</P>
<P>
   He is a hard-nosed, fearless player, but he needed therapy when
he was 8 because he was hit by an automobile and developed a fear
of crossing the street.
</P>
<P>
   He has become a weightlifting and nutritional fanatic, but only
after getting over his beer-and-cigarette days of high school. He
also once considered acting as a career after finishing second in a
city-wide drama competition by playing three roles from ``Taming of
the Shrew.''
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together and you have a bold-talking,
straight-shooting mixture of Rusty Greer, Will Clark, and Socrates
_ a muscular philosopher who doesn't mind speaking his mind or
getting his uniform dirty. He seems as adept at discussing cures
for cancer with teammate Chad Curtis as he is breaking up double
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm out there, but I'm not uncomfortable with that,''
Kapler said.
</P>
<P>
   Nez Balelo, owner of the West Coast Baseball School and a mentor
who helped Kapler overcome his wayward teen-age years, said: ``He's
a great individual. People who see his size and commitment don't
see the whole picture. He's a very caring person with a heart of
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   His Tigers teammates, however, had trouble seeing that. When he
unexpectedly crashed their starting lineup last season, they saw a
brash rookie who was coming off an incredible minor-league season
and seemed to have everything going for him. Having his own Web
site didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't help that his well-sculpted body was on the cover
of several weightlifting and bodybuilding magazines. When he walked
into the clubhouse at spring training, he was greeted by a sign
that said ``Welcome Mr. America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some serious grief,'' Kapler said. ``But I was a rookie,
so I had to keep my mouth shut. I'd be in bed late at night, and
I'd just twist and turn. My wife, Lisa, would say to me, `I know
you want to explode, but you have to be smart.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His first season in Detroit was rough but it fulfilled a dream
Kapler said he had since he was 5. Growing up in Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley, he would get up at 7 a.m. and spend all day at the
park playing baseball. That apparently included school days, as
well as weekends and summers.
</P>
<P>
   He was gifted in mathematics and reading, but he also had
attention-deficit disorder, and that led to trouble in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sit there and watch the clock, break pencils in
frustration and look out the window,'' Kapler said. ``It would be
one of those beautiful California days, and I'd want to be playing
sports instead of being in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``School was miserable, so I didn't go. I'd take the bus, get
dropped off, and I wouldn't go. Any chance, I'd cut class. My mom
\RJudy\S bailed me out a billion times. One day, she went in to see
the counselor, and he had a stack of notes this big where I had
forged her signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are awesome. I owe everything to them. They really
helped me through some tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kapler said his son ``is a very intelligent person, he
just wasn't a student. He's an exceptional reader. He was
interested in learning; he just wasn't interested in the school
system. We all struggled with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball wasn't a struggle. Kapler was able to hold his own and
more among the highly competitive Southern California baseball
talent. But the guy who was taunted by his Tigers teammates as
``Mr. America'' was scrawny and didn't have much power, causing
coaches and others to doubt his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an intensity I saw in very few other people,'' his
father said.
</P>
<P>
   That intensity was transferred to weight training when Kapler
started seriously working out as a senior in high school. It was a
time when he was becoming precariously more interested in drinking
and smoking than hitting and fielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weight training was a way of getting my anger out,'' Kapler
said. ``I wasn't feeling too good about myself, and I got a lot of
compliments right away. I'd probably say that's what drove me to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler was a shortstop at Taft High School in Woodland Hills,
graduating in 1993. He wasn't the best player around, but, through
Balelo's help, he received a scholarship to Fullerton State,
coached by Augie Garrido and one of the premier programs in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't belong there,'' Kapler said. ``I was overmatched,
completely directionless and completely insecure. I was over my
head in every way, and I was trying to be something I wasn't. I was
partying a lot. All I know is when I was there, I didn't want to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I told the coach I had to miss practice because of a
family problem,'' Kapler said. ``Well, I didn't go home. I was in
the dorm watching a basketball game and drinking a beer when one of
the coaches brought in some recruits to look at the place. So I got
nabbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day, very politely, they said beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler said calling his father and telling him was one of the
hardest things he has ever done. But being kicked out of Fullerton
turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to him,
once he enrolled in Moorpark College, a community college in the
Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   He played for head coach Ken Wagner and assistant Mario Porto.
``Those coaches were awesome. I needed firm guidance and they gave
it to me,'' Kapler said. ``They didn't give me anything. Usually
when you come back from a major university and want to play at a
junior college, they're pretty excited to have you.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys said, Tuesday practice starts. The best guys are
going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler flourished under Wagner and Porto's guidance in 1995,
hitting .337 (56-for-166) with seven home runs and 52 runs batted
in. After the season, the Tigers drafted him in the 57th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moorpark was great for him,'' Balelo said. ``After Fullerton,
I think he really decided at that point, `I'm going to commit
myself to the game of baseball and be a major-league player.' Gabe
and I had a lot of long talks, and he just needed to understand he
had to work at it. When he got off the beaten path, I'd tell him,
you have what it takes, it's up to you to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did it quickly with the Tigers. He started out as a
57th-round pick, but three years later he was one of the Tigers'
top prospects. He hit .322 with 28 homers and 146 RBI at Double-A
Jacksonville in 1998 and was named minor-league player of the year
by several publications.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was great until he unexpectedly made the Tigers'
Opening Day roster last season then failed to live up to his
impressive minor-league credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he was the minor-league player of the year, everybody
wanted instant results,'' Justin Thompson said. ``That just didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He was optioned back to the minors after six games, then
promoted after Brian Hunter was traded to the Seattle Mariners on
April 28. Overall, Kapler hit .245 with 18 homers and 49 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looked upon as needing to not have a good year but a
gigantic year because we weren't any good,'' Kapler said. ``That's
why it's a breath of fresh air being here. The veteran players were
great guys, but they didn't go out of their way to make me feel
comfortable as the guys here do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have come to realize that Kapler might not be Juan
Gonzalez, but he is extraordinary in his own way.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Somebody wandering into the Dallas Stars' postgame locker room
in Detroit a couple of years ago had a better chance of hearing a
pin drop than a laugh. On June 5, two years will have passed since
Stars players trudged from Detroit's Joe Louis Arena with a dark
cloud of uncertainty hanging over them. Game 6, along with the
Western Conference Finals, had just been lost, and everybody seemed
to be wondering if Stars goalie Ed Belfour had what it took to
carry a team to a Stanley Cup. Wouldn't they be better building
with a young player like Red Wings goalie Chris Osgood, people
asked. Stars general manager Bob Gainey insisted ``no.'' Now,
almost two years later, you can't hear a marching band for all of
the laughing. Gainey and the Stars certainly have had the last
laugh on this one. Not only has Belfour helped them win one Cup, he
has them primed to win another. A month away from the playoffs, the
Stars have to be on the short list of Cup contenders in large part
because of the play of Belfour. He has to be considered one of the
three best goalies in the league right now, along with Toronto's
Curtis Joseph and New Jersey's Martin Brodeur. Without a doubt,
start to finish, he has been the Stars' best player this season.
When the Stars were good, he was good. When the Stars were bad, he
was better. Everybody knows good goaltending is the key to winning
in the playoffs. Not everybody has a good goaltender. We're not
talking also-rans like Pittsburgh or San Jose, either. There are
legitimate Cup candidates who have serious holes in goal. And,
maybe, the most ironic part is Detroit is one of them. Osgood, who
outdueled Belfour in 1998 on the way to the Cup, has become the
enigma that Belfour was supposed to be. The same people who
questioned Belfour have now turned their sights on Osgood. The
question isn't whether he's a good goalie. The question is whether
he's a goalie who can win a Cup for the Wings. There isn't an easy
answer. The shelf life on this team is short. Players like Brendan
Shanahan, Chris Chelios and Steve Yzerman have one, maybe two, more
Cup runs in them. This is not the same Red Wings team it was two
years ago either. They need their goalie to do more than just mind
the net. They need to have confidence that he'll be able to win
games for them. The Wings, of course, have said all season that
they have complete faith in Osgood. They did when he started the
season hot. They did when he went through a slump. They do now as
he has mirrored the team's inconsistency. He's their guy. But with
10 days remaining until the trading deadline, the brutal reality is
Osgood can't be if they want to win. Osgood was good enough to play
on a Cup winner. He hasn't proved himself to be capable of winning
a team a Cup. The irony is that Belfour has. The not-so-funny part
for Detroit is that he might just do so again this season.
Iginla carrying Flames into the playoff chase
</P>
<P>
   You hear the phrase ``win-win'' situation all the time. The
description has crept into the English language in politics and
finance and sports. But what does ``win-win'' really mean? Well, it
means that four years after the Stars traded a young, talented
Jarome Iginla to Calgary for a proven, talented Joe Nieuwendyk both
teams are saying they got exactly what they wanted. Nieuwendyk, of
course, was the playoff MVP as the Stars won the Stanley Cup last
season. Iginla, 22, has developed into the player capable of
leading the Flames to a Cup in the coming seasons. Don't think
Iginla didn't realize it would easily have been a win-lose
situation. ``I did feel pressure,'' Iginla said. ``I'm a big fan of
hockey, and I watched and I realized that Nieuwendyk was one of the
top scorers in the game, and so I did feel pressure. But the Flames
talked to me, and they took a lot of pressure off me. They just
told me to relax, and once the season started, after my first year,
I was just going out and playing, and I realized all I could do was
my best.'' Which has been pretty good lately. Iginla had 10 goals
and 11 assists in February, snagging him Player of the Month
recognition. (He's the first minority ever to win the award). In
February, he scored or assisted on half of the Flames' goals and
led the team with a plus-11 rating. His team followed, too. A
strong end to February not only snapped a 10-game winless streak
but has the Flames back in contention for a playoff spot. They're
three points out of the eighth and final spot. ``We haven't really
talked about a certain amount of points that we need,'' Iginla
said. ``But we play all the teams that, besides a few games,
directly affect us. We play Anaheim. We still have two against San
Jose. I think we still play LA again, and we have two against
Edmonton.'' Ah, a playoff race in Calgary. For a while, playoffs
and a small-market team like Calgary looked to be at odds,
especially as players such as Nieuwendyk and then Theo Fleury were
traded for younger, less expensive players such as Iginla. Not so,
says Iginla. ``This year we want to make the playoffs, but we think
there's bigger things,'' Iginla said. ``We look at the Ottawa
Senators, where they had to go through some tough times, and now
they are a legitimate contender, and that's what we feel we can do
here and what we have developing. I mean, people have written us
off. When we did lose Theo, people wrote us off, and people said we
were all a bunch of no-names and stuff.'' nn

U.S. MARATHONERS SLOW TO FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are a nation of joggers. And yet, in the ultimate 26-mile
jog, we are wheezing also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. On any given weekend, there is a marathon being
staged somewhere within a day's drive from practically anywhere in
America. There is a long-distance race, calling men's and women's
soles.
</P>
<P>
   But in the consummate run to glory, the Olympic marathon, United
States runners have been little more than roadkill since Joan
Benoit won the first women's marathon at the Los Angeles Games in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   The latest case came last weekend in Columbia, S.C., where 170
women ran for what were supposed to be three spots on the U.S.
Olympic marathon team.
</P>
<P>
   Why February, you ask? A fair question. U.S. Track and Field
organizers felt that the midwinter weather in South Carolina
approximated what the Olympic marathoners will experience when they
toe the line on Sept. 24 in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the men's Olympic Trials Marathon will take place in
Pittsburgh more than two months from now, which won't correspond to
any weather except, duh, Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the runners in Columbia last week saw temperatures
climb into the 80s as the marathon progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Libbie Hickman, who had the fastest time by a U.S. woman coming
into the trials (2 hourse, 28 minutes, 34 seconds), staggered home
eighth. Benoit, now Joan Samuelson and a married mother at age 42,
came in ninth. Anne Marie Lauck, a 1996 Olympian, carried the pace
for 20 miles and then faded desperately, collapsing as she crossed
the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of the 170 runners never made it to the finish line.
And of those who did, few ran personal bests in the muggy
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But one who did, Christine Clark, a 37-year-old pathologist,
came from the edge of nowhere _ Anchorage, Alaska, actually _ to
win the trials in 2:33:31. The time was more than seven minutes
faster than she had ever run a marathon before.
</P>
<P>
   She had trained for the race by running a relatively benign 70
miles per week, with most of it coming on a motorized treadmill
because of Alaska's acute winters.
</P>
<P>
   A great story, except ...
</P>
<P>
   Except seven months ago, to weed out the sundry roadkill, the
world governing body for track and field, the IAAF, lowered the
``A'' qualifying standard for the women's Olympic marathon from
2:35 to 2:33. The U.S. governing body, in turn, decided that all of
its Olympic entrants should have to make the A standard and thus
decreed that if the trials winner didn't run 2:33, only the winner
would run in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In most U.S. track and field events, the decision wouldn't have
raised a single eyebrow. We more than capably fill our three spots
in the sprints, hurdles and field events.
</P>
<P>
   But in South Carolina, the issue boiled over. The two other
Americans who had run under the A qualifying standard coming into
the race _ Hickman and Kristy Johnston _ can't compete in Australia
now because Clark's time was too slow on an 80-degree day in
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most fair system there is,'' Craig Masback, head of
USA Track and Field, told the Denver Post, ``because there's no
bureaucratic meddling. And it's the most unfair system there is,
because inevitably in every Olympics, there is some story of
someone not making the team who people thought should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Masback is correct. Track and field's system of trials is
supposed to stifle the tribulations by removing all subjectivity.
Finish 1-2-3 and you go to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But by deciding to honor only the IAAF's A qualifying standard,
USATF opened the door to a worst-case scenario as it experienced in
Columbia. Hickman and Johnston deserve to join Clark as Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   Masback is being urged to ask the IAAF for an exemption that
would take into account the humid conditions _ relax the A standard
to 2:34, perhaps, which Clark bettered.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy underscores, however, the ongoing problems with
the marathon in this country. Since 1984, no U.S. runner has
finished better than 10th in the Olympic marathon. Since 1985, no
U.S. runner, male or female, has won the Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The theories linger. Some think that our elite runners are
opting for their weekend 10-kilometer runs because they're easier
and sometimes offer prize money. Others contend that marathoning
has simply become more serious business in other countries _ Japan,
notably.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the race last weekend in South Carolina will
only aggravate the problem.
TANGLED BUREAUCRACY
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of marathon problems, the best marathon runner in the
world wants to run for the United States _ and red tape may not let
him.
</P>
<P>
   Khalid Khannouchi of Morocco broke the world record at the
Chicago Marathon last October, covering the 26 miles, 385 yards, in
2:05:42. He wants to run for Uncle Sam and has denounced his
Moroccan citizenship because of what he claims is lack of support.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi moved to the United States in 1993, married an
American girl and lives now in Ossining, N.Y. Under normal
processing, he would have been eligible for U.S. citizenship in
September, two weeks before the Sydney marathon.
</P>
<P>
   But an immigration official who was handling Khannouchi's
application failed to complete the paperwork, and the runner was
forced to start again from square one. Khannouchi reportedly is
seeking a special exemption based upon his wife's employment
overseas. Problem is, she doesn't work overseas _ yet. TV-FRIENDLY
TRACK
</P>
<P>
   Lamine Diack of Senegal, who took over as IAAF president upon
Primo Nebiolo's death in November, wants to make track and field
more appealing to the TV-stupefied masses.
</P>
<P>
   Diack said last week that he is in favor of doing away with
false starts altogether. One premature lurch and you're gone. In
time, Diack feels, sprinters would stop training to anticipate the
starting gun.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF head also likes the idea of limiting high jump and pole
vault attempts to six, which would eliminate the three-jump cattle
call at the lower heights. And he wants to lower the number of long
jump and triple jump attempts from six to four. AUSTRALIAN COLD
SHOULDER
</P>
<P>
   What, no ESPN?
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Morning Herald reported last week that Sydney Olympic
organizers plan to limit broadcast access to Olympic venues only to
local (Australian) television and to NBC, its affiliates and
non-U.S. rights holders.
</P>
<P>
   If enforced, it would mean that organizations such as ESPN, ABC
and FOX couldn't tape interviews from any Olympic sites. NBC paid
$3.5 billion to the International Olympic Committee for the TV
rights to every Olympics from now to 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by controversies that prompted a shake-up at the top in
recent months, SOCOG, the Sydney organizing committee, has turned a
conspicuous cold shoulder to the global media. Committee president
Michael Knight says it's time that the organizers ``get out of the
media and turn the focus elsewhere.'' EYEING 2008
</P>
<P>
   Ten cities officially remain in the running to host the 2008
Summer Games _ Bangkok, Thailand; Beijing; Cairo, Egypt; Havana;
Istanbul, Turkey; Kuala Lampur, Malaysia; Osaka, Japan; Paris;
Seville, Spain; and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is considered the favorite, with Paris a semi-distant
second. The IOC will name the 2008 Olympic host city in July 2001.
LEARNING FROM THE GUYS
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Dragila pocketed a $50,000 bonus Friday for breaking a
world record at the USA Indoor Track and Field Championships at the
Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila is the world's best woman in the pole vault, an endeavor
that not too long ago was considered a distinctly manly pursuit. As
queen of the new event, therefore, her sky is the limit.
</P>
<P>
   She jumped 15 feet, 1 3/4 inches Friday, bettering her previous
mark by a convenient one-quarter inch and thus earning the USATF's
$50,000 bonus check.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old Sergei Bubka trick. The great Ukrainian vaulter used
to travel the planet, breaking his world record in one-eighth inch
increments and, of course, pocketing bonus checks all the way up to
20-2. \Nsubheds:Forrest Gump would be proud Adrien Sawyer, who won
the USATF indoor long jump Friday with a leap of 21-5 1/2, is a
product of Texas A&AMP;M. She was born with a dislocated hip, and
doctors advised her parents to put her in leg braces. They didn't,
and she says she leaped off the table one day and hasn't stopped
running or jumping since.
DRUMMOND ENJOYS LIFE AS TRACK STAR, FATHER
</P>
<P>
   Long after he was supposed to have exhausted his shelf life, if
not his vocal cords, Jon Drummond is still a world-class sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   The former TCU All-American was among the favorites yesterday in
the 60-meter dash at the USA Indoor Track and Field Championships
in Atlanta. Drummond went into the race with a career indoor best
of 6.45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   He came to TCU from Odessa College in 1988 and led off the
Horned Frogs' NCAA champion 400-meter relay team in 1991. In that
same year, the Philadelphia native made the 100-meter top-10
rankings of Track and Field News for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond became a fixture on the lists. In 1997, he was ranked
No. 3 in the world over 100 meters and No. 1 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in Culver City, Calif., and works out under the
demanding eye of Olympian John Smith. Drummond and 100 world
record-holder Maurice Greene share the same coach and the same
practice track.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is like my father,'' Drummond said by telephone last
week. ``Before, he was just my coach and later he was my friend.
But now our relationship is more like father and son. He's cautious
about overworking me. He understands that sometimes Jon Drummond
just needs somebody to say, `Come on, man, let's do this together.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Notepads and microphones have never seemed to scare Drummond. He
has been called the ``Clown Prince of Track,'' a nickname he didn't
shy from.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond was born 31 years ago with spina bifida. Doctors told
his parents that he would likely be mentally retarded and unable to
walk. ``I'm a walking miracle,'' he tells interviewers.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond was married in 1997 and has a 19-month-old daughter,
Gabriella. He said she is much harder to catch than Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in good health,'' Drummond said. ``I just take my time now
and listen to my doctors and don't rush things. A lot of times we
get caught up, pushing that envelope. But married, with a child,
I'm learning how to manage my time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also more focused now on my technique. In the past, I was
focused on running fast, not running correct. If I can do that now,
I do believe that Jon Drummond can do some amazing things. I've
already proven that I'm a man full of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Drummond missed the Olympic teams in both 1988 and 1992,
reaching the semifinals of the 100 and 200, respectively. But he
came back to finish third in the 100 and make the U.S. team for the
1996 Games. He reached the semis, finishing sixth, in Atlanta, and
ran the lead-off leg on the U.S. silver medal-winning 400-meter
relay team. nn

RANGERS, DODGERS TEAM TO FIND SPRING HOME
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers and Dodgers have formed an
informal partnership to search for a new spring-training home
either in Las Vegas or Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But if that doesn't work out and only the Dodgers leave Florida,
the Rangers could move into historic Dodgertown at Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't go with them, Vero Beach would be an option,''
Rangers owner Tom Hicks said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' contract with Port Charlotte expires after the 2001
spring training. The Rangers, especially general manager Doug
Melvin, are happy with their current situation from a baseball
standpoint, but poor attendance remains a major concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sympathetic to what the baseball people want and intend to
listen to them,'' Hicks said. ``This place wouldn't really be all
that bad if we weren't last in attendance. I haven't figured out
why that is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are looking seriously at Las Vegas, but there are
concerns about the cool weather and the possible distractions of
the city famous for its night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vegas would be the perfect place,'' Hicks said. ``Texans love
to go there, and there are 10 flights a day \Rfrom DFW\S into the
place. There are great golf courses and attractions. You could
build a resort around the complex. But the baseball people have
some obvious concerns; they're worried about turning players loose
there. But that could be controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   A move to Las Vegas would require three to five other teams
coming with them. The Dodgers and their Fox ownership group are
eager to move to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had a rare sellout crowd yesterday against the
Cincinnati Reds, but that was from advanced sales from the
unfulfilled expectations that Ken Griffey Jr. would make the trip
from Sarasota, Fla. HICKS GOAL STILL HIGH
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks, addressing the Rangers as a team for the first time
this spring, said his goals remain high even with the off-season
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to continue to win the West, make it farther in the
playoffs and eventually win the World Series,'' Hicks said. ``This
is the best I've ever felt about the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have cut $9-10 million from the payroll, but the
players were happy to hear Hicks say there is flexibility to add
payroll during the season if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in here thinks we're going to win the World Series,
and it's good to know he's going to help any way he can,'' first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro said. ``If we're close, he's willing to put
us over the top. That's great to hear in spring training.''
THOMPSON THROWS
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Justin Thompson threw another 25 pitches off the
mound yesterday without any trouble with his left shoulder.
Thompson, who underwent shoulder surgery in August, said, ``It
feels good, I just don't know how much to put on it. I'm just
trying to feel good and mechanically do everything right.'' nn

FEELING THE HEAT, PITINO LETS OFF SOME STEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA would love for storied franchises like the Boston
Celtics to recapture their past glory.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't be happening anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to keep their slim playoff hopes alive, the Celtics
blew a home game on Monday when the Mavericks overcame a 20-point
deficit in the third quarter to win, 108-100.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wednesday, critical missed free throws, plus an amazing
3-point field goal at the buzzer by Toronto's Vince Carter, led to
a 96-94 home loss to the Raptors. That also was enough to nearly
send Celtics coach Rick Pitino over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the people being negative,'' Pitino told the media.
``And some of the fans. Larry Bird is not walking through that
door. Kevin McHale's not walking through that door. Robert Parish
is not walking through that door.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you expect them to walk through the door, they're going
to be gray and old. What we are is young, exciting, hard-working,
and we're going to improve. People don't realize that, and as soon
as they realize those three guys are not coming through that door,
the better this town will be for all of us because there are young
guys in that \Rlocker\S room playing their \Rbutts\S off.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some coaches, Pitino has a way of blaming his team's woes
on the media. It's never the fault of the coaching, or the
inability of players to execute plays or make key free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had $90 million under the salary cap,'' Pitino said.
``I wish we could buy the world. We can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we can do is work hard. And all this negativity
that's in this room \Rstinks\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino is feeling some heat because the Celtics are a
below-average NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone assumed when Pitino left Kentucky to take over the
Celtics in 1997, credibility and winning would be instantly
restored to this historic franchise. But the bluegrass has been
greener in Kentucky than in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Boos are a regular part of the backdrop in the Fleet Center.
Antonio Walker hears them, Vitaly Potapenko _ he missed two
freebies with 3.5 seconds left in the loss to Toronto _ hears them.
And Pitino hears them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around when Jim Rice was booed,'' Pitino said.
``I've been around when \RCarl\S Yastrzemski was booed, and it
stinks. It makes the greatest city in the world lousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that will turn this around is being upbeat and
positive like we are in that locker room. And if you think I'm
going to succumb to negativity, you're wrong. You've got the wrong
guy leading this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Celtics do have the wrong guy leading this team.
AROUND THE EAST
</P>
<P>
   -- Vince Carter is still represented by Tank Black, the agent
charged with fraud and money laundering and under investigation by
the Southeastern Conference, but Carter has begun to distance
himself from Black.
</P>
<P>
   After saying early last week that they were ``sticking by Tank
Black,'' Carter and his mother ``suspended'' their relationship
with Black on Thursday pending the outcome of the trial, scheduled
to begin May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Carter-Robinson manages her son's business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's mother described the decision to temporarily sever ties
with Black as ``very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   -- You have to wonder how Shawn Kemp feels when he hears
Cavaliers coach Randy Wittman lamenting the fact he doesn't have a
go-to guy on his team.
</P>
<P>
   Wittman didn't actually call out Kemp by name. But it doesn't
take a genius to figure out that if you're paying a guy $100
million _ as the Cavs are with Kemp _ then he's your go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a player here who's going to say, `Get on my
back, I'm going to carry you the rest of the way,' '' Wittman said.
``We're a blue-collar team that needs to bring our lunch pail every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets, selected by some to reach the NBA Finals, finished
0-6 against the Lakers, Trail Blazers and Spurs. AROUND THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   -- It's been another sorry season for the Warriors, but Donyell
Marshall has been on an amazing tear lately.
</P>
<P>
   In four games before Friday] his past fives games, Marshall
averaged 19.6 points and 17.4 rebounds. He had at least 20 rebounds
in three of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I've been \Rin the NBA\S six years,'' Marshall said after
his 23-point, 21-rebound performance led the Warriors to an 80-75
victory against the Hawks on Monday. ``It's time for me to turn
into something.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Jazz, once nearly invincible at home, is 8-5 at the Delta
Center since Jan. 19. And even when it has won, Utah hasn't looked
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz defeated the Spurs by three points in that homestretch,
and dethroned the Lakers in double overtime. However, it also eked
out victories against the Pistons (91-87), Hawks (96-94) and Nets
(106-101).
</P>
<P>
   Also during the homestretch, the Jazz lost to the Grizzlies and
Celtics, two teams that had never won at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   -- Memo to the Hack-a-Shaqers out there: The Lakers' Shaquille
O'Neal buried 9 of 13 free throws in Tuesday's showdown victory
against the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   PACERS MIGHT LOSE ROSE, JUST WHEN HE'S PICKING UP
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Larry Bird showcasing his talents, Pacers swingman
Jalen Rose is expected to be one of the league's top free agents
come July 1.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rose said not to look for him to try to return home and
play for the Detroit Pistons. He likes it in Indy just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't put one foot in front of the other when it comes to
that subject,'' Rose said. ``This is where I want to be, but we're
going to have a new coach \Rin Indy after this season\S and that
means more uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose struggled through an uncertainty-filled season under Larry
Brown, who coached the Pacers before Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Rose averaged 7.3 points per game in 1996-97, Brown's final
season coaching the Pacers. In Bird's first two seasons coaching
Indy, Rose averaged 9.4 and 11.1 points, and he is averaging 16.9
points this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 15 games, Rose averaged 22.0 points; he scored at
least 20 points in 12 of those games.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, who still leads the Pacers in scoring,
appreciates Rose's production. That is, as long as Miller is still
called upon to take the key shots during crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of pressure off of Rik \RSmits\S and myself,''
Miller said. ``We have three legitimate scorers out there now.
Teams are going to have to adjust to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to make us a much better ballclub come
April, May and hopefully June. This is a welcome addition. It's a
great tandem to play off of.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but this could be the last season Miller gets to ``play
off of'' Rose, who grew up in Detroit, where his mother and other
relatives still live.
</P>
<P>
   Rose played college basketball at the University of Michigan
because it was close to home, and he spends a lot of his off-season
in Detroit. But at this stage of his career, Rose says he prefers
Indianapolis to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play anywhere,'' he said. ``I'm not a person who needs
change. But being a professional, there's always two sides to the
coin.'' nn

STARS FINDING WAYS TO COME FROM BEHIND IN FINAL PERIOD
</HEADLINE>
 COMEBACKS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stars rarely seemed in need of comebacks last season as they
steamrolled to the Presidents' Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   This season, they could charge opponents for clinics on the art
of the third-period comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's 4-1 victory against Pacific Division rival Phoenix
provided the Stars an NHL-leading eighth comeback victory when
trailing after two periods. That's 16 points. Sixteen points that
could be the difference between winning a division title and
opening the playoffs as the second seed in the West, and falling
back in the pack as a fourth or fifth seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sign of a good hockey team,'' said winger Aaron
Gavey, who is providing substantial depth at forward. He scored his
fifth goal of the season Friday and third in the past five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars won only one of 17 games when trailing after the
second period last season. They are now 8-15-2 when faced with that
same predicament this season. They've done it twice in the past two
weeks in critical situations.
</P>
<P>
   Before beating the depleted Coyotes on Friday, two weeks ago the
Stars put a third-period spanking on a cranky group of Red Wings
who make their way to Reunion Arena tonight for a key Western
Conference showdown.
</P>
<P>
   With 17 games remaining, the Stars hold a seven-point division
lead. And now all of a sudden they find themselves trailing the Red
Wings by only three points.
</P>
<P>
   In both of those comebacks, the Stars, the team with the fewest
goals in the Western Conference, broke loose for four third-period
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pretty good coming into the third and realizing
whether we're up or we're down to really go after them,'' said
Grant Marshall, who notched his first goal of the season Friday to
tie the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The key has been goaltending team defense, which has enabled the
Stars to stay within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of games we've been down 1-0, 2-1, we've been right in
the games,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``It hasn't been like we've
gotten blown out, we've been competitive in the game, stayed with
it and scored some goals in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go into every game now, regardless of our lineup, expecting
to win. It doesn't matter who we're playing or who is in our
lineup. We have confidence _ it's not a cockiness _ in the way that
we push each other. It's just an expectation, we're expecting to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory tonight would give the Stars the season series, 3-1,
and the edge in a head-to-head tiebreaker. By catching Detroit, the
Stars would ensure home-ice advantage should they meet the Red
Wings in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe now that is another goal for us,'' defenseman Darryl
Sydor said. ``They are right there, so let's try to catch them. I
guess you always want to keep pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars kept pushing against Phoenix thanks in part to a line
change. Hitchcock moved Jamie Langenbrunner off the checking line
with Guy Carbonneau and Mike Keane and onto the No. 1 line with
Mike Modano and rookie Brenden Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner responded with an offensive blitz. He scored the
game-winner and added an assist in the third period. Hitchcock said
he is not certain if he will keep the Modano-Langenbrunner-Morrow
line intact for tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``One of the reasons we made the
change was we didn't really have a line specifically to check. We
weren't getting enough offense, and I felt we needed to change the
mind-set. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, everything seems to be working for Stars. nn

TARRED CAROLINA FEELING BLUE
</HEADLINE>
 BARNHOUSE COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ Good thing Bob Knight wasn't around. He might
have thrown a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Cameron Crazies broke out Rhythmic Cheer No. 33 _ ``Who's
Your Daddy'' _ to taunt visiting North Carolina yesterday. Knight
took offense when Northwestern's fans yelled that phrase last year,
but the Tar Heels took no umbrage. It would appear they understand
completely who their daddy is.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-ranked Blue Devils (24-4) are the Atlantic Coast
Conference's patriarch. Their 90-76 victory against North Carolina
gave them a 15-1 ACC record and a 58-6 league record the last four
years that translates into four consecutive ACC regular-season
titles. Duke is a Big Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Duke might even be in the process of ruining this rivalry, the
best in sports. It's not a rivalry when one team wins all the time.
What's most galling to the Tar Heels isn't that they're no longer
king of the hill, it's that the Dookies are.
</P>
<P>
   A telling moment. In the second half, as North Carolina tried to
shoot its way back in the game, Duke's Shane Battier (game-high 30
points) hit his second consecutive 3-pointer. Blue Devils coach
Mike Krzyzewski bounded from the bench, landing on his hands and
knees. He slapped the court, urging his team's defensive effort.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite sideline, North Carolina coach Bill Guthridge
observed the scene calmly, hands on both knees.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels (18-12, 9-7 ACC) lack passion. They have several
talented parts that don't fit together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, that's you guys saying they're struggling,'' Krzyzewski
said. ``They're a heck of a basketball team, well-coached. I don't
look at them struggling. They're good.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical Coach K class. But there's ``good'' and there's North
Carolina ``good''. These Tar Heels are generic ``good''
</P>
<P>
   A fan behind the North Carolina bench held up a chartreuse sign
with the words Guthridge's Pink Slip. Guthridge, in his third
season as Dean Smith's Successor, isn't likely to be fired. But he
knows that this season, with a senior point guard (Ed Cota), a
talented scorer (Joseph Forte) and a 7-foot center (Brendan
Haywood), has been substandard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously wanted to do better, but we've worked hard and
competed hard,'' Guthridge said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's excuse for this season is ``injuries''. Backup
point guard//defensive specialist Ronald Curry was lost for the
season. Brian Bersticker's broken foot cost the Tar Heels another
post player, and power forward Kris Lang has played despite
numerous aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   And yesterday, the Tar Heels lost Cota for a key stretch in the
first half when he needed five stitches to close a cut in his left
eyebrow. When he left the court with 10:57 remaining, Duke had a
15-10 lead. When he returned at 3:05, North Carolina trailed 36-18.
The Blue Devils' press had produced seven turnovers and a 21-8 run.
</P>
<P>
   (Never mind this counter point: Duke won yesterday even though
freshman Mike Dunleavy, the team's top reserve, missed his fourth
consecutive game recovering from mononucleosis.)
</P>
<P>
   Duke has won five consecutive games in this rivalry, its longest
streak over North Carolina since the early '60s. The Blue Devils
have averaged 89.2 points in those victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' said Cota, noting that the Tar Heels
shot 58.2 percent _ 69 percent in the second half _ to lose by
double digits. ``It would have been in there, it would have been a
different game. I'm not saying we would have won. ... Losing to any
teams five times is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   But you just know that for North Carolina, losing five in a row
to the Dookies is equal parts grating and galling.
</P>
<P>
   The Cameron Crazies' Cheer No. 1 in this series is ``Go to hell,
Carolina, go to hell.'' A sign in the stands put the cheer into
past tense: Gone to hell, Carolina, gone to hell. Five losses to
Duke by an average margin of 14.6 points. Carolina blue isn't just
a color, it's a mood description. nn

NAKATANI IS UP TO THE CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Bob Baffert, the trainer, once told Gary Stevens, the
Hall of Fame jockey, that he wished the process of giving
instructions to a rider didn't have to end in the saddling paddock.
Baffert wished they could keep barking orders as a race unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert evidently pictured himself scanning the entire field
through his binoculars from the box seats, reading the fractional
times off the tote board, and acting as kind of a mare-traffic
controller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I wish I had a (walkie-talkie) radio on you guys,' ''
Baffert recalled. ``Gary said, `If you've got to have a radio,
you're definitely using the wrong rider.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The point being that if a jockey doesn't know how to ride his
horse before the starting gate springs open, they're both sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap, run for the
63rd time under threatening skies, Corey Nakatani demonstrated the
difference the right jockey executing the right gameplan can make
to a horse. Santa Anita's leading rider showed newcomers in the
crowd of 30,122 what racetrack regulars mean by a ``good fit''
between a little man and a powerful beast.
</P>
<P>
   Succeeding again where three previous riders occasionally failed
-- including two Hall of Famers -- Nakatani got the best out of the
notoriously flighty 4-year-old General Challenge and won the most
history-rich thoroughbred race west of Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani and General Challenge won the Big 'Cap by 1 1/4 lengths
over Garrett Gomez and Budroyale after briefly being last in the
eight-horse race and trailing by 5 3/4 lengths on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey has found his number,'' said John Mabee, the San Diegan
who, with his wife Betty, owns General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He found it, ironically, by ignoring Baffert's instructions the
last time General Challenge raced, which was the first time
Nakatani rode him. It was the Strub Stakes, Santa Anita's classic
race for 4-year-olds, and Baffert wanted them to be hew close to
the early leader, the same plan he'd given to Stevens, Chris
McCarron and David Flores.
</P>
<P>
   When General Challenge quickly dropped back to last place, nine
lengths off the pace, Baffert thought, ``What's he doing back
there?''
</P>
<P>
   What he was doing was discovering a new dimension for the
gelding who'd already done some great things (victories in the 1999
Santa Anita Derby and Pacific Classic) but thrown in too many
clunkers (11th in the Kentucky Derby, 10th in the Breeders' Cup
Classic) to be considered a top-class racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   After General Challenge was slow out of the gate in the Strub,
Nakatani decided not to fight him, letting him set his own pace.
General Challenge would circle the tiring leaders on the turn and
win by 9 1/2 sensational lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the key,'' Nakatani proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Three other riders had fumbled through their pockets, hunting
for that key, before Baffert put the 29-year-old Nakatani on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dana Barnes (Baffert's exercise rider) could have won
more races on this horse last year than those jockeys did,'' Mabee
sniped.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were probably listening to me too much,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Again Saturday, Nakatani let General Challenge dictate his own
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually called an audible,'' Baffert said. ``This horse
relaxes unbelievable for him. For some reason, he feels comfortable
with Corey. Corey's going to have to ride him the rest of his life.
Corey's a big-race rider. He always shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani had finished second in the past three Big 'Caps before
winning the marquee race at a track with special significance for
his family. His Japanese-American father Roy lived on the
backstretch as a child during World War II, when Santa Anita was
used as a relocation camp.
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani was washing mud out of his eyes as he walked out of the
winner's circle. He'd gone through four pairs of goggles during the
race -- run on a track rated ``good'' after overnight rain -- but
some of the dirt spray got through. It bothered the jockey more
than the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tendency before was that when he got dirt in his face, he
threw his head around,'' Nakatani said. ``But he's taken the dirt
just fine the two times I've ridden him.
</P>
<P>
   A jockey must learn his horse's idiosyncrasies. Then he must be
an understanding partner, not try to change him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched a lot of tapes of Laffit (Pincay), McCarron,
(Bill) Shoemaker, and I've learned that they rode the horse the way
the horse wanted to be ridden,'' Nakatani said.
</P>
<P>
   It's called a good fit. That's a way of saying teamwork. Today
the rest of the circuit is saying break up General Challenge and
Corey Nakatani.

RUSH QUICKLY FINDS HIS TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD - Time and again, UCLA forward JaRon Rush imagined how
his first game in three months would unfurl. How much would he
play? Would he upset the team chemistry? Would he be nervous? What
about his defense and his rebounding?
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Rush didn't worry about was his shooting touch -
not after shooting 500 jumpers a day during his suspension. When he
wasn't going to class, testifying before a grand jury or meeting
with his attorney, Rush was shooting jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I worked on the most,'' he said. ``I wanted to get
a consistent jumper. I've been shooting before practice and after,
and I was pretty comfortable with my touch.''
</P>
<P>
   He proved that Saturday, hitting 7 of 10 shots from the field
and scoring a team-high 19 points - including the game-winner - in
UCLA's dramatic 94-93 overtime victory over Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might score a few points,'' Rush said. ``But I
never imagined this.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest baskets came when UCLA needed them most: trailing
93-89 with 48 seconds left in overtime and big men Jerome Moiso and
Dan Gadzuric on the bench with five fouls.
</P>
<P>
   First, Rush buried a 3-pointer from 23 feet to pull the Bruins
within 93-92.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rhythm shot,'' he explained. ``(Mark) Madsen backed
off me, and I'd been shooting well all day.''
</P>
<P>
   After a Stanford turnover and several UCLA timeouts, Ray Young
missed a difficult shot from 10 feet. A scramble for the rebound
ensued, and Stanford guard David Moseley tried to flip the ball to
teammate Casey Jacobsen.
</P>
<P>
   Rush intercepted and swished a 10-footer from the left baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fade-away jumper, a regular shot,'' he said. ``Nobody
was in my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate and longtime friend Earl Watson wasn't surprised by
Rush's last-minute heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been doing this stuff since we were 12 years old,''
Watson said. ``He's the biggest money player I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The Bruins improved to 12-1 in the last two years
when Sean Farnham starts.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was 10 of 15 from the foul line. Stanford was 29 of 42.
</P>
<P>
   This was UCLA's first win in Maples Pavilion since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when the Bruins last beat a No. 1 team, a UCLA official
mentioned 1980, when they upset No. 1 seed DePaul in the NCAA
Tournament.

EASY DOES IT FOR PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA - If Saturday was any indication of how easy it's
going to be for Pepperdine at the West Coast Conference basketball
tournament, then the Waves should immediately begin clearing their
schedule for March 16-19.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like they'll be dancing that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly it can't get (begin ital)any(end ital) easier for
Pepperdine, which crushed overmatched Loyola Marymount 83-49 in a
first-round victory at Santa Clara's Torso Pavilion. But if the
Waves (23-7) can play at the same level through Monday, it's hard
to imagine any other team in the conference wresting the title away
from the No. 1 seed.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament champion gets an automatic bid to the NCAA
Tournament. Pepperdine, the regular-season conference champion,
plays Santa Clara or San Francisco tonight in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves' next opponent better hope it's more effective than
LMU, which had nothing Saturday despite playing for lame-duck coach
Charles Bradley, who resigned two weeks ago but stuck around for
the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lions (2-26) were hoping to keep Bradley employed a
little while longer, they sure didn't play like it. In fact,
Bradley could have started his job search about five minutes into
the first half. That's when Pepperdine opened an 18-2 lead to get
the rout started.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Armstrong led the way with 17 points, including three
3-pointers on 3-of-4 shooting. Nick Sheppard and David Lalazarian
had 12 points apiece. Sheppard, playing one of his best games this
season, also had seven rebounds in only 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Loyola got 21 points from Pablo Machado and 10 each from Rupert
McClendon and Curtis Slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get to them early, be aggressive and just be on
top of our game,'' said Armstrong. ``And that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of their game? The Waves took it to new heights,
especially in a scintillating first half in which they shot 57.9
percent from the field (22 of 38), hit five 3-pointers,
outrebounded LMU 22-14, forced 10 turnovers and held the Lions to
28.6 percent shooting (8 of 28) to take a 53-24 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine, which struggled to a 77-65 victory over LMU the last
time the teams met, had no trouble this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played very unselfishly, we made the extra pass - there
were four different times in transition when someone had a layup,
but they passed it to someone else,'' Pepperdine coach Jan van
Breda Kolff said. ``When you do that, it's a team that's cohesive,
a team that knows what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The ease with which Pepperdine took care of LMU allowed van
Breda Kolff to substitute freely. The Waves need two more wins
today and Monday to win the tournament, so any chance to rest
players is welcomed. No Pepperdine starter played more then 18
minutes, and reserve Al Minihan (22 minutes) played the most of
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff didn't want anyone to play !ital!that!off! much,
but backup center Cedric Suitt went down in the second half with a
hyperextended knee, forcing van Breda Kolff to change his plan.
Suitt, who had seven points, said he should be fine by today.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-point margin of victory was the second biggest in
Pepperdine-LMU history. The Waves beat the Lions 92-57 in 1962-63.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, LMU brought this trouncing on itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're our crosstown rival, we have a history and they played
us tough in their place the last time we played,'' Tezale Archie
said. ``That was enough motivation right there. We had to come in
and keep our cool. We knew it would be a war.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, a very one-sided war.

   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ Throughout his career, Darren Kelly's shot has
been the subject of fairly animated conversation. Texas coach Rick
Barnes recalled that the first time he saw it, the result was three
air balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're guarding him, it looks like it's not going in, but
it does,'' said Texas teammate Gabe Muoneke, who has seen a lot of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Last night it went in almost continually, as Kelly popped in 33
points to lead the Longhorns (22-7, 13-3 Big 12) to a 99-70 victory
over Kansas State (9-18, 2-14) in the regular-season finale.
Coupled with Oklahoma's victory over Oklahoma State, the victory
gives Texas the second seed position for the conference tournament,
which opens Thursday in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ugly, but it drops,'' Kelly said. ``And when it does,
it's pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke, who added 27 points, said he wasn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Darren is, he started off the season pretty
slow,'' Muoneke said. ``But tonight he was making the same shots I
watched him make all summer ... a little fadeaway, and a floater. I
don't know how he does it, but when it starts, I just say, `OK,
Darren.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything _ except for a first-half air ball _ was OK
for Kelly, loudly supported by several old teammates from his days
at Brown Mackie (Junior) College in nearby Salina, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like I couldn't miss,'' said Kelly, who hit 13 of
17 shots from the field, including 6 of 8 3-point attempts. ``After
the air ball, coach left me in, and they left me open, so I figured
he wanted me to shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both teams had foul trouble in the first half, Barnes
said he was pleased with the tuneup for the tournament _ especially
since Chris Mihm spent much of his time on the bench with foul
trouble. He still managed 17 points and seven rebounds in 23
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked some of the things we did,'' Barnes said. ``We stayed
poised and calm even when they made a run. But the main thing was,
this is the first time we won by playing a big lineup without Chris
in there. Gabe and Chris Owens and William Wyatt really played
well, and I was impressed with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he also felt better about the shape of the team at
this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I think we were just happy to win the \RBig 12\S
title, and we were tired,'' he said. ``We're a much different team
physically this time around, and I think we're feeling good.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke agreed, saying, ``Last year at this point we were worn
out. This year, we have much greater depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting 58 percent, the Longhorns put up a season-high point
total, the most by a Texas team since UT scored 105 against
Nebraska in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an idea people have, that we can't win without a big
game from Mihm,'' Kelly said. ``But we have a lot of offensive
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kelly's shot, Barnes said, ``No, I never tried to change
it. You can't change that thing.''  &LR; tagtop:Whit Canning, (817)

<P>
   By early afternoon, when the high school basketball players from
Cambridge Rindge and Latin School came over to practice at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology gym back in the late 1970s,
the noontime pickup games of MIT grad students, research
assistants, faculty members and employees would be winding down.
</P>
<P>
   The egghead reputation of the place notwithstanding, those were
surprisingly competitive contests, with some pretty talented and
driven players spurred by the nature of the games: First to six
baskets played on, while the losers sat until their next turn.
Sometimes you wouldn't get another shot before you had to head back
to class or desk.
</P>
<P>
   But for me, win or lose, the real lure was the chance to walk
over to the court next to the one we played on, where the high
school kids were taking warm-up shots before their practice began
in earnest. Inevitably, I'd approach the tallest player, the one I
was sure was destined for eventual stardom, and ask to go
one-on-one for a minute or two.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have been terribly exciting for him, to guard this
guy a dozen years older and 14 inches shorter, and so I was upfront
about my reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick,'' I told him the first time, ``you're going to be a
great player someday, and I'd love to tell my children I scored on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, I never did. Day after day, he'd block my best
shot, no matter now many fakes I gave him; slap the ball off my leg
out of bounds, or simply force me into an awkward attempt that had
no chance. When he felt so inclined, he'd just catch my jump shot
and look at me.
</P>
<P>
   Still, good-naturedly, Patrick Ewing, all of 15 or 16, day after
day accepted my polite challenge.
</P>
<P>
   So I watched with some pride in subsequent years as he led
Georgetown University to the national championship. I also cringed
at times, as he was subjected to racist haranguing in Boston
arenas, the soft-spoken son of immigrants called all kinds of names
because of his supposedly suspect language skills. Actually quite
bright, he was too dignified to respond in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as a native New Yorker, I was beyond thrilled when he
became a Knick. And I felt pride as he soon joined that tier of
great centers, just below Russell and Chamberlain and Jabbar, that
includes players the caliber of Reed and Cowens, Unseld and
Thurmond, Olajuwon and Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, on a trip back to New York, I secured a game
pass from Knick management that admitted me to the locker room.
With some trepidation, I approached Ewing, by then a worldwide
basketball figure, and inquired whether he remembered the days on
the MIT court and my futile efforts to score a basket on him. After
a moment's reflection, he softly said, ``I think I do,'' and smiled
broadly, though I'm sure he was just being polite.
</P>
<P>
   So I was dismayed that after years and years as the bulwark of
the Knicks, Ewing was feeling unappreciated recently. Indeed, he
may well have been _ by his teammates, by the media and even by
many fans. As a result, he seemingly wanted out.
</P>
<P>
   This was unfortunate and unfair, and not just because Patrick
Ewing probably has more class and more accomplishments than any
dozen of his critics. As he is once again demonstrating, he remains
a vital part of the team; observers who say the Knicks are better
off as a fast-break team ignore that running requires a man in the
middle who can secure the rebound or, better yet, ignite a break
with a blocked shot. They also forget that playoff basketball is
often half-court basketball.
</P>
<P>
   As a suffering Knick fan from the early 1960s on, I would assert
that Patrick Ewing is the most important player in franchise
history. Almost single-handedly, he has kept the team competitive
from one year to the next, as the players _ and coaches _ around
him changed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Knick history is defined by ineptness and no-name
players, with even the team's announcers of the mid-1960s, for
instance, having trouble articulating the movement of the ball from
Butler to Butcher to Buckner to Budd. The brief shining moment of
the late '60s and early '70s was stitched together by a coterie of
players _ the Fraziers and Reeds and DeBusscheres, the Monroes and
Barnetts and Bradleys and, of course, Holzmans. Ewing has had to
give this franchise meaning _ through management shifts and lineup
experiments and talent deficits _ for much of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with some speed and versatility around him, he should be
allowed to ride the twilight of his career as far as it takes him _
and the team.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans ought to see Ewing end his career in Madison Square
Garden. I have three little girls who all play basketball.
Actually, the 7-year-old and the 3-year-old do; the 1-year-old only
cradles a little rubber ball, but she's just a year or two away
from trying to get a shot by her father.
</P>
<P>
   I'd love to take them some day soon to the mecca of basketball
and point out the man who never let their daddy score a point, but
who graciously let him try. In the best of worlds, it will be when
Ewing is yelling and driving and scowling in the middle of it all
as the Knicks contend for a championship. They deserve that thrill.
More important, so does he.
</P>
