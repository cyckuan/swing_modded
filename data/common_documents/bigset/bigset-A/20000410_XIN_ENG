<HEADLINE> Defending Champions Shandong Goes Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Shandong
Luneng went to top on the Chinese first division soccer league
standings table as they scored an emphatic 3-0 home victory over
Shengyang Haishi under torrential rain on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese international marksman Su Maozhen struck twice on a
soggy home ground to bring the visiting Haishi to their first
defeat this season. Shangdong, on the back of a hat-trick wins
under the guidance of former Yugoslavian national coach Slobodan
Santrac, tallied nine points from four games to occupy the top
position.
</P>
<P>
Following behind only by goal difference were the newly-
promoted Yunnan Hongta, who saw off Jilin Aodong 2-0 for their
third win out of four games. Tianjin Taida, starting this round of
action as league leaders, went down to the third after playing a 1-
1 tie with last season's runners-up Liaoning Fushun.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Guo'an, suspended their Yugoslavian manager Milovan
Djoric this week following a three-game losing streak and
consequential bottom position, finally managed one point by
forcing out a goalless draw with Sichuan Quanxing.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Ping'an, still recovering from a prostitute scandal
which involved six of their players partying with call girls all
night after a league defeat, posted a morale-boosting 2-0 win over
Qingdao Hainiu.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Presence Threatens Security in Gulf: Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The military presence of the United
States is the real threat to the security in the Persian Gulf, said
Acting Commander-in-Chief Gholamali Rashid of Iran's armed forces
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the physical and military presence of the U.S.,
especially their battleships armed with weapons of mass destruction
and nuclear weapons, that threatens the security of the region,"
the major general said, quoted by the official IRNA News Agency.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Omani Air Force Commander Muhammed Bin
Mahfooz Al-Arezi, the military leader said the U.S. is trying to
rule over the energy sources of the region perpetually.
</P>
<P>
Refuting Washington accusations that Iran threatens the Gulf
security, he said that on the contrary Iran is seeking to
strengthen its ties with its southern Gulf neighbors, Oman in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Iran's policy of detente is not merely a tactical one but a
strategic decision, he added, noting that Iran makes no distinction
between its own security and that of the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted the visiting Omani air force commander as describing
his visit to Iran useful. Al-Arezi said Iran has high military
capabilities, and invited Iran to share its defense experiences
with Oman.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Rashid and Al-Azeri also signed a
bilateral defense agreement on Monday whose contents were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The high-level Omani delegation ended a four-day visit on
Monday. Iran and Oman face each other across the strategic Strait
of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
They signed an agreement in November 1998 allowing their
military experts to be present at each other's annual military
exercises as observers.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Speaks Highly of China's Support to G-77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuba Monday spoke highly of China'
s support to the Group of 77 and contribution to the convocation
of the South Summit, the largest gathering of heads of state and
government since the founding of the body in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told a press
conference here that the presence of the Chinese delegation means
a strong support of China to G-77.
</P>
<P>
"China can play a very important role for the Group of 77," he
said. "Given its high degree of economic and social development in
a socialist system, which is also a great encouragement for our
effort as a group of Third World countries."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, headed by Vice Premier Li Lanqing, is
expected to arrive in Havana, the Cuban capital, Tuesday afternoon.
China, which is not a member of the body, has always supported the
just stance and reasonable demand of G-77 and it has been long in
close and friendly ties with the organization.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban foreign minister made the remarks as world leaders
are arriving in the Caribbean island country for the South Summit,
which ends on April 14.
</P>
<P>
A total of 122 delegations are attending the South Summit, and
60 countries will be represented by heads of state or government,
the foreign minister said, adding that also present at the first
summit of G-77 are 34 delegations of non-member countries and
representatives of 35 international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Covering the historic event are 500 correspondents from 80
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The organization was founded by 77 developing countries in
Geneva on June 15, 1964. Although the membership of G-77 has
increased to 133 countries, the original name was retained because
of its historic significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and
the largest grouping in the South, G-77 provides the means for the
developing world to articulate and promote its collective economic
interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on all major
international economic issues in the United Nations system, and
promote economic and technical cooperation among developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Annan Flies to Cuba for South Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking to the press at Madrid Airport en route to Havana
earlier Monday, Annan said there were some positive lessons that
developing countries could share with each other, including in
information technologies.
</P>
<P>
"We need to use information technology and computers to be able
to leapfrog all the difficult developmental stages that other
countries went through," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides addressing the summit Wednesday, the U.N. chief is
expected to conduct bilateral meetings withe several of the heads
of state and government in attendance of the gathering of the
Group of 77, a U.N. spokesman told reporters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The meeting scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday will focus on
globalization, knowledge and technology, South-South cooperation
and North-South relations.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 was created on 15 June 1964 when developing
countries adopted a joint declaration at the conclusion of the
first session of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it consists of 133 developing countries from Africa,
Asia and Latin America, with Nigeria as chairman for the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Foreign Minister Calls for Globalization of Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The foreign minister told a press conference here that the
economy imposed by the developed world today is excluding the poor,
which make for the vast majority of the planet, while denying
their access to development.
</P>
<P>
"It is to solve this situation that we stand for dialogue"
between the North and the South, he said. "We need a North-South
dialogue in which the North listens to our opinions."
</P>
<P>
However, such a dialogue, he said, "must be conducted on an
equal footing for both North and South, bearing in mind all of our
interests, especially our fundamental right to development."
</P>
<P>
In that regard, he said he is highly optimistic about the South
Summit, in progress here through April 14, for this meeting is
taking place on very appropriate timing, in the year when the
United Nations is summoning the so called "the Millennium Assembly,
" where the international policies of the next century will be
devised.
</P>
<P>
But he said "because the South cannot wait for ever, as it
needs an urgent solution to its problems, and the North cannot
expect the South to tackle all problems on its own. They must be
worked out in a joint manner."
</P>
<P>
Currently, the inhabitants of the rich countries, which account
for some 20 percent of the world's total population, enjoy 80
percent of the wealth available to the world, he said, adding that
this is "unbearable" in the current international financial
situation.
</P>
<P>
He charged "a few countries" with an attempt to impose their
political views, which usually respond to their economic polices
as well, on the rest of the world at the U.N., invoking the so-
called "right to humanitarian intervention," in violation of the
principle of non-interference in another country's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
What would happened, he asked, if countries of the South would
form an alliance to bomb the North just because countries there
are practicing xenophobia or abusing the rights of minorities?
</P>
<P>
"The only acceptable invasion for us," he added half-jokingly,
would be one that brings lower interests for long-term financing.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remarks as the Group of 77 is
convening the South Summit, the largest gathering of heads of
state and government since the founding of the body in June 1964.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Heated Debate Expected on Trade in Endangered Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Li Jinqi
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Heated and even emotional debates
are expected on international trade in endangered species as some
2,000 delegates across the world converged in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi to begin an international meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the 11th Meeting of the Conference of Parties of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES),
which was opened on Sunday and hosted by the United Nations
Environmental Program (UNEP) at its headquarters, 62 proposals
mainly focused on trade in endangered species will be discussed
among the delegates from more than 100 nations.
</P>
<P>
"Our discussions on elephants, whales, sharks and sea turtles
are, I am sure, going to be difficult and heated, sometimes even
emotional," said CITES Secretary-General Willem Wijinstekers in
his opening statement for the 11-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that one of the most high-profile issues on
the CITES agenda for the current meeting is the possible
introduction of another sale of ivory from southern African
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the previous CITES meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1997, it
was agreed that Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe could make a
one-time and highly- controlled experimental sale of their
existing ivory stock to Japan. These countries sold a total of 49
tons of tusks to Japan last year.
</P>
<P>
At the present meeting, the three countries, together with
South Africa, proposed a further authorization for trading
elephant products under strictly controlled conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya and India posed a tit-for-tat to their proposal
and advocated a complete ban on ivory trade, fearing that the
experimental sale would result in further ruthless elephant
poaching that has been alarming in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Both Kenya and India are expected to rally delegates to vote
for the reinstating of the elephant species to the CITES Appendix
I which bans all trade, while several southern African countries
will surely seek to push the case to Appendix II that regulates
trade under a strict monitoring system, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 Kenyan youths Sunday afternoon gathered at the UNEP
gate, holding placards or slogans against the lifting of the ban
on ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
Another highly charged issue at the CITES meeting, which will
inevitably arouse fervent debate, is the trade in whale products
as Japan and Norway proposed a restart of limited hunting of gray
and minke whales.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Norway believe that certain stock of gray and minke
whales are healthy enough to be transferred from CITES Appendix I
to Appendix II that regulates trade through the issue of hunting
permits.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Wildlife Foundation recommended that the
proposal by Japan and Norway be rejected as it was at the 1997
CITES meeting, arguing that any discussion about rules for
controlling whaling must take place in the International Whaling
Commission.
</P>
<P>
All commercial whaling has been banned by the International
Whaling Commission since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Also among the 62 proposals is that on the resumption of a
limited trade in hawksbill turtle shells as Cuba wants to make a
single, internationally supervised sale to Japan of up to 6,900
kilograms of shells from its existing stock, followed by an annual
trade quota.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that some nations, in proposing the relaxation
of the current trade bans, insist that the move would not harm the
overall populations of the endangered species and should even help
them in the long term if quotas are applied and the sales closely
monitored.
</P>
<P>
But conservationists and some governments said that these
proposals would either bring massive violation of quota
arrangement or stimulate an illegal trade, leading to the species
decimation or outright disappearance.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Fund for Animal Welfare,
thousands of species in the world are endangered as a result of
human activities such as hunting, habitat destruction and
pollution.
</P>
<P>
CITES was established in 1975 in order to address the threat
posed by international trade in endangered species. To date, 151
countries and regions have become parties to the treaty, making it
one of the world's most important agreements on wildlife
protection.
</P>
<P>
So far, the CITES agreement offers varying degrees of
protection to more than 30,000 species of plants and animals,
depending on their conditions in the wild and the effect that
international trade may have on their survival.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Economy Grows by 2.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's gross national product (GNP)
grew by 2.4 percent in the last Iranian calendar year that ended on
March 19, said Governor of the Central Bank Mohsen Nourbakhsh on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not specify the real value of GNP. Commerce
Minister Mohammad Shariatmadari said last month that Iran's annual
gross domestic product (GDP) is around 120 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran's foreign trade balance was positive last year, with
exports and imports increasing 9 percent and 14 percent
respectively, Nourbakhsh was quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the total oil revenues topped 16 billion U.S. dollars
last year due to the rising of oil prices, which was the major push
for the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil exports (including engineering services) stood at 3.5
billion dollars last year, registering a 8.5 percent rise compared
to the year before. The value of imports stood at 12.3 billion
dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
Iran's total foreign debts last year declined by 25 percent to
stand at 10.5 billion dollars as a result of the positive trade
balance, Nourbakhsh said.
</P>
<P>
The budget showed no deficit last year, with the total hard
currency sources equaling the consumption of 19.77 billion dollars.
Inflation rate was 20.1 percent last year, almost the same level as
the year before, the official added.

<HEADLINE> UAE Committed to Regional Peace and Stability: Cohen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
is committed to regional and international peace and security,
said visiting U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived here Monday morning from Saudi Arabia, told a
press conference that his talks with UAE President Sheikh Zayed Al-
Nahyan and other senior UAE officials had covered bilateral
relations and a wide range of regional and global issues.
</P>
<P>
"The security relationship between the U.S. and the UAE is very
good and getting better," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his pleasure with UAE's decision to purchase the U.
S. F-16 fighters, saying the decision would further strengthen
security cooperation between the two countries and enhance security
and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
While addressing concerns that the deal may encourage arms race
in the region, Cohen said "We think every nation is entitled to
provide for its security needs and the UAE has considered several
options before deciding the F-16 was the best aircraft."
</P>
<P>
On Iran, Cohen said the U.S. was encouraged by the recent
political developments in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"But, the U.S. is yet to see changes in the unacceptable Iranian
policy in their support for terrorism, their attempts to undermine
the Middle East peace and the development of weapons of mass
destruction,"said Cohen, affirming that such changes would benefit
all countries in the region by creating a great sense of security.
</P>
<P>
As for Iraq, Cohen said "We agreed that (Iraqi President) Saddam
Hussein can end the suffering of Iraqi people by complying with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions and until he complies, sanctions
must continue."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. sanctions since 1990 when its
troops invaded Kuwait which triggered the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"Now, Iraq is trying to ease the impact of the sanctions by
smuggling more oil,"said the U.S. defense chief. Iraq has been
banned from selling oil on world market under the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Cohen charged that Saddam has been using revenues of smuggled
oil to build palaces and military projects. "He may be accumulating
as much as a billion dollars annually through this illegal
smuggling."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Iran announced Sunday that Iranian Revolutionary
Guards seized a tanker suspected of carrying smuggled oil from Iraq
in defiance of U.N. sanctions and this may signal a crackdown by
Iran on these illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, he said, supports the U.N. operations to halt smuggling
of Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question whether the U.S. demand for lower oil
prices can affect U.S. arms sales to oil producers in the region,
Cohen said "I don't believe their will be any major impact on the
needs of the countries to modernize their armed forces," adding
that higher oil prices could affect global economy.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is currently on a tour of the Middle East countries. The
trip has taken him to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will leave here for Oman later on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for Efforts to Activate Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat urged the international community to
exert more effective efforts to push forward the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the appeal during a joint press conference with
visiting Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien after their talks at
the Palestinian presidential office here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The second round of Palestinian-Israeli peace talks going on in
Washington failed to yield any positive result so far, Arafat said,
adding "we insist on the demand for an effective U.S., European and
Arab roles in the talks."
</P>
<P>
On Jewish settlement expansion, Arafat said it was illegal and
went against the U.N. Security Council resolutions as well as
against the clear-cut international positions and Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
The settlements and Jerusalem are among the key thorny issues in
the final-status talks, he added, noting that the U.S.
administration believed settlement activities would sabotage the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said his talks with Chretien "were positive, important
and constructive." He added that the talks covered a wide range of
issues on top of which were the bilateral ties, especially in the
areas of education and technology.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side, according to Arafat, suggested the
formation of a joint Canadian-Palestinian permanent committee.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chretien reaffirmed his country's support for the
Palestinian people and the PNA, especially in the economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Chretien, the highest level Canadian leader ever to visit
Palestine, said his minister of international trade would come here
on top of a senior economic delegation soon to coordinate Canadian
assistance to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He added that he discussed with Arafat the importance of
economic development for the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, Chretien underscored the
importance of unremitting international efforts to establish peace
in the region. "I felt a common Palestinian-Israeli desire to
activate the peace talks and serve the interests of the Palestinian
and Israeli peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the issues of Jerusalem and refugees, the Canadian leader
said they should be solved through all-round talks.
</P>
<P>
Chretien arrived at Gaza Strip Monday morning from Israel for a
short visit. He has flown back to Israel to continue official visit
there.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Arrest 17 Jihad Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces have
arrested 17 members of the outlawed fundamentalist terrorism
organization Jihad, including a leading member of Syrian origin,
said Ankara Police Bureau Chief Kemal Iskender on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iskender told reporters that the security forces also seized two
rifles, four guns, bomb-making equipment, false identity cards, and
many documents and statements.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, police working in the Diskapi Hospital, affiliated
to the Social Security Agency (SSK), informed the Ankara Police
Bureau that two people who claimed to have been injured in a
traffic accident, applied to the hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The two confessed during interrogation that they had planted 10
pipe bombs at various locations in Ankara. And they were injured
when one of the bombs exploded.
</P>
<P>
They said that their Jihad organization was influenced by the
ideas and principles of the Al-Jihad Organization in Egypt, which
was blamed for the assassination of former Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the fundamentalist group seeks to establish
an Islamic-ruled state in Turkey by Jihad, giving priority to "
Jihad and politics."
</P>
<P>
The Ankara police chief said that they were recruiting
supporters, providing false identity cards and passports to their
militants to send them to foreign countries to receive military and
political trainings.
</P>
<P>
The organization was mainly centered in Ankara, but it also had
some supporters in southeastern Sanliurfa province.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made as part of efforts by the Turkish
government to rein in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of last year, Turkey has launched massive
crackdown on the radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah, which
seeks to turn secular but overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey into a
strict Islamic-ruled regime by resorting to violent means.
</P>
<P>
The group was found to have committed kidnappings, blackmail and
murders across the country.

<HEADLINE> Door Still Open for Talks: Hoss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
said Monday that the door is not closed for the resumption of the
peace talks with Israel, An Nahar newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Hoss made the remarks following a telephone discussion with
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, in which they discussed the
border flare-up and the upcoming summit between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said that Lebanon prefers Israel's withdrawal from south
Lebanon with an agreement with Lebanon and its powerbroker Syria.
Lebanon, he reiterated, will not give a security guarantee to
Israel in the event of a unilateral withdrawal, because Israel
leaves unsolved a lot of thorny problems, such as Palestinian
refugees and the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. last week, President Emile Lahoud called on
the U.N. peacekeeping troops to disarm Palestinian force in refugee
camps who might try to launch attacks on Israel from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied a border enclave of 850 square kilometers in
south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer zone against cross-border attacks
to its north.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state has decided to pull out its troops from south
Lebanon by July whatever an agreement with Syria and Lebanon is
reached or not.
</P>
<P>
The two Arab countries have stressed the simultaneity of two
tracks in peace negotiations with Israel.

<HEADLINE> EU to Speed Up Food Aid to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union decided
Monday to speed up its food assistance toward Ethiopia as a follow-
up of its decision made at the Lisbon summit of EU heads of state
and government.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Patten, EU commissioner for external relations,
told the press that Monday's meeting of the general affairs
council of EU foreign ministers urged a speeding-up of EU
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc has pledged 50,000 tons of food aid to the
African country. So far 30,000 tons have been transported to their
destination.
</P>
<P>
The transport of another 16,000 tons of food will have to be
quickened to reach Ethiopia that has been baffled by famine.
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, high representative of the EU common foreign and
defense policy, said that during the EU-Africa summit held last
week in Cairo of Egypt, the EU had talked with the leaders of both
Eritrea and Ethiopia about their border conflict.
</P>
<P>
The EU trio, that consisted of Patten, Solana and Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, briefed the general affairs council
of EU foreign ministers about their talks with the African leaders
on the regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, the EU foreign ministers are expected to meet
their Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov, during the third EU-Russia
cooperation council.
</P>
<P>
Gama, whose country is holding the six-month rotating
presidency of the EU, said that Russia would talk with the
European Union about both issues of Chechnya and trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
The European Union would demand for free access to Chechnya for
international and humanitarian organizations to inspect the
violation of human rights in the region.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Russia are to discuss such trade disputes as the
Russian levy on scrap metal exports, regulation of the Russian
market for eggs, alcohol beverages and wine, intellectual rights
protection, financial services and overflight rights over Siberia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also review the progress made in the
implementation of the EU-Russia joint partnership and cooperation
agreement.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned About Situation in Congo, Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Monday
expressed its concern about the situation in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc, at a monthly general affairs council of its
foreign ministers, urged all parties to the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo to halt immediately all military
activities and respect in full their commitments made under the
Lusaka Agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued after the first day of the two-
day council meeting, the EU foreign ministers said that the union
strongly supports the Lusaka Agreement and "stands ready to
continue to assist African efforts and to back the United Nations
in managing the crisis and in restoring peace and stability to the
Democratic Republic of Congo through political, diplomatic and
financial means."
</P>
<P>
The EU stressed that the ultimate responsibility for the
implementation of the Lusaka Agreement continues to rest with the
parties in the country, including assuring that conditions are in
place to enable the early deployment of the U.N. observer mission.
</P>
<P>
As for Zimbabwe, the European Union expressed readiness to send
observers for the planned elections which, one spokesman of the
two-day foreign ministers council meeting said, may help establish
democracy in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"If the elections are free and fair, they can be an opportunity
for the establishment of democracy," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the African country is willing to accept EU
observers for the elections, the spokesman said that there is
reason to believe that Zimbabwe is ready to accept.

<HEADLINE> ILO Holds Meeting on Educational Trends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) began a five-day meeting here Monday on
lifelong learning in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of constant political, economic, environmental and
technological change in modern society, "there is every indication
that learning needs to become a lifelong function," according to a
background document prepared for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The report characterizes lifelong learning as "a survival issue
" and predicts that "the importance for persons to continue
learning throughout their active working life, and beyond, will
increasingly move to the top of individual, national and
international agendas in the future."
</P>
<P>
The report notes that at the all-important first step, the
primary school, an estimated "130 million children of primary
school age do not have access to basic education." Nearly two-
thirds of these children are girls.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "close to one-sixth of the world's population is
unable to read and write," according to the report. The gender
imbalance in illiteracy levels means that "poor women are doubly
marginalized in terms of literacy through being both poor and
women."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, delegates representing governments, private
employers, teachers' unions and non-governmental observers from
more than 50 countries will examine the funding, organization and
especially staffing options needed to address these problems and
gradually transform lifelong learning from "rhetoric" to "a
reality."
</P>
<P>
They will also study the development of linkages and strategic
partnerships between education and training institutes and
enterprises and the role of trade unions and employers in
fostering a culture of lifelong learning.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned About Chechen Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union expressed
Monday its concern about the humanitarian situation in Chechnya
and deplored the suffering of the civilian population in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the 15-nation bloc said that the
recent decisions and recommendations by the Parliamentary Assembly
of the Council of Europe and the discussions by the European
Commission on human rights in Geneva had reflected the serious
concern of European public opinion with the conflict in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Europe last week decided to suspend the voting
rights of Russia as a protest against the alleged deterioration of
the humanitarian situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers expressed their support for the
Council of Europe's continuing cooperation with and assistance to
Russia under the condition that Russia abides by its commitments.
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged the efforts made by the Russian authorities
for having the presence of Council of Europe experts in Russia and
their promise of allowing free access by the International Red
Cross to the detention camps in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama and EU high
representative of common foreign and defense policy Javier Solana
briefed the foreign ministers about their recent trip to Moscow,
where they met with President-elect Vladimir Putin and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers expressed their hope that Putin would
give a new impetus to the partnership between the European Union
and his nation on the basis of common values and shared objectives.
</P>
<P>
The council also hoped that under Putin's leadership, the
Russian political and economic reforms would "lead to early
tangible results."
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers are expected to meet their Russian
counterpart later Monday in the third EU-Russia cooperation
council during which they are expected to discuss such issues as
the situation in Chechnya, the outcome of the Russian presidential
elections, the orientation for forming government policies and the
coming EU-Russia summit slated for May 17 in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also expected to discuss trade disputes such
as the Russian levy on scrap metal exports, regulation of the
Russian market for eggs, alcohol beverages and wine, intellectual
rights protection, financial services and overflight rights over
Siberia.

<HEADLINE> FAO Sees Slight Rise in Cereal Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rome-based U.N. body put the wheat output at 595 million
tons, 1 percent up from 1999, coarse grains at 900 million tons, 3
percent up, while predicting that the rice crop would drop by 1
percent to 395 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In its first forecast for the year, the FAO said cereal output
would not be sufficient to meet expected utilization requirements
in 2000/01 and global cereal reserves would have to be drawn down,
despite higher production forecast for the year.
</P>
<P>
It said food emergencies persist in 34 countries throughout the
world and unfavorable prospects in several others could lead to
localized supply difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The FAO's latest forecast of world cereal trade in 1999/2000 is
222 million tons, unchanged from the previous report and some 4
percent above the previous year's volume.
</P>
<P>
It attributed this to larger imports of both wheat and coarse
grains, which would more than offset the likely fall in rice trade.
</P>
<P>
International grain prices have been volatile and slightly
higher in recent weeks, reflecting active trade and concern over
adverse weather for the 2000 crop in the major producing areas of
the United States, the FAO said.

<HEADLINE> Abandonment of River Harnessing Works Responsible for Damage: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Mugur
Isarescu Monday stressed in the western city of Timisoara that the
abandonment of river harnessing works is responsible for the
damage caused by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu is now on a tour of the counties worst hit by
rainfalls in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, "The civil protection investments have
to be correlated with the distressed areas. It is evident that we
have to invest more in the field but not only in sore spots but
also in the areas where we can create jobs. The start of several
projects without finishing them is extremely bad, even expensive."
</P>
<P>
"River harnessing works have been neglected in the past 10
years. Small sums were allocated and they are time consuming works,
but we hope that beginning next year we shall re-start the dam-
building process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu wanted to help notably the counties of Alba and
Hunedoara, central Romania, where unemployment is high. At the
first government meeting of this week, he is to make a first
assessment of the losses caused by the floods and will propose the
first measures to help the afflicted persons.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rainfall lately and the rapid melting of snow in the
first few days of April caused floods in most regions of the
country, with the center, the northwest and the southwest of
Romania being the most affected. The damage caused is considered
as the heaviest in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of Civil Service Vlad Rosca, 489 villages
and towns were affected, most of them in Hunedoara and Caras-
Severin counties in western Romania. Another 14 were still
isolated by waters in Timis county, in western Romania too. In
Caras-Severin overflowing rivers inundated 1,013 households.
</P>
<P>
Rainfalls and storms blacked out 16 villages in Arad, Bihor and
Timis counties. Still under water are 85,273 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu convened on April 12 an
emergency meeting of the country's Supreme Defense Council for an
analysis of the effects of the floods. The Supreme Defense Council
will set a medium- and long-term program for preventing floods and
ecological accidents and for improving the environment protection,
according to a Monday release of the Presidency's Press Office.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian agricultural
authorities will popularize high-yield and disease-resistant
coffee seedlings in the Borena region bordering with Kenya.
</P>
<P>
More than 6.8 million coffee seedlings have been available for
transplantation in about 5,200 hectares of land in the region,
according to local Walta Information Center on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The coffee seedlings will be transplanted beginning later this
month. The number of coffee seedlings prepared for transplantation
this year shows an increase of 1.7 million over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Borena region, which suffered losses in a wild fire between
February and March, entered small rainy season at the end of
March, thus having paved way for the transplantation of the coffee
seedlings.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Build First Gas-Fired Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The recent discovery of a
huge natural gas field off South Africa's west coast will prompt
the country to build its first gas-fired power station in Cape
Town within the next five years, said Western Cape Province
Premier Gerald Morkel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the Sixth International
Geostatistics Conference in Cape Town, Morkel said the discovery
has the potential to boost economic development in the region
besides securing its energy needs for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
According to Morkel, the gas field can supply a 1,000 megawatt
power station in Cape Town for about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
This will mean relatively cheap fuel for industrial and
domestic use in the greater Cape Town area, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Negatively Affected by Rising Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Adjustments in international oil
prices have adversely affected economies like Zimbabwe which are
dependent on oil imports, said the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in its
Economic Highlights released here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Sharp increases in oil prices imply that the terms of trade
have worsened, thus negatively impacting on the country's external
payments position," the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The latest round of increases in oil prices has meant that for
the same volume of oil imports, the country has had to finance
import bills close to three times its import bill in 1998," it
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the cumulative effect of this
development includes imbalances in the country's balance of
payments and pressures on the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly so in view of the country's continued poor
export performance, it said.
</P>
<P>
It commended the decision made by the Organization of Petroleum
 Exporting Countries to increase oil production by an additional
six percent.
</P>
<P>
The move should impact favorably on oil prices and dampen fuel
price induced inflationary pressures, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also called for optimal and efficient use of fuel in
Zimbabwe, saying the practice would help stabilize the import
volumes of the country, minimizing the negative effects of the
latest round of fuel price increases.
</P>
<P>
The international oil prices rose from 12.1 U.S. dollars per
barrel at the beginning of 1999 to 25.6 U.S. dollars by the end of
the year and to 29 U.S. dollars by March 2000.

<HEADLINE> Portugal, Angola Dispute Over Entry Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Portuguese government is
seeking clarification from Angola on refusal of entry of some 30
Portuguese citizens over the weekend, local informed sources said
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama was quoted as saying
that he had asked the Portuguese Embassy in Luanda "to insist on
clarification" of the two incidents which took place on Friday and
Sunday respectively, describing them as "unprecedented" and
"disagreeable".
</P>
<P>
"This situation does not appear compatible with the good level
of relations between our two countries," Gama said, adding that he
would contact his Angolan counterpart Joao Miranda.
</P>
<P>
However, spokesman for Angolan Foreign Ministry Antonio Pedro
downplayed the significance of the incidents, saying the
Portuguese-Angolan bilateral relations "are and will always be the
best. Everything else is speculation."
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic flap emerged last Friday when 12 Portuguese
citizens were denied entry into Angola by Luanda immigration
officials because they had come to Angola to work but only carried
visas for tourists, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
A similar incident took place on Sunday, when 15 Portuguese
were refused entry at the airport and sent back to Lisbon aboard a
TAP (Air Portugal) flight.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts noticed that the incidents followed the recent
bilateral tensions triggered by former Portuguese President Mario
Soares who publicly denounced "corruption" and "dictatorial"
practices in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Luanda government retorted immediately and charged Soares
for having benefitted from the Angolan rebels' illegal trade in
diamonds and ivory.

This is caused not only by poverty but also by the incapacity to
absorb children into education systems, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Sevene also said that labor migration within the community is
partly to blame for the poor development of SADC national
economics.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a need to prioritize investment in the
health and education areas, and called on SADC member states to
undertake efforts leading to gender equality.
</P>
<P>
As regards Mozambique, Sevene said that, despite the
difficulties faced by the country in the wake of the devastating
flooding in February, the government is making efforts to
implement its five-year program, the top priority of which is to
eradicate absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, due to end on April 15, brings together SADC labor
 ministers and experts, as well as donor organizations.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that themes such as the SADC Employment and
Labor Sector Annual Report, the child labor problem, social
security, and the impact of AIDS on jobs, among others, will be
debated.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Pressures Increase In Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The UK economy is experiencing
inflationary pressures, following an unexpectedly strong rise of
producer prices, according to official figures released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Output prices rose by 0.5 percent in March to an annual rate of
2.3 percent. It was the greatest monthly increase in nearly four
years since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile input prices, the cost of raw materials, rose even
faster, by 0.8 percent, to an annual rate of 13.6 percent on a
seasonally adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices are regarded to be the main reason for the rising
input prices that have increased by 134 percent year-on-year as
OPEC production cuts have led to a sharp increase in the price of
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The Office of National Statistics (ONS) said that oil
contributed half (0.4 percent) of the total rise.
</P>
<P>
The ONS also said that 0.2 percent of the increase in output
prices was due to the effect of the Budget, which raised various
duties on tobacco, petrol, and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
While the UK economy is expected to grow strongly this year, by
around 3 percent, the news will put further pressure on the Bank
of England to raise interest rates again.

<HEADLINE> Honda Extends Production Line In UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The UK car industry received a
much-needed boost with Japanese car firm Honda unveiling plans to
build a new model at its Wiltshire car plant.
</P>
<P>
Production of the four-wheel drive CR-V, currently build in
Japan, will start at Swindon in eight weeks time, following
exceptional demand for the car throughout Europe, said Honda
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Honda opened its factory at Swindon in 1992 and is currently
recruiting to boost the number of workers from the current 3,000
to about 4,000 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Honda announced a short-term cut back in
production at Swindon -- mainly because the plant is undergoing a
modernization program.
</P>
<P>
Honda said the news reaffirmed its long-term commitment to the
UK. The new model will be the fifth built at the plant.
</P>
<P>
Minoru Harada, chief executive of Honda's European operations,
said: "We are delighted that we will be building the CR-V at
Swindon to meet European customer demands."
</P>
<P>
"This manufacturing facility demonstrates the flexibility and
agility that characterizes Honda's success and confirms our long-
term commitment to making top quality cars in Britain," he added.

<HEADLINE> Toronto's Worst Fire Brought Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- After eight hours of fighting,
Canada's biggest city Toronto is bringing under control the most
dangerous fire the city has ever seen, said local media reports
Monday.
</P>
<P>
There have been no injuries. The city is yet to deal with
massive chemical aftermaths.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 firefighters and 30 fire trucks were battling
overnight to contain the spread of the worst fire started Sunday
afternoon in the eastern part of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
There were more explosions of tanks of inflammable liquids,
including xylene, a volatile hydrocarbon used as a solvent, at U.S.
E. Hickson Products plant located near Lawrence and Morningside
Aves, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters had difficulty getting close to four vats of
potentially explosive chemicals near where the fire continued to
burn out of control, Toronto Fire division commander Pat McCabe
said.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Dan Newman of Ontario was reported at the
scene Sunday night. He said monitoring trucks were called in to
test the surrounding atmosphere for toxins.
</P>
<P>
Huge black fumes were rising hundreds of meters into the sky
Sunday afternoon and could be seen as far away as Niagara-on-the-
Lake and the Burlington Skyway.
</P>
<P>
Several dozens of homes were evacuated, while nearby traffic
was halted.

"We need help from countries all over the world, especially
China and other friendly countries, at the very beginning of
reconstruction," said Jaber, who offered an invitation to Chinese
companies to participate in infrastructural construction of
Palestine, including hospitals, schools and bridges.
</P>
<P>
China will soon build a computer training center in Jericho,
and a hospital and school in the Gaza Strip, according to the
diplomat. He said that since President Arafat first visited China
in 1964, he has sealed a deep friendship and good relationship
with three generations of the Chinese leadership.
</P>
<P>
So far, Arafat has visited China 12 times, and two or three
high-level Palestinian delegations have come to China every year,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Palestine and China enjoy good relations at all times, he said,
pointing to China's support for Palestine in political, financial
and other areas, as well as in the international arena, including
the United Nations Security Council and international conferences.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The following is a round-up of
Xinhua's archaeology news for the past week:
</P>
<P>
-- Heritage Law to Be Revised
</P>
<P>
China will revise its existing Heritage Law, which ensures
systematic heritage preservation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's Legislative Affairs Office has listed the
revision to the Heritage Law as a priority of its work this year.
The amendments will be submitted to China's top legislative body,
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, for
approval.
</P>
<P>
Rampant grave looting and relics smuggling have emerged in
recent years, and the existing law could not effectively curb such
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The amendments will also pave the way for coordinated
development plans between relics preservation authorities and the
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
-- Double City Walls Found in Ancient Emperor Tomb
</P>
<P>
Double city walls surrounding the tomb of the Emperor Gaozong
of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) were discovered recently.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said that the tomb, 80 kilometers from Xi'an
City, capital of northwest Shaanxi Province, reflects the ancient
architectural style of imperial graves.
</P>
<P>
Aerial photography helped lead experts to the site. They
believe there are many treasures in the lavish tomb inside the
double city walls.
</P>
<P>
-- Ancient River Banks Found in Central Henan
</P>
<P>
Some remains of ancient banks of the River Luohe, near Luoyang
City of central Henan Province, were found recently.
</P>
<P>
The 400-meter river banks, dated back to the Sui (581-618) and
the Tang (618-907) dynasties, were important landmarks of the
ancient city of Luoyang, which was a state capital in many
dynasties.

<HEADLINE> Cohen in UAE for Military Cooperation Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the
Armed Forces of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Khalifa Bin
Zayed al-Nahyan met here Monday with visiting U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides discussed relations and
cooperation between the UAE and the United States as well as the
latest developments of the Arab and Persian Gulf issues, Emirates
News Agency (WAM) reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Nahyan, also crown prince of the Abu Dhabi Emirate, expressed
satisfaction with the cooperative relations and friendship between
the two countries as they share common desire to expand cooperation
in all areas especially in the military sphere.
</P>
<P>
The deal on the purchase of the U.S.-made fighter F16s is part
of the military cooperation between the two countries and their
common endeavor to strengthen such ties, said al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cohen hailed the achievements made by UAE in dealing
with regional and international issues, citing contributions by UAE
to the humanitarian relief efforts in wars and natural disasters
worldwide. He expressed his country's desire to enhance ties with
the UAE.

with Cohen on the situation in the Middle East, bilateral ties and
issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Vows to Defend Press Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate Minister of Culture
and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani on Monday vowed to defend
press freedom and make efforts to stop the trend of closing down
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Mohajerani said his ministry
would propose a bill to the new Majlis (parliament) to revise the
press law to annul the right of any state organs to revoke the
licenses of any newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"If a newspaper is found guilty, it could be punished by a
suspension of certain period, its license should not be revoked,"
he said, believing Iran's freedom-seeking press would feel more
comfortable after the reformists take over the parliament on May
27.
</P>
<P>
Iran's outgoing conservatives-dominated parliament has been
trying to put more restrictions on the press and it passed the
outlines of a bill to amend the press law last July, which
triggered a nationwide protest and a political turmoil following
clashes between students and policemen.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that the conservatives intended to pass the
bill before handing over the parliament to the reformists, who
support freedom of the press and expression.
</P>
<P>
Iran's press, closely associated with political factions, went
through ups and downs in the past years. A total of 78 publications
were ordered to close in the capital in the past year alone.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, four managing directors of reformist
newspapers have been summoned to the conservative courts for
questioning, and a number of journalists and writers interrogated.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the official Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) Fereydoun Verdinejad on Sunday openly called on the
government to safeguard the freedom of journalists.
</P>
<P>
"We should pay the price to foster openness in the society by
granting freedom to the journalists," he said after being called
before the press court for the second time in a week.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani said that the press court has the right to summon
managing directors of newspapers if complaints were filed against
their publications. But, he noted, summoning journalists or writers
is illegal, because managing directors should be responsible for
the contents of their newspapers.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that the appeals court has recently
confirmed a sentence of 30 months in prison on Mashaallah
Shamsolvaezin, editor-in-chief of the daily Asr-e Azadegan, for
press violations.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the press to observe the country's laws and
the limits of the press freedom, particularly before the reformists
take over the parliament.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: G-77 Summit Strives for Close South-South Cooperation (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation among developing
countries is top on the agenda of the South Summit, the largest
ever gathering of heads of state or government in the 36-year-old
Group of 77 (G-77), and the Havana meeting is seen as the best
chance to improve the bargaining position of the developing South
in trade with the developed North.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 Monday held a meeting of senior officials in advance
of the first ever South Summit in Havana, the capital of Cuba, to
ponder over the current challenge facing the developing world,
including the impact of globalization and the South-South
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries face today the challenge of formulating
a common vision and constructing a platform for collective action
in order to achieve a comprehensive formulation and forceful
articulation of their concerns and objectives," said the G-77
chairman, Arthur Mbanefo, who is also the Nigerian permanent
representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Havana Summit is a unique opportunity to renew the South'
s commitment to South-South cooperation and define an action plan
with clear targets and a time frame for its effective
implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua last week, Mbanefo has said that
the heads of state or government are expected to exchange views
among themselves on the economic issues, the new economic order
for the developing countries and the pros and cons of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The challenge of development remains paramount in a world
where one fifth of humanity is forced to fend for itself on a
meager U.S. dollar a day, one third of all Africans are not
expected to survive past the age of 40, nearly 40 percent of women
in developing countries are illiterate, and more than half of
South Asia's children remain underweight at age five.
</P>
<P>
In fact, enhancing the South-South cooperation is critical as
the cost of doing business with the North is rising. Under the
current international economic system, which remains far from
being fair and just, many developing countries are in an
unfavorable position while they are trading primary products with
the developed North.
</P>
<P>
Historically, poorer nations in the Southern hemisphere have
traded with richer countries in the North, rather than with each
other. The stark reality is: the international market is under the
control of the North and many developing countries can hardly have
a say in the world price mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, an increased cooperation among developing countries
can open up more opportunities for development, thus improving
their bargaining position in the current world economic and trade
system.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts must be also made to strengthen the South-
North cooperation at the same time as the developing countries are
striving for closer economic and trade ties among themselves. As
the interdependence increases in the world, highly influenced by
the tide of globalization, the South cannot do without the North
because the industrialized countries are well advanced in
information and technology, the well-known booster of efficiency
and productivity.
</P>
<P>
Many countries are being marginalized in the globalization
process simply because they are underdeveloped in science and
technology: people in some African rural areas are still lighting
candles at night due to the lack of power, fundamental resources
to run television and computer.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the enhanced cooperation in the developing
world is crucial against a backdrop that most industrialized
countries fail to comply with their pledged development assistance,
set at 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the United Nations General Assembly established the
goal for wealthy countries to earmark 0.7 percent of their GDP for
assistance to developing nations. Currently, only four -- Denmark,
the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden -- have reached or surpassed
that mark.
</P>
<P>
Official development aid (ODA) from the North to the South in
1992 reached 61 billion U.S. dollars. By 1997, the total had
fallen to 47.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan once said that the volume of
external aid to developing countries has declined steadily
throughout the 1990s, and now stands at 0.22 percent of the GDP of
the industrialized countries -- only 0.19 percent for the Group of
Seven major industrialized countries, which includes the richest
among them.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the issue will likely spark debate,
not only regarding the need for the aid, but also about special
attention for programs targeting education, health and social
security in the South countries.
</P>
<P>
For years, these fundamental areas have been dramatically
affected by the economic adjustment and restructuring programs
imposed within the current globalization process.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: One Million Somalis Face Starvation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 10 (Xinhua)-- More than one million people are
 estimated to be at high risk of dying for starvation and lack of
water due to a long spell of drought in Somalia, local and
international aid agencies have said.
</P>
<P>
The drought is especially severe in the central and southern
regions all along the border with Ethiopia. The towns of Gebiley,
Buro and Odweyneh in the northwest known as Somaliland are also
suffering from the drought.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected region is Bakol where several people are
dying from famine and its related diseases everyday.
</P>
<P>
Its neighboring region of Gedo is not any better where the
famine claims the lives of four everyday, according to the local
officials.
</P>
<P>
Entire villages have been abandoned in Bakol and Gedo regions
with thousands of families having moved from their villages and
countryside to the main towns in search of water and food.
</P>
<P>
The few villages where still some people are available include
El-Garas and Biyoley whose people travel 60 Kilometers to get to
Tieglow town for water everyday.
</P>
<P>
According to Sheikh Ahmed Sheikh Aden, one of the elders in
El-Garas village, after covering that long distance for water one
should still stand a long queue for nearly 24 hours to obtain a
jerry can of 20 litter water.
</P>
<P>
It is the lack of water that mainly kills the people, he said.
It is not the people alone, but the livestock has also been
affected by the drought.
</P>
<P>
"Forget about cattle, almost all of them have gone, but the
goats and camels are still struggling," said Kusow Issaq Hassan,
the chairman of El-Garas village whom the Xinhua reporter
contacted on the VHF radio on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The families with goats and camels will still be able to
survive a little longer, he added.
</P>
<P>
Where the security situation permits, the aid agencies are
trying hard to get food and water to the most needy people in the
regions along the border with Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and a Norwegian aid
agency have already managed to get water supplies for the villages
surrounding Buro and Gebiley towns in the breakaway republic of
Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of Red Cross and the U.N.
Children's Fund have also supplied nearly 800 tons of dry food
rations, nutritious biscuits and porridge to the famine stricken
families in Bakol and Gedo regions.
</P>
<P>
But despite these efforts, the drought is far from being
challenged and the people and livestock keep dying in daily bases.
</P>
<P>
In Somaliland the aid can flow smoothly owing to the relative
stability in the region, but in the south and central Somalia, the
fate of the people remains uncertain since the lawlessness is also
another problem and nobody seems to be able to do anything about
it.
</P>
<P>
Unless something concrete is done, the people especially in
southern Somalia will be dying in great numbers similar to their
neighbors in Ethiopia.

<P>
HAVANA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuba Monday expressed warm welcome
to delegations to the South Summit, the largest gathering of heads
of state and government since the 1964 establishment of the Group
of 77 (G-77), saying that the Caribbean country will do whatever
it can to ensure the success of the historic event.
</P>
<P>
Maria de Los Angeles, Cuba's vice minister of foreign affairs,
said at the opening session of the summit that the summit is the
highest-level meeting on Cuban soil, and she is confident that it
will achieve success.
</P>
<P>
"We have to see our Group of 77 as a vehicle. We will maintain
as a group in the international situation, and as the most
appropriate way to develop cooperation programs among ourselves,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are rich in human resources, "said the Cuban vice minister,
adding that it is hoped that G-77 will take advantage of the
resources available for the benefit of the peoples of the South.
</P>
<P>
The brief opening session, presided over by Chairman of G-77

<HEADLINE> Senior G-77 Officials Hammer out Final Documents for South Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77 (G-77) Monday held
a closed-door meeting of senior officials from its 133 member
states in the Cuban capital of Havana at the end of a brief
opening session of the South Summit, the largest gathering of
heads of state and government in the body's 36-year history.
</P>
<P>
The high-ranking officials kicked off the meeting at the Havana
International Conference Center to finish the last touch on the
two final documents which are to emerge from the Summit -- the
Joint Declaration and the Plan of Action.
</P>
<P>
The forward-looking Joint Declaration will set out a vision and
broad strategy for the future, while the Plan of Action will
clearly define the measures, targets and time frames for
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The two draft documents will be presented to foreign ministers
when they meet here Wednesday, and then be relayed to the heads of
state and government for approval when they meet for three days
beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two documents are expected to touch on the impact of
globalization on the developing world, how to better the South-
South cooperation, and how to improve the South-North dialogue,
including the access to market in developed countries, the
transfer of advanced science and technology and the relief of debt
burdens for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Maria de Los Angeles, Cuba's vice minister of foreign
affairs, expressed warm welcome to delegates to the South Summit,
saying that the Caribbean island country will make every possible
effort to ensure the historic event a success.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit, which is scheduled to conclude on April 14,
will mark a "turning point in the history of the Group of 77,"
Arthur Mbanefo, G-77 chairman and the Nigerian permanent
representative to the United Nations, told reporters here last
week.
</P>
<P>
Some 65 heads of state and government from Africa, Asia, Latin
American and the Caribbean are expected to attend the historic
event, along with representatives of more than 50 other countries,
such as China, and of 80 international organizations, including U.
N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit is an occasion for developing countries to
galvanize their strength and solidarity into a truly energetic
force against those capable of conditioning the international
economic order in which they must operate.
</P>
<P>
G-77 was founded on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries in
Geneva. Although its current membership has increased to 133
countries, the original name was retained because of its historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and
the largest grouping in the South, the organization provides means
for the developing world to articulate and promote its collective
economic interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on
all major international economic issues in the United Nations
system, and promote economic and technical cooperation among
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Georgian President-Elect Eduard Shevardnadze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Veteran Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze won another five years in power in the Sunday
presidential election in the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Eduard Shevardnadze, who was born on January 25, 1928 in a
teacher's family in the Mamati Lanchkhutsky region of the Georgian
Soviet Socialist Republic, became the president of Georgia in 1995
after serving as chairman of the republic's State Council since
1992.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Communist Party of the USSR in 1948 and graduated
from the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of Georgia and the Kutasi Pedagogical Institute.
</P>
<P>
Between 1957-1961, he worked as first secretary of the Central
Committee of the Georgian Comsomol, then as a member of the
Central Committee of the Soviet Comsomol from 1958 to 1962 and as
first Communist Party secretary of the Mtskheta region from 1961
to 1963,
</P>
<P>
He was first deputy Public Order Minister of Georgia in 1964-65
and served as Georgia's minister of internal affairs from 1968 to
1972. His campaign against crime and political corruption caught
the attention of central government officials in Moscow, who named
him first secretary of the Georgian Communist Party in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze was elected first secretary the Tbilisi (Georgia's
capital) city committee of the Georgian Communist Party in 1972,
then served as first secretary of the Central Committee of the
party between 1972-1985.
</P>
<P>
He became member of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1976, alternate member of the
Political Bureau of the CPSU in 1978, and was full member of the
bureau from 1985 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Shevardnadze was nominated Minister of Foreign Affairs
for USSR. His close personal and ideological ties to party
chairman Mikhail Gorbachev influenced his nomination. As foreign
minister, Shevardnadze oversaw a transformation of Soviet
international relations under the Gorbachev administration.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze was a strong supporter of the withdrawal of the
Soviet military from Afghanistan in 1989. He also promoted arms
reduction.
</P>
<P>
He served as foreign minister of the Soviet Union from July
1985 to December 1990 and was re-appointed Minister of Foreign
Relations of USSR on November 19, 1991.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Shevardnadze was elected chairman of the State Council
of the newly independent Republic of Georgia. He was elected
chairman of the Civic Union of Georgia on November 21, 1993.
</P>
<P>
After Georgia's independence, Shevardnadze became deeply
involved in a dispute with separatists in the autonomous republic
of Abkhazia, located in the northwest portion of the country. To
gain Russian support in Abkhazia, Shevardnadze agreed to enroll
Georgia in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In August 1995, Georgia's legislature approved a new
Constitution, which restored the office of the presidency. Four
months later, he won the first Georgian general election with more
than 70 percent of the vote.

<HEADLINE> WSBI Asia-Pacific Regional Group Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The 6th Asia-Pacific Regional
Group Meeting of the World Saving Banks Institute (WSBI) opened in
Shanghai today to plan for future operations in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 specialists, including governors of savings banks
from WSBI Asian-Pacific member countries, and representatives of
WSBI Management Committee were in attendance.
</P>
<P>
De Noose, chairman of WSBI Management Committee, said WSBI has
been going all out to increase exchanges in information and
experiences among different areas, to promote cooperation among
members from different regions, and to help member banks with
their reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, bankers will discuss future plans
of WSBI in the Asian-Pacific region, the Asian economic status and
future prospects, challenges faced by saving banks, economic and
financial reforms in China, regional cooperation among banks from
different parts of China, and ways for savings banks to
participate in regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1996 with headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, WSBI
consists of African, Asian-Pacific, American and European regional
groups and has 107 institutional members which represent 1,500
saving banks from 88 countries and regions. Its forerunner was the
International Saving Banks Association set up in Milan, Italy, in
1924.
</P>
<P>
There are 14 members from 11 countries and regions on WSBI
Asian-Pacific regional group. Chinese members of the Asian-Pacific

<HEADLINE> Mechanized Paddy Production Crucial to China's Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China will promote mechanized
paddy production nationwide as it is crucial for modernizing the
country's agriculture, Vice-Minister of Agriculture Zhang Baowen
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told the International Conference on the Mechanization of
China's Paddy Production, which opened here today, that China has
never had such an urgent need to modernize its paddy production,
now that more farmers, especially in the eastern regions, are
moving to the industrial and service sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ongoing adjustment of the country's agriculture
and the improvement of the farmers' life also call for overhaul in
paddy production, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's paddy acreage accounts for over 34 percent of the
country's total crop acreage, while its output accounts for more
than 44 percent of the crop grain output, making up 23 percent and
37 percent respectively of the world's paddy acreage and output.
</P>
<P>
However, paddy production mechanization in China lags behind
wheat, corn and other staple grains. In 1998, only four percent of
rice planting and 10 percent of harvesting were conducted with
machinery, said Niu Dun, director of the Agricultural
Mechanization Department attached to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Niu attributed China's relatively low mechanized paddy
production to inadequate research and development of new
technologies and implements. He said that China should introduce
more advanced technologies and tools from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference is sponsored by the Agricultural
Mechanization Department, and is attended by officials, experts
and business people from major paddy producing countries including
Japan, the U.S., and France.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's State Development and
Planning Commission and National Tourism Administration today
jointly issued a circular calling for a nationwide check of prices
charged to tourists.
</P>
<P>
The review is aimed at curbing rampant inflated prices,
involving all tourism-related companies and government departments
and focusing on admission tickets to scenic spots, transportation
fares, prices of commodities and services in scenic spots as well
as prices in hotels, restaurants and recreational facilities.
</P>
<P>
The notice urges price-regulating departments at all levels to
investigate irregularities such as random price-raising and
overcharging, and says that those who violate price laws will be
punished.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide check-up will be carried out from April 20 to
May 10, and from September 20 to October 10. The two periods
include International Labor Day and China's National Day which
historically see a rush of tourists.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Fiscal Transfer to Western Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
promoting fiscal transfer as a major financial support to
accelerate development of the enormous western territory.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Finance Jin Liqun said here today that fiscal
transfer will become the major channel for facilitating
development of west China, as the short-term pro-active fiscal
policy is going to be phased out.
</P>
<P>
China now is funding projects in the west with money earned
from treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
Since China began to adopt a relatively standardized fiscal
transfer system in 1995, the amount of fiscal transfer among the
richer and poorer areas every year has grown from two billion yuan
to 9.5 billion yuan. Most of the money has gone to the west.
</P>
<P>
At present, the central government's budget revenue accounts
for only 13 percent of the gross domestic product, far lower than
the ratio of 30 percent in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will try to increase this percentage
while it is also allocating loans of lower interest rates and
allowing for greater flexibility of repayment for loans to the
west than other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that these pro-active fiscal policies represent
another form of fiscal transfer.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the fiscal transfer to the west is aimed to
upgrade infrastructure to attract foreign investment and
international loans to fund projects in the poor areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will learn from experience of other
countries in reducing regional disparity.

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China can play a much-needed,
bigger role in the Mideast peace process, Sadi Jaber, charge d'
affaires of the Palestinian embassy in Beijing, said today.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is an important thing for us, and we believe

" he said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
And as a trusted friend of Palestine, China can play a vital
role in pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Chinese President Jiang Zemin's impending state
visit to Palestine, the Palestinian diplomatic envoy said the
visit comes at a crucial time in the peace process. President
Jiang and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat are expected to
discuss the general situation of the Mideast region and ways to
move forward the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is good for all the people in the region," Jaber said,
adding that economic cooperation will also be on the agenda of
talks between Jiang and Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Anthropoid Statue Discovered in Northwestern Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian geographer recently
found a huge anthropoid statue made of stone in northwestern Iran,
similar to the statue of Sphinx, one of the seven wonders of the
world, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statue was found on a hill overlooking Anbaran village in
the city of Namin, some 40 kilometers away from Ardebil, the
capital city of the northwestern Ardebil province.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the village call the statue, 20 meters high and six
meters wide at the top of a 100-meter hill, as "Baba Davood"
(Father Davood) and believe that a shrine had been built in the
area surrounding the statue, but was destroyed with the lapse of
time.
</P>
<P>
Local residents have no exact information on why the statue is
called "Baba Davood" or about its historical beginning, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Projections resembling the eyes, mouth and chin of a person can
be seen on the face of the statue and it is believed that they have
been shaped by atmospheric changes, though a human role in the
shaping of the statue cannot be ignored.

<HEADLINE> Barak Leaves for Summit with Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is heading to Washington Monday afternoon on a mission to
inject more vitality into the faltering Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak is due to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington
on Tuesday to try to rescue the stalled peace talks with the
Syrians and push ahead the final-status talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss with Clinton about Israel's planned troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon by July this year.
</P>
<P>
En route, Barak is set to hold talks in Cairo with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, whose Foreign minister Amr Moussa said on
Sunday that Israel's peace talks with the Palestinians are in a
serious crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before the departure, Barak, who had expressed his deep
pessimism about the chances of renewing peace talks with the
Syrians, laid out his vision of solving the key issues in the
final-status talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said on Sunday that Israel will not give the sovereignty to
the Palestinians over big Jewish settlements in the West Bank, but
will transfer all Palestinian villages outside Jerusalem, including
Abu Dis and Anata, to the Palestinians in the future Israeli troop
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
He also said the most areas in the West Bank designated as Area
B, which are under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security
control, will, under a permanent-status agreement, be transferred
to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
He added the Palestinian entity should be as continuous as
possible, so that Palestinians should not have to go through
roadblocks to get from one part to another and their leaders should
not need permission to leave its borders.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Palestinian refugees, Barak said that Israel will
take neither legal nor moral responsibility for the refugees and
the solution to this problem is not within Israel.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, commenting on the
upcoming Washington summit, said Monday it is time for Israel and
the Palestinians to "put their cards on the table" ahead of a May
deadline to draw up a framework deal for a final peace agreement
which must solve the toughest issues such as the fate of Jerusalem
and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks were stalled in January after the
two sides held two rounds of talks in the United States since last
December, due to Israel's refusal to promise to return to Syria all
the Golan Heights it occupied during the 1967 Middle East War.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Monday launched a fresh offensive against Tamil rebels in the
northern Jaffna Peninsula to recapture a stretch of a vital
highway, according to military spokesman B.P. Fernando.
</P>
<P>
The troops had moved out on one front south of Pallai, which
has seen fighting in the past two weeks since the rebels launched
a push for the strategic Elephant Pass military base linking the
mainland and the Jaffna Peninsula, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting broke out between Sri Lankan government troops
on a highway between Eluthumadduval and Muhamaalai Monday morning
as the troops made yet another attempt to recapture more than six
kilometers of the road to the Elephant Pass, reports reaching here
from the north of the country said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have pounded each other with artillery and
mortars while the Sri Lankan Air Force has bombed several rebel
targets as the rebels have resisted the military's advance.
</P>
<P>
The fighting is fierce but details of casualties on both sides
were still not available, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels who have been fighting a war against the
government since 1983 for a separate state in the country,
launched a major offensive two weeks ago to take the Elephant Pass,
a vital road bridge, in a bid to recapture the Jaffna Peninsula
which they lost to government troops in May 1996.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Demands Total Ban on Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Sun Huixia
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
 reiterated Kenya's stand on the total ban on ivory trade here
Monday, saying that the poaching of elephants has increased due to
some southern African countries' one-off sales of ivory to Japan
approved by CITES in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We in Kenya see evidence that the illegal killing of elephants
has increased while no reliable monitoring system has been put in
place," Moi said at the opening ceremony of the 11th conference of
Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
"I am pointing this out because one tends to forget that
actions in one country can significantly affect the situation in
others," Moi added.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that the system of Monitoring the iIlegal Killing of
Elephants, which was proposed to set up in 1997, is not truly
representative of CITES membership.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that the problem of poaching has
adversely affected Kenya's tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South africa, have proposed to
be authorized by CITES to have an annual quota for further sales.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and India have demanded a return to the full ban on the
ivory trade, citing the southern African sale stimulated poaching
greatly and that CITES member countries had failed to curb the
illegal ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which ends on April 20, is expected to review
62 proposals to amend the trade controls or bans on international
trade in endangered species. The ivory issue has been the focus of
the meeting.

<P>
SEOUL, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming summit between
South Korean president Kim Dae-jung and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang on June
12-14 this year is expected to center on economic cooperation
rather than political and military issues, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Both Seoul and Pyongyang believe the economic complementarity
and a closer economic cooperation will help them understand each
other and build mutual confidence after a 55-year-old division of
the Korean peninsula, laying a foundation for future talks on
political issues such as national reunification.
</P>
<P>
For its part, South Korea, with access to the DPRK's cheap
labor and comparatively rich natural resources, will gain a new
market for its products and will save outlay and boost exports in
trade with China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DPRK, whose national income is around 25 times
and trade 156 times smaller than South Korean, can introduce
technology and capital from South Korea to improve its
infrastructure and other industries.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year's speech this year, President Kim proposed that
the two sides form an economic community for cooperation from
commodities to industries, from transportation and energy to
agriculture and financial services.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK must have realized that no countries in the world can
help it better than South Korea in the economic respect, said Kim
Bee-tai, senior researcher of South Korea's Research Institute for
Northeast Asian Community.
</P>
<P>
A closer inter-Korean economic relationship will help alleviate
tension on the Korean peninsula and reduce military spending on
both sides, the researcher said.
</P>
<P>
It will help raise the credibility of the DPRK in the
international community and attract foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
It will also lessen cost for future reunification by narrowing
the economic gap between the two sides, said the researcher.
</P>
<P>
However, some observers warned that the upcoming summit is
unlikely to produce much, as many unpredictable factors exist.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia regards the strengthening
of its relations with the United States and other Western
countries as a "priority of foreign policy," Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leadership "would like the relations between Moscow
and Washington to be a partnership" and the Russian-American
relations are entering "a new, very important phase," said Ivanov,
when meeting with a delegation of Western businessmen and
investors.
</P>
<P>
"Our approach to relations with the U.S. is not of a time-
serving character. We can positively cooperate in many spheres, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
They could include "strengthening international stability and
security, advancing disarmament progress, consolidating the non-
proliferation regime for mass destruction weapons and fighting
against international terrorism and organized crime," the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov reminded that Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin had
reiterated Moscow's intention to "develop a constructive, mutually
advantageous dialogue with all countries, including both the U.S.
and member countries of the European Union."
</P>
<P>
The strategy of the new Russian leadership is absolutely
clearly directed at deepening economic reforms, creating a
favorable climate for foreign investors and expanding cooperation
with the West, Ivanov added.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Active in Development of Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is ready to use
its expertise to help China develop the backward western parts of
the country, the director of the international organization's
China Program, Yukon Huang, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China should use World Bank loans for
the high-priority development needs of the west, including
educational, social and health programs.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that China should take a broader view of
infrastructure development in the west and concentrate budget
resources on building village and secondary roads.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks today at the International Workshop on
Fiscal Policy and Regional Development sponsored by China's
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Noting that market access, labor quality and infrastructure are
crucial for attracting commercial investment to western China, the
World Bank official said that the central budget, instead of
commercial banks, should play a key role in improving the
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The central government should resume the responsibility of
repaying international loans for funding social and educational
projects in western China because local authorities in the poor
areas cannot afford to repay the debt, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official, who has held various positions in the World Bank
over 24 years, noted that many other developing countries have
experienced the same problems China has in expanding backward
areas.
</P>
<P>
Still smarting from the Asian financial crisis, the Republic of
Korea, Malaysia and Thailand are cautious about borrowing from
outside sources. But they are willing to use World Bank loans to
fund social and educational projects so as to improve the
competitiveness of the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to the lower income and scattered location of
the population in western China, construction of major national
highways will not be economically viable because there won't be
enough traffic.
</P>
<P>
World Bank loans should be channeled to building rural and
secondary roads in order to link the west with the national
transport network and the broader markets in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that China should pay attention to links with
neighboring countries in central and southeast Asia. The growth of
these economies is likely to turn western China into an important
channel of exchange between central and eastern China and the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the World Bank has loaned about 35
billion U.S. dollars to China in support of over 220 projects.
About 50 of the projects, worth more than five billion U.S.
dollars, were oriented to western China.

<HEADLINE> Pine Worms Detected in Wood Packing for Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in east China's
Jiangsu Province have reported the appearance of harmful pine
worms in the wood packing of three batches of imported goods from
Japan and two batches of imported goods from the United States,
according to the Beijing-based International Business Daily
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The worm, mainly found in the U.S., Japan and Canada, is so
dangerous to pine trees that it is known as "pine cancer."
</P>

To protect forests and the country's eco-environment, China in
January launched special quarantine measures for the wood packing
used in imports from Japan and the U.S., stipulating that all

<HEADLINE> China's TB Control Needs Governmental Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has been
urged to increase funding for its anti-tuberculosis (TB) campaign
to avoid further spread of the infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
"About half of the country's TB patients have no access to
treatment or are forced to halt the treatment due to poverty, even
though the illness is curable with drugs," said Professor Duanmu
Hongjin, director of the National Tuberculosis Control Center.
</P>
<P>
China currently has six million TB patients, the world's second
largest total next to India. About 250,000 of China's TB sufferers
die each year.
</P>
<P>
If no preventive measures are taken, more than 200 million
healthy Chinese may be infected with tubercle bacillus, the
bacteria that leads to TB, in the next decade, and one tenth of
them may become full-fledged TB patients, Chinese doctors have
warned.
</P>
<P>
Although an effective treatment, called "directly observed
treatment, short course" (DOTS), has been available in China for
many years, the majority of poor farmers cannt afford the service
which costs 200 to 300 yuan (24 to 36 U.S. dollars) per period of
treatment, said Prof. Duanmu.
</P>
<P>
The prevalence of TB in China's rural areas 2.4 times that in
cities.
</P>
<P>
"What is most needed now is the commitment of governments at
all levels," he said, indicating that more funding should be
allocated since a TB-control project will be completed next year.
The project, aided by the World Bank, will cover almost half of
the Chinese population and provide free treatment.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the ministries of health and finance said a
special national TB fund will be established.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Duanmu also heads the Beijing Tuberculosis and Thoracic
Tumor Research Institute, China's first TB control agency, founded
in 1955.
</P>
<P>
As the domestic leader of TB research and treatment, the
institute has initiated a series of advanced therapies while
developing new drugs, according to Duanmu.
</P>
<P>
The institute also is involved in the research of lung cancer,
which threatens many Chinese. More than 6,000 lung cancer patients
have undergone surgery, and their five-year survival rate has
reached 35 percent, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters of the Iranian
opposition group Mujahidin Khalq in southern Iraq were shelled
Sunday by mercenaries infiltrating into Iraq from "a neighboring
country," announced an Iraqi official on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency (INA), the official said
that a number of mercenaries fired mortar shells at the
headquarters of the Iraq-based Iranian opposition organization.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The attackers have fled back to their bases in the "neighboring
country," said the official, asking not to be named.
</P>
<P>
Iraq vehemently condemns these terrorist acts as well as those
who stand behind them, stressing that Iraq has full rights to
defend its interior security and seize the terrorists wherever they
go, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Mujahidin Khalq has been a major Iraq-based armed group
conducting activities against the Iranian government ever since the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
For years, Iraq and Iran, the two Gulf neighbors who fought a
bloody war from 1980 to 1988, have been trading accusations against
each other for harboring each other's opposition groups engaged in
terrorist activities, hampering the normalization of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that on March 22, four Iraqi civilians were
killed and 38 others injured in a mortar attack by Iranian agents
against densely-populated residential areas in the capital Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier to be Extradited to Canada for Murder Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Jerusalem District Court Judge
Zvi Cohen ruled on Monday that Daniel Weiz, a 19-year-old soldier
of Israel Defense Forces, is eligible to be extradited to Canada to
face a second-degree murder charge.
</P>
<P>
Weiz is suspected by Toronto police of taking part in the brutal
beating to death of a teenage Canadian in a Toronto park last
November, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Weiz denied all the charges. His lawyer Nitzana Darshan-Leitner
had announced that her client will appeal the ruling to Israel's
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
According to the police's accusations, Weiz, who lives in Israel
with his mother and has duel Israeli-Canadian citizenship, was
involved in the case while he was on a three-month furlough in
Toronto with his father.
</P>
<P>
On November 14, 1999, a dozen of youths ambushed Dmitri
Baranovsky, a 15-year-old Canadian boy, and his friends in a
Toronto park, demanding money and cigarettes. Four of the gang
allegedly beat and kicked Baranovsky to death.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian police had kept several suspects in custody on
charges of second-degree murder. In the interrogation of them, Weiz
was identified as one of the murderers.
</P>
<P>
As Weiz had returned to Israel and rejoined his army service at
that time, Canada asked Israeli Justice Ministry to extradite him
to stand trial for the case. He was then arrested at his army base
last December.
</P>
<P>
Weiz's lawyer argued that Toronto should hand over all testimony
gathered in the case to Israeli authorities before the court could
decide on the demand of extradition.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said Toronto police have deliberately withheld some
affidavits, in which some other suspects are identified as the
killers, including the two who blamed Weiz. Thus, she asserted, her
client was framed.
</P>
<P>
However, State Attorney Irit Kohn said the state does not have
to prove that Weiz is guilty, but only that there is enough
suspicions to warrant the extradition.
</P>
<P>
According to the recently revised extradition law in Israel,
Israeli citizens could be handed over to stand trial in other
countries on condition that they, if found guilty, will serve
sentences in Israel.

<HEADLINE> 30 MILF Rebels Killed in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that at least 30 Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
rebels and five soldiers were killed in fresh fighting in the
southern province of Lanao del Norte over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to armed forces spokesman Col. Rafael Romero,
government troops, backed by bomber planes and helicopters, were
poised to launch their final assault on Camp Bilal, the largest
MILF camp in Lanao del Norte.
</P>
<P>
Renewed fighting erupted between government forces and the MILF
in the towns of Balo-i and Munai last Friday when MILF guerrillas
tried to seize Balo-i, Romero said in a report.
</P>
<P>
"There is a continuous operation to clear up once and for all
the area of lawless elements and also to deny them (MILF) the base
from which they conduct their deprivation of civilians like
extortion and harassment," Romero said.
</P>
<P>
He said the fighting has displaced about 16,000 families but
they are being taken care of by government relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
The gunbattle now entering its fourth day on Monday has claimed
35 lives, including 30 MILF and five soldiers, Romero said, adding
that 18 government troops were wounded in the battle.
</P>
<P>
With the military offensive in full blast, Romero said Camp
Bilal is expected to fall in three days.
</P>
<P>
The military has deployed 2,400 troops to capture the MILF camp.
Two MILF strongholds, Camp Omar and Camp Jon Mac, were earlier
captured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MILF Military Chief Al Haj Murad said the MILF has
warned that it would back out of peace talks if government forces
continue to attack MILF-controlled territories in Lanao del Norte.
</P>
<P>
Murad expressed fears in a radio interview that the talks may
fail before the June deadline set out by Philippine President
Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
The war that broke out in early March this year in Lanao del
Norte has left 200 MILF rebels and scores of government soldiers
dead.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for an independent state in Mindanao
during the past two decades.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Ex-Presidents to be Summoned for Poor Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former heads of state,
including Gen Ibrahim Babangida, Chief Ernest Shonekan, Gen
Abdulsalami Abubakar, and former Central Bank governors may soon
be summoned by the Senate over the poor state of the nation's
accounts.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper on Monday quoted the chairman of Senate
 Committee on Public Accounts, Alhaji Abubakar, as disclosing on
Sunday that the federal government's accounts were "in tatters",
and as a result, billions of naira could not be accounted for.
</P>
<P>
He told The Guardian that the invitation to the former leaders
became imperative because of the huge sums of money involved.
</P>
<P>
He expressed shock at the committee's discovery that accounts
of the various ministries and parastatals had not been audited for
about six years.
</P>
<P>
The poor handling of the accounting system resulted in
increased wastage and embezzlement, particularly between 1992 and
May 29, 1999 when president Olusegun Obasanjo took over, ending
15-year military rule.

<HEADLINE> D.R. Congo, Its Allies Urge U.N. to Deploy Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo (D.
R. Congo) and its allies have appealed to the United Nations to
deploy as soon as possible truce observers to avoid the outbreak
of another large-scale war in the region.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made at a mini-summit held on Sunday at the
headquarters of the Organization of African Unity in the D.R.
Congo's capital of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio Voix du People, the official radio
station of the D.R. Congo, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who
was attending the summit, said that the leaders present hope that
the United Nations will deploy the group of truce observers
immediately.
</P>
<P>
"This is very important, because there is a danger that the
situation will deteriorate. The war risks to resume on a big scale,
" said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Also at the summit were D.R. Congo President Laurent Desire
Kabila, Angolan President Jose Edouardo Dos Santos and Namibian
President Sam Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
The leaders discussed the military and political situation in
the D.R. Congo since a truce agreement was signed in Lusaka in
last July to end the war, which broke out in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
A truce agreement was signed last Saturday in Kampala, Uganda,
between the D.R. Congo government, the rebels and their ally
countries -- Uganda and Rwanda, who decided to cease all actions
of hostility from the mid-night of April 14.
</P>
<P>
The Kampala agreement is seen as aiming apparently at creating
favorable conditions for the deployment of the U.N. mission of
observers.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has agreed to send observers and a 5,000-
strong peacekeeping force to the D.R. Congo to supervise the truce
and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the country.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. has so far delayed the deployment because of lack
of security guarantees for its personnel from the belligerent
sides.
</P>
<P>
The D.R. Congo government forces and the rebels are still
confronting each other on the eastern and northwest borders of the
D.R. Congo.

<HEADLINE> One-China Principle, Prerequisite of Improved Cross-Straits Relations: Magazine (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Acknowledging the one-China
principle is the prerequisite for the improvement and growth of
relations across the Taiwan Straits, says an article in the latest
issue of Cross-Straits Relations Monthly.
</P>
<P>
The magazine's April issue, which went on sale here today,
noted in a by-lined editorial that after the recent elections in
Taiwan, new elements of instability have popped up in the cross-
Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Recently, new leaders in Taiwan have called for better cross-
Straits relations, but they have yet to respond positively to the
one-China principle -- which is crucial for the improvement of
ties, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
"The one-China principle is the basis for the peaceful
reunification and the prerequisite for the stable growth of the
cross-Straits relations," it notes.
</P>
<P>
Upholding the one-China principle is not an issue between the
Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang party, but a question
that will decide whether China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity is split.
</P>
<P>
"The change of leadership in Taiwan can't in any way change the
status of the island as part of China," the magazine stresses.
</P>
<P>
New leaders and other politicians in Taiwan should learn from
the disgraceful end of Lee Teng-hui, who challenged the one-China
principle over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The magazine says that it would be a waste of time to deny the
one-China principle while claiming to hope for relaxed relations
across the Taiwan Straits.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has begun to build a 100-
sq-km forest belt around the city.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yunchang, spokesman for the Beijing Municipal
Afforestation Bureau, said today that the huge afforestation
project, which is to be completed by 2002, may be the biggest of
its kind in the history of afforestation in the world.
</P>
<P>
The forest belt, 40 percent of which has taken shape, is
located between the city's Second Ring Road and Fifth Ring Road.
</P>
<P>
The 100-sq-km forest will help protect Beijing residents from
dusty winds, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The pawpaw, bamboo, metasequoia and gingkgo and other tree
species are selected as the main trees for the belt, he added.
</P>
<P>
As part of the belt, nearly 100 cash orchards and gardens will
be built.
</P>
<P>
Beijing plans to increase its vegetation by 767 ha in its city
proper this year.
</P>
<P>
The central government departments have allocated a total of
about 120 million yuan (about 15 million U.S. dollars) to help
with Beijing's afforestation projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Northern part of north China and
eastern part of northwest China are expected to experience a
moderate to strong northward breeze as a strong cold air current
is moving towards the regions during April 10 - 12, China's
Central Meteorological Observatory said here today.
</P>
<P>
Northern part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is
expected to have a snowfall of one to five mm during the three
days, and the northern part of north China, the central part of
Gansu Province, and the northern part of Qinghai Province will
have overcast weather from Tuesday night to Wednesday, the
observatory said.
</P>
<P>
The eastern part of northwest China is also expected to have a
snowfall of one to five mm with fresh to strong breeze for much of
northwest China and east China during Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said strong northward breeze to fresh gale is expected for
the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea and northern part of the East China
Sea with strong to whole gale for parts of the seas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a strong breeze to moderate gale is forecast for
the central and south part of the East China Sea, the Taiwan
Strait and the northern part of the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weekend, much of northern China to the Yangtze
River experienced a cold air current moving southward with a drop
of up to 16 degrees centigrade in temperatures and dusty wind as a
result of the cold air current hitting part of south China and
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The cold air current will disappear shortly as another one is
moving southward, the observatory said.

The magazine relates that ever since semi-official channels of
communication were formed, all dialogue and negotiations between
the two sides have been based on the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the Taiwan authorities recently stated that
the one-China policy could become a topic of discussion, but would
not be the basis of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"This is a grave regression from the common understanding
reached between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits and the Straits Exchange Foundation," the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
With the upcoming inauguration of Taiwan's new leaders, people
are waiting to see whether the new Taiwan authorities will
continue Lee Teng-hui's splittist approach or recognize the one-
China principle after considering the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens, one thing is clear: the mainland will
never allow any form of Taiwan independence, the magazine says. "
It will never succeed if some people hope to promote separation
under the pretext of 'peace'."
</P>
<P>
The magazine stresses that upholding the one-China principle
has direct bearing on the fundamental interests of the Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that the Taiwan people and its new leaders
should think out," the magazine says.

the one-China principle by admitting that Taiwan is part of China,
and earnestly carry out the "four no's": no declaration of Taiwan
independence, no incorporation of the "two states" remarks into
its constitution, no change of the so-called country's name; and
no referendum on Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they should stop all activities that are
designed to sever the historic, cultural, educational and other
links between Taiwan and the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Only by doing this can the two sides of the Straits hope to
form the basis of essential political trust, and have more room to
develop a peaceful and stable relationship across the Straits,"
the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
The magazine also notes that dialogue and negotiations will
lead to the improvement of cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent elections in Taiwan, top leaders of the
Chinese Communist Party noted that anything can be discussed
between the two sides under the umbrella of the one-China
principle.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects both the firm stance of the one-China policy,
and also the sincerity of the mainland," it says, adding that new

their fingers.

<HEADLINE> Dogs to Patrol Chinese Borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 police dog handlers
from over 10 provinces and regions of China gathered here today to
begin a six-month program on training for border patrol.
</P>
<P>
The officers are expected to bring a large number of police
dogs to be used for patrolling Chinese borders in the fight
against drug and weapons trafficking and other crimes, according
to the Helongjiang Frontiers Defense Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Stepped-up surveillance of border areas is believed to be the
most effective way to control China's drug-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
Formerly only a conduit for international drug-trafficking,
China has fallen victim to the narcotics trade, with more drugs
entering the country each year.
</P>
<P>
Police dogs have been playing an increasingly important role in
detecting drugs and traffickers. And the police trainees in the
new program are mainly from border provinces and regions,
including Guangxi and Yunnan, that are adjacent to the notorious "
Golden Triangle" in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Police Dog Training Base under the Helongjiang Frontier
Defense Bureau is the only police dog training center in China,
and has produced many highly-qualified dogs for police use across
the country.

Traditional Medicine opened here Monday evening.

<P>
More than 85 overseas and local experts are participating in
the four-day WHO meeting jointly organized by the Department of
Health of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and
the Federation of Hong Kong Industries.

center for Chinese medicine, it is an honor for Hong Kong to be
the host city for such an important and authoritative WHO meeting,
" said a spokesman for the Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
Despite the existence of traditional and herbal medicines over
many centuries and the increasing use of such medicines,
regulations and registration of herbal products and other
traditional therapies are not well established.

International standards and criteria for evaluation of safety,
efficacy and quality control for herbal products and remedies are
currently not available. More and more governments are seeking WHO

</P>
<P>
At the meeting, experts from all over the world will review and

finalize the guidelines. This meeting and the guidelines will
facilitate the development of international standards for
traditional medicine in due course. The authoritative guidelines

</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Preliminary data showed that trade balance registered a
surplus amounting to 67.2 billion Yemeni rials (417 million U.S.

rials (800 million dollars).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Joins Bangkok Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China has formally acceded to the
Bangkok Agreement, according to a press release of the United
Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (
ESCAP) Monday.
</P>
<P>
Calling it "an important development," the press release said
China's accession could have a profound impact on regional trade
relations in Asia and the Pacific and possibly in the rest of the
international trading system.
</P>
<P>
M.A. Kamal, chairman of the Standing Committee of the agreement,
announced it at the end of the 16th session of the committee which
met in Bangkok from April 3 to 5.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is significant that China has acceded to
Asia's only regional preferential trading agreement ahead of its
accession to the World Trade Organization, saying this marked the
beginning of a new era for international trade relations in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
China's accession is significant because it marks that country'
s debut into regional trading agreements and is, therefore, an
important milestone in its two-decades long outward-looking policy
orientation, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
"But more significantly, it also means that members of the
agreement will have access on concessional terms to the markets of
two giants of the global economy, China and India, with a combined
population of more than two-and-a-half billion," the press release
noted.
</P>
<P>
China's accession to the agreement will certainly makes
membership of the agreement a worthwhile goal to pursue for many
other countries in the region, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Agreement, signed in 1975 as an initiative of ESCAP,
is a preferential tariff arrangement that aims at promoting intra-
regional trade through exchange of mutually agreed concessions by
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Till now, five countries, Republic of Korea, India, Bangladesh,
Sri Lanka and Lao People's Democratic Republic were signatories to
the agreement. Several other countries have also indicated their
desire to join.
</P>
<P>
So far two rounds of trade negotiations have taken place and a
schedule for the commencement of a third round is being drawn up
by ESCAP, which also functions as the secretariat for the
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Attorney General Fails to Question Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Attorney General's
Office on Monday failed again to question former President
Soeharto on corruption charges due to his bad health condition.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto still has a big trouble in his communication skills,
both spoken and written, an independent medical team set up by the
attorney general's office along with Soeharto's medical team said,
adding that the health condition of the former president is worse
than before.
</P>
<P>
"Before the team of prosecutors of the attorney general's
office launched investigation into Mr. Soeharto, we examined him,
particularly his cardiovascular, neurological and psychiatric
condition. And we concluded that the condition of Mr. Soeharto is
not good enough to face questioning. So we advised the prosecutors
not to launch investigation into him today," head of the
independent medical team, Supardi Sudibyo, told a press conference
at Soeharto's house.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried that if the prosecutors launch investigation,
Soeharto will experience a stroke again for the second time,"
Sudibyo added. He said Soeharto's blood pressure reached 180/90-95
mm/hg.
</P>
<P>
As many as eight prosecutors from the attorney general's office
previously were expected to further question the 79-year-old
former president to collect further information in connection with
his alleged involvement in corruption,collusion and nepotistic
practices during his 32 rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
The team arrived at Soeharto's residence in Central Jakarta at
about 01:00 p.m. (local time) Monday.
</P>
<P>
"After examining Soeharto, the independent medical team and
Soeharto's medical team said that Soeharto can not be questioned.
His blood pressure is still high. The medical team even said that
Soeharto's health condition is worse than before," Munthe, head of
the team, said at the press conference
</P>
<P>
But no details were provided on the health condition of the
former strong man who was forced to step down in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Munthe also declined to answer questions about the policy the
attorney general's office will further take concerning the case.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know, whether or not it (investigation) will be
ceased or continued. We will report today's result to the attorney
general (Marzuki Darusman) and we will wait to see what kind of
step will be taken. Just wait," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Juan Felix Tampubolon, one of the Soeharto
lawyers, said his side is ready to cooperate with the attorney
general's office in connection with investigation into its client.
</P>
<P>
Early in April, prosecutors of the attorney general examined
Soeharto in connection with his alleged involvement in corruption,
collusion and nepotistic practices in social foundations he
chaired when he was still in office.
</P>
<P>
But the investigation was suspended due to the health condition
of Soeharto.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Bring in Low-Priced Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
finalizing negotiations with foreign drug manufacturers to bring
in low-priced quality medicines into the country as part of its
efforts to make life-saving health care available to the poor.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Mar Roxas of the Department of Trade and Industry
said Monday that the government is now in the process of coming up
with a list of widely used brands of drugs which are priced too
high for Filipino consumers so that these could be placed in the
priority list of medicines that would be imported at low prices.
</P>
<P>
"These are the steps that we are doing right now. In my view,
after several months we can actually pass on these low-priced
medicines to consumers," he said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said medicine manufacturers in India were the first to
discuss the possibility of bringing in low-priced medicines into
the country.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who has mobilized the
government machinery to tap ways of pulling down medicine prices,
has noted earlier that medicines in India cost 10 times less than
those sold in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Roxas said that aside from accelerating the process
of bringing in these low-priced medicines into the country, the
government is also making sure that quality control is strictly
observed in the importation of these goods.
</P>
<P>
"The first ones to talk with us were Indian drug companies.
What is important here is not just bringing in these low-priced
medicines, but also taking into account quality control," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said the government is taking this initiative to place"
competitive pressure" on other medicine manufacturers which hold a
virtual monopoly on the retailing and distribution of medicines in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar's Population to Double to 1.6m in 2008 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar's population would
double from 800,000 to reach more than 1.6 million by 2008, a
senior official of the Zanzibar Revolution Government has said.
</P>
<P>
The Principal Secretary in the Ministry of State (Planning and
Investments) Omar Yussuf Mzee warned that the rapid population
growth would worsen unemployment, land scarcity, housing shortage
and environmental destruction.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the draft version of the population policy, Yussuf
told a special committee of the Zanzibar House of Representatives
that the island' s rapid annual population growth of three percent
must be checked.
</P>
<P>
The legislators said that there should be a specific version of
the National population policy to deal with Zanzibar's special
problems from the grassroots to the national levels as well as
their solutions.
</P>
<P>
They argued that such a document would define priorities and
strategies on the population boom which had adverse effect on the
delivery of social services and employment.
</P>
<P>
For example, they pointed out that over 52 percent of
Zanzibar's 800, 000 population are non-productive and there are
great inequalities of life between men and women especially in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The representatives also called for strict measures to check
immigration into the island, saying the government's annual budget
especially in provision of social services is often
over-stretched.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, consisted of the main Unguja island and its sister
island of Pemba with a total area of 2,642 square kilometers in
the western part of the Indian Ocean, lies some 40 kilometers east
of the mainland of Tanzania whose population stands at about 30
million at present.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar and the then Republic of Tanganyika merged in 1964 to
form the United Republic of Tanzania, but it has its own
government dealing with affairs except foreign and defense.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- President Olusegun Obasanjo Sunday

as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Monday quoted

co-operation, globalization and its implication on development,
trade and monetary affairs.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Descent Kidnapped by Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan coffee planter of
Portuguese descent was kidnapped by the Angolan rebels in a recent
attack on the town of Calulo, a relative said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Henrique Chaves Fonseca, 64, and an undetermined number of
other residents were seized by the rebels and forced to serve as
porters for goods sacked by the rebels when their forces withdrew
from Calulo, a strategic town located in the central Kwanza-sul
province, some 230 kilometers southeast to the Angolan capital
Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Since late March, Calulo has been disturbed by the rebels of
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
who occupied the town on March 31 but soon repelled by the
government troops after a counter-offensive, said local analysts.
</P>
<P>
Fonseca, the Angola-born son of Portuguese parents, had been
the target of a previous UNITA attack, when his Kwanza-sul coffee
plantation was raided by the rebels, according to the relative.
</P>
<P>
After the UNITA occupation of Calulo and heavy fighting in a
surprise operation on March 31, thousands of people fled the
region as government forces mounted a successful
counter-offensive.

LUANDA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Guinea-Bissau President Kumba Iala
has appointed a civilian as the country's new defense minister,
with an aim to promote the process of returning the country back
to full civilian rule, local radio station said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iala named Fernando Correia, an engineer, to the post of
defense minister, to replace Lt. Col. Verissimo Correia Seabra,

</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Seabra, who joined the government on February 19, had
recently ceased going to his ministry or attending cabinet
meetings.
</P>
<P>
The move was considered by local analysts as the reflection of
the military's desire for a full return to barracks after its
1998-99 rebellion that deposed President Nino Vieira, after which
the multi party elections were realized in the western African
country.
</P>
<P>
The insurrection's leader, Brigadier Ansumane Mane, has

presidential and legislative balloting at the turn of the year,
the military would fully withdraw from political life.

<HEADLINE> Flexibility Needed for China's WTO Entry Talks: EU Negotiator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The chief European Union trade
negotiator stressed on Monday that flexibility is needed from both
the 15-nation bloc and China to complete the latter's World Trade
Organization entry talks.
</P>
<P>
Pascal Lamy, EU trade commissioner and chief negotiator with
China, told the press that he briefed the EU foreign ministers
during their monthly council meeting about his Beijing trip and
the four-day negotiations that ended without reaching a deal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the foreign ministers believed that it is of
extreme importance to get China into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he, as chief negotiator, felt the pressure
from the pending vote in the United States Congress concerning the
U.S.-China trade deal, Lamy said that the EU is following the
development in the United States closely but will have its own
decision.
</P>
<P>
The EU will not adopt a position which will have to depend on a
yes or no vote in the U.S. congress. "We cannot be dependent on
that," he said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to discuss whether he can be more flexible the next
time he is in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the EU would stick to its position though
flexibility is being considered now.
</P>
<P>
When answering how long it will take to complete China's WTO
accession negotiation, Lamy said, "the sooner the better."
</P>
<P>
It is of mutual interest to have China in the world trade
global arbitrating organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
An EU statement last week described Lamy's negotiations in
Beijing as "a certain narrowing of differences on the outstanding
issues under negotiation."
</P>
<P>
The EU and China have held three rounds of negotiations so far
this year, with the previous two rounds in January and February in
Brussels and Beijing respectively.

The spokesman made such a statement on the media reported

"We have noticed that according to U.S. media reports, the U.S.

According to the spokesman, on March 2, 1993, the China Great
Wall Industry Corporation and Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co.
Ltd. signed a launch services contract by using LM-2E launch
vehicle to launch the Lockheed Martin built AsiaSat-2 satellite
into low earth orbit and a purchase agreement for a perigee kick
motor.
</P>
<P>
The selection of LM-2E launch vehicle to launch AsiaSat-2 by
Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co. Ltd. was based on the fact
that China's space industry has had 40-year's experience in
successfully developing multiple versions of launch vehicles, and
has mastered mature technology on both liquid and solid motors and
manufactured a variety of solid motors of the similar
specifications, he said.

"We hereby responsibly state that China has developed the
satellite perigee kick motor entirely relying on its own efforts.
We have never acquired from Lockheed Martin or other party any
technical assistance in this regard," he said.

WELLINGTON, April 10 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark announced here Monday that her government has decided
to discontinue in future the titles of Sir and Dame in the country
's honors system.
</P>
<P>
In a government statement, the prime minister noted that Knight

Order of New Zealand, but also a large number of other awards
given for an extraordinary variety of services to a wide cross-
section of the community.
</P>
<P>
Noting that New Zealand has its own honors system, Clark said
discontinuing the use of British awards will complete the work in
replacing a mixed honors system with a wholly New Zealand one.
</P>

The decision to discontinue Knight and Damehoods will be put
into effect before the Queen's Birthday honors to be announced on
June 5th, the prime minister said, adding that these changes will
be applied to future recipients only and all current knights and

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Committed to Fighting Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday committed
itself to fighting software piracy with enforced laws.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia's commitment to fighting piracy is incorporated into
our government's bill of guarantees for MSC (Multimedia Super
Corridor) status companies in which we commit ourselves to
becoming the regional leader in intellectual property protection
and cyber laws," Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said
when opening the Asia Software Policy Summit here.
</P>
<P>
The two-day software policy meeting will tackle the issues of
intellectual property protection and software piracy which are
plaguing the region and inhibiting economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Cabinet has recently approved the tabling of the
Optical Disc Act in parliament which will strengthen and
complement existing legislation such as the Copyright Act in the
protection of intellectual property, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed act will impose stiffer punishment on violators of
intellectual property and will give the relevant authorities
greater regulatory powers such as confiscating equipment used to
manufacture pirated goods, he added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said the Malaysian government is
continuously looking at ways to strengthen intellectual property
laws to eradicate piracy.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that legislation alone is not sufficient in
combating piracy, therefore, national strategies to combat piracy
must focus on enforcement.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, he said, a special copyright task force was set up
in March 1999 to strengthen the efforts to combat piracy.
</P>
<P>
The efficacy of the task force has been encouraging, he said,
adding from April 1999 to end-March 2000, the task force checked
more than 12,000 premises for pirated software, music CDs and
video CDs and its activities had resulted in 3,178 cases of piracy
and seizures of pirated goods worth 8 million ringgit (2.1 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian government fully recognizes and supports
the need for strong intellectual property protection of software
to ensure a strong and vibrant software industry.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Common Efforts Lead to Inter-Korean Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
will travel to Pyongyang in June for a historic summit with Kim
Jong Il, top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK), the first-ever between the two sides since the Korean War
in the early 1950s, both Seoul and Pyongyang announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The long-delayed summit, which is widely expected to be a
turning point in the inter-Korean ties, was a result of common
efforts made in recent years by the two sides to promote
reconciliation and peace on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and South Korea had agreed to hold a summit in July
1994 between the then DPRK President Kim Il Sung and his South
Korean counterpart Kim Young-sam. But the scheduled meeting was
canceled due to the sudden death of Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
After six years, the two sides reached the agreement to resume
the summit during a meeting in Beijing last Saturday between South
Korean Culture and Tourism Minister Park Jie-won and Song Ho Gyong,
vice chairman of the DPRK's Asia-Pacific Peace Committee.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the announcement of the news, Kim Dae-jung said the
summit may serve as an opportunity for national prosperity and
development and bring hope for the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Since President Kim Dae-jung was inaugurated in February 1998,
South Korea has provided food, fertilizers and other humanitarian
assistance to the DPRK, which has been in economic trouble because
of natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
On March 9 this year, Kim Dae-jung proposed in Berlin, Germany,
that South Korea give more economic aid to the DPRK based on inter-
Korean direct dialogue.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the DPRK has made untiring efforts to promote
dialogue between the governments of the two sides and between the
two peoples, and continued contact with the South Korean
government during recent years.
</P>
<P>
In February 1999, the DPRK government, in an open letter to the
South Korean authorities and all political parties in the country,
proposed that the year 1999 be set as a year for enhancing
national reconciliation and unity. It also proposed wide-ranging
dialogue between the two sides including that between the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held two vice ministerial meetings in Beijing in
April 1998 and in June 1999 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming summit, the first of its kind since the
governments of the two sides were established in 1948, will give
the two leaders a historic chance to discuss matters on the cause
of peaceful coexistence on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
They are believed to focus their talks on economic cooperation,
humanitarian assistance, reunion of separated families, stability
and peace on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The summit, if realized, will surely pave the way for South
Korea to help the DPRK build electric power system, roads and
other infrastructure, and impose a positive impact on negotiations
on improving ties between the DPRK and the United States and other
western states.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said the summit will not produce results
easily due to the deeply-rooted mutual distrust even though the
strong political will of the two leaders will likely allow the
summit to go ahead as scheduled under widespread international
expectations.

priority, said he had withdrawn from the marathon as a
precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
Brown, who has been carrying a hip injury since winning a
bronze medal when leading Great Britain to team victory for the
first time in last December's European Cross Country Championships,
plans to return to full-time training in a few weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
He was fourth in last year's London Marathon with a personal
best time of two hours nine minutes and 44 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Sheffield star has been receiving intensive treatment from
UK Athletics physiotherapist Neil Black.
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday the 29-year-old realised he had lost his race
against the clock. He said: "After having treatment the injury is
not so serious. But if I was to run I would want to be at my most
competitive. At the moment I am not - so my London plans will have
to wait for another year."
</P>
<P>
Brown missed the recent World Cross Country Championships to
concentrate totally on the London Marathon.
</P>
<P>
He added: "Of course I'm disappointed at missing the race after
all the preparations I have put in. But with the injury there
would always have been a risk factor - one I wasn't prepared to
take."
</P>
<P>
Already pre-selected for September's Sydney Games, the British
10,000m record holder added: "The Olympic Games are more important
than anything else this year. I do not plan to run another
marathon beforehand but now intend to do a few track races to
maintain my racing edge."
</P>
<P>
Brown, who has been based in Vancouver for the past couple of
years, arrived in London three weeks ago hoping treatment from
Black would give him a quick cure.
</P>
<P>
Now he intends returning to Canada as soon as his physiotherapy
treatment is concluded.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Seeks Symbolic Olympic Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- East Timor has urged Olympic
officials to allow it to send a delegation to the opening and
closing Sydney Olympic ceremonies, Australian media reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said East Timorese independence leader Jose Ramos-
Horta had asked Australian Prime Minister John Howard to lobby
Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
Ramos-Horta argued that inclusion in the Olympics would be a
great psychological boost for his nation of 800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"If we can have a symbolic presence in the Games the whole
world will be able to see the new East Timor as a symbol of
tolerance, peace and reconciliation," Ramos-Horta was quoted as
saying by The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-administered territory is making its first tentative
steps towards independence after 400 years of foreign occupation.
</P>
<P>
But International Olympic Committee vice-president Kevan Gosper
said East Timor would not be able to attend Olympic events until
it formally became independent. He said it also had to be a member
of at least five international sporting bodies.

<HEADLINE> China Demands Satisfactory Explanation on Bombing of Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government strongly
demands that the U.S. Government conduct a comprehensive and
thorough investigation into its bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia, bring the perpetrators to justice and give the Chinese
Government and people a satisfactory explanation, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
On April 8, the U.S. Government informed the Chinese
Government of the results of the accountability review concerning
the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia on May 8, last year, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The United States only admitted that the U.S. side used an
inappropriate methodology to locate the target and that the review
process at every level failed to find the mistake, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side informed the Chinese side that it had sanctioned
eight CIA officers involved, with one of them fired, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"It must be pointed out that the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia
has unmistakable symbols and it is also clearly marked on the U.S.
maps. The U.S. claim that it did not know its exact location is
not justified," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Directory of Supply and Procurement is not a secret
agency and its building is half a kilometer away from the Chinese
Embassy, Zhu said. The two buildings look totally different. "So
it was impossible for the U.S. side to mix up these two buildings,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. explanation, several individuals all
neglected their duties and its review process failed to detect the
mistake at every level, Zhu said. "This is hard for people to
believe."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side once again stresses that the U.S. bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia caused a
heavy casualty and severe damages to the embassy premises. In
committing this act, the U.S. side seriously violated the relevant
international conventions and basic norms governing international
relations, infringed gravely on China's sovereignty, greatly hurt
the dignity of the Chinese people and severely damaged Sino-U.S.
relations," he said. "This was an extremely serious international
unlawful act."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government strongly demands that the U.S.
Government conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation into
its bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, bring the
perpetrators to justice and give the Chinese Government and people
a satisfactory explanation," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Releases Another 500 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday night released
another batch of 500 Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) left over from
the 1980-88 bloody war between the two neighbors, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Qasr-e Shirin of the western Kermanshah province
Asfandiar Zakeri said that the group of Iraqi POWs left Iran
through the Khosravi border point in the province at a ceremony
attended by officials from the two countries and representative of
the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
It was the second group of Iran's unilateral release of 2,000
Iraqi POWs, and the first group of 500 Iraqi POWs left Iran on
Sunday morning. The other 1,000 POWs are scheduled to be released
in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced on Wednesday to unilaterally release 2,000 Iraqi
POWs in a bid to solve the POW issue with Iraq, one of the major
hurdles on the way of normalization of Tehran-Baghdad ties.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials expressed hope that Baghdad would respond to
Tehran's "goodwill gesture" by helping to determine the fate of
Iranian POWs and those missing in action.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein recently accused Iran of
torturing and murdering Iraqi POWs by using methods "worse than the
Nazis during the World War II." Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi soon refuted the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that it had released 55,438 Iraqi POWs since 1981 on
103 occasions while Iraq freed 39,417 Iranian POWs in the same
period on 70 occasions.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed last month that Iraq still holds 2,800 Iranians
according to available documents, but Iraq claimed that it has
repatriated all Iranian POWs and the 64 Iranians still being held
are "criminals" who were arrested after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that around 13,000 Iraqi POWs remain imprisoned in
Iran. But Iran refused to confirm how many Iraqi POWs are still
held in the country.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rules out Disarming Palestinian Refugees in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has
ruled out disarming Palestinian refugees in Lebanon as part of an
Israeli withdrawal from the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian presence in Lebanon is wholly legitimate
according to principles laid down at the Arab summit in Cairo in
1970," Arafat told Egyptian reporters on Sunday after meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was "indignant" at the suggestion that Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon might be disarmed, Egypt's Al-ahram daily
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud filed a memorandum last week
with the United Nations, asking if a multi-national force would be
willing to disarm Palestinian refugees as part of an agreement on
an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has pledged a unilateral withdrawal from southern Lebanon
it has occupied for 22 years, even in the absence of a peace accord
with Syria, which exerts key influence on Lebanon with some 35,000
troops there.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- On the eve of his departure for the United States for a
summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak Sunday laid out his vision of a future Palestinian
entity.
</P>
<P>
He said that while some Jewish settlements near Jerusalem will
be part of a united Jerusalem in the future, there is "no interest"
in annexing the approximately 50,000 Palestinians living in
villages on the capital's outskirts, such as Abu Dis and Anata.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the cabinet Sunday that most areas designated as Area
B - under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control -
will, under a permanent-status agreement, be transferred to full
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A decision by Israel's High Court which enables an Arab
family to buy a house in a Jewish settlement has prompted the
government to consider dramatic expansion of housing opportunities
in Arab villages, and for the first time in the state's history,
the establishment of a new town for Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Except for some towns established for Bedouin in the Negev, no
new Arab cities have been established in Israel since its founding.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Syria has toughened its position in its official reply to
proposals made by U.S. President Clinton in his March 26 meeting
with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, according to well-informed
sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Syria is demanding a total Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights to the lines of June 4, 1967, Syrian
sovereignty on the shore of the Kinneret, and the right to part of
the lake.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Damascus is adamantly opposed to an early-warning
station on Mount Hermon after a withdrawal, and will begin
normalization with Israel only after the evacuation of the Golan is
completed.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas Sunday fired a mortar shell
that struck Moshav Margaliot on the Lebanese border, damaging the
community's chicken coops but hurting nobody.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces suggested that the targeting of
Margaliot was not an accident but was intended to intensify the
internal debate within Israel over the withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The IDF says the past two weeks have seen a 20 percent leap in
the scale of fighting in south Lebanon, a sign that Hezbollah wants
to show the world that it is the guerrillas that force Israeli
soldiers out of Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformers Seek Post of Majlis Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian reformers are trying to
seize the post of Majlis (parliament) speaker after they won a
landslide victory over their conservative opponents in the sixth
parliamentary elections in February.
</P>
<P>
The May 23 Front, an alliance which groups 18 reformist parties,
is currently busy finalizing the list of its members of the
presiding board of the new parliament, including naming a candidate
for the post of speaker, the conservative daily Tehran Times
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an informed source, the report said that Behzad Nabavi,
spokesman of the reformist alliance, is under mounting appeal to
accept the post of Majlis speaker.
</P>
<P>
Nabavi is a leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Mujaheddin
Organization, one of the major parties in the reformist May 23
Front, which was formed to mark the victory of reformist President
Mohammad Khatami in the 1997 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
He served as government spokesman under former Prime Minister
Mir-Hossein Musavi in the 1980s and was minister of heavy industry
in former President Hashemi Rafsanjani's government.
</P>
<P>
If Nabavi took the post of speaker, he would be the first non-
cleric head of the parliament in Iran's post-revolution history.
</P>
<P>
According to an unnamed source, however, Nabavi insists that the
post of speaker should be filled by center-rightist Rafsanjani, who
entered the parliament but ranked the last in Tehran's list of 30
winners.
</P>
<P>
But Rafsanjani has declined to accept the post, as he prefers to
keep his post as chairman of the advisory and arbitrary State
Expediency Council, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Not all members of the May 23 Front agree with Nabavi's
speakership, the daily said, adding the Party of Constructive
Executives of Iran (PCEI), a centrist party which was inside the
front but close to Rafsanjani, is trying to find another candidate
for the post.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper did not disclose the name of the possible
candidate of the PCEI.
</P>
<P>
Another source told the paper that former mayor of Tehran
Gholamhussein Karbaschi, PCEI secretary general, recently met with
former Majlis Speaker Mehdi Karrubi and urged him to accept the
post of deputy speaker in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
But Karrubi, secretary general of the Society of Combatant
Clergymen in Tehran, snubbed Karbaschi and turned down his
suggestion, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The May 23 Front, which bagged 189 seats out of 226 decided in
the first round of the February elections, has not announced its
candidate for the future Majlis speaker.
</P>
<P>
A run-off is to be held later this month to decide the winner of
the remaining 64 seats in the expanded 290-seat parliament.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Urges Mine Clearance by Countries Responsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League has urged the
countries which sowed mines on Arab land to take responsibility for
the deadly legacy of past wars.
</P>
<P>
"The size of the problem in the Arab world is due to a lack of
maps and information about mine fields," the league's secretary-
general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, said on Sunday in a speech read on his
behalf to an Arab regional symposium on land mines.
</P>
<P>
Two-fifths of the world's land mines were scattered on Arab
soil, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
He called for pressure on the countries that planted the mines,
as well as the United Nations and human rights organizations, to
solve the problem which has been impeding Arab development.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Issa, director of Egypt's National Center for Middle East
Studies, which organized the symposium, said Egypt alone has 19.7
million mines laid by Britain, Germany and Italy in the Western
Desert during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Issa said 8,313 people were killed by mines spreading over 287,
000 hectares of Egyptian territory.
</P>
<P>
"The armed forces have only been able to remove 2.9 million
mines from 38,730 hectares of land," Issa said, adding that
clearing a single mine could cost 300 to 1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has called on Britain, Germany and Italy to provide fund,
maps of mine fields and equipment for mine clearance. It sees the
aid offered by the three countries as meager.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also suffers from land mines and unexploded bombs left in
the Sinai Desert from its wars with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The final declaration of the first Africa-Europe summit held in
Cairo last week called for removal of existing mines, calling on
the states that had laid mines to provide money and know-how to
clear them and rehabilitate their victims.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. team visited Egypt in February to assess the land mine
problem, but has yet to release its findings.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Forest Coverage Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's forest acreage in 1999
showed an increase of 1.5 million hectare (ha) compared with the
1995's figure, including 1.2 million ha of natural forests,
Vietnam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam had a total of 10.9 million ha of forests by the end of
1999, hence a forest coverage of 33.3 percent, according to the
country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD).
</P>
<P>
The MARD's estimates were made on the basis of the reports by
46 of the country's 58 provinces having forests.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, as many as 9.5 million ha are natural forests,
while 1.4 million ha are planted ones, not counting the areas
grown with scattered trees and industrial trees.
</P>
<P>
The four Central Highlands provinces of the country topped the
list with 2.99 million ha of forests, followed by the northeastern
provinces with 2.33 million ha.
</P>
<P>
The regions which recorded high increases in afforestation in
the past five years included the northeastern region (up 689,240
ha), the northwestern region (up 403,429 ha), the mid-central
region (up 257,937 ha), and the northern central region (up 161,
850 ha).
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is carrying out a program to plant five million ha of
forests by the year 2010, raising forest coverage to 43 percent.
The country plans to grow 200,000 ha of concentrated forests this
year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Development Should Be Culture-Based: TRF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Industrial development in
Thailand should be based on the country's precious cultures, a
report released by the Thailand Research Fund (TRF) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the industrial sector has played an
increasing role in Thailand's modern development since the country
launched its First National Economic and Social Development Plan
in 1961, with its contribution to the economic growth rising to 33.
7 percent of the gross domestic products (GDP) in 1998, from 15.8
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, it argued that due to rapidly-changing situations of
globalization, Thailand's industrial development could not rely
only on capital and technology-intensive industries under the
trade liberalization framework, in which developed nations have
always had comparative advantages over developing countries, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The industries should be based on the strength of traditional
Thai cultures, arts, and people's wisdom, proficiency and
lifestyles, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The unique Thai cultural assets should be transformed into the
production of Thai-branded products, namely, various types and
styles of handicrafts, and gem and jewelry, as well as the
development of Thai tourism and related industries, reflecting the
recognized Thai characteristics of generosity and artistic talents,
it suggested.
</P>
<P>
These industries were seen to be able to compete with developed
countries and could bring in substantial revenues to the country,
it stated.
</P>
<P>
But the report said that modern technologies were needed to the
development of the industries to help upgrade production processes
and quality of the culture-based products.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Open Up Local Law Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will soon open up its
local law firms so as to provide them an opportunity to join the
ranks of international firms to become global legal service
providers, Singapore Chief Justice Yong Pung How told a law
conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Legal Profession (Amendment) was before Parliament. It allows
joint ventures and formal alliances between Singapore and offshore
law firms and the corporatization of law firms," the chief justice
said when addressing the opening of the Singapore Law Conference
under the theme "Leading the Law and Lawyers into the New
Millennium."
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference organized by the Singapore Academy of
Law is attended by some 500 participants including over 80 foreign
delegates from 19 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"Such joint ventures between onshore and offshore firms will
enable the former to gain considerably in terms of knowledge and
skill, and in the development of legal databases, technology and
management know-how," Yong said
</P>
<P>
"We must be able to offer something more to entice foreigners
to use our legal system and our lawyers," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that new laws are continually promulgated and current
legislation revisited and revamped in order to keep abreast of
modern developments and to ensure that they meet with
international standards, Yong underlined that this is especially
pertinent given the explosion of developments and issues in
intellectual property, information technology, e-commerce and
trans-border commercial crimes.
</P>
<P>
Referring to initiatives adopted within Singapore's judiciary
to meet the new challenges, Yong cited the speed-up of the trial
process and quick disposal of cases which allows a civil suit now
be heard in a mere six months from the date of commencement of the
action and the reorganization of sources which can offer more
diversified services such as night courts and court dispute
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The court dispute resolution, introduced by the Subordinate
Courts last year as the Court Dispute Resolution-International
Regime, is a form of co-mediation conducted by local judicial
officers together with judges from other common law jurisdictions
through settlement conference using video conferencing facilities.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's legal system belongs to the English common law
family. The judicial power in Singapore is vested in the Supreme
Court and in the Subordinate Courts and an Attorney-General is
appointed by the President on advice of the Prime Minister to act
as the principal legal adviser to the government. The ministry of
law has the mission to ensure legal infrastructure and to optimize
the allocation of the nation's land resources.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A meeting on software policy
opened here Monday with the aim of identifying positive government
policies and practices to expand the overall size of the software
industry and increase Asia-Pacific participation in that growth.

kind in the region, will address software asset management,
intellectual property protection, the role of a strong and vibrant
software industry and e-commerce policies impacting the industry.

software industry lost about 3 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 to
piracy which also directly impacted on tax revenues and employment
rates.

<P>
Participants from Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand,
India, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, Belgium and the United States to
the summit are to jointly formulate an action agenda to reduce
piracy in the region, the organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police to Quell Political Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean police have taken new
measures to quell political violence that has so far claimed three
lives and left about 100 people injured since January this year,
The Herald newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police Spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena said on
Sunday that police had introduced patrols in most areas ahead of
parliamentary elections scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
The police is mounting roadblocks in search of weapons that
might be used in political violence.
</P>
<P>
He said although the force would spare no effort in dealing
with political violence, it still had its limitations.
</P>
<P>
"It still remains the responsibility of the political
leadership to encourage their supporters to carry out their
activities in a peaceful manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the police's role would mainly be reactive due to
 limitations in anticipating the outbreaks of violence.
</P>
<P>
However, the force was fully prepared and equipped to deal with
any eventualities arising from political violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Election campaigns have so far been characterized by violent
clashes, mainly between the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front and the opposition Movement for Democratic
Change supporters.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Boost Tea Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will increase green tea
leaf production from current 640,000 tons to one million tons
annually within next five years, the Kenya Tea Development
Authority has said.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Richard Cheruiyot made the announcement over
the weekend, saying his authority will change to a marketing
agency by July 1, the East African Standard newspaper said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cheruiyot said the restructuring of the authority and
liberalization of the tea sector before his agency is eventually
put under privatization is tailored to benefit the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Just two days ago, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said his
government had de-linked itself from the tea sector, leaving the
sector to farmers to manage their own affairs and have the
controlling voice in the management of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is one of the world's largest black tea suppliers and
last year it exported more than 241,000 tons of tea, accounting
for about a quarter of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
The tea sector employs over two million people across the country.

<P>
LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has started
negotiations with the concerned authorities of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo to seek the release of 30 villagers abducted
from Northwestern province by suspected Congolese armed people
last week.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dar Listed as the Most Costly City for Business in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Dar es Salaam is said to be
the most costly city for business people in East Africa due to
high charges levied by the City Commission, the African newspaper
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey recently conducted by a committee jointly
formed by the Dar es Salaam Regional Chapter of the Tanzania
Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (TCCIA) and the Dar
es Salaam Merchants' Chamber, Dar es Salaam is found to be the
most costly city for doing business in comparison with the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which was formed about four months ago to review
all costs incurred by businessmen in the city, did a comparative
study of costs in Nairobi, Kampala, Harare and Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
In Dar es Salaam, a businessman is charged 300 Tanzanian
shillings (about 0.375 U.S. dollar) per hour, while his
counterpart in Nairobi is paying the equivalent of 50 Tanzanian
shillings (about 0.0625 U.S. dollar), the TCCIA President Elvis
Musiba was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam City Commission also demands high over the
cost of advertising banners, health inspection and other services.
All these costs add up to the cost of production, said Musiba,
noting that local businessmen are finding it hard to compete in
the East African market.
</P>
<P>
The committee will hold talks with the City Commission and
advise it on reasonable charges to be levied on businessmen for
various services, he added.

<P>
TOKYO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed sharply higher
in Tokyo Monday, led mainly by high-priced information and
technology issues.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 366.25 points, or 1.81
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 20,619.06.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, surged 39.12 points, or 2.33 percent, to 1,
716.74.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 519.81 million
shares from last Friday's 585.33 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi was the day's volume leader.

After opening the Nikkei rose steadily as rebounds in
information and high-tech issues, combined with Friday's jump in
New York's technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, improved
market sentiment, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The yen's stabilization against the U.S. dollar was another
factor making investors in Tokyo confident about buying stocks,
traders said.

Automakers, brokerage houses, chemical firms and retailers also
saw large gains, while air and marine transportation firms,
electric power and gas companies and drug makers were among the
losers.

bilateral relations after the recent presidential elections in
Russia.

The general affairs council usually lasts two full days.

ones and the coming EU-Russia summit scheduled for May 17 in
Moscow.

High Representative Javier Solana will brief the foreign ministers

<P>
PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The French Academy on Monday
expressed its deep regret over the degradation of the teaching of
French literature in public schools over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Academy said that over the past two decades,
the classes on literature in French schools have been reduced "to
the point of almost completely eliminating our teaching of the
knowledge and taste of literature."
</P>
<P>
They blamed the government of abolishing the teaching of the
ancient languages like Latin and Greek in public schools, which
they said are essential for understanding the French.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the language and literature themselves seem to have
become the enemies who destroy our culture," they said.
</P>
<P>
The Academicians also said that the principle of equality in
education can no longer help strengthen the teaching of literature
in France, because the overall teaching standard is falling.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: East-West Seeks Win-Win Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The five-day Investment and Trade
Fair for Cooperation Between East and West China closed on Sunday,
clinching contracts worth 100 billion yuan (12 billion U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fair was jointly organized by four central government
departments and governments from 19 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The combined value of contracts and investment signed at the
fair was 2.5 times more than the previous session. Over 60 percent
of the contracts were infrastructure, high-tech and tourism
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Jia Zhibang, vice-governor of Shaanxi Province, described the
fair as a win-win cooperation between east and west China under
the strategy of accelerating economic development in western China.
</P>
<P>
Provinces in east China have a wealth of experience in
acquiring market information and commercialization of scientific
achievements while their western partners enjoy rich natural
resources. Cooperation will lead to a leap in western China and a
sustained economic growth in east China.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between east and west China has shifted its focus
from exploiting resources to developing technology, information,
education, tourism and real estate. There has also been a shift
from government-organized to market-oriented economic activities
involving participation of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Businesses in Beijing and Tianjin and Guangdong Province have
signed contracts with their western partners in coal, gas, power,
medicine and agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese economist said, "Development of western China is of
strategic importance. It brings hope to the west and opportunity
to the east. The win-win principle is the basis for east-west
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Interest Tax Growth Reported In East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
one of China's leading economic giants, collected 96 million yuan
(11.6 million US dollars) in interest taxes in March, a big leap
from 41 million yuan in February and 17 million yuan in January.
</P>
<P>
The growth in interest taxes is due to local people's
preference for saving money in banks rather than to invest and
spend. The introduction of interest tax is aimed to increase the
locals' initiatives to spending instead of saving their money.
</P>
<P>
By the end of February, savings and deposits in Jiangsu
Province had topped 441 billion yuan (53.1 billion US dollars), a
10.7 percent rise on a yearly basis.

<HEADLINE> Quality Stressed in Sino-Russian Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A series of effective measures
have been taken to ensure the safety of the Sino-Russian Tianwan
Nuclear Power Station under construction in Lianyungang, a famous
coastal city in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 Chinese nuclear specialists have been sent to
Russia to supervise the manufacture of the equipment while a team
of Russian experts are stationed in Lianyungang providing
technical guidance, according to Ouyang Yu, chief engineer of the
Jiangsu Nuclear Power Co., Ltd..
</P>
<P>
Ministerial officials from both sides meet every three months
to coordinate the construction of the nuclear power station, said
Ouyang, who is also an academician scholar with the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The station has prevented severe accidents and in terms of
safety standards will be comparable to all other Chinese nuclear
power stations now in operation or under construction," Ouyang
said.
</P>
<P>
The new station, the largest cooperative project between the
two countries, is designed in strict compliance with the latest
safety regulations and norms from the International Atomic Energy
Agency and also takes into account the experience of Russia and
other Western countries in building and operating nuclear power
stations.
</P>
<P>
Key technology used for it has been modeled after that nuclear
power stations built in Russia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Ouyang, the new station will have four Russia-made
pressurized water reactors installed, each with a generating
capacity of one million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
These pressurized water reactors will have four safety backup
systems, as compared with two at other nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
Siemens digital instrumentation and control systems, believed
to be the most advanced in the world, will be adopted to ensure
the sound, smooth operation of the nuclear station.

<HEADLINE> China's Power Transmission Strategy Paying Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's strategy of transmitting
electricity from resource-rich western China to power-shortage
coastal areas has achieved initial results.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Yunnan Province transmitted 3.7 billion kwh
of electricity to south China's Guangdong Province and Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region in the 1993-1999 period.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has a power generating capacity of 90 million kw,
ranking second in the country. The eight stair hydro-electric
power stations on Lancang River generate 73 billion kwh of
electricity each year, rated as one of the 12 leading hydro-
electric power bases in China.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of Manwan Power Station with an installed
capacity of 1.25 million kw is completed. The first generating
unit of Dachaoshan Power Station, with an installed capacity of 1.
35 million kw, is expected to generate electricity next year.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, transmission of every kw of electricity
from Yunnan to Guangdong can save 1,120 yuan compared with using
electricity generated in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong consumed 107 billion kwh of electricity last year.
Four billion kwh were imported from Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Zhiqiang, general manager of Yunnan Provincial Power Group,
said the province is able to transmit 1 million kw of electricity
to south China in each flood season by 2005. Its annual
transmission capacity will be tripled by 2017.
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing electricity domestically, Yunnan will
provide Thailand with 3 million kw of electricity a year from 2017,
according to an agreement signed recently between the governments
of China and Thailand.

YANGON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported a total of 63,700
tons of rice in 1999, a drop of 42.97 percent compared with 1998
when it registered 111,700 tons, according to the latest figures

<P>
Due to population growth at high rate, the demand for food
continuously increases.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar's rice export has been at a trend of
down-sliding. To meet the daily increasing food demand, Myanmar
has, since January 1999, leased out 400,000 hectares of vacant and
virgin lands for cultivation to private entrepreneurs, and
introduced policies of privilege including exempting the import
duties on agricultural implements.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's cultivable land
covers 18.22 million hectares, of which 9.31 million hectares have
been utilized with 8.91 million hectares remaining to be reclaimed.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Take Move to Discourage Food Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi government is
contemplating measures to discourage imports of foodstuffs,
specially cereals, considering the bumper production of rice in
the country during the last three years, The New Nation reported
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government would soon implement several measures to
decrease food imports with the objectives of saving foreign
exchange and protecting the interest of local farmers, the report
said, adding that the fiscal measures for checking import of rice
may be strengthened and duty on imports of cereals may be further
increased.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the government withdrew all duties on import of
rice during the post-flood period of 1998 in order to encourage
and facilitate procurement of foodstuffs through private sector.
</P>
<P>
The present food stock position, however, is satisfactory, and
with the bumper production of rice in the current situation, the
food supply position would further improve.
</P>
<P>
In such a situation, inflow of huge imported rice and wheat may
deprive farmers of reasonable price of their produces and increase
expenditure of foreign exchange unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
As prices of rice and wheat in the international market have
declined significantly this year, import of rice at lower costs
may adversely affect local production and also returns to farmers,
experts said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Not to Phase Out Tariffs As Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
announced here Monday that it will freeze all tariffs at current
levels until at lease July 1, 2005.
</P>
<P>
Acting Minister of Commerce Trevor Mallard said in a statement
that tariff reductions planned by the previous government with the
National Party as its ruling party will not go ahead and the new
New Zealand government formed jointly by the Labor Party and the
Alliance in last December will be moving urgently to repeal the
Tariff(Zero Duty) Amendment ACT 1998, which the previous
government implemented to phase out all tariffs by July 1, 2006.
</P>
<P>
"The coalition government has made it clear that New Zealand
will no longer be removing tariffs on a strictly unilateral basis,
"Mallard said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see any point in New Zealand leading the world in
this way. We will consider tariff changes where there are clear
benefits to New Zealand," he added.
</P>
<P>
This new policy direction, Mallard noted, is "an important part
of our intention to assist industry development and employment in
New Zealand."

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Tap China's Help in Food Security Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- As part of the efforts to ensure
food security for the Filipinos, President Joseph Estrada plans to
tap China's assistance in modernizing the country's agricultural
system when he visits Beijing this May.
</P>
<P>
The president noted Monday that China's expertise has already
proved valuable in introducing the use of hybrid rice seeds to
Filipino farmers.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in a statement he hopes to expand agricultural
cooperation between his country and China during his visit to
Beijing next month.
</P>
<P>
"I'll go to China in May to ask for aid in agriculture. Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji promised to give us help in that area when he
visited us last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the Philippines last November, Zhu proposed
the setting up of a Chinese-Philippine Agriculture Center to mark
the 25th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has ordered agriculture and local government officials
to encourage farmers to use hybrid rice seeds developed in China.
</P>
<P>
"This new Chinese technology will be a big help to our farmers.
Their income will almost double when they use these seeds," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed the need for farmers to use new
farming technologies to maximize their productivity.
</P>
<P>
Estrada noted that the Enhanced Rice Action Program (Erap) and
Erap Seed Program, which use these Chinese hybrid seeds, aim to
double the present national average of 2.9 metric tons per hectare
with the planting of hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
The use of these hybrid seeds, the president believed, would
also help him realize his vision of making the country self-
sufficient in rice by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Wants Speedy Deployment of U.N. Observers in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
has said the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its
allies would like to see a speedy deployment of United Nations
observers in the DRC to ensure that peace prevail in the giant
central African country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the presidents from the DRC, Zimbabwe, Namibia
and Angola held a closed-door consultation to review the DRC peace
process in Kinshasa on Sunday, Mugabe said the U.N. force should
be deployed as soon as possible to prevent resumption of war,
according to a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We all hope that the U.N. is going to dispatch the observer
group as soon as possible and that is absolutely important because
without that group and without the part of the U.N. there is a
danger that the situation will be reversed to that point where we
started, that is the war will once again be resumed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council endorsed on February 24 the
deployment of 500 military observers and 5,000 military personnel
to protect them in the DRC to oversee the ceasefire agreement
signed in Lusaka last July and August by all warring parties in
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola sent troops to support DRC
president Laurent Kabila to defend the rebels backed by Uganda and
Rwanda forces.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Mugabe and his delegation were expected to
proceed to France en route to Cuba for the G77 Summit.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Allows War Crimes Tribunal to Probe Alleged Mass Grave Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian government Sunday
okayed an investigation by international war crimes tribunal
experts into an alleged mass grave site suspected of containing
the bodies of ethnic Serbs killed by Croatian troops during the
1991-1995 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the government's information office said that
the decision was made on the basis of international commitments
Croatia shoulders, related laws on cooperation with the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands,
and other important norms, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the government fixed conditions with the U.N-
sponsored tribunal for its investigations into the possible mass
grave site located in the region of Gospic, about 100 kilometers
southwest of the capital Zagreb, so that Croatia's sovereignty and
legal system can be fully respected.
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the Bosnian war, Croatian troops staged in
Gospic, a Serb-populated region in the former Yugoslav republic, a
storm operation, executing reportedly dozens of Serb civilians and
dumping them in a pit.
</P>
<P>
Since last year the international war crimes court has demanded
participation in digging the site and cooperation from the
Croatian government, including presenting related archives.
</P>
<P>
The death in December 1999 of President Franjo Tudjman, who had
refused to admit that Croats were involved in war crimes, and the
fall of his nationalist party in January elections paved the way
for better cooperation with the tribunal.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean-DPRK Summit Chance for Prosperity: Kim Dae-jung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
said Monday that the summit with Kim Jong Il, top leader of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), in June may serve as
an opportunity for national prosperity and development and bring
hope for the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot withhold my shock over the rapid progress of inter-
Korean relations with the agreement on inter-Korean summit in June,
although we have prepared for improvement in such relations,"
South Korean presidential spokesman Park Joon-young quoted Kim as
saying at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
President Kim will specify his position on the summit at a
cabinet meeting late Monday.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman said the summit will help both sides
to overcome national division and proceed with a new leap in
national development.
</P>
<P>
"A major change will come in the path of our nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached by the two sides on Saturday
in Beijing, China, Kim Dae-jung will travel to Pyongyang from June
12 to 14 for a historic summit with Kim Jong Il, both Seoul and
Pyongyang announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was aimed at accelerating national reconciliation
and unity, exchange and cooperation, peace and reunification, the
DPRK's state KCNA news agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It said the summit was requested by Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in Beijing during a meeting between
South Korean Culture and Tourism Minister Park Jie-won and Song Ho-
gyong, vice chairman of the DPRK's Asia-Pacific Peace Committee,
Seoul said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first-ever summit between the two sides since
the Korean War in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides will have a preliminary
contact to make arrangements for the summit.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for Kim Dae-jung dismissed the claim by
opposition parties that the government announced the summit to
score political points in Thursday's general elections.
</P>
<P>
"We expected that the announcement could be made in May or June
at the earliest but the announcement was made earlier than
expected because the DPRK suddenly delivered its willingness to
agree to the summit meeting," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 firefighters are still
battling a fierce blaze in Toronto after a series of explosions
rocked a chemical plant Sunday afternoon in the city's east.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports of casualties, but authorities
warned that further explosions are possible as the fire is
engulfing the plant containing tanks of flammable liquids.
</P>
<P>
CTV television quoted a firefighter as saying that they had
difficulty in approaching the fire because of the black smoke,
while another witness said that the blaze is too hot for anybody
to get near the site.
</P>
<P>
Huge black fumes were rising hundreds of meters high and could
be seen from as far as 20 kilometers away during the day, said the
CTV.
</P>
<P>
A small population east of the plant was already evacuated,
while rail traffic by the side of the plant was halted.
</P>
<P>
This is the second fire reported to occur in the plant, which
produces driveway sealers, caulking products and other building
materials. The plant had tanks of xylene, a volatile hydrocarbon
used as a solvent.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan on Monday welcomed the news
that leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
and South Korea will hold their first-ever summit in Pyongyang in
June.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori praised the accord,
describing it "the fruit of untiring effort" by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very good for peace in Asia as well," Mori told
reporters at his official residence.
</P>
<P>
Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki told a press conference that
he believes the summit, if realized, will have "a very good impact
" on the talks between Tokyo and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the DPRK Friday ended their ninth round of
negotiations to normalize diplomatic relations in Pyongyang
without breakthrough. They agreed to meet again in late May.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, in a statement issued
shortly after Pyongyang and Seoul announced the agreement earlier
Monday, said the accord was of "epoch-making significance."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome and will fully support it," Kono said, adding that
he believes the accord showed the will of the two governments to
promote dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK media and South Korean government announced earlier in
the day that DPRK leader Kim Jong Il and South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung will hold a summit on June 12-14 in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be the first ever between the two sides since
the Korean War in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached on Saturday in Beijing, China,
South Korea and the DPRK will have a preliminary contact this
month to make arrangements for the summit, both sides said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Canada Wins Sixth Women's World Hockey Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada defeated the United States
Sunday to win its sixth straight title for Women's World Hockey
Championship.
</P>
<P>
Team Canada beat Team U.S.A. 3-2 with Canadian player Nancy
Drolet's goal 6:50 into overtime to give Canada a come-from-behind
victory in Mississauga, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Drolet picked up the puck on the right boards, skated to the
faceoff circle and blasted the puck off the left shoulder of U.S.
goaltender Sara DeCosta.
</P>
<P>
It popped in the air and floated into the net behind DeCosta,
as 4,890 hockey fans at the Hershey Center erupted for the
decisive score.
</P>
<P>
The win allowed Canada to have a perfect record of 30-0 in team
sport history since the women's tournament was first held in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Finland took the bronze medal with a 7-1
win over Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The Swedes' lack of discipline was their downfall as Finland
scored three power-play goals. The Finns scored two minutes into
the game on a power play and stayed in control the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
Finnish goaltender Tuula Puputti stopped 19 of 20 shots, while
Lotta Gothesson turned away 41 of 48 for Sweden.

He added that their heights ranged from 6,000 to 7,800 meters.

"The decision will help in promoting tourism and creating jobs

He said the newly opened peaks were located in the northern
Himalayan states of Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh,

<HEADLINE> Overseas Tourism Popular in NE China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Simplified overseas tourism
procedures and increased per capita income have inspired more and
more Chinese people to travel to foreign countries instead of
sightseeing just around the country.
</P>
<P>
"I will spend my honeymoon in southeast Asia," said Li Xiao'ou,
coming out of the China Travel Agency Shenyang Office.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks will be enough for a Chinese resident to get a
tourist visa now, hard to imagine just several years ago.
</P>
<P>
Statistics with the Shenyang Tourism Bureau (STB), northeast
China's Liaoning Province, show that nearly 20,000 local people
went traveling overseas in 1999, as compares with only several
thousand in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Longer holidays and increase of income have enabled people to
shift their focus to traveling abroad," said Yan Baomin, a STB
official. The per capita GDP last year for Shenyang was as much as
1,700 U.S. dollars. 4,000 to 5,000 local residents traveled
overseas during the seven-day Spring Festival Holiday this
February, almost doubling that the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
March, once a slack period for tourism, now sees increasing
numbers of people at China Tourism Agency Shenyang Office. Middle-
class and private entrepreneurs make up the bulk of the travelers.
Parents going abroad at the expense of their children has also
accounted for a large proportion, said STB officials.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Macao, have been
the first choices for travelers." It is worthwhile to have a look
at Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand in ten days with some 5,000
yuan (about 600 U.S. dollars)," said Li Xiao'ou, adding that 5,000
yuan was just two or three months salary.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics in 1999, some 1.933 million Chinese
people traveled overseas, 66.9 percent more than in 1998, or 67.1
percent of all the Chinese people going abroad that year.

<HEADLINE> China Builds World's Largest Liquified Ethylene Gas Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Jiangnan Shipyard (Group) Co.
, Ltd., a major shipyard in Shanghai, has just launched a ship
with a carrying capacity load of 22,000 cubic meters of liquified
ethylene gas.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, "Navigator Mars", is the first of the five
liquified ethylene gas ships ordered by the Navigator Gas Limited
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ship, 170 meters long and 24.2 meters wide, is equipped
with four liquified gas containers, which can also carries other
kinds of liquified gas like liquified butane gas.
</P>
<P>
Experts say ships used to carry liquified gas are normally made
according to higher quality standards than those for building
ordinary ones because liquified gas is usually combustible,
explosive and highly corrosive.
</P>
<P>
Jiangnan Shipyard is scheduled to deliver the other four
vessels to the U.S. company within this year.

States to properly handle the issue of granting China permanent
normal trade relations (PNTR), in meeting with visiting U.S.
Commerce Secretary William Daley Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The proper solution to the PNTR issue "is in the interests of
both China and the U.S.," Jiang said. The mutual granting of the
most-favored nation status forms "one of the essential principles
of the World Trade Organization," he pointed out. "China will, as
always, make an active contribution to the healthy development of
the world economy and trade," he added.

commerce and trade here Friday since signing a bilateral agreement
on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) last
November.

<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Developing China's west requires
the efficient use of resources and the application of science,
said Tian Fengshan, China's new Minister of Land and Resources.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old former governor of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province was appointed to the post last month, and
has just returned from a fact-finding tour of western China.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, Tian refuted a widespread
argument that the west's resources, such as land, water and
minerals, will not aid in its development. Some people think poor
transportation and geological conditions, plus ignorance about the
distributions of resources and reserves, will cause developers to
work twice as hard as normal for half the expected gains.
</P>
<P>
Their arguments do not change the importance of using the west'
s resources. A key resource is time, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"The west's development is not a business of several days,"
Tian said. "Considering that it took 20 years for our
traditionally better developed east to advance to today's stage,
the development of western China might take a period at least no
shorter."
</P>
<P>
Although it might take more time, more money and more effort to
use the west's resources, Tian said, these issues need not
discourage anyone.
</P>
<P>
And transportation, geography and other technical concerns are
major targets of the improvement itself.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the minister confirmed some experts'
worries that a water shortage may limit the west development.
</P>
<P>
However, Tian still believes the resources of western China
could become the country's major sources of energy and raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
Another key resource is smart efficiency, he said. "What people
should really strive for is to ensure a scientific and highly
efficient use of the resources."
</P>
<P>
"We should not take the old road of developing an area at the
cost of resource waste and pollution, but rather economize
resources," he added.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Disburse Loans to Indonesia Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF) is expected to disburse 400 million U.S. dollars in loans to
Indonesia later this month, according to Cabinet Secretary
Marsillam Simanjuntak.
</P>
<P>
He said an IMF team would come to Jakarta on April 21 to review
the implementation of economic reform programs promised by the
government in January.
</P>
<P>
The result of the review would be sent to the IMF executive
board at its headquarters in Washington to decide on the second-
tranche disbursement from the IMF 5 billion dollars bailout fund
for Indonesia for the 2000-2002 period.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that one week after the visit of the review team, the
IMF will disburse the money," Simanjuntak was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, IMF chief representative in Jakarta John Dodsworth
said late last month that even though the review could be
completed in the first half of April, the second disbursement of
loans would probably take place only in mid-May at the soonest.
</P>
<P>
"After the review, it needs about three weeks until the IMF
executive board in Washington can meet," Dodsworth said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government signed a letter of intent with the
IMF on January 20, in which it promised to complete a host of
ambitious economic measures by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
But many of the key programs were not completed by the deadline,
prompting the IMF to delay the disbursement of the 400 million
dollars, which had been scheduled for April 4.
</P>
<P>
Simanjuntak said that Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie handed over to President
Abdurrahman Wahid on Friday night a document reporting that 42
items of the letter had been implemented.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Two courts in Chongqing
Municipality in southwest China have handled over 1,600 cases
related to the massive resettlement of residents affected by the
Three Gorges dam project since construction of the project started
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the municipality's No. 2 Intermediate
People's Court said that cases related to the relocation project
were up 70 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, 106 people on charges of misappropriating and
embezzling government funds allocated for resettling affected
people in the massive Three Gorges project have been brought
before the courts.
</P>
<P>
Wang Sumei, a cashier of the Wanzhou Resettlement Bureau, was
sentenced to death on charges of spending 1.26 million yuan of
government funds on gambling.
</P>
<P>
Some 473 million yuan of funds earmarked for the Three Gorges
Resettlement Project have been misappropriated in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the central government allocated
over 17.6 billion yuan for resettlement purpose in the Three
Gorges Project by 1999.
</P>

The relocation project will involve 1.13 million people in 20
counties and prefectures by 2009 when the Three Gorges Project is
completed.

<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool moved above Leeds United
into second place in the English premier league on Sunday after
goals from Czech Patrik Berger and Michael Owen clinched a 2-0
victory over Tottenham Hotspur.
</P>
<P>
Leeds lost 1-0 at Aston Villa, their third successive league
defeat. Liverpool have 62 points from 32 games, eight points
behind leaders Manchester United who play at Middlesbrough on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Leeds, who have had a traumatic week after two of their fans
were killed in Turkey before a UEFA Cup semifinal against
Galatasaray, have 60 points with six games left.
</P>
<P>
Czech international Berger ran across the edge of the penalty
area and struck the ball home superbly in the 34th minute. England
striker Owen slotted home a pass from new striking partner Emile
Heskey in the 61st minute to seal the win at Anfield.
</P>
<P>
Leeds title hopes were destroyed by a controversial Julian
Joachim goal in the 39th minute.
</P>
<P>
Leeds felt Joachim had pushed Gary Kelly off the ball before
bursting away on his own to score.
</P>
<P>
A minute's silence was held before the kickoff for the two dead
Leeds supporters.

<HEADLINE> UEFA: Leeds' Plan to Ban Turkish Fans 'Makes Sense' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's governing body
UEFA on Sunday gave support to Leeds United's plan to ban
Galatasaray fans from their UEFA Cup semifinal second leg after
two English supporters were killed in Istanbul last week.
</P>
<P>
UEFA spokesman Frits Ahlstroem said the proposal, put forward
because of security reasons, "made a lot of sense", adding a final
ruling about the game on April 20 would be made on Monday or
Tuesday, according to the Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Leeds want the ban on away supporters because they are worried
about retaliatory violence after two of their fans were stabbed to
death during trouble 24 hours before Thursday's first leg which
they lost 2-0.
</P>
<P>
"It made a lot of sense to us because it's a question of making
everybody at Elland Road safe for the second leg,"Ahlstroem was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"That's why we fully understood if Leeds United can't guarantee
the security. This is something special in this situation and we
have full understanding for that."
</P>
<P>
UEFA have already sent a letter to both clubs telling them it
would be better for the game to be played without Turkish
supporters. They are waiting for official responses from both
clubs, expected on Monday, before announcing their ruling.

<HEADLINE> Syria Ready to Negotiate Water Deal with Israel: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh
has said that Damascus is ready to compromise on sharing water
resources with Israel in a bid to break the deadlock of peace
talks, Egyptian newspapers reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While Syria refuses to compromise on land, it is ready to
negotiate a deal on sharing the Sea of Galilee, Shareh was quoted
as telling the Egyptian newspapers after meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands that Israel completely withdraw from the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau Israel occupied in the 1967 Mideast
War, in return for peace.
</P>
<P>
Shareh told reporters that land is not negotiable, but water is.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since January
due to disputes over the Golan Heights. Damascus conditions its
return to the negotiating table on an advance Israeli commitment to
a complete Israeli exit from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Water is another thorny issue linked to the argument over the
border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants Israel to withdraw to the cease-fire line prior to
the 1967 war, which would give Syria control of the northeastern
shore of the Sea of Galilee.

TEHRAN -- Iran said on Sunday that it has stopped a Panamanian
oil tanker suspected of carrying smuggled Iraqi oil in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The official IRNA news agency quoted the elite Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as saying the seizure was made
after the tanker, "Ramim al-Khaleej," violated Iranian territorial
waters.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said the tanker gave no heed to the warnings and the IRGC
patrol fired blank shots and forced it to stop. The tanker asked to
be allowed to return to Iraq where it had loaded the oil, which was
apparently refused, and it is now under control of the IRGC navy.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Trade Deficit Rises by 143.5 Percent: Bank Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade deficit in
February this year registered a sharp increase by 143.5 percent
over January, a Tanzania's central bank report said over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
During the month, deficit in the trade account grew to 52.1
million U.S. dollars from 21.4 million U.S. dollars recorded in
the previous month, the Bank of Tanzania said in its monthly
economic review for March.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the poor performance of the trade
account to 37.5 percent increase in imports, surpassing a 2.2
percent increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, imports in February rose to 117.8
million U.S. dollars from 85.7 million U.S. dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
The export increase of 2.2 percent from 64.3 million U.S.
dollars in January to 65.7 million U.S. dollars in February was
due to an increase in non-traditional exports such as petroleum
products, manufactured goods, fish and fish produce.
</P>
<P>
Report said export earnings in February amounted to 65.7
million U.S. dollars and imports totaled 11.8 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in traditional exports was partly due to decline
in export values and export unit prices for all traditional
commodities except cotton and tea, it said.

<HEADLINE> Third Batch of Iraqi POWs Back Home From Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGDHAD, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The third batch of 500 Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs) released by Iran on Monday crossed the
Iranian-Iraqi border and set foot on Iraqi soil, the Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
It was just another tearful reunion. Many POWs wept with joy,
while their family members, overwhelmed by excitement and rejoice,
threw flowers and candies on them.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have been waiting for their arrival in the
border region, said the INA, adding that many POWs have not been
able to see their loved ones for as long as 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Sunday morning unilaterally released 500 Iraqi POWs left
over from the 1980-88 bloody war between the two neighbors, and it
set free another batch of 500 on Sunday night. In all, 1,500 Iraqi
POWs have since been back home.
</P>
<P>
The fourth batch of 500 Iraqi POWs are expected to arrive in
Iraq on Tuesday, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Red Crescent Society has done its best to ensure that
all the returned POWs can receive best medical services, said the
INA.
</P>
<P>
The POWs have been hailed as heroes by the Iraqi government and
each POW will be given 300,000 Iraqi dinars (150 U.S. dollars) for
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced last Wednesday to unilaterally release 2,000
Iraqi
POWs in a bid to solve the POWs issue with Iraq, one of the major
hurdles on the way of normalization of Tehran-Baghdad ties.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials expressed hope that Baghdad would respond to
Tehran's "goodwill gesture" by helping to determine the fate of
Iranian POWs and those missing in action.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claimed that Iran is still holding more than 13,000 Iraqi
POWs, while Tehran claimed last month that Iraq still holds 2,800
Iranians according to available documents.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been exchanging POWs in recent years in a
bid to improve strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that it had released 55,438 Iraqi POWs since 1981 on
103 occasions while Iraq freed 39,417 Iranian POWs in the same
period on 70 occasions.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Stepped-up Efforts to Advance Mideast Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt called on Monday for stepped-
up efforts to break the deadlock in the Middle East peace process
and push it forward "as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
"There is not ... any breakthrough, or any development" in the
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said following a meeting between Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Instead, "there is a problem and there is a crisis" in the peace
march, Moussa said while briefing reporters on the Mubarak-Barak
talks, which the minister said dwelt on the situation on the
Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Barak stopped over in Cairo en route to a summit meeting on
Tuesday with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"At present, which is very crucial for all of us, (we should) be
serious with the peace process and move as quickly as possible,"
Moussa stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since January
due to Israel's refusal to commit itself to withdrawal from the
Golan Heights the Jewish state occupied in the 1967 Mideast war,
and control of the Sea of Galilee at the foot of the heights.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are underway at a secluded
air force base near Washington. But the negotiations are as what
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said "a mere chat" in lack of
progress. Clinton has also invited Arafat to a summit meeting on
April 20 in Washington.

WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday welcomed the announcement of a summit between the
Democratic People's Republic of Korean and the Republic of Korea,
saying it was "fundamental to solving the problems of the Korean
Peninsula."
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the announcement that the Republic of Korea and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea will hold an historic first

something we have long advocated and is fundamental to solving the

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Secretaries of Treasury Support China PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) - Nine former Secretaries of
Treasury of the United States called on the Clinton administration
and Congress to grant China Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR)
so as to seize "an historic opportunity" to make important
commercial benefits for the American people.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in a joint letter to President Bill Clinton
dated April 10 by former Secretaries of Treasury James A. Baker
III, Lloyd M. Bentsen, W. Michael Blumenthal, Nicholas F. Brady,
Douglas Dillon, G. William Miller, Robert E. Rubin, George Shultz,
William Simon.
</P>
<P>
The nine former Secretaries of Treasury expressed their
wholehearted support for Clinton's efforts "to advance economic
interests by seeking China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WT0) and by working with Congress to secure PNTR for
China."
</P>
<P>
"Since the normalization of relations with China and the
establishment of the U.S.-China Joint Economic Committee two
decades ago, each Administration has worked to encourage China's
market reforms and integration into the world economy," they said.
</P>
<P>
The former senior officials applauded the agreement reached
between the two countries on China's entry into the WTO last
November, noting that the commercial benefits to the United States
resulting from the agreement are "clear and compelling."
</P>
<P>
"American farmers, workers and companies will benefit from
reduced tariffs on agricultural and industrial products, expanded
rights to import and distribute within China, and broad new market
access for banking, telecommunications, and insurance services,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
"As China opens its door to American exports, American workers
and the U.S. economy will benefit substantially," they added.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, they said, if the United States fails to accord
PNTR, it would "allow our competitors to realize these
extraordinary market-opening benefits while denying them to
ourselves."
</P>
<P>
They said that the broad, market-based measures China has
committed to as part of its WTO accession will expose Chinese
firms to the discipline of global competition, deepening reforms
that are transforming China's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Along with the establishment of China's open door and reform
policies of 1978, WTO accession is a most important impetus for
economic reform," they said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that China's full integration into the global
trading system will also "mark an important milestone in the post-
war development of the world economy", and "it is vital for
American leadership that we fully support these historic
developments."
</P>
<P>
"A more open, market-oriented, prosperous China, firmly rooted
in the international economic system, is profoundly in the
interests of the United States. China's entry into the WTO will be
an historic step in this direction," they said.
</P>
<P>
The former senior treasury officials urged U.S. Congress to
pass PNTR for China, which they said "will ensure that Americans
will be able to fully share in the benefits."
</P>
<P>
About one month ago, President Clinton sent to the Capitol Hill
a legislation advocating backup for China's entry into the WTO and
passage of PNTR. Congress has decided recently that it will
consider and vote on the issue in the week of May 22.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows to Keep Forces in Korean Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States, while
welcoming the announcement of the North-south Koreas summit, vowed
on Monday it would keep its forces on the Korean Peninsula even if
the two Koreas reach any positive agreement.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin argued that the U.S.
forces, currently 37,000 strong, stationed in South Korea for a
half-century since the Korean War early in the 1950s, was "
justified" despite strong opposition from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, which says the U.S. deployment was the cause of
tension in the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"From our standpoint, our deployment of forces and troops and
equipment in South Korea was justified by the historical situation
there," Rubin said. "That remains our view."
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any changes in those plans," he added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> G-77 Criticizes Humanitarian Intervention Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This right lacks legal basis in the UN Chart and general
principles of international rights, said the summit in its draft
Joint Declaration published here Monday in advance.
</P>
<P>
"We're insisting on the need to maintain a clear difference
between humanitarian assistance and other United Nations'
activities", said the text.
</P>
<P>
The document condemned the military attacks that last year the
United States and its allies from North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) launched upon Yugoslavia due to Kosovo's
internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 expressed its "deep worry" of U.S. air attack
against El Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, that happened on
August 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The block said "We're reiterating the continual validity of the
fundamental right of all peoples to self-determination" for cases
of colonial or foreign domination or foreign occupation".
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 is convening in Cuba's capital city of Havana
the South Summit, the largest gathering of heads of state and
government since the founding of the body in June 1964.
</P>
<P>
A total of 122 delegations are attending the South Summit, and

<HEADLINE> Britain to Allow Pubs Open 24 Hours a Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Pubs in England and Wales would be
allowed to stay open 24 hours a day under plans for the biggest
shake-up in licensing laws for almost a century.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw published a White Paper on Monday
setting out proposals to end fixed closing times for pubs
alongside increased powers for the police to close down premises
which become associated with violence caused by drunken customers.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans, people convicted of violent behavior in pubs
could be banned for life from licensed premises, while "habitual
drunkards" could be banned from buying drink for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The proposals would end Sunday restrictions and give children
more access to pubs and bars.
</P>
<P>
They also include plans to transfer the issuing of licenses from
magistrates courts to local authorities and a new system of
personal licenses which would allow holders to sell alcohol from
any building.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper is aimed at streamlining rules drawn up during
the First World War.
</P>
<P>
Pub landlords would be able to decide on their own hours, with
the aim of staggering closing times between 11 pm and 3 am, with
some premises allowed to stay open all night, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
But licensing authorities will take account of local concerns
before granting licenses.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper's proposals are unlikely to be implemented
before the general election, as the government seeks responses to
the plans before bringing forward legislation in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Licensing laws in England and Wales have changed little since
1915, when they were tightened to stop factory workers turning up
drunk and harming the war effort.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Boost Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
will spend 1.75 million euro (about 1.68 million U.S. dollars)
provided by the European Union in implementing a ten-year
integrated tourism market master plan (TMMP) to be launched this
June.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions in the parliament which is in session
in Tanzania's central town of Dodoma, Minister for Tourism and
Natural Resources Zakia Megji said the fund, which was allocated
to Tanzania through the Lome Convention Arrangement, will be used
to implement tourism policy, grade tourist hotels, improve data
collection for planned tourism data bank and strengthen the
tourism department.
</P>
<P>
The money will also be used to purchase equipment and logistics
for the project implementation and to prepare a zonal-based
implementation plan, she said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a booming industry in Tanzania. The country earned
last year a total of 11.2 billion shillings (about 14 million U.S.
dollars) from receiving 482,000 foreign tourists who came to
sample tourist attractions ranging from wild animals to
geographical features like Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that tourism currently contributes
to 18.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product and 50
percent of its annual foreign exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Minister Warns of Disintegration of Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Environment Minister and
presidential hopeful Ben Mwila said here on Monday that the
country's ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) is
heading for a disaster and will soon disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, MMD National Treasurer, told state-run Zambia News
Agency that the party will vanish and go under.
</P>
<P>
He urged MMD leaders to learn the art of dialog if they want
the party to survive and remain intact for the 2001 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
People should sit down as a party and talk to iron out the
problems the party is facing at the moment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the current expulsions and suspension do not
auger well for the party.
</P>
<P>
Mwila described his working relationship with other cabinet
ministers as cordial and said he is still consulting on the issue
of him standing as president.
</P>
<P>
He said he has to go around the country to measure his
popularity, adding that a lot of leaders in the MMD are also
campaigning for presidency in the name of consulting.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, he will make his position known
after consulting and will wait for the MMD National Executive
Committee (NEC) to air his views.
</P>
<P>
MMD announced here on April 2 that its Information and
Publicity Secretary George Mwambazi and Lusaka Province
Chairperson for Women's Affairs Rose Zimba had been expelled from
the party for alleged disobeying party regulations.
</P>
<P>
They were expelled from the party following dark corner
meetings they had been holding in support of Mwila together with
some other party members who had also been campaigning for Mwila,
said Lusaka Province Minister Sonny Mulenga.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest with a business empire
spanning manufacturing, construction, finance and fertilizers,
helped Frederick Chiluba defeat former President Kenneth Kaunda in
the 1991 elections and now is seen as a leading candidate to
replace Chiluba in the next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
But Chiluba said last September that he would ensure that his
uncle Mwila does not become the country's president.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Strengthen Control Over Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
will pass a bill to impose stricter control over firearms in the
country, said South African Safety and Security Minister Steve
Tshwete on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Firearms Control Bill, which is currently before the South
African National Assembly, will provide stricter control over the
issuing and renewal of firearms licences to individuals as well as
stricter control over state-owned firearms, Tshwete said at the
United Nations' 10th Congress on Crime and Justice in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Accord to a report by the South African Press Association, he
told the delegates that more resources have been made available to
 the South African police so that gun trafficking will be
combated.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has undertaken operations with its
 neighboring countries to find and destroy caches of arms left
over from wars, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the easy availability of guns in
South Africa contributes largely to the country's high crime rate.
</P>
<P>
Most guns used in crime were either stolen from private owners
or the amy or were firearms that had been lost, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Ruling Party Launches National Referendum Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The National Resistance Movement
(NRM), the ruling party of Uganda, has launched its national
referendum campaign here Monday, which will decide the political
future of the party as well as that of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni who declared the party's
decision at the International Conference Center said at a press
conference that it is a crucial move of the party toward the June
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, also NRM chairman, said that the country under the
leadership of NRM has achieved success in politics, economy,
education, and other fields, and it is NRM that brings people of
different shades of opinions to work together under one unified
political roof.
</P>
<P>
In Ugandan history, the country had suffered from failure of
multi-party system, because it was based on political
sectarianism, said the president, adding that the NRM guarantees
democracy because it represents interests of all groups.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the electorate to participate actively in the
coming referendum and urged them to vote for his party.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1995 Constitution, a national referendum is to be
held in June 2000 to decide on the country's political system. It
is widely believed that the NRM would come out a winner.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government Monday
urged the southern African region to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions in order to set off the likely effects of climatic
change.
</P>
<P>
The region is vulnerable to climatic change with the latest one
hitting Mozambique, which this year suffered the worst floods in
50 years, said Zambian Environment and Natural Resources Minister
Ben Mwila.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the region must play a role in reducing the
greenhouse gas emissions, the minister said while opening a
five-day workshop here on climatic change for government planning
officials.
</P>
<P>
He said climatic change studies in Zambia have addressed
various issues such as greenhouse gas emissions with a view to
reduce the emissions.
</P>
<P>
He urged the private sector to work in close collaboration with
the government to come up with a project to develop the climatic
change program because Zambia, and the southern African region as
a whole, lacks financial resources, technology and adequate
infrastructure to detect and deal with major climatic changes.

<HEADLINE> Johannesburg Sets Up Surveillance Cameras to Detect Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The South African major city
of Johannesburg has been equipped with a network of surveillance
cameras as authorities act to quell rampant crimes on the city's
streets.
</P>
<P>
The four-million-rand (600,000 U.S. dollars) monitoring unit
represents a joint effort of local government, police and some
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The 12 surveillance cameras have been placed at hot spots in
the city center and will be able to track the movements of any
person within range, the South African Press Association reported
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cameras, which can zoom on people two kilometers away, will
be linked by fibre-optic cable to a 24-hour control room, where
they will be operated by specially trained operators.
</P>
<P>
When the cameras were installed in cities of Cape Town and
Durban, crime was slashed by about 80 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for International Cooperation in Fighting Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Monday urged
the international community to find workable and credible
solutions to strengthen their common efforts to combat crime.
</P>
<P>
Since crime transcends national boundaries, crime prevention
requires international co-operation and coordinated strategies,
said South African Justice Minister Penuell Maduna after he was
elected president of the United Nations' 10th Congress on Crime
and Justice.
</P>
<P>
Maduna was quoted by the South African Press Association as
saying that " the fight against crime goes beyond the issues of
law and order. It goes to the core of a just and democratic
society."
</P>
<P>
Technological advances have made crime more complex and opened
up more opportunities for criminals, he said, adding that crime
affects different countries in different ways.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African National Director of Public
Prosecutions Bulelani Ngcuka said there is more pressure on the
criminal justice systems in societies in transition than in
settled democracies.
</P>
<P>
While there is a need to establish a human rights culture in
emerging democracies, the need to establish and maintain an
effective justice system should not be ignored, he said.

<HEADLINE> Former Nigerian Opposition Leader Back From Exile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Anthony Enahoro, a prominent former
 opposition leader of Nigeria, Monday returned to his home country
after four years in exile in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted as a hero in Lagos, the largest city in the west
African country. Among those going to the airport to welcome him
were thousands of supporters including two state governors.
</P>
<P>
Enahoro was one of the founding fathers of new Nigeria, who
fought tirelessly to press Britain to accept Nigeria's
independence in October, 1960.
</P>
<P>
His chequered political history included a stint as
commissioner (minister) for information, culture, youth, sports,
co-operatives and labor during the period from 1967 to 1974.
</P>
<P>
Noted for his belief in justice, equity and the rule of law,
Enahoro, along with other eminent Nigerians, formed the Nigeria
Association for Democracy to protest the military annulment of the
1993 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Enahoro was briefly detained in 1994 by the regime of late
military leader Sani Abacha, before he fled the country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately clear if the former opposition leader
still has energy for Nigeria's rigorous politics.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls Sharply But Dow Rises on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell sharply Monday as investors were worried
about the tech firms in forthcoming first quarter earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Nasdaq index fell 258.25 at 4,188.
20, its second largest drop ever.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 75.08 at 11,186.56 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 11.89 at 1,504.46.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index fell as Richard McCabe, chief market analyst
at Merrill Lynch, told clients in a research note that they should
reduce their exposure to technology stocks in favor of energy,
financial and consumer issues. Microsoft, Applied Materials and
Yahoo! fell.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations coincided with remarks from a number of
Wall Street strategists in recent weeks that strongest earnings
growth this quarter is expected not from the technology sector,
but from the less heralded energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The recent wild rides in the technology stocks dragged the
Nasdaq index down 349.15 points Monday, last week and 574.57
points before marching back on the following day. But the
composite rebounded in the three consecutive sessions after the
volatility.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index rose as investors drew out some tech stocks and
moved money into more stable and predictable Old Economy stocks.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.28 at 659.71. But American Stock Exchange
index fell 30.65 at 958.04 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller

<HEADLINE> Roundup: German CDU Elects Merkel New Chairman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ESSEN, Germany, April 10 (Xinhua)--Germany's opposite
Christian Democrats (CDU) Monday formally elected Angela Merkel
the first female chairman at their 13th national congress here.
</P>
<P>
Merkel, 45 and a former physics teacher from a east German
pastor's family, won some 96 percent supporting vote among 1,001
delegates from all over Germany.
</P>
<P>
Most have predicted Merkel's election, but her voting result
is by far the best one in CDU's history.
</P>
<P>
Merkel's predecessor Wolfgang Schaeuble won 93 percent at the
congress in the year of 1998, and Helmut Kohl won 87 percent when
he first elected CDU chairman in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, the ill-fated "crown prince" of Kohl, was forced to
step down amid a funding scandal of himself. But he still held a
seat in the new CDU presidium.
</P>
<P>
Also elected to the CDU leading circle was Ruprecht Polenz, a
53-year old legislator from Muenster city who will manage the
party as general secretary. The new face emerging into the CDU
presidium won some 88 percent of vote.
</P>
<P>
In her speech to the congress, Merkel urged the CDU to unite
around her and win the general election in the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
"The time of our enemy has gone away, we are here again, to
the business," she said.
</P>
<P>
The CDU, haunted by former chancellor Helmut Kohl's illicit
funding scandal, should forget Kohl, look forward, and turn the
crisis into chance, Merkel told the party.
</P>
<P>
She vowed to begin structural and financial reforms, enhance
the internal democracy, and turn the west-rooted conservative CDU
into a real "people's party".
</P>
<P>
In the hour-long speech, Merkel also hit Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's red-green coalition cabinet, contending Schroeder's "
new middle" policy.
</P>
<P>
Merkel said: "every policy of Schroeder is a lie-- the
ecological tax, social welfare and tax reform, eastern
construction!--there are lie no.1 through no.5. "
</P>
<P>
The CDU delegates welcomed her speech with long-time hails and
applauded for six minutes.
</P>
<P>
Merkel, unknown to the public just half a year before, is seen
as an outsider who will lead the party in another style. The CDU's
grass-rooted members call Merkel her nick name "Angie" and try to
find another Magarette Thatcher in her.
</P>
<P>
To re-build the party finance, which is near bankrupt after
the government pursued huge fines against the CDU for Kohl's
scandal, Merkel and other CDU leaders also planned to raise
monthly party membership fee by one mark each.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, the former CDU chairman whose reputation was ruined
after acknowledging to have collected undeclared campaign funds,
did not take part in the congress, though he said in an open
letter to Merkel and Schaeuble that "the CDU remains my political
homeland."

<HEADLINE> G-77 Attaches Importance to South-North Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77 (G-77) Monday said
that the body attaches great importance to the South-North
dialogue and keep the door "wide open" for such a dialogue at a
time when the official development assistance, the aid promised by
developed countries, has been on decrease year by year and many
developing countries are being marginalized in the current tide of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Mbanefo, chairman of G-77 and the Nigerian permanent
representative to the United Nations, told a press conference that
"only very few countries are continuing to fulfill their
commitment" to earmarking 0.7 percent of their gross domestic
product (GDP) as official development assistance to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We tend to use the South Summit as an opportunity to
revitalize the South-South cooperation so as to face the challenge
of globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
But G-77, at the same time, also attached great importance to
the dialogue between developed countries and developing nations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the United Nations General Assembly established the
goal for wealthy countries to earmark 0.7 percent of their GDP for
assistance to developing countries. Currently, only four --
Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden -- have reached or
surpassed that mark. A majority of industrialized in the North
have failed to comply with their pledged development assistance.
</P>
<P>
"You can not force somebody to keep his promise, because you
don't know what problems he may have had," he said. "But as far as
the North-South dialogue is concerned, we have to keep the door
wide open because we are not living in an isolated world."
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, we will continue the dialogue," he said. "We
are continuing this relationship and improving upon it."
</P>
<P>
The North-South dialogue is top on the agenda of the South
Summit of G-77, slated for April 10-14, the largest gathering of
heads of state and government since the 1964 founding of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
"In the spirit of openness, we have also invited 54 developed
countries, including members of OECD (the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Official Development Assistance from the North to the South in
1992 reached 61 billion U.S. dollars. By 1997, the total had
fallen to 47.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the United States, all members of OCED,
which unites the world's wealthiest nations, have reaffirmed their
pledge to bring development assistance for the South up to 0.7
percent of their respective GDPs.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77, with Nigeria holding its Chairmanship for the
year 2000, was established on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing
countries in Geneva. Although the membership of G-77 has increased
to 133 countries, the original name was retained because of its
historic significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and
the largest grouping in the South, G-77 provides the means for the
developing world to articulate and promote its collective economic
interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on all major
international economic issues in the United Nations system, and
promote economic and technical cooperation among developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The broad themes of globalization, knowledge and technology,
south-south cooperation and north-south relations are the
principal focus of the Summit. The agenda thus reflects the
enormous global challenges facing developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit is an occasion for developing countries to
galvanize their strength and solidarity into a truly energetic
force capable of conditioning the international economic order in
which they must operate.

<HEADLINE> Southern Summit to Take Measures for Technologic Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 10,(Xinhua)-- The Summit of the Group of 77 to
start Wednesday in Havana, proposes adopting a group of measures
serving to cut down the technologic gap nowadays separating
countries in development from industrialized ones.
</P>
<P>
Two final documents are to merge from the Summit, including the
Joint Declaration and the Plan of Action.
</P>
<P>
The Plan of Action for approval by the Summit, includes among
its objectives eradicating illiteracy, strengthening the fight
against sicknesses such as AIDS and tuberculosis and trying to
hold back scientists and intellectuals in countries of the South.
</P>
<P>
With this intention the document makes a call on scientific and
investigation organizations of the South so that these open
offices in developed countries and that these branches are manned
by professionals that emigrated from the Third World.
</P>
<P>
Those participating at the debate, representing the 133
countries that make up nowadays the Group of 77, are backing up
the creation of a Science and Technology prize highlighting the
most talented investigators that work in nations of the South.
</P>
<P>
They also recommend establishing a finance fund to promote
knowledge and technology in developing countries, to which
governments, the private sector and other organizations that
voluntarily want to donate these means, may contribute.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 is convening the South Summit, the largest
gathering of heads of state and government since the founding of
the body in June 1964.
</P>
<P>
The summit is scheduled to conclude on Friday .

<P>
HAVANA, April 10 (Xinhua)-- The Southern Summit of the Group of
77 said Monday that the production systems of industrialized
countries are unsustainable and threaten the planet's survival.
</P>
<P>
This summit, that takes place from Wednesday to Friday in
Havana, demanded in its draft Joint Declaration that before its
application, technological innovations are submitted to economic,
social and environmental evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The block proposed that in this project participate
governments, entrepreneurial and scientific communities and other
groups that have been excluded from this kind of decisions.
</P>

G-77 exhorted industrialized nations to submit to developing
countries environmentally safe technologies.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Foreign Minister Calls for Globalization of Solidarity  (Updated with more quotes) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The foreign minister told a press conference here that the
economy imposed by the developed world today is excluding the poor,
which make for the vast majority of the planet, while denying
their access to development.
</P>
<P>
"It is to solve this situation that we stand for dialogue"
between the North and the South, he said. "We need a North-South
dialogue in which the North listens to our opinions."
</P>
<P>
However, such a dialogue, he said, " must be conducted on equal
footing for both North and South, bearing in mind all of our
interests, especially our fundamental right to development."
</P>
<P>
In that regard, he said he is highly optimistic about the South
Summit, in progress here through April 14, for this meeting is
taking place on very appropriate timing, in the year when the
United Nations is summoning the so called "the Millennium Assembly,
" where the international policies of the next century will be
devised.
</P>
<P>
But he said "because the South can not wait for ever, as it
needs an urgent solution to its problems, and the North cannot
expect the South to tackle all problems on its own. They must be
worked out in a joint manner."
</P>
<P>
Currently, the inhabitants of the rich countries, which account
for some 20 percent of the world's total population, enjoy 80
percent of the wealth available to the world, he said, adding that
this is "unbearable" in the current international financial
situation.
</P>
<P>
He charged "a few countries" with attempt to impose their
political views, which usually respond to their economic polices
as well, on the rest of the world at the U.N., invoking the so-
called " right to humanitarian intervention," in violation of the
principle of the noninterference in other country's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
What would happened, he asked, if countries of the South would
for an alliance to bomb the North just because countries there are
practicing xenophobia or abusing the rights of minorities?
</P>
<P>
"The only acceptable invasion for us," he added half-jokingly,
"would be one that brings lower interests for long term financing.
"
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 80 percent of the world's population were
forging a unified voice to carry on the struggle for their rights
from the 1999 chaotic World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remarks as the Group of 77 is
convening the South Summit, the largest gathering of heads of
state and government since the founding of the body in June 1964.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chairman Eisenberg told reporters that he supports China's PNTR
and urges congressional approval of that status because for
centuries, foreign trade has been the lifeblood of the economies
of New York and New Jersey, and China, with its 1.2 billion people,
is a huge market.
</P>
<P>
According to his account, last year U.S. exports to China
totaled some 18 billion U.S. dollars. Of that, 1.3 billion dollar
worth of goods was shipped from the New York and New Jersey region.
"We need to build on this enormously important relationship," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Eisenberg said Governor Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey
and Governor George Pataki of New York also support normal trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Whitman and Pataki were among the 44 governors who signed a
letter on March 31 to Senate majority leader Trent Lott, urging
him to support China's PNTR. They said that the U.S. exports to
China in 1998 created 200,000 jobs for Americans and if the PNTR
is granted the exports to that country could nearly double.
