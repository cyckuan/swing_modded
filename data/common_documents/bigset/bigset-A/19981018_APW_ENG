Howard seeks to rebuild his support in the bush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP)_ Conservative prime minister John
Howard is seeking to beef up his government's performance in rural
Australia with a revamped ministry he announced Sunday.
	   John Anderson, a rising star in the rural-based National Party,
the junior partner in Howard's government, has been given the job
of providing better services for those living in areas of the
Australian outback.
	   Howard sees this as critically important to his newly reelected
government's long-term survival.
	   The National Party faced a determined challenge from Pauline
Hanson's right wing One Nation Party in the lead up to the
country's national elections on Oct. 3.
	   Discontent in depressed rural areas, particularly among
Australia's pig farmers, fueled much of the support that has
emerged for One Nation's highly protectionist policies over the
past two years.
	   But even though it won more than 1 million of the 12 million
votes cast on Oct. 3, One Nation managed to capture only one seat
in the Senate and none in the House of Representatives.
	   Howard is now determined to shore up the government's support
outside the capital cities and seaboard towns where most of
Australia's population of more than 18 million people live.
	   Anderson, the deputy leader of the National Party, is seen as a
likely future leader when trade minister Tim Fischer retires.
	   As expected, former industry minister John Moore, a close
associate of Howard, is to succeed Ian McLachlan, who retired at
the election, as Australia's defense minister.
	   But Nick Minchin, the high profile senator who steered Howard's
controversial 10-point native title plan through a hostile chamber,
in the first Howard government, did not become finance minister as
expected.
	   Minchin had been widely tipped to get that post because of his
success in tough bargaining. He gets an expanded industry portfolio
instead.
	   The biggest challenge Howard is likely to face, in his second
term, is steering his equally controversial plan to overhaul
Australia's tax system through the Senate.

Deposed Malaysian leader says Prime Minister Mahathir fears
</HEADLINE>
people's wrath
 &UR; UPDATES throughout with additional comments from Anwar.
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's former No. 2 leader
said his release from detention under a harsh security law was
prompted by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's fear of his
countrymen's wrath and pressure from the international community.
	   In the first statement issued since his arrest nearly a month
ago, dismissed deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim protested his treatment
in prison, but vowed that neither he nor his reform movement would
be beaten into submission.
	   ``The detention was an attempt to weaken my resolve. They have
failed,'' the dissident said in the statement from his jail cell.
``It is time for change.''
	   Anwar, who was arrested under Malaysia's draconian Internal
Security Act, has alleged he has suffered from police beatings
while awaiting trial to face a number of corruption and sex
charges.
	   In the statement, circulated by Anwar's wife Azizah Ismail late
Saturday night, the dismissed former deputy prime minister revived
his attack on the government and his calls for reform.
	   ``There must be an end to the abuse of instruments of
government; we must rid the country of corruption, cronyism and
nepotism,'' he said.
	   Anwar, 51, was taken into custody under the ISA on Sept. 20
after he organized mammoth rallies against the government. After 24
days in detention under the ISA, he was placed under a form of
custody which permits access to his lawyers and family.
	   The security law, which allows for indefinite imprisonment
without trial, had restricted access to his legal counsel and
relatives.
	   The deposed deputy leader said Mahathir's government had made
the move to stem growing public sympathy for Anwar and ease
pressure from abroad before Malaysia hosts a summit meeting next
month of leaders from members of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   ``The plan was to get me out of ISA detention before APEC
begins,'' Anwar said.
	   He also accused Mahathir of using the act, which was enacted in
1960 to combat militant communists, as a means of clinging to
power.
	   Malaysia's police chief, meanwhile, said more charges could be
brought against Anwar, The Star newspaper said Sunday. Rahim Noor
was quoted as saying that a probe into the activities of the
dissident politician were ongoing.
	   Anwar's case drew international condemnation after he appeared
in court with bruises and a black eye, and alleged he was a victim
of police brutality.
	   Among those sympathetic to him were governments of several
countries scheduled to attend the November APEC summit meeting in
Kuala Lumpur. The president of the Philippines has not yet
confirmed his attendance.
	   Malaysia says the economic forum should not be politicized.
	   Within Malaysia, protests have continued over Anwar's Sept. 2
dismissal and his subsequent arrest.
	   Defying a police order, Anwar's wife, Azizah, joined thousands
of protesters demanding Mahathir's resignation Saturday.
	   It was the first protest in which Azizah has participated since
her husband was arrested last month after leading rallies against
Mahathir's rule. Police have warned her against getting involved in
the reform campaign her husband began.
	   Hundreds of people rushed to Azizah's car shouting ``Reforms!
Reforms!'' and ``Mahathir Resign!'' She shook hands with some from
inside her car. The couple's 18-year-old daughter, Nurul Izzah,
accompanied her.
	   Later, police beat protesters with rattan canes to get them off
the streets. About 140 people were arrested, the Star newspaper
reported.
	   Police fired a water cannon to disperse the crowd of nearly
10,000 protesters who had marched to the palace of Malaysia's
constitutional monarch, demanding that Anwar be reinstated as the
nation's deputy prime minister.
	   Mahathir, 72, fired Anwar saying his former heir-apparent was
morally unfit to rule. Anwar has denied the charges, saying they
were fabricated to eliminate the challenge he had posed to
Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   His trial begins Nov. 2.

Report: Indonesian president to attend APEC despite Anwar arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Honorific ``Pak'' is correct, graf 10

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
plans to attend next month's Asia-Pacific leaders' summit in
neighboring Malaysia despite the controversial arrest of ousted
Malaysian deputy leader Anwar Ibrahim, The Jakarta Post reported
Sunday.
	   The paper quoted Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a presidential spokeswoman,
as saying Habibie had decided to go to the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation meeting in Kuala Lumpur in November because Malaysian
authorities were now affording Anwar better treatment after he was
allegedly beaten by guards.
	   Habibie has described Anwar as a friend and has repeatedly
raised concerns over his treatment.
	   Earlier this month, he canceled a planned state visit to Kuala
Lumpur, citing commitments which kept him busy at home.
	   Doubts about his attendance at APEC were raised when he met
Philippine President Joseph Estrada on the Indonesian island of
Batam, near Singapore. Both leaders have called for fairer
treatment for Anwar.
	   Estrada has yet to say whether he will attend APEC.
	   Anwar, 51, was arrested under the Internal Security Act on Sept.
20 after he organized mammoth rallies against the government. After
24 days in detention under a harsh security act, he was placed
under a form of custody which permits access to his lawyers and
family.
	   Dewi said Habibie and Estrada had instructed their foreign
ministers to draft a letter to Malaysia suggesting Anwar be placed
under house arrest while awaiting trial.
	   ``The better treatment given to Anwar and possible house arrest
status for him have eradicated major barriers for the visit (to
APEC),'' the Post quoted Dewi as saying.
	   The newspaper also quoted an official who said on condition of
anonymity that Habibie had telephoned Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad before his meeting with Estrada to state that he
would take part in APEC and to explain his concerns about Anwar's
case.
	   ``Pak Habibie told Mahathir that he did not intend to interfere
in Malaysia's internal affairs. He was just worried about the
condition of his close friend Anwar,'' the official was quoted as
saying.
	   Dewi said Habibie had been less outspoken that Estrada on the
issue because the Indonesian president preferred to use quiet
diplomacy in recognition of Indonesia's close relations with
Malaysia.

Brown and Wells didn't look like Brown and Wells
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ This wasn't the pitcher's duel everybody
expected.
	   Instead of Kevin Brown and David Wells setting down the side
inning after inning Saturday night, the Yankees and Padres combined
for the most runs in a Game 1 in 20 years.
	   New York won the opener 9-6, the most runs in a World Series
opener since the Dodgers beat the Yankees 11-5 in 1978.
	   Brown and Wells, both nearly unhittable in the first two rounds
of the playoffs, spent a lot of time watching runners circle the
bases.
	   ``Five is a lot of runs to give up to that team,'' Wells said.
``I needed help tonight and the hitters picked me up.''
	   Brown, who had a 0.38 ERA in his first three starts, gave up
four runs in 6 1-3 innings, leaving with a no-decision. In three
World Series starts over the last two years, Brown is 0-2 with a
7.27 ERA.
	   ``It's fair to say he wasn't quite on,'' Padres manager Bruce
Bochy said.
	   Brown was slowed by a sinus infection and he hurt his shin after
Chili Davis lined a shot off his leg in the second inning.
	   ``I was tired and I was feeling bad,'' he said. ``It's a
struggle when you're physically not right. This was one of my worst
nights physically in a long time.''
	   Wells didn't fare much better despite posting his first World
Series win. The Yankees left-hander allowed seven hits and five
runs, including three homers, in seven innings.
	   Wells improved to 4-0 in the postseason _ 8-1 for his career _
becoming the seventh player to win four games in one postseason.
The last pitcher to accomplish the feat was Livan Hernandez last
year.
	   There were so many pitching changes that in the eighth inning
Graeme Lloyd thought he had been summoned into the game, but
instead Joe Torre had signaled for Mariano Rivera.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HITTING HOMERS: Greg Vaughn of the Padres homered twice in his
first World Series game, becoming the 40th player with a multihomer
game in series history.
	   The last player to accomplish the feat was Atlanta's Andruw
Jones in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium two years ago.
	   Vaughn's fifth-inning homer came one pitch after Tony Gwynn hit
his first Series homer, marking the 12th time consecutive homers
were hit in the Series.
	   Moises Alou and Charles Johnson connected for Florida against
Cleveland in the fourth inning of last year's opener.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN: Who better to listen to on advice for
how to handle the pressure of the World Series than Yogi Berra, who
played in a record 14 series and managed two others.
	   When Berra, the former Yankees player and manager, called Joe
Torre two days ago, the current Yankees manager reminded Berra of
the advice he gave before Torre's first World Series in 1996.
	   ``He said you'll never forget the experience of running out to
first base when they introduce you in Game 1 of the World Series at
Yankee Stadium,'' Torre said. ``It was something I continue to
remember and cherish and look forward to doing again.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; PETTITTE'S BACK: Andy Pettitte returned to New York on Saturday
after being by his father's side following heart surgery.
	   Tommy Pettitte is resting comfortably in a Houston hospital
after undergoing double bypass surgery on Thursday.
	   ``My dad is fine,'' Pettitte said.
	   Pettitte is scheduled to start Game 4 for the Yankees.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOME COOKING: Conventional wisdom is that home-field advantage
means less in baseball than in other sports.
	   But over the last 12 World Series, the team with the home edge
has won 11 times, with only the 1992 Braves losing. Toronto beat
Atlanta in six games that year.
	   There could be many reasons for this phenomenon, including the
use of the designated hitter in the AL park since 1986. Or it could
just be a coincidence. Regardless, the home team has won 42 of the
last 72 World Series games (a .583 winning percentage).
	   In the NBA and NHL _ where the home edge means more during the
regular season _ visiting teams fare better in the championship,
despite that the home team is determined by record instead of
alternating years like in baseball.
	   Three times in the last 12 years in both sports, a team without
the home field won the championship.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BIG DIFFERENCES: The Yankees are the seventh team to win at
least 15 more games than their World Series opponent.
	   Those teams have won five of the six previous meetings, taking
22 of the 29 games. There have been three sweeps, one five-game
series and one six-game series.
	   Only the 1906 Cubs, who won a major league record 116 games,
lost in the World Series, falling in six games to the White Sox (93
wins).
	   New York (114) won 16 more games than San Diego.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; ODDS AND ENDS: Sammy Sosa got a standing ovation from the crowd
of 56,712 when he threw out the first pitch. ... The Yankees
bullpen has allowed just three earned runs in 20 innings this
postseason. ... The Padres bullpen has accounted for three of the
team's four losses this postseason. ... The team that won the
opener has won 54 of the 93 World Series (58 percent).

New tropical storm threatens Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A new storm moved closer to the
central Philippines on Sunday, while officials continued searching
for missing people and repairing the damage wrought by killer
Typhoon Zeb last week.
	   Weather forecasters tracked the new storm, which had maximum
sustained winds of 75 kilometers (46 miles) per hour, over the
Pacific Ocean about 400 kilometers (248 miles) east of eastern
Samar province.
	   The storm, dubbed Babs, is expected to strengthen further and
hit several eastern Philippine provinces in two to three days if it
maintains its current course, said weather forecaster Susan Dampog.
	   Storm warnings have been raised in several eastern provinces,
which were expected to be hit by strong winds, rain and rough seas
starting Sunday.
	   Last week, Zeb blew across the northern Philippine region,
killing at least 74 people, forcing more than 100,000 people from
their homes and causing widespread damage.
	   Disaster officials said the number of missing people has risen
to more than 60 as reports came in from isolated villages on
Sunday.
	   The typhoon destroyed an estimated 1.5 billion pesos (dlrs 35
million) worth of property and crops in 1,087 northern villages in
the country's tobacco- and rice-growing region, officials said.
	   Search, rescue and relief work were continuing, they added.

 &UR; Zanardi wins seventh race of season &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) _ Alex Zanardi won a 13th-lap
pit road battle with Scotland's Dario Franchitti to take the lead
and hold on for victory in Sunday's caution flag-marred Honda
Australian IndyCarnival.
	   The race, shortened to two hours _ 62 laps _ from its scheduled
65 laps, finished under a yellow flag. It was Zanardi's seventh
CART FedEx series victory of the season and an early birthday
present for the Formula One-bound Italian driver who will turn 32
on Friday.
	   Zanardi celebrated his win by doing five of his trademark
``donut'' circular spins in his car on the track immediately after
the race.
	   He was trailing pole winner Franchitti by less than a second
when they and the top 13 cars pitted under a caution caused when
Michel Jourdain Jr., spun on between the ninth and 10th turns on
the 4.5-kilometer (2.795-mile) temporary road circuit.
	   When series points champion Zanardi, driving a Target/Chip
Ganassi Reynard Honda, and Franchitti, who had won three of the
last four races, came out of their pit stalls, the Italian returned
to the track in first place.
	   Zanardi, who lost the lead briefly to Franchitti with 10 laps
left when he pitted ahead of the Scottish driver, finished in 2
hours, 01.512 minutes.
	   Franchitti, who took his fifth pole of the season by breaking
the track record on Saturday, was second, followed by Christian
Fittipaldi, who was seriously injured in an accident here last
year, in third.
	   ``The problem was the first pit spot where we let Alex get track
position,'' said Franchitti. ``It went downhill from there.''
	   American Scott Pruett was fourth and Finland's J.J. Lehto fifth.
	   The race was held under clear, sunny skies and temperatures in
the 30 Celsius (86F) range.
	   Bobby Rahal, who was making his final driving appearance in
Australia following his decision to retire at the end this season,
came out of the race on the 19th lap after making contact with the
wall.
	   ``It's very disappointing because I wanted to do well here,''
said Rahal, 46. ``I just glanced off the wall and that shot me back
across the track into the wall. I just made a mistake trying to be
aggressive.''
	   The starting grid was made up of only 27 cars instead of the
usual series race total of 28. CART officials determined that the
amount of pit space available would only safely support 27 cars, so
the slowest qualifier of the weekend, Dennis Vitolo of the United
States, did not get a start.
	   Attendance figures of 93,000 on Sunday pushed the four-day crowd
to 245,000, breaking the previous record of 226,000 set last year.
	   CART officials said the previous best race-day attendance this
season was at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, Calif., where
87,500 watched Zanardi win his first race of the season on April 5.

All niceties aside, Taiwan flatly rejects `one China' position

Chen-fu's meeting with Jiang Zemin.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Seizing a chance to speak directly with a top
Chinese leader, Taiwan's chief envoy on Sunday flatly rejected a
key position of Beijing _ that there is only one China of which
Taiwan is just a small part.
	   Taiwan cannot accept China's plan to reunify under a ``one
country, two systems'' formula akin to Hong Kong's status as a
capitalist enclave within China, Taiwan negotiator Koo Chen-fu told
Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen, according to a statement issued
by Koo's team.
	   The envoy told Qian that Taiwan is a sovereign state and will
accept no lesser status, the statement said.
	   Tang Shubei, a high-ranking mainland negotiator, later told
reporters that Taiwan should reconsider its position. He added that
Beijing would not budge from its ``one China'' policy.
	   Beijing views Taiwan as a province that must eventually be
reunified with the mainland.
	   But Tang said China was still willing to push ahead for more
talks under an agreement reached last week in Shanghai between Koo
and his Beijing counterpart, Wang Daohan.
	   China wants to begin with political negotiations, a euphemism
for talks leading to reunification. Taiwan wants discussions to
begin with practical issues, such as fishing rights, and put off
more contentious political matters.
	   Koo was scheduled to meet later Sunday with President Jiang
Zemin, capping a visit that has helped thaw contacts.
	   Beijing broke off talks with Taiwan in 1995 in anger over a trip
by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to the United States, a move
Beijing saw as a sign Lee was leading Taiwan to independence.
	   Koo's talk with Vice Premier Qian on Sunday was the first chance
for Taiwan to put its position directly to one of China's top
government leaders, instead of going through the government-backed
negotiating organizations Koo and Wang head.
	   Koo was blunt, his top aide, Shi Hwei-you, told reporters.
	   The envoy told the vice premier that Beijing's failure to
recognize the existence of a separate government on Taiwan was the
main obstacle to improving relations, Shi said.
	   Koo also objected to Beijing's obstruction of Taiwan's efforts
to establish diplomatic relations with other countries and join
international organizations, Shi said.
	   Beijing insists all countries with which it has diplomatic
relations must cut ties with Taipei. Only 27 countries still have
formal ties with Taiwan.
	   Koo also told Qian Taiwan was investigating the possibility of
joining in an international project to build two nuclear energy
plants for North Korea in exchange for North Korea giving up its
nuclear weapons program.
	   The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization project is
a consortium of the United States, Japan, South Korea and the
European Union.
	   China viewed Koo's planned meeting with Jiang as a courtesy call
rather than formal talks and only a handful of officials were
brought to the meeting.
	   Koo and Wang, both elder statesmen charged with improving
relations across the Taiwan Strait, had not met since their initial
meeting in Singapore in 1993, when they agreed to set up talks on a
broad range of issues.
	   Their meeting last week was the first concrete advance since
Beijing froze the talks three years ago.
	   Koo, 81, is a business tycoon and Nationalist Party elder. He
was visiting the mainland for the first time in more than 50 years.
	   His counterpart, Wang, 84, is a former mayor of Shanghai and a
mentor to President Jiang.
	   Civil war split China and Taiwan seven decades ago. In 1949, Mao
Tse-tung's Communists forced Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the
mainland and onto the island of Taiwan.
	   As recently as 1996, when relations were at their lowest point
since the Cold War, China attempted to intimidate Taiwan by testing
missiles off its waters.

Malaysian dissident's teen daughter stirs Southeast Asian storm
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The daughter of jailed Malaysian dissident
Anwar Ibrahim is stirring up a storm in Southeast Asia by seeking
support from the leaders of the Philippines and Indonesia.
	   The two presidential audiences accorded to 18-year-old Nurul
Izzah last week are seen by more traditional members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations as a sign of interference in
a neighbor's domestic affairs, a violation of a three decade-old
code for avoiding open conflicts within the trade group.
	   The Philippine ambassador to Malaysia said on Friday he was
summoned to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to explain President
Joseph Estrada's statements in support of Anwar.
	   Plans by Philippine legislators to observe Anwar's trial in
November, and a resolution working its way through the Philippine
congress calling for justice in the case, are bound to make
Malaysian leaders even angrier, as they prepare to host an
Asia-Pacific nations summit next month.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Thursday criticized
leaders who have been publicly sympathetic to Anwar, the man he
fired Sept. 2, as morally unfit to be deputy prime minister and
finance minister.
	   When Anwar appeared in court to plead innocent on charges of
corruption and illegal homosexual acts he had a black eye and
bruises, which he said were inflicted during a police beating.
	   If neighboring countries continue to comment on Malaysian
domestic affairs, Malaysia will do the same, Mahathir said.
	   But some leaders in the disparate nine-nation group feel
outspokenness on human rights is just what's needed to bring the
region into the next century.
	   ``We are entering the era of openness to express views,
comments, and moving toward having an open society as a vision for
ASEAN ... before the year 2020,'' Thailand's Foreign Ministry
spokesman, Kobsak Chutikul, said Friday. ``We believe Malaysian
society is strong enough to take these criticisms.''
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie and Estrada, both in office
less than five months, ``are saying, wait a moment, Anwar Ibrahim
is our friend. We want to say something. This has never happened
before in ASEAN,'' Philippines Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon said
last week during an economic conference in Singapore.
	   ``Some people say this is retrogressive. But this is actually
positive,'' he said.
	   Such openness also was debated during the ASEAN summit in Manila
in July.
	   Singapore Foreign Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar, next year's
ASEAN chairman, argued against any change and warned of letting
loose forces that could tear the group apart with bickering.
	   Singapore's own souring relations with Malaysia, exacerbated by
the stress of the Asian economic crisis, show how disagreements can
become strategic problems.
	   A dispute in July over the location of a railroad border post
has gotten so far out of hand that Malaysia has banned Singaporean
rescue craft from its air and sea space, and pulled out of annual
military exercises that were designed to ease just such tensions.
	   While deploring that turn of events, the United States supports
the move toward openly discussing human rights in ASEAN, a group
formed as a bulwark against communism that now includes communist
Vietnam and Laos.
	   ``I noted how far ASEAN had come in willingness to express
publicly and privately its concerns about a very serious situation
that has developed,'' U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stanley
Roth said Friday after meeting with Habibie.
	   But many in ASEAN don't want to go there.
	   In a statement that took two days to prepare, Vietnam's Foreign
Ministry said Friday, ``We do not comment on internal affairs of
other countries.''
	   When Vietnam joined ASEAN, it ``solemnly declared to respect the
fundamental principles regulating relations among ASEAN member
countries,'' the statement said. ``The principles are consensus,
consulting each other, and non-interference.''
	   By contrast, Habibie and Estrada made it clear that they met on
Oct. 13 _ during Estrada's first foreign trip as leader of the
Philippines _ to discuss Anwar.
	   When Nurul, Anwar's daughter, meet with both presidents, it was
shown on television around Asia. And Estrada sent her home with a
message for her father, a man who has called for the end of
Mahathir's 17-year-rule and is accused by the Malaysian government
of causing riots.
	   ``I am just telling Izzah here to tell her father not to waver
because he is fighting for a cause, the cause of the Malaysian
people,'' Estrada told reporters. ``I am very hopeful and sure that
... Anwar Ibrahim will triumph in the end.''
	   Although Estrada and his aides said he was giving a ``personal,
moral'' opinion, he added that ``human rights and due process
transcend all boundaries. This is a universal concept that must be
respected not only by people, but all leaders of the world.''

Report: Laotian leader criticizes corruption, bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) _ In remarks rarely heard in
Communist-ruled Laos, Prime Minister Sisavath Keobounphanh has
criticized official corruption and excessive bureaucracy for
impeding economic progress, the official English-language Vientiane
Times reported Sunday.
	   Sisavath called for more transparency in the Southeast Asian
nation's state-controlled economy at a key ministerial meeting last
Tuesday. He noted the need for autonomous watch-dog committees to
report on financial irregularities throughout Laos.
	   ``We must make sure these (watchdog) committees work
effectively,'' the newspaper quoted Sisavath as saying.
	   Laos has been seeking ways to protect itself from the Asian
economic crisis which has begun to pinch the reclusive, land-locked
nation. In recent years, the country been loosening controls both
in the economic sphere and, to a lesser extent, in politics.
	   The country's premier also blamed excessive layers of
bureaucracy which ``have hindered overall national productivity.''
	   Some foreign officials viewed the prime minister's frank remarks
as a signal the government is willing to implement more measures to
streamline the public sector.

Negotiators hammer out details of final communique
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Negotiators from the world's newest
nuclear states were sequestered behind closed doors Sunday to
hammer out the details of a final communique wrapping up three days
of talks.
	   ``Preparing a joint statement is not an easy thing,'' said Tariq
Altaf, the spokesman for Pakistan's foreign ministry outside the
opulent Punjab House.
	   The foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India were wrapping up
three days of talks during which time they discussed the dispute
over Kashmir, which has dogged their relations since independence
from colonial rule in 1947.
	   The talks in Pakistan are the first high level negotiations in
more than a year and the first since the two countries conducted
nuclear explosions in May, generating fears of a nuclear arms race
on the subcontinent.
	   Both India and Pakistan possess missiles capable of carrying
single and multiple nuclear warheads. Their missiles can strike
deep inside each other's territory.
	   While India has offered Pakistan a no-first-use pledge, most
analysts here say such an agreement is untenable for a
conventionally weaker Pakistan. Pakistan's nuclear facilities, as
well as command and control centers, could be swiftly destroyed by
India's conventional power.
	   It's widely accepted that talks resumed after a one year hiatus
due to international pressure, most notably from the United States,
which has slapped economic sanctions on both countries.
	   For India the sanctions are meddlesome, but not damaging. For
cash-strapped Pakistan they are devastating. The sanctions also
effect international lending institutions like the International
Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.
	   Both nations are being asked to sign the comprehensive test ban
treaty as the first step toward lifting sanctions. Both countries
have expressed their willingness, but the United States is looking
for a stronger commitment.
	   The next round of talks are to be held in New Delhi in November.

Japanese, Russia prepare for visit by Japanese prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's foreign minister has finalized plans for
next month's visit by Japan's prime minister to the Russian
capital, the latest sign of improving relations between the two
countries, a news report said Sunday.
	   Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura wrapped up his trip Saturday
evening after meeting Russian officials to discuss a territorial
dispute that has prevented the two countries from concluding a
World War II peace treaty, ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The Kuril Islands, located off Russia's Pacific Coast, were
captured by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II, but are
still claimed by Japan.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia will not sign a
treaty that infringes on its national interests, but Japan has been
cautious about investment and economic cooperation with Russia
because of lack of movement in dispute.
	   The two sides have been holding periodic talks on the issue, but
have not announced any breakthroughs. Ivanov gave an upbeat
assessment, saying the two sides were making progress.
	   The foreign ministers agreed on a date for a summit between
Russian President Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
to be held Nov. 10-13. It will be the first visit by a Japanese
premier to the Russian capital in 25 years, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   However, Russia and Japan have been holding summits in recent
years, and Japan's former prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, met
with Yeltsin in Russia's Siberia region last year.
	   Komura also assured Russian economic officials that Japan will
continue to release installments of a dlrs 1.5 billion loan granted
to Russia by the Japanese Export-Import Bank, Komura's press
spokesman Masaki Okada said.
	   Of the dlrs 600 million the bank said it would disburse this
year, dlrs 400 million have already been sent to Russia, Okada
said.
	   In meetings with Komura, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
thanked Japan for its support of Russia's economic reforms, and
accepted an invitation to visit Japan. The two also discussed the
long-delayed peace treaty.

General strike paralyzes Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ At least 15 people were injured in
clashes in the capital of Bangladesh Sunday during a general strike
protesting how the government is handling flood relief.
	   Nearly 5,000 police and paramilitary soldiers have been deployed
in Dhaka, the Home Ministry said.
	   An alliance of seven opposition parties have enforced a 12-hour
shutdown accusing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government of
harassing opposition activists and siphoning off funds meant for
people affected by recent floods.
	   Hasina denied the allegations in a nationwide speech over
state-run radio and television Saturday night.
	   Most traffic was stopped and stores closed Sunday, paralyzing
the city of nine million people.
	   Police detained at least 50 protesters on charges of exploding
home-made firecrackers and smashing vehicles that defied the
strike, United News of Bangladesh said.
	   Sunday is a working day in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh,
where the sabbath is observed on Friday.

Pakistan avoids follow-on

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan averted a follow-on on the
fourth day of the second cricket Test against Australia Sunday.
	   Replying to Australia's 599 for four, the home team was 410 for
three at lunch with Inzamamul Haq batting on 70 and veteran Salim
Malik unbeaten on 11. The match appeared to be heading toward a
draw.
	   Pakistan required another 71 runs to avoid follow-on when it
resumed at the overnight total of 329 for two.
	   Australian seam bowlers Damien Fleming and Glenn McGrath bowled
to a steady line and length and kept both the Pakistan batsmen
Inzamamul Haq and Ijaz Ahmed on the defensive for half an hour.
	   Ijaz, unbeaten on 125, posted his career-best 155 before he
needlessly cut a wide delivery off leg-spinner Stuart MacGill and
got an edge to wicketkeeper Ian Healy. Pakistan's right-handed
batsman walked dejectedly to the dressing room.
	   Ahmed, playing in his 47th Test, bettered his previous best of
151 made against West Indies at Karachi last year. He hit two dozen
boundaries and faced 282 balls during his six and a hour vigil at
the crease.
	   Haq and Ahmed's 115-run third wicket partnership came in 133
minutes.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived, but
Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels also blamed each other in new
shooting attacks.
	   The conflicting events Saturday represented progress and setback
for last week's agreement that was intended to peacefully resolve
the conflict in the secessionist province in southern Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   A NATO attack plan remains on standby if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic fails to comply fully with the agreement, which
calls for him to reduce military forces in Kosovo to the levels
before his crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in February.
	   He also must give full access to the 2,000 ``compliance
verifiers'' and relief agencies trying to help scores of thousands
of Albanian refugees return to their homes before winter sets in.
	   NATO began an aerial surveillance mission Saturday by sending
U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern
Balkans. Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights Thursday as
part the peace agreements.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians,
have been displaced from their homes.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic was pulling back at
least two of seven force battalions as demanded by NATO commander
Wesley Clark on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   NATO had given Milosevic until Saturday morning to fully comply
with international demands, but hours before the deadline was to
expire, NATO extended it until Oct. 27.
	   Clark was to return to Belgrade on Monday to reinforce to
Yugoslav officials that the threat of attack ``remains alive,''
said the White House official, who spoke in Washington on condition
of anonymity.
	   Eight members of an advance team of specialists arrived in the
Kosovo capital Pristina last night and 17 more were expected later
Sunday.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the
54-nation OSCE, said in Vienna, Austria, that the group hopes to
have a sizable number of monitors in place in Kosovo in two weeks.
today.
	   Peter Erben, chief of staff of the OSCE mission in Bosnia, who
led the first group here said, ``Our only job is to set up and
prepare for the main group arriving today.'' The group will contain
various experts in technical matters, security, communications and
administration.
	   The leader will be John Sandrock from Vienna, chief of the
mission support section.
	   Meanwhile, members of a so-called Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission were scouting for accommodation in the towns of Pec and
Prizren to find accommodation for the 2,000 verification
inspectors.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have reported significant pullbacks by
Yugoslav forces in recent days but say the number remaining exceeds
the level required by the agreement reached by Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   But just a day after NATO gave Milosevic 10 more days to fulfill
his peace pledge, new attacks reported throughout the province put
new urgency into implementing the agreement.
	   In the worst of those, three Serb policemen were found killed
after what their colleagues said was a KLA grenade attack on the
house they occupied along a main Kosovo road in Orlate, 20 miles
(30 kilometers) southwest of the provincial capital of Pristina.
Two other police were seriously wounded, they said. AP reporters
who drove by the house saw the Serbs' bloodied bodies on the second
floor.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina claimed earlier that KLA
``extremists'' had staged more than a dozen attacks on Serb forces
since late Friday. Machine-gun fire, mortars and grenades allegedly
were used to target Serb police and at least two Serbs were
reported wounded.
	   A Serb police commander at the police checkpoint at Dragobilje
said the rebels are trying to ``use the agreement to open fire on
us.''
	   ``They want to provoke us into a response, and get NATO to
attack,'' said the commander, who goes by the nom de guerre Baja.
	   The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs for at least two of the
incidents, saying police in the Pristina suburb of Vranjevac had
opened fire, hitting several Albanian houses and a car.
	   The conflicting claims could not be independently confirmed.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. But aid workers
and U.S. officials have reported a steady return in the last few
days.
	   But signs of progress in implementing the Kosovo peace agreement
also continued Saturday.

 &UR; Zanardi wins seventh race of season &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: RECASTS, adds quotes, new material, clarifies winning time &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) _ It wasn't pretty, but Alex
Zanardi was happy to take his seventh CART FedEx victory of the
season under a sea of yellow flags in Sunday's Australian
IndyCarnival race.
	   In a race slowed by seven cautions for a total of 19 laps,
Zanardi, heading for the Formula One Williams team next season,
finished the race _ predictably _ under a yellow flag and .322
seconds ahead of pole winner Dario Franchitti of Scotland, who had
won three of his previous four races.
	   The race was shortened from its scheduled 65 laps to 2 hours,
allowing only 62 laps to be completed on the 4.5-kilometer
(2.795-mile) Surfers Paradise street circuit.
	   Zanardi finished in 2 hours, 1 minute, 51.70 seconds in an
average speed of 137.32 kilometers per hour (85.328 mph).
	   The win came after Zanardi, driving a Target/Chip Ganassi
Reynard Honda, edged ahead of Franchitti on a 13th-lap pit change _
the race's only lead change _ allowing the Italian to begin early
celebrations for his 32nd birthday on Friday.
	   Third place went to Christian Fittipaldi, who broke his leg in
an accident in last year's race here, while fourth was claimed by
defending champion Scott Pruett and fifth J.J. Lehto of Finland.
	   Seven cars went out of the race due to contact on the track,
including previous Australian winners Michael Andretti (1994), Paul
Tracy (1995), Jimmy Vasser (1996) and the retiring Bobby Rahal.
Tracy and Andretti blamed each other for one collision between the
two.
	   It was the eighth Australian race, with no one able to win the
event more than once.
	   Zanardi celebrated his win by doing five of his trademark
``doughnut'' circular spins in his car on the track immediately
after the race.
	   ``On Saturday, I had trouble with my gearbox, and it was
disappointing not to get my first pole of the year,'' said Zanardi,
who had to sit out the last 12 minutes of qualifying Saturday,
allowing Franchitti to win his fifth pole of the season.
	   ``But this circuit seems to be designed for my driving, so I'm
very pleased to come away with a win.''
	   Zanardi will jump circuits next year after winning the CART
series championship two years in a row.
	   ``It's another challenge, and life goes on,'' said Zanardi of
his move to Formula One. ``I would have liked to stay in CART for
the rest of my life, but I've only got a certain amount of years
left, and I thought it was important to do it now.''
	   Zanardi was trailing Franchitti by less than a second Sunday
when they and the top 13 cars pitted under a caution caused when
Michel Jourdain Jr., spun out between the ninth and 10th turns.
	   ``The problem was the first pit stop where we let Alex get track
position,'' said Franchitti. ``It went downhill from there.''
	   Rahal, who was making his final driving appearance in Australia
following his decision to retire at the end this season, came out
of the race
	   on the 19th lap after making contact with the wall.
	   ``It's very disappointing because I wanted to do well here,''
said Rahal,
	   46. ``I just glanced off the wall and that shot me back across
the track into the wall. I just made a mistake trying to be
aggressive.''
	   The starting grid was made up of only 27 cars instead of the
usual series
	   race total of 28. CART officials determined that the amount of
pit space available would only safely support 27 cars, so the
slowest qualifier of the weekend, Dennis Vitolo of the United
States, did not get a start.
	   Attendance figures of 93,000 on Sunday pushed the four-day crowd
to 245,000, breaking the previous record of 226,000 set last year.
	   CART officials said the previous best race-day attendance this
season was
	   at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, Calif., where 87,500
watched Zanardi
	   win his first race of the season on April 5.
	   Zanardi has reached 15 career wins faster than any driver in
CART history, accomplishing the feat in 50 races. If he wins the
season-ending Marlboro 500 on Nov. 1, he can tie the record of
eight wins in a season achieved by Andretti in 1991 and Al Unser
Jr., in 1994. (djp)

Macedonians have plenty of choices in parliamentary election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with polls opened at 0500 GMT, close at 1700 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Thirty-eight parties and alliances
competing in Sunday elections all were promising a brighter future
for a nation burdened by economic woes and ethnic tension.
	   Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and were to close at 7 p.m.
(1700 GMT).
	   The multitude of parties in the third parliamentary elections
since Macedonia abandoned its Communist single-party system in 1990
meant none stood a chance of winning a majority in the 120-seat
assembly.
	   The three partners of the ruling coalition _ the Social
Democratic Alliance or renamed Communists, the ethnic Albanians'
Party for Democratic Prosperity and the Socialists _ ran
separately.
	   A favorite of pro-reform voters was the recently formed
coalition of the VMRO-DPMNE party and Democratic Alternative.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 440,000 of Macedonia's 2 million
population, were expected to increase their representation. Their
desires for self-rule have drawn comparisons to those in
neighboring Kosovo.
	   U.N. peacekeepers and the ruling alliance headed by former
Communists turned pragmatists _ notably Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski and President Kiro Gligorov _ are credited with keeping
the country out of the trouble that engulfed much of former
Yugoslavia.
	   But Macedonia was the poorest of all six republics in the former
Yugoslavia, and its economy remains feeble with about 30 percent
unemployment and a dlrs 210 monthly average salary.
	   The Yugoslav wars and resulting sanctions on its neighbor and
main trade partner, Serbia, shut down many production lines and
trade routes.
	   Economic issues dominated the parties' campaign pitches to
Macedonia's 1.5 million voters.
	   ``Obvious democratic progress has been made in Macedonia in the
last four years,'' said Kent Patton, resident program officer of
the International Republican Institute. ``The stability of this
country, as long as people work through the system, is ensured.''

Fire reported at nuclear reactor site in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Fire broke out at a nuclear power
plant construction site in North Korea in June, but did not cause
serious damage, the South Korean government said Sunday.
	   The June 17 fire, believed caused by an overheated electric
heater, burned an industrial water tank, causing an estimated 36
million won (dlrs 25,700) in damage, the government said in a
report to parliament.
	   The damage was covered in part by 23 million won (dlrs 16,400)
in insurance money received by Korea Electric Power Corp., a South
Korean state utility contracted to build the plant, it said.
	   The South Korean contractor has been doing ground-leveling work
for the plant since last year. Main construction work has yet to
begin.
	   When completed by 2003, the plant will have two light-water
nuclear reactors provided by a U.S.-led international consortium
called the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization.
	   The reactors are a reward for North Korea's promise to abandon
its own nuclear program under a 1994 agreement with the United
States. The program was suspected of developing nuclear weapons.
	   In addition to the reactors, with a rated capacity of 1,000
megawatts each, North Korea is to receive 500,000 tons of
substitute fuel oil annually until the plant is completed by 2003.
	   North Korea is complaining that the project is behind schedule
and may not be completed by 2003 as promised.

Philippine lawmakers to observe Anwar's condition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 14 Filipino lawmakers plan
to attend the trial of jailed Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim
next month and observe how Malaysian authorities are treating him,
one of the 14 said Sunday.
	   The group would include a son of former President Corazon
Aquino, who, along with current Philippine leader Joseph Estrada,
has openly expressed her support to Anwar and his family.
	   ``We don't want to intervene in their processes but we know that
when there are eyes watching, sufferings are somehow eased,'' said
Heherson Alvarez, a member of the Philippine House of
Representatives.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired as deputy prime minister on Sept. 2 by
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. He was arrested Sept. 20
and later appeared in court with a black eye, bruises and a neck
brace, saying he was beaten in police custody.
	   Anwar has been charged with sexual misconduct and corruption,
but has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated.
	   The Philippine lawmakers plan to start their visit Nov. 2, the
day Anwar's trial starts, Alvarez told a Manila radio station.
	   Alvarez said they wanted the trip to remind Malaysian
authorities ``that human societies have changed and that there is
now a major concern for human rights in the world.''
	   At least 14 legislators have agreed to join the trip, including
Benigno Aquino III, the son of the former Philippine president, and
six Muslim lawmakers, Alvarez said.
	   Citing the Philippines' bitter experience under the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Alvarez urged Malaysia to consider
repealing a harsh law that allows the Malaysian government to
arrest and detain people without charges.
	   He warned that Malaysia's recent actions could affect its trade
relations with other countries.
	   Estrada and Indonesian president B.J. Habibie have spoken
against Anwar's arrest and treatment and said they were considering
boycotting a summit of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
leaders in Malaysia next month.
	   Last week, Anwar's daughter visited the two leaders and other
officials in the Philippines and Indonesia to seek support for her
father.
	   The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and a rift over Anwar could
endanger harmony within the regional trade bloc as it tries to work
cohesively to overcome the region's year-old financial storm.

Higo wins Fujitsu Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIBA, Japan (AP) _ Kaori Higo overcame swirling winds and shot
a 2-under-par 70 Sunday, winning her second title of the season by
one stroke in the Fujitsu Ladies.
	   In one of only six sub-par rounds Sunday, Higo sank three
birdies against one bogey as winds gusting up to 25 mph (40 kph)
whipped the 6,483-yard (5,900-meter), par-72 Tokyu 700 Club course.
	   The wind came from Typhoon Zeb, which was downgraded to a
tropical storm and crossed over southwestern Japan into the Sea of
Japan Sunday morning.
	   With a 5-under 211 total, Higo finished a stroke ahead of Kumiko
Hiyoshi, who shot a 71 Sunday.
	   Hiyoshi, winless since capturing her fourth title in the 1994
Japan Women's Open, and Higo both started the final round four
shots behind overnight leader Nahoko Hirao.
	   Hirao, in contention for her first title in two years as a pro,
struggled to a 76 and placed third at 3-under 213.
	   At 4-under, Higo was one shot behind Hirao and Hiyoshi after the
14th.
	   Playing in the penultimate group, she caught up with the two
leaders on the 374-yard (340-meter), par-4 15th, rolling in a
one-meter (3-foot) birdie putt.
	   Hirao, in the final group, fell behind with bogeys on the 15th
and the par-3 17th, while Hiyoshi, playing with Higo, bogeyed the
186-yard (159-meter) 17th.
	   ``In the swirling winds, I was too preoccupied with my own game
to pay attention to the other contenders,'' Higo said. ``There was
little strategy but lots of concentration.''
	   The victory, Higo's seventh in a 10-year career, was worth 10.8
million yen (dlrs 91,000) from a purse of 60 million yen (dlrs
506,000).

Sleet put out long-burning fires in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Heavy sleet has finally extinguished many of the
forest fires that had been raging out of control for months in
Russia's Far East, a news agency reported Sunday.
	   About 80,000 hectares (197,000 acres) of forest are still ablaze
after storms hit the Khabarovsk territory, down from 450,000
hectares (1 million acres) a week ago, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The region has spent more than dlrs 2.5 million to battle the
blazes, which spread quickly in an unusually dry summer and defied
firefighters' efforts to contain them.
	   The fires have burned more than 1.5 million hectares (3.7
million acres) of forest.

Parliament speaker says legislators want `concrete' reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament is willing to adopt unpopular
measures drafted by President Boris Yeltsin's government, but only
if it sees ``the light at the end of the tunnel,'' the parliament
speaker said.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who servers as speaker of
Russia's Duma, or lower house, said Saturday that parliament
supports Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, but wants to see him
``determine concrete priorities,'' according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Primakov has been in office for more than a month, but his
government has yet to offer a comprehensive plan to deal with the
country's economic crisis.
	   Seleznyov, who has indicated he may run for president in 2000
elections, said the government should reduce some taxes, review
customs and railway tariffs, and support domestic manufacturers.
	   Parliament is willing to consider unpopular reforms, but only if
Primakov's government shows it ``the light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Seleznyov said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Seleznyov also called for a truce in the political fighting that
pits many members of the parliament against President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   ``We must think about economic problems,'' he said. ``When they
are solved, political storms will subside too.''
	   The Communists in parliament are among the most vocal critics of
Yeltsin.

New nuclear states end talks without agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with talks over, communique offers nothing new.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Sequestered for three days,
negotiators of the world's newest nuclear states emerged Sunday
without an agreement, but with a promise to meet again in February
1999.
	   ``It's not that talks have failed ... this was just a
beginning,'' said India's chief negotiator and foreign secretary K.
Raghunath.
	   The joint communique was a brief statement that said the two
foreign secretaries discussed confidence building measures, but
there were none agreed upon. They also discussed peace and security
in a volatile region that has already seen three wars and now
openly possesses the ability to make nuclear weapons.
	   ``The nuclear issue was discussed and we agreed we will show
restraint,'' said Pakistan's negotiator and foreign secretary
Shamshad Ahmed.
	   At the heart of their three days of talks was the dispute over
Kashmir, which has dogged their relations since independence from
British colonial rule in 1947.
	   There was no resolution or statement related to Kashmir, where a
bloody guerrilla war is being waged on the Indian side of the
border. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the violence, a charge
that Islamabad denies.
	   In recent months cross-border attacks from both Indian and
Pakistani soldiers has increased and as many as 100 civilians on
both sides of the disputed border have been killed.
	   Both India and Pakistan have missiles capable of carrying
multiple and single nuclear warheads.
	   ``We discussed measures to avert the risk of a nuclear conflict
and to prevent an expensive nuclear arms race,'' said Ahmed.
	   The talks in Pakistan are the first high level negotiations in
more than a year and the first since the two countries conducted
nuclear explosions in May, generating fears of a nuclear arms race
on the subcontinent.
	   While India has offered Pakistan a no-first-use pledge, most
analysts here say such an agreement is untenable for a
conventionally weaker Pakistan. Pakistan's nuclear facilities, as
well as command and control centers, could be swiftly destroyed by
India's conventional power.
	   It's widely accepted that talks resumed after a one year hiatus
due to international pressure, most notably from the United States,
which has slapped economic sanctions on both countries.
	   For India the sanctions are meddlesome, but not damaging. For
cash-strapped Pakistan they are devastating. The sanctions also
effect international lending institutions like the International
Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.
	   Both nations are being asked to sign the comprehensive test ban
treaty as the first step toward lifting sanctions. Both countries
have expressed their willingness, but the United States is looking
for a stronger commitment.

Three climbers trapped in freezing weather are rescued
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Three Austrian climbers who were trapped
by freezing weather about 150 meters beneath the peak of Austria's
highest mountain, the Grossglockner, were plucked from the
mountainside by rescuers at daybreak Sunday, media reported.
	   The 3,797-meter high Grossglockner, located between Salzburg
province and eastern Tyrol in western Austria, can pose a serious
challenge even to experienced mountain climbers, especially because
of fast changing weather conditions in the area.
	   While seven of a group of ten mountaineers managed to reach a
makeshift shelter on Saturday, the three hung in the wall the whole
night at temperatures around minus 15 degrees celsius (5 F),
Austrian radio reported.
	   Rescuers later took the three men, who suffered unspecified
frostbites, to a lower-altitude mountain hut from where they were
helicoptered to safety despite adverse weather, a reporter of the
Austria Press Agency in Innsbruck said.
	   It was not immediately known if and how long they would have to
stay in hospital.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived, but
Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels also blamed each other in new
shooting attacks.
	   The conflicting events Saturday represented progress and setback
for last week's agreement that was intended to peacefully resolve
the conflict in the secessionist province in southern Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   A NATO attack plan remains on standby if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic fails to comply fully with the agreement, which
calls for him to reduce military forces in Kosovo to the levels
before his crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in February.
	   He also must give full access to the 2,000 ``compliance
verifiers'' and relief agencies trying to help scores of thousands
of Albanian refugees return to their homes before winter sets in.
	   NATO began an aerial surveillance mission Saturday by sending
U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern
Balkans. Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights Thursday as
part the peace agreements.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians,
have been displaced from their homes.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic was pulling back at
least two of seven force battalions as demanded by NATO commander
Wesley Clark on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   NATO had given Milosevic until Saturday morning to fully comply
with international demands, but hours before the deadline was to
expire, NATO extended it until Oct. 27.
	   Clark was to return to Belgrade on Monday to reinforce to
Yugoslav officials that the threat of attack ``remains alive,''
said the White House official, who spoke in Washington on condition
of anonymity.
	   Eight members of an advance team of specialists arrived in the
Kosovo capital Pristina last night and 17 more were expected later
Sunday.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the
54-nation OSCE, said in Vienna, Austria, that the group hopes to
have a sizable number of monitors in place in Kosovo in two weeks.
today.
	   Peter Erben, chief of staff of the OSCE mission in Bosnia, who
led the first group here said, ``Our only job is to set up and
prepare for the main group arriving today.'' The group will contain
various experts in technical matters, security, communications and
administration.
	   The leader will be John Sandrock from Vienna, chief of the
mission support section.
	   Initial reaction to the OSCE mission reflected the ethnic
divisions in Kosovo.
	   A Serbian man standing outside a Serbian Orthodox church Sunday
morning, said: ``They have never been good for the Serbian people,
even (in Bosnia) where they have already been. They have to see the
situation.''
	   An Albanian man in a red jacket, ``If they wanted to help they
should have done it before. At least it's not too late.l I think
it's better to have an agreement, even if it's too late.,'' Both
men declined to give their name.

Vatican foreign minister holds talks with Egyptian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Vatican's foreign minister, Monsignor
Jean Louis Tauran, said Sunday there would be no lasting peace in
the Middle East until the status of Jerusalem was decided.
	   He also told reporters after a meeting with President Hosni
Mubarak that the peace process cannot remain stalled because the
people of the region, especially the Palestinians, are suffering.
	   Talks between the two focused on the peace process. They came as
U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying to move Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations ahead with a special summit outside of Washington.
	   Tauran reiterated the Vatican's position that Jerusalem _ a city
revered by Muslims, Jews and Christians _ should be open to all
faiths and not just ``to one side.''
	   Christians and Muslims have long charged that Israeli control of
the city has put limits on the ability of Christians and Muslims to
worship freely at their holy sites.
	   The Palestinians want Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of
their would-be state. But Israel, which captured the Arab sector in
the 1967 Middle East War, has rejected this, saying that it will
not accept a divided Jerusalem.
	   Tauran, who arrived in Cairo on Saturday, said he delivered a
message to Mubarak from Pope John Paul II. The contents of the
message were not made public.

Rios trounces Woodforde to win Singapore Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Marcelo Rios trounced Australia's Mark
Woodforde 6-4, 6-2 Sunday for the championship of the Singapore
Open indoor tennis tournament, and said he is on his way back to
the world's No. 1 ranking.
	   The 33-year-old Woodforde, a doubles expert playing his first
singles final in four years, couldn't keep up with the blistering
pace of the 22-year-old Chilean.
	   ``I was No. 1, then I went to No. 3, and now I'm coming back,''
Rios said after winning his seventh title of the year, worth dlrs
107,000. ``I feel pretty good right now. I'm really excited about
playing tournaments.''
	   Helping Rios' in his effort to move back up the rankings, No. 2
Patrick Rafter of Australia lost in the quarterfinals of the CA
Trophy tournament in Vienna, where No. 1 Pete Sampras was to play
in the final later Sunday.
	   At the start, Woodforde's composed play seemed to put some
pressure on Rios, who nevertheless managed to handle the
Australian's variety of slow and fast shots. But in the fifth game,
two unforced errors by Woodforde gave Rios the chance he needed,
and the Chilean broke serve.
	   Woodforde tried more aggressive tactics, but Rios kept him
pegged to the baseline with well-placed deep returns and produced
passing shots with ease on the few occasions Woodforde dared
approach.
	   Rios broke again in the second set's first game with deadly
placements and excellent play at the net.
	   Woodforde broke back for 2-2 on an error by Rios and a fine
passing shot, but after that the Australian was making the errors
and Rios did not let him hold serve again in the 70-minute match.
	   Woodforde collected dlrs 56,100 for the singles and then joined
fellow Australian Todd Woodbridge for a 6-2, 6-3 victory over
India's Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes for the doubles title.

After the Poles, pope celebrates 20 years with Romans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Wrapping up a week of celebration of 20
years as pontiff, John Paul II on Sunday asked for prayers to keep
him going in guiding his church and helping people find truth in
the world.
	   Two days earlier, it was his fellow Poles who feted the former
archbishop of Krakow in St. Peter's Square. On Sunday, tens of
thousands of Romans and other Italians turned out for the pope's
Mass on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica.
	   His thin, white hair blowing in a warm breeze, the 78-year-old
pope appeared tired but his voice was strong as he thanked all
those who in the days leading up to the anniversary of his Oct. 16,
1978 election as pontiff sent him messages of solidarity.
	   ``Above all, thanks for the constant recollection in prayer,''
John Paul said. ``I feel near to me the heart of the church.''
	   ``I'd like in this moment to tell all of you dear people how
precious your support for me was in these 20 years of service,''
the pope added in his homily.
	   ``The prayer of the people support he who has the task to guide
them,'' said the ailing John Paul, who walks with difficulty and
has a constant hand tremor.
	   As he did 20 years ago, John Paul told the crowd, he was
``trusting in Divine Providence'' so that he may ``carry out right
to end the mission'' of the papacy.
	   Earlier in the Mass, he recalled how, when he was chosen to lead
the Roman Catholic church, ``aware of the great difficulty, I
accepted.''
	   John Paul confided how in these days he has been reflecting on
his role as pontiff and wondering if he met the faithful's
expectations.
	   He asked himself, he said, how well he has responded to the
``hunger for truth that we feel in the world, outside the church.''
	   Arrangements of daisies and of roses in white and yellow, the
colors of the Vatican, adorned the altar area in the sunny square.
	   John Paul wore gold-colored robes while the cardinals in the
front-row had vestments in bright green, which signifies hope and
life in the church.
	   Among the VIPs was the Italian head of state, President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro.

Ballesteros attacks new world tournaments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN PAGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Spain's Severiano Ballesteros on Sunday
launched a stinging attack on the granting of Order of Merit and
Ryder Cup points to the new World Golf Championship events to be
inaugurated next year.
	   ``This is the most ridiculous decision the European Tour has
ever made, '' the Spanish star said.
	   ``It is simply not fair. There's so much money to be won and
only a few European players will be there. Ninety percent of
European players against this.''
	   The World Golf Championship will consist of three events in 1999
to which a fourth will be added in the year 2,000.
	   Each event offers a 5 million dollar prize-fund, with the
winner's check as yet undecided.
	   ``A player could win one of these tournaments and win the Order
of Merit. That has to be wrong,'' Ballesteros said.
	   Next year the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship is
scheduled for February 24 through 28 at La Costa resort, Carlsbad,
Calif, to be followed by the NEC Invitational at Firestone Country
Club, Akron, Ohio August 26 through 29 and the American Stroke Play
Championship at Valderrama, Spain November 4-7.
	   Only the Match Play will affect Ryder Cup points for 1999.
	   In the year 2,000 the World Cup Team Championship will be added
to the schedule.
	   Players will qualify for the limited-field events through their
position on the PGA Tours International money list. The Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship will offer 64 slots in the
line-up. Currently only 10 European players figure in the top-65 of
the World Rankings.
	   ``We must have a players' meeting about this on the Tuesday
before the Volvo Masters in Valderrama at the end of the month,''
Ballesteros stressed.
	   ``Something has to change. These qualifications must not happen.
They will not happen,'' he said.
	   Ballesteros has dropped out of the world top-200 and currently
stands 116 in Europe.

New party blames violence on people trying to maintain status quo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A new Muslim party on Sunday blamed
recent violence in Indonesia on people trying to preserve the
status quo.
	   In a rally attended by about 15,000 member and supporters at
Jakarta's Senayan Sports Palace, leaders of the National Awakening
Party also said that democracy remained muzzled under an
authoritarian political system.
	   The party, known as PKB for its Indonesian acronym, was set up
in July by the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's
largest Muslim organization.
	   ``PKB and followers of NU condemn all kinds of anarchy and of
taking the law into one's own hands, ignoring laws and human
rights,'' said party chairman Matori Abdul Jalil. ``We urge all the
nation's components to always uphold the supremacy of law.''
	   Referring to killings, rapes and terror against volunteers and
human rights activists, Matori said, ``The political motives of the
violence are clear, which is to preserve the status quo.''
	   His remarks came in the wake of more than 150 mysterious
killings of alleged black-magic practitioners and NU preachers in
East and Central Java.
	   On Saturday, Abdurahman Wahid, leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, said
certain government officials were behind those killings, which
began in August.
	   Earlier, Wahid had urged the military to better protect
Indonesians.
	   New parties have sprung up since the end of 32 years of
authoritarian rule by Suharto, who quit in May amid widespread
riots and protests. About 1,200 people were killed in that
violence, and more than 160 women, mostly Chinese, were reported
raped.
	   Suharto was replaced by B.J. Habibie, who has promised reform
and wider democracy, but many critics consider his administration a
continuation of the Suharto era.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived, but
fighting appeared to continue with Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels
blaming each other for new shooting attacks.
	   The conflicting events Saturday represented mixed results for
last week's agreement that was intended to peacefully resolve the
conflict in the secessionist province in southern Serbia.
	   A NATO attack remains on standby in case Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic fails to comply fully with the agreement, which
calls for him to reduce military forces in Kosovo to the levels
before his crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in February.
	   He also must give full access to 2,000 ``compliance verifiers''
and relief agencies trying to help thousands of Albanian refugees
return home before winter sets in.
	   NATO began aerial surveillance Saturday by sending U-2 planes
over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern Balkans.
Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights Thursday as part of
the peace agreement.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians,
have been forced from their homes.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic was pulling back at
least two of seven battalions, as demanded by NATO commander Wesley
Clark on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   NATO had given Milosevic until Saturday morning to fully comply
with international demands, but hours before the deadline was to
expire, NATO extended it until Oct. 27.
	   Clark was to return to Belgrade on Monday to reiterate to
Yugoslav officials that the threat of attack ``remains alive,''
said the White House official, who spoke in Washington on condition
of anonymity.
	   Eight members of an advance team of specialists arrived in the
Kosovo capital Pristina Saturday night and 17 more were expected
later Sunday.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the
54-nation OSCE, said in Vienna, Austria, that the group hopes to
have a sizable number of monitors in place in Kosovo within two
weeks.
	   Peter Erben, chief of staff of the OSCE mission in Bosnia, said:
``Our only job is to set up and prepare for the main group arriving
today.'' The group will contain various experts in security,
communications and administration.
	   The leader will be John Sandrock from Vienna, chief of the
mission support section.

Behind scenes at summit: scrambled phones, hairdresser tangle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ If Israelis and Palestinians have one thing in
common, it's their passion for their mobile telephones. Many give
the impression they'd rather stroll the streets naked than be
caught without a cell phone at the ready.
	   So the no-phones rule at the Mideast summit on Maryland's
Eastern Shore initially caused dismay among both delegations.
	   Israeli media, however, reported Sunday that summit participants
had succeeded in getting around the restrictions, which were part
of an effort by the American hosts to help along the secret talks
by discouraging news leaks.
	   One account gave the credit to hard-line Jewish settler leader
Aharon Domb, who traveled to the United States to campaign against
any land-for-peace accord. The Jerusalem Post said Domb ``somehow
figured out that by dialing a certain random combination of
numbers, one could unscramble the scramble.''
	   It said he passed the information to the Israeli delegation, who
in turn gave their Palestinian counterparts the news. Ahmed Tibi,
an aide to Yasser Arafat, reportedly conveyed his thanks.
	   ___
	   At home in Israel, gossiping about first lady Sarah Netanyahu is
a favorite pastime. Even with a change of scene to Maryland's
Eastern Shore, that remains a constant.
	   Mrs. Netanyahu raised eyebrows here with her decision to
accompany Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Wye Plantation
retreat where the talks are being held _ despite the fact that
spouses were explicitly uninvited.
	   On Sunday, the Maariv newspaper reported that Mrs. Netanyahu's
hairdresser was initially denied permission to enter the retreat
grounds, and was finally allowed in only after high-level
intervention.
	   The newspaper also said the White House had hoped Sarah
Netanyahu would stay at a Washington hotel rather than the summit
retreat. To entice her to do so, it even acquired coveted tickets
for a wildly popular Van Gogh exhibit in the capital.
	   But Mrs. Netanyahu has instead remained at the retreat.
	   In Israel, the first lady has been the target of pointed press
reports over everything from flying into a rage when her children's
nanny burned the soup to throwing shoes when angered.
	   ___
	   Observation of the Jewish Sabbath _ when work is proscribed _
caused a mini-controversy at the summit.
	   Israel's National Religious Party has reportedly demanded a
formal apology from Netanyahu for what they said was desecration of
the Sabbath by working on Saturday.
	   Israeli spokesman Aviv Bushinsky told Israel radio, however,
that even though Netanyahu engaged in talks that day, they were
informal, with no notes taken.
	   And he said the prime minister refrained from using the
telephone _ in line with the practices of religious Jews, who do
not operate machinery of any kind on the Sabbath.
	   Some in the Israeli delegation complained about being confined
to the Wye retreat for the day of worship _ and some unofficial
guests were unhappy about being kept out.
	   Domb, the settler leader, told Israel radio that he and some
Orthodox Jews who had hoped to enter the retreat grounds and pray
with Netanyahu were turned away. The group had even brought a Torah
scroll with them.
	   The Americans reportedly declared that even without any guests,
the Israelis had plenty of personnel for a ``minyan'' _ the group
of 10 men required for Jewish prayer services.
	   ___
	   The summit is being staged at a luxurious estate, but some
members of the Israeli security detail reportedly found themselves
roughing it a bit.
	   Israel radio said some of Netanyahu's bodyguards found
themselves spending the night in sleeping bags after the Americans
enforced a rule of only one person per room.
	   The report cited a member of the prime minister as saying the
Americans had taken over several rooms they had though were
designated for the Israeli delegation.
	   The Israelis suspected that as a ploy to eavesdrop, the report
said.

Mormon missionary stabbed to death in Russia, suspect arrested

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police arrested a suspect in a stabbing attack on
two Mormon Church missionaries in central Russia that left one dead
and the other hospitalized, police said Sunday.
	   A group of assailants stabbed to death Jose Manuel Mackintosh,
20, and wounded Bradley Alan Borden, 20, after the pair left the
home of a Mormon family in Ufa, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
east of Moscow, according to a press release issued by the church
in the United States.
	   Borden was in stable condition in an Ufa hospital, the statement
added. Both the missionaries are from the United States.
	   Investigators believe the stabbing was an indiscriminate attack
and was not directed toward the Mormon church, said Alexander
Ovchinnikov, police chief for the district that includes Ufa, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Witnesses said that the man who killed Mackintosh was drunk at
the time, the report said. Police did not release the name of the
arrested man.
	   ``We understand that this tragedy was a random act of violence
and that there was no premeditation,'' said L. Aldin Porter, an
official with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in
Utah. ``Our representatives in Russia will cooperate fully with
local authorities in their investigation.''
	   Mackintosh, from Hiko, Nevada, had been a missionary in Russia
for just over a year. Borden, of Mesa, Arizona, arrived in January.
	   The young missionaries, dressed in white shirts and dark ties,
work in pairs and are easy targets for harassment. In March, two
Mormon missionaries were held hostage for four days in southern
Russia before being released unharmed.
	   There are about 500 Mormon missionaries in Russia, among 57,000
mostly young men the church has deployed around the globe.

Estrada urges Filipinos to emulate Singaporeans' cleanliness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Impressed by Singapore's clean
streets and toilets, President Joseph Estrada urged Filipinos
Sunday to emulate Singaporeans' clean habits to help ward off
diseases.
	   ``Even the public toilets there are clean and users do not steal
the toilet paper and soap as what is likely to happen in public
toilets here,'' Estrada said in a statement.
	   Estrada was in Singapore last week for a state visit and an
international economic summit, where he delivered a keynote
address.
	   He said he noticed Singaporeans didn't litter in the streets and
kept their public toilets clean and smelling good.
	   He said Filipinos can outdo the Singaporeans in cleanliness,
which would help prevent diseases like a recent dengue fever
outbreak.
	   Next month, Estrada said, he will lead a nationwide clean-up of
canals and waterways. He also plans to impose salary cuts on
presidential palace employees who don't keep their offices clean.
	   Manila has been criticized for its filth. Last month, Manila's
city council voted to ban the movies of Hollywood actress Claire
Danes because of her reported statements, among which was a
description of Manila as smelling ``of cockroaches, with rats all
over and ... there is no sewerage system.''
	   In the ensuing debate in newspaper columns and editorial pages,
some newspapers castigated the actress and others said the city
council should clean up Manila instead of criticizing the remarks.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The crowd was small at the battered wooden
table that doubles as an outdoor voter registration center, just a
half-dozen people filling out forms and gossiping about politics.
	   ``We've seen this many times before,'' said Lucky Chrohian, a
furniture maker who stopped by to register. ``We've voted many
times and then they cancel everything. We are now praying that this
one we are doing, we are not doing it for nothing.''
	   Having seen democracy stumble repeatedly over the past four
decades and give way to a string of military regimes, Nigerians are
trying again.
	   The new ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has vowed to end
military control. Elections _ local, state and finally presidential
_ are scheduled for late this year and early 1999.
	   But with just four months until presidential polling, the
political process is stumbling. Voter registration is plagued by
bureaucratic foul-ups and the parties seldom mention issues.
	   Years of ethnic bitterness overshadows the politicking.
	   ``The election is not important,'' said Beko Ransome-Kuti, an
activist and former political prisoner. ``Abubakar seems OK, but
what we're saying is: He's one of them; he's a northerner.''
	   His comments reflect the deep vein of ethnic enmity that runs
through Nigeria. Northerners, mostly Muslims of the Hausa-Fulani
ethnic groups, have long controlled Nigeria, while Christians and
animists of the Yoruba southwest and Ibo southeast have been
largely excluded.
	   Nigerians make no secret of the ethnic divide.
	   Chrohian, a Yoruba, said it wasn't enough that Nigeria's leaders
have indicated a southerner should be the new president. ``We don't
want any northerners and we don't want southerners. I want a
Yoruba.''
	   In an effort to quell the divisiveness, the junta will allow
only parties that demonstrate national support to field candidates
in state and national balloting. To do that, a party must win at
least 10 percent of the votes cast in local elections in each of at
least 24 of the 36 states.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived, but
Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels also blamed each other in new
shooting attacks.
	   The conflicting events Saturday represented progress and setback
for last week's agreement that was intended to peacefully resolve
the conflict in the secessionist province in southern Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   A NATO attack plan remains on standby if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic fails to comply fully with the agreement, which
calls for him to reduce military forces in Kosovo to the levels
before his crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in February.
	   He also must give full access to the 2,000 ``compliance
verifiers'' and relief agencies trying to help scores of thousands
of Albanian refugees return to their homes before winter sets in.
	   NATO began an aerial surveillance mission Saturday by sending
U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern
Balkans. Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights Thursday as
part the peace agreements.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army. More than 300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians,
have been displaced from their homes.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic was pulling back at
least two of seven force battalions as demanded by NATO commander
Wesley Clark on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   NATO had given Milosevic until Saturday morning to fully comply
with international demands, but hours before the deadline was to
expire, NATO extended it until Oct. 27.
	   Clark was to return to Belgrade on Monday to reinforce to
Yugoslav officials that the threat of attack ``remains alive,''
said the White House official, who spoke in Washington on condition
of anonymity.
	   Eight members of an advance team of specialists arrived in the
Kosovo capital Pristina Saturday night and 17 more were expected
later Sunday.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the
54-nation OSCE, said in Vienna, Austria, that the group hopes to
have a sizable number of monitors in place in Kosovo in two weeks.
today.
	   Peter Erben, chief of staff of the OSCE mission in Bosnia, who
led the first group here said, ``Our only job is to set up and
prepare for the main group arriving today.'' The group will contain
various experts in technical matters, security, communications and
administration.
	   The leader will be John Sandrock from Vienna, chief of the
mission support section.
	   Initial reaction to the OSCE mission reflected the ethnic
divisions in Kosovo.
	   A Serbian man standing outside a Serbian Orthodox church Sunday
morning, said: ``They have never been good for the Serbian people,
even (in Bosnia) where they have already been. They have to see the
situation.''
	   An Albanian man in a red jacket, ``If they wanted to help they
should have done it before. At least it's not too late.l I think
it's better to have an agreement, even if it's too late.,'' Both
men declined to give their name.

Opposition party criticizes election registration plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ An opposition party on Sunday
criticized a plan to allow only three days for voter registation
for the 1999 elections, saying it would ``undermine democracy.''
	   The Independent Electoral Commission announced Wednesday that
South Africa's 25 million eligible voters would have only from Nov.
27 through Nov. 29 to register for the elections.
	   The Pan Africanist Congress said the commission should allow at
least 14 days for voter registration.
	   ``Three days are not enough. It will result in barring many
potential voters from voting, especially in the rural areas,'' said
PAC Deputy President Motsoko Pheko. ``This will cause a low turn up
for the 1999 elections and thus undermine democracy in the
country.''
	   The electoral commission also said people must register in the
district where they reside and vote in the same district.
	   An election date has not been set yet. It is expected to be held
around the middle of next year.
	   President Nelson Mandela, whose African National Congress won
the first all-race elections in 1994 which marked the end of
apartheid, plans to retire at the end of his term. Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki is widely expected to succeed him.

Turkey confirms security talks with Syria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ High-ranking officials from Turkey and
Syria will meet Monday at a secret location to hold security talks
aimed at easing tensions between the neighbors, foreign ministry
officials confirmed Sunday.
	   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said late Saturday that talks would
take place but gave no indication as to where and when they would
be held.
	   Turkey accuses Syria of sheltering Turkish Kurdish rebels
responsible for cross-border attacks and indicated last month it
might resort to military action unless Damascus halted alleged
support to the insurgents. The threat raised fears of war in the
region.
	   ``In the meeting our representatives will assess how well
Turkey's demands over separatist terrorism are being met,'' Cem
told the Anatolia news agency. ``And, if they are being met, (we
will assess) if the measures are enough and lasting.''
	   Follow-up meetings would depend on how convincing Syrian
officials were on promises to clamp down on the activities of the
rebel group, said a foreign ministry official speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Turkish newspapers gave conflicting reports as to where the
talks would be held. Possible venues included the Turkish and
Syrian capitals as well as borders towns.

Taiwan condemns exclusion of official from Jiang meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-China-Taiwan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's main opposition party denounced
the exclusion of an ally from a meeting with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin on Sunday, calling it proof that China is trying to
diminish the island's democracy.
	   Kang Ning-hsiang's exclusion was a Chinese strategy to weaken
Taiwan's argument that its democracy makes it impossible to agree
to Chinese demands for reunification, said Chiu Yi-jen,
secretary-general of the Democratic Progressive Party.
	   Reports in Taipei said Kang, a member of Taiwan's government
watchdog body, originally had been on the list of those who would
meet with Jiang at the end of a historic visit to China by top
Taiwanese negotiator Koo Chen-fu.
	   As an opposition legislator for almost two decades, Kang had
urged Taiwan's hard-line Nationalist regime to democratize and
moderate its determination to reunify Taiwan with China regardless
of public opinion.
	   The DPP, which advocates formal independence for Taiwan from
China, holds about a third of the seats in the legislature. Surveys
show the overwhelming majority of Taiwanese reject China's demand
for near-term reunification with the mainland, insisting that China
must first become more democratic and prosperous.
	   Kang was suspended from the DPP in 1990 when he joined the
government's National Unification Council, which advises on China
policy.
	   Chiu said Kang's exclusion was from the meeting with Jiang was
more likely due to his reputation as an advocate of democracy and
human rights than his DPP connections.
	   Kang, however, did meet with Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen, a
reunification hard-liner, earlier Sunday with the rest of Koo's
delegation.
	   Koo's China visit led to a commitment by the two sides to hold
further talks aimed at restoring formal dialogue broken off by
Beijing in 1995.

Vatican foreign minister holds talks with Egyptian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Vatican's foreign minister, Monsignor
Jean Louis Tauran, said Sunday there would be no lasting peace in
the Middle East until the status of Jerusalem was decided.
	   He also told reporters after a meeting with President Hosni
Mubarak that the peace process cannot remain stalled because the
people of the region, especially the Palestinians, are suffering.
	   Talks between the two focused on the peace process. They came as
U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying to move Israeli and
Palestinian negotiations ahead with a special summit outside of
Washington.
	   Tauran reiterated the Vatican's position that Jerusalem _ a city
revered by Muslims, Jews and Christians _ should be open to all
faiths.
	   Christians and Muslims have long charged that Israeli control of
the city has put limits on the ability of Christians and Muslims to
worship freely at their holy sites.
	   The Palestinians want Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of
their would-be state. But Israel, which captured the Arab sector in
the 1967 Middle East War, has rejected this, saying that it will
not accept a divided Jerusalem.
	   Tauran, who arrived in Cairo on Saturday, said he delivered a
message to Mubarak from Pope John Paul II. The contents of the
message were not made public.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Marcelo Rios trounced Australia's Mark
Woodforde 6-4, 6-2 Sunday to win the Singapore Open indoor tennis
tournament, and said he is on his way back to the world's top
ranking.
	   The 33-year-old Woodforde, a doubles expert playing his first
singles final in four years, couldn't keep up with the blistering
pace of the 22-year-old Chilean.
	   ``I was No. 1, then I went to No. 3, and now I'm coming back,''
Rios said after winning his seventh title of the year, worth dlrs
107,000. ``I feel pretty good right now. I'm really excited about
playing tournaments.''
	   Rios' climb back up the rankings was aided when No. 2 Patrick
Rafter of Australia lost in the quarterfinals of the CA Trophy
tournament in Vienna, where No. 1 Pete Sampras of the United States
was to play in the final later Sunday.
	   Rios is expected to replace Rafter in the second spot when the
ATP rankings are released Monday.
	   At the start, Woodforde's composed play seemed to put some
pressure on Rios, who nevertheless managed to handle the
Australian's variety of slow and fast shots. But in the fifth game,
two unforced errors by Woodforde gave Rios the chance he needed,
and the Chilean broke serve.
	   Woodforde tried more aggressive tactics, but Rios kept him
pegged to the baseline with well-placed deep returns and produced
passing shots with ease on the few occasions Woodforde dared
approach.
	   Rios broke again in the second set's first game with deadly
placements and excellent play at the net.
	   Woodforde broke back for 2-2 on an error by Rios and a fine
passing shot, but after that the Australian was making the errors
and Rios did not let him hold serve again in the 70-minute match.
	   Woodforde collected dlrs 56,100 for his singles performance, and
then split dlrs 46,000 with fellow Australian Todd Woodbridge for
the doubles title. They won the final 6-2, 6-3 against India's
Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes.

Warne's first test hopes slide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Star spinner Shane Warne has missed
his planned return to cricket after shoulder surgery, placing him
in doubt for the first Ashes test against England next month.
	   Warne was left out of the Victorian state team's Sheffield
Shield match against Tasmania starting Wednesday.
	   Warne had surgery in May and while there were early scares that
he might miss up to two years, he soon targeted this week's game as
his return.
	   Victoria has another Shield match scheduled before the first
test against England in Brisbane on Nov. 20. It remains possible
for Warne to recover in time for the first of the five tests, but
no-one is prepared to risk further damage to the match-winning
spinner.
	   Victorian spokesman Shaun Graf said Warne, the state captain,
had wanted to be considered for a place.
	   ``He was keen to but from a bowling point of view he has not
done much,'' Graf said. ``He needs to get in the nets and do a bit
of bowling and we'll see how he is from there. We'll need to get a
medical report to give him the all-clear.''

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Sequestered for three days,
negotiators of the world's newest nuclear states emerged Sunday
without an agreement, but with a promise to meet again in February
1999.
	   ``It's not that talks have failed ... this was just a
beginning,'' said India's chief negotiator and foreign secretary
K.Raghunath.
	   The joint communique was a brief statement that said the two
foreign secretaries discussed confidence building measures, but
there were none agreed upon. They also discussed peace and security
in a volatile region that has already seen three wars and is
threatened by nuclear weapons.
	   ``Both sides underscored their commitment to reduce risk of a
conflict by building mutual confidence in the nuclear and
conventional fields,'' the statement said without elaborating.
	   At the heart of their three days of talks was the dispute over
Kashmir, which has dogged relations since independence from British
colonial rule in 1947.
	   There was no resolution or statement related to Kashmir, where a
bloody guerrilla war is being waged on the Indian side of the
border. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting violence on its side of
the border, a charge that Islamabad denies.
	   Both sides reiterated their positions on Kashmir, they said.
	   Pakistan's negotiator and Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed said
the two neighbors cannot improve their relations until this core
issue is resolved.
	   In recent months cross-border attacks from both Indian and
Pakistani soldiers has increased and as many as 100 civilians on
both sides of the disputed border have been killed.
	   The two sides discussed their ballistic missile capability as
well as conventional arsenals, he said. Both India and Pakistan
have missiles capable of carrying multiple and single nuclear
warheads.
	   ``We discussed measures to avert the risk of a nuclear conflict
and to prevent an expensive nuclear arms race,'' said Ahmed.
	   The talks in Pakistan are the first high level negotiations in
more than a year and the first since the two countries conducted
nuclear explosions in May, generating world fears of a nuclear arms
race on the volatile subcontinent.
	   Shamim Akhter, a political analyst in the southern port city of
Karachi, said no one had hopes of a major breakthrough.
	   ``But the two countries have broken a long spell of deadlock
which in itself is a positive development,'' he said.

All niceties aside, Taiwan flatly rejects `one China' position

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After a day of frank, sometimes forceful talk
with senior Chinese leaders, Taiwan's chief envoy to China said
Sunday that differences between the rival governments remain great
but will narrow only through more talks.
	   Koo Chen-fu capped his path-breaking five-day visit to the
mainland by meeting Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Although the two
have met previously on the sidelines of international meetings,
Sunday's get-together was the first inside China.
	   Koo described Jiang as an ``old friend.'' In their meeting,
which ran a half-hour beyond its scheduled hour's length, he said
the two very generally discussed relations between the governments
_ the political heirs to the unfinished Chinese civil war.
	   ``Not a single person was angry. If there was anger, we would
not have been able to talk with each other for an hour and a
half,'' Koo told reporters.
	   The talk was more pointed in Koo's first appointment Sunday with
Vice Premier Qian Qichen, the communist government's leading
strategist on dealing with the island.
	   Koo told Qian Taipei flatly rejects Beijing's most fundamental
positions: that Taiwan is a part of one China and that the island
should accept a local autonomy formula similar to the one given
Hong Kong last year.
	   Taiwan is a sovereign state and will accept no lesser status,
said a statement issued by Koo's delegation.
	   Afterward, Tang Shubei, one of China's most senior negotiators
with Taiwan, warned Taipei to change its position or risk harming
the progress the two sides have made. He told reporters that
Beijing would not budge from its ``one China'' policy.
	   Koo played down the differences in comments to reporters. He
kept the focus on his mission's main task _ to explore reviving a
dialogue Beijing called off nearly 3 1/2 years ago.
	   ``I thought the atmosphere was very good,'' Koo said of his
meetings. ``Although we have different positions, we do not fear
the differences. There were no barbs.''
	   Taiwan believes future dialogue can narrow differences, ``and we
do have the patience,'' Koo said.
	   China and Taiwan split into rival governments after Mao
Tse-tung's Communists dislodged Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists from
the mainland in 1949.
	   Koo, an influential business tycoon and Nationalist Party
member, and Wang Daohan, an ex-mayor of Shanghai and mentor to
Chinese President Jiang, have been charged with nurturing relations
in the absence of official channels.
	   The two elder statesmen agreed in Shanghai last week to have the
government-back groups they head look into restarting the talks
they initiated at their first and only other meeting in 1993.
	   Beijing scrubbed the talks in mid-1995 after Taiwan President
Lee Teng-hui secured a visit to the United States, a move Beijing
saw as a sign he was reneging on eventual reunification.
	   Koo said Jiang approved of the agreement and hoped for more
discussions to resolve any problems.
	   China wants to begin with political negotiations, meaning talks
leading to reunification. Taiwan wants discussions to begin with
practical issues, such as fishing disputes, and put off more
contentious political matters.
	   Seemingly a reluctant partner, Taipei has tried to use Koo's
visit to increase China's understanding of its vibrant democracy.
Koo invited Wang to visit Taiwan, if possible during the general
election in December.
	   Koo told Jiang that democracy was the way to modernize a
country. Jiang noted that China has allowed democratic elections in
rural villages.

Behind scenes at summit: scrambled phones, hairdresser tangle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ If Israelis and Palestinians have one thing in
common, it's their passion for their mobile telephones. Many give
the impression they'd rather stroll the streets naked than be
caught without a cell phone at the ready.
	   So the no-phones rule at the Mideast summit on Maryland's
Eastern Shore initially caused dismay among both delegations.
	   Israeli media, however, reported Sunday that summit participants
had succeeded in getting around the restrictions, which were part
of an effort by the American hosts to help along the secret talks
by discouraging news leaks.
	   One account gave the credit to hard-line Jewish settler leader
Aharon Domb, who traveled to the United States to campaign against
any land-for-peace accord. The Jerusalem Post said Domb ``somehow
figured out that by dialing a certain random combination of
numbers, one could unscramble the scramble.''
	   It said he passed the information to the Israeli delegation, who
in turn gave their Palestinian counterparts the news. Ahmed Tibi,
an aide to Yasser Arafat, reportedly conveyed his thanks.
	   ___
	   At home in Israel, gossiping about first lady Sarah Netanyahu is
a favorite pastime. Even with a change of scene to Maryland's
Eastern Shore, that remains a constant.
	   Mrs. Netanyahu raised eyebrows here with her decision to
accompany her husband, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to the
Wye Plantation retreat where the talks are being held _ despite the
fact that spouses were explicitly uninvited.
	   On Sunday, the Maariv newspaper reported that Mrs. Netanyahu's
hairdresser was initially denied permission to enter the retreat
grounds, and was finally allowed in only after high-level
intervention.
	   The newspaper also said the White House had hoped Sarah
Netanyahu would stay at a Washington hotel rather than the summit
retreat. To entice her to do so, it even acquired coveted tickets
for a wildly popular Van Gogh exhibit in the capital.
	   But Mrs. Netanyahu has instead remained at the retreat.
	   In Israel, the first lady has been the target of pointed press
reports over everything from flying into a rage when her children's
nanny burned the soup to throwing shoes when angered.
	   ___
	   Observation of the Jewish Sabbath _ when work is forbidden _
caused a mini-controversy at the summit.
	   Israel's National Religious Party has reportedly demanded a
formal apology from Netanyahu for what they said was desecration of
the Sabbath by working on Saturday.
	   Israeli spokesman Aviv Bushinsky told Israel radio, however,
that even though Netanyahu engaged in talks that day, they were
informal, with no notes taken.
	   And he said the prime minister refrained from using the
telephone _ in line with the practices of religious Jews, who do
not operate machinery of any kind on the Sabbath.
	   Some in the Israeli delegation complained about being confined
to the Wye retreat for the day of worship _ and some unofficial
guests were unhappy about being kept out.
	   Domb, the settler leader, told Israel radio that he and some
Orthodox Jews who had hoped to enter the retreat grounds and pray
with Netanyahu were turned away. The group had even brought a Torah
scroll with them.
	   The Americans reportedly declared that even without any guests,
the Israelis had plenty of personnel for a ``minyan'' _ the group
of 10 men required for Jewish prayer services.
	   ___
	   The summit is being staged at a luxurious estate, but some
members of the Israeli security detail reportedly found themselves
roughing it a bit.
	   Israel radio said some of Netanyahu's bodyguards found
themselves spending the night in sleeping bags after the Americans
enforced a rule of only one person per room.

Kyrgyzstan voters approve land reform referendum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Voters in the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan
overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment that in theory
calls for the private ownership of land, a news report said Sunday.
	   Over 90 percent of voters in Saturday's referendum approved the
amendments, proposed last month by Kyrgyz president Askar Akayev,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   However, as part of the amendment, Akayev plans to introduce a
five-year moratorium on private land sales that could extend for 20
or 30 years if it is delayed in the country's parliament, said
Sulaiman Imanbayev, chairman of the Kyrgyz Central Election
Commission.
	   The proposed amendment is designed to grant Kyrgyzstan's rural
residents ownership of the small land plots they live on.
Non-Kyrgyz citizens and companies with foreign participation would
be barred from owning land in the republic.
	   Kyrgyzstan is a poor agricultural nation that has seen minimal
economic development since the country gained independence from the
Soviet Union in 1991.

Kusakabe edges Ozaki for Nikkei Cup title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KASUMIGAURA, Japan (AP) _ Mitsutaka Kusakabe fired a 3-under-par
69 in gusting winds Sunday and edged Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki by one
stroke for the Nikkei Cup Torakichi Nakamura Memorial championship.
	   Kusakabe, seeking his third career title and first since winning
the Casio World last November, scored an eagle and two birdies
against one bogey on his way to an 8-under 280 total.
	   It was one of only six sub-par scores in winds gusting up to 32
kph (20 mph) after Typhoon Zeb crossed over southwestern Japan.
	   Ozaki, Japan's winningest golfer with 108 career victories, shot
a 74 for 281.
	   British Open runner-up Brian Watts of the United States turned
in a 72 and was alone in third at 282.
	   Kusakabe, who started the round four shots behind Ozaki, shared
the lead at 9-under after chipping in an approach shot for an eagle
on the par-5 14th.
	   After both Kusakabe and Ozaki bogeyed the par-4 15th, Kusakabe
parred the remaining three holes, while Ozaki reached the green in
three and two-putted for a bogey-5 on the final hole.
	   ``When Jumbo was putting for par on the final hole, I thought I
would have little chance to beat him (in a playoff) unless he
missed the putt,'' said Kusakabe.
	   Kusakabe earned 19.8 million yen (dlrs 167,000) from a purse of
110 million yen (dlrs 928,000).

Ballesteros attacks new world tournaments

 &UR; By ALAN PAGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Spain's Severiano Ballesteros on Sunday
launched a stinging attack on the granting of Order of Merit and
Ryder Cup points to the new World Golf Championship events to be
inaugurated next year.
	   ``This is the most ridiculous decision the European Tour has
ever made, '' the Spanish star said.
	   ``It is simply not fair. There's so much money to be won and
only a few European players will be there. Ninety percent of
European players against this.''
	   The World Golf Championship will consist of three events in 1999
to which a fourth will be added in the year 2,000.
	   Each event offers a 5 million dollar prize-fund, with the
winner's check as yet undecided.
	   ``A player could win one of these tournaments and win the Order
of Merit. That has to be wrong,'' Ballesteros said.
	   Next year the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship is
scheduled for February 24 through 28 at La Costa resort, Carlsbad,
Calif, to be followed by the NEC Invitational at Firestone Country
Club, Akron, Ohio August 26 through 29 and the American Stroke Play
Championship at Valderrama, Spain November 4-7.
	   In the year 2,000 the World Cup Team Championship will be added
to the schedule.
	   Only the Match Play Championship will count towards the Ryder
Cup points next year.
	   Players will qualify for the the Match Play through their World
rankings. The other limited-field events will use various criteria
including world rankings, Ryder Cup and President's Cup selections
and Tour rankings. The Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship
will offer 64 slots in the line-up. Currently only nine European
players figure in the top-65 of the World Rankings and only 16 in
the top-100.
	   ``We must have a players' meeting about this on the Tuesday
before the Volvo Masters in Valderrama at the end of the month,''
Ballesteros stressed.
	   ``Something has to change. These qualifications must not happen.
They will not happen,'' he said.
	   Ballesteros has dropped out of the world top-200 and currently
stands 116 in Europe.

McEnroe wins seniors tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ John McEnroe was in familiar territory
Sunday _ winning a tournament and then having to defend himself
after bursts of offensive behaviour.
	   McEnroe beat Frenchman Henri Leconte 6-4, 6-2 in the Champions
seniors tennis final, but the result of a barely-serious event for
past-their-peak former greats was incidental.
	   McEnroe ensured he would be center of attention whatever
happened on court when he swore at an umpire, semi-final opponent
Mikael Pernfors and the crowd.
	   ``If I break the rules and someone has the balls to bust me than
let them do it,'' McEnroe said Sunday. ``It's exactly what people
want but then they get mad at me. That was nothing compared to what
I am capable of.''
	   McEnroe said tennis needed an overhaul and referees and
officials should be held more accountable for their actions.
	   ``Fun is not making bad calls, I don't see the fun in that,''
McEnroe said. ``We've butchered the game to the point where almost
no-one cares _ let's see if we can do something about it.''
	   Most of McEnroe's opponents on the seniors tour take it at face
value _ they kid with the crowd and each other, keeping it light.
	   But just like the old days, when McEnroe could still play at a
high level, few of his rivals are prepared to question his
behaviour.
	   Leconte made an effort, saying there should be rules in place in
seniors to combat misbehaviour.
	   ``At the moment anything can happen,'' Leconte said. ``There
should be some rules, the referees deserve some respect.''
	   With seven tournaments remaining in the seniors' tour, McEnroe
is 50 points clear of Jimmy Connors in the overall standings. All
players from Sydney now head to Melbourne for the champions
tournament beginning Wednesday.
	   In an all-Australian final of the doubles Johan Kriek and John
Fitzgerald defeated Mark Edmonson and Wally Masur 6-3 4-6 10-5.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO spy planes flew over Kosovo and
an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived, but
Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels also blamed each other in new
shooting attacks.
	   The conflicting events Saturday represented progress and setback
for last week's agreement that was intended to peacefully resolve
the conflict in the secessionist province in southern Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   A NATO attack plan remains on standby if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic fails to comply fully with the agreement, which
calls for him to reduce military forces in Kosovo to the levels
before his crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in February.
	   He also must give full access to the 2,000 ``compliance
verifiers'' and relief agencies trying to help scores of thousands
of Albanian refugees return to their homes before winter sets in.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have reported significant pullbacks by
Yugoslav forces in recent days but say the number remaining exceeds
the level required by the agreement reached by Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   But just a day after NATO gave Milosevic 10 more days to fulfill
his peace pledge, new attacks reported throughout the province put
new urgency into implementing the agreement.
	   In the worst of those, three Serb policemen were found killed
after what their colleagues said was a grenade attack by the Kosovo
Liberation Army on the house they occupied along a main Kosovo road
in Orlate, 20 miles (30 kilometers) southwest of the provincial
capital of Pristina. Two other police were seriously wounded, they
said. AP reporters who drove by the house saw the Serbs' bloodied
bodies on the second floor.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina claimed earlier that KLA
``extremists'' had staged more than a dozen attacks on Serb forces
since late Friday. Machine-gun fire, mortars and grenades allegedly
were used to target Serb police and at least two Serbs were
reported wounded.
	   Veljko Odalovic, the head of Kosovo's regional government, said
Sunday, ``These latest attacks show that the Albanian terrorsts are
trying by all possible means to prevent the realization of the
Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement.
	   `` This confirms what the international community has never
wanted to admit, that these bands of terrorists are not in favor of
a peaceful solution to the problem and are trying to take advantage
of the withdrawal of the police and military forces from Kosovo,''
he added.
	   The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs for at least two of the
incidents, saying police in the Pristina suburb of Vranjevac had
opened fire, hitting several Albanian houses and a car.
	   The conflicting claims could not be independently confirmed.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. But aid workers
and U.S. officials have reported a steady return in the last few
days.
	   NATO began an aerial surveillance mission Saturday by sending
U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern
Balkans. Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights Thursday as
part the peace agreements.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the KLA. More than
300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been displaced from
their homes.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic was pulling back at
least two of seven force battalions as demanded by NATO commander
Wesley Clark on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   NATO had given Milosevic until Saturday morning to fully comply
with international demands, but hours before the deadline was to
expire, NATO extended it until Oct. 27.
	   Clark was to return to Belgrade on Monday to reinforce to
Yugoslav officials that the threat of attack ``remains alive,''
said the White House official, who spoke in Washington on condition
of anonymity.
	   Eight members of an advance team of specialists arrived in the
Kosovo capital Pristina Saturday night and 17 more were expected
later Sunday.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. A sizable number of monitors were expected
to be in place in two weeks.
	   Peter Erben, chief of staff of the OSCE mission in Bosnia, who
led the first group here said, ``Our only job is to set up and
prepare for the main group arriving today.'' The group will contain
various experts in technical matters, security, communications and
administration.
	   Meanwhile, members of a so-called Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission were scouting for accommodation in the towns of Pec and
Prizren to find accommodation for the 2,000 verification
inspectors.

Fish trawlers' owner kidnapped in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Armed men have abducted an owner
of fishing trawlers in the southern Philippines, where government
troops were searching for other recent kidnap victims, police said
Sunday.
	   Police said the armed men, aboard two motorboats, stopped
Rolando Kanes' pumpboat near a wharf in Naga town in Zamboanga del
Sur province Friday night.
	   The abductors didn't harm Kanes' companions but took their
two-way radios and belongings, police added.
	   Government troops have started a search for Kanes and the
kidnappers, officials said. They said no ransom demand has been
received.
	   After separate abductions last month in southern Mindanao, an
Italian priest, the Rev. Luciano Benedetti; the family of a
Taiwanese businessman, two Hong Kong citizens and a Malaysian were
still in captivity.
	   One of two wealthy Filipino traders seized recently by
kidnappers in Mindanao was released Friday in a forest and rescued
by government troops.
	   The kidnappers released rice trader Modesto Natividad, 62,
apparently out of fear that the military was closing in on their
lair in the island province of Basilan, officials said.
	   Ransom kidnappings remain rampant in the Philippines despite a
high-profile government crackdown.

Report: Clinton to threaten recognition of Palestinian state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton aims to put
pressure on Israel by threatening to recognize a Palestinian state
this spring if the two sides don't reach an agreement at the
Mideast summit outside Washington, Israel's army radio reported
Sunday.
	   The report, citing an unidentified American official, said
Clinton would use the tactic to try to propel Israel to accept a
long-sought after deal with the Palestinians, under which Israel
would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
security guarantees.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would declare a
Palestinian state unilaterally in May 1998, when the interim peace
talks between the sides are set to expire. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has threatened unspecified unilateral steps in response
that could include annexing chunks of the West Bank.
	   Talks at the Maryland retreat of Wye Plantation, in their third
day, were moving into high gear Sunday with the arrival of Israel's
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.
	   Upon their arrival, Netanyahu was to convene a special session
of his inner security cabinet on the grounds of the retreat, Israel
radio reported.
	   Israel radio also reported that an announcement would be made
Sunday night by the Americans on whether an agreement has been
reached or if the summit will be extended until one has been
struck.
	   Although a press blackout remains in effect on the summit,
details about the talks continued to leak out.
	   Several Israeli press reports painted a picture of a frustrated
Clinton who told both sides categorically that he intended to push
an agreement through.
	   ``I've been working on this deal for 17 months and I'm not
prepared to defer it any longer,'' Clinton was quoted by the
Israeli daily Maariv as having told both Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   Wide gaps still remain on security issues, Israeli media have
reported. The CIA has been helping broker talks between the sides
on security issues, Maariv said.
	   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, some 300 relatives of Palestinian
prisoners being held by Israel held a protest Sunday, chanting
slogans and holding up pictures of imprisoned family members. They
demanded that the release of Palestinian prisoners be put on the
summit agenda.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German motorists got good news and bad news
in the coalition deal worked out by the incoming center-left
government: no autobahn speed limits, but higher gasoline taxes.
	   After two weeks of talks, the newly elected Social Democrats and
Greens wrapped up their pact Saturday with agreement on
transportation policy and energy taxes _ among the most contentious
issues.
	   ``We're done,'' Social Democratic party chairman Oskar
Lafontaine said when asked what remained to be settled.
	   On Sunday, both parties announced details on social welfare
policy, including a pledge to scrap cuts in retirement benefits
pushed through by outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The new
administration gave itself two years to overhaul the retirement
system, strained by Germany's aging population.
	   Other plans include curbing low-wage jobs that fall below the
limit for social security contributions, and a law strengthening
incentives for parental leave while allowing parents to work
part-time.

Police investigate extortionist targeting Mercedes drivers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Police are investigating whether an
extortionist demanding millions from Daimler-Benz struck again
Sunday by hurling a stone from a bridge at a passing Mercedes.
	   The car avoided the cobblestone, tossed from a bridge at an
autobahn exit near Dorsten in western Germany, but crashed into a
guardrail. The driver was uninjured.
	   A police spokesman said the person who threw the stone escaped,
and no letter was left behind. But he said they had notified
detectives in Stuttgart investigating an extortion attempt made
against Daimler-Benz _ the third such case this year.
	   The carmaker confirmed Friday that it had received letters from
someone threatening to toss rocks at Mercedes cars unless it paid a
ransom of several million marks (dollars).
	   One car was hit on Oct. 11 while driving on another autobahn,
also in western Germany. The car's windshield was smashed but no
one was hurt.
	   Investigators say the extortionist left behind a letter that
time saying: ``This time there was just damage to the car. Next
time a driver dies.''
	   Daimler-Benz has been targeted twice before by extortionists.
	   One man who threatened to shoot at Mercedes drivers unless he
was paid 5 million marks (dlrs 3 million) was arrested during the
ransom drop in February. He was convicted in September and
sentenced to almost five years in prison.
	   In the other case, a man threatened to tamper with Mercedes cars
unless he was paid 30 million marks (dlrs 19 million). He was
sentenced to almost three years.

Volunteers use trucks to save whales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Volunteers used trucks to save six
stricken whales Sunday, while dozens more died after becoming stuck
in shallow waters off Australia's southern island of Tasmania.
	   A pod of about 100 pilot whales hit trouble near Blackman's Bay
and 24 died. Later, 60 whales beached farther north at Orford, and
most perished.
	   Those saved by the trucks were carried 45 minutes by road to be
released into the open sea.
	   The drama began Saturday morning when 56 whales, the biggest
nearly 7 meters (23 feet) long, beached themselves at Marion Bay.
	   Aside from 21 that died, rescuers managed to get the rest out to
sea to join the large pod, using boats to turn back any that tried
to return to shore.
	   Rangers also took a whale calf into deeper water and turned its
head toward shore in the hope that its distress calls would attract
others. Four adults came.
	   ``I've never seen this technique used before but it got at least
four back out,'' Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service director Max
Kitchell said. ``We learn something each time with these
strandings.''
	   But instead of heading to the safety of open sea, the reunited
pod turned toward the narrow entrance of Blackman's Bay Saturday
night.
	   Despite efforts to head them off, about 50 became trapped in
shallow water, wallowing helplessly.
	   Nine became stranded on a sand bar where three died, and the
rest were moved back to sea at first light Sunday.
	   Rangers decided to truck them to Eaglehawk Neck, where they
could be released into open sea. Calves were lifted on to trailers
and driven off.
	   Hydraulic lifts on the back of flatbed trucks had to be used for
the adults, which were lowered on to foam mattresses, covered with
sacks and strapped down.
	   During the drive, five volunteers rode precariously on the
truck's back, continually sluicing the whales down with buckets of
water.
	   At the end of one drive, one whale heaved and almost went over
the side of the truck on to a concrete launching ramp.
	   Pat Deprez, one of the volunteers who stayed with a whale
throughout its truck rescue, said it was agitated when he first
reached it in the water at Blackman's Bay.
	   But it calmed down as it was moved closer to other whales and
they could talk to each other.
	   ``If it got a bit distressed (on the truck), we'd give it a pat
and that seemed to help it,'' Deprez said.
	   A group of surfers also helped with a couple of the stronger
whales.
	   Andrew Campbell twice pushed, cajoled and swam with a whale
until it was back in open water.
	   ``It was very hard at first but once the whale got into deeper
water it quickly rejuvenated and then I hung on and went for the
ride,'' he said.
	   ``If it went off course, I'd give it a push. It seemed to know
what I was trying to do. Anyway it always responded.''
	   Campbell stayed with each whale until it was well beyond the
mouth of the bay.
	   Then came the news from Orford, 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the
north, that more than 60 more whales had beached themselves there
and most of them had died.
	   ``Then just as we think we've got it under control, we get a
kick in the guts,'' Kitchell said.
	   He didn't know if the 60 that beached there were part of the
same pod.
	   He said all but about 10 were dead by the time rangers reached
them, which suggested they had been ashore for some time before
being found.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungarians voted Sunday in nationwide
municipal elections which are seen as a popularity test of Prime
Minister Viktor Orban's center-right government.
	   More than 101,000 candidates, including 48,000 independents, ran
for posts in local government bodies.
	   Polls opened at 6 a.m. (05:00 GMT) in the country's 3,153
municipalities for the 8,155,169 eligible voters.
	   Early turnout figures (at 11 a.m., 10.00 GMT) showed that 15.5
percent of the voters had cast their ballots, which was slightly
higher than in 1994.
	   Of all the parties, the most candidates were entered by the
Hungarian Socialist Party. The Socialists, the biggest opposition
party, are especially strong in settlements with over 10,000
inhabitants.
	   But the Independent Smallholders Party, the junior partner in
the ruling coalition, nominated the most candidates for the post of
mayor.
	   In the capital Budapest, the last liberal stronghold, Mayor
Gabor Demszky of the Free Democrats has two competitors, the
candidate of the coalition, Laszlo Latorcai, and Pal Kollath of the
Workers (communist) Party.
	   According to a Szonda Ipsos survey conducted between Sept. 26
and Oct. 2, Demszky has a 55-60 percent support, while Latorcai 40
percent. The margin of error was between 3 and 3.5 percent.
	   Demszky enjoys the support of the Socialists, too, and they had
withdrawn their candidate in Demszky's favor.
	   In small places, however, party affiliations are not as
important as in bigger towns.
	   In 1994, 83.7 percent of all elected mayors were independent.
	   Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Agriculture Minister Jozsef
Torgyan have repeatedly warned that only those municipalities will
enjoy advantages of the central development budget where the local
government bodies are loyal to them.
	   Popularity of the coalition is still strong, as shown by a poll
taken by the Szazadveg Institute in the third week of September
with 1,500 respondents. The margin of error was 2.5 percent.
	   The Young Democrats were in the first place with 51 percent,
followed by the Socialists, with 31 percent. The Smallholders had
seven percent, and the liberal Free Democrats five percent.

Report: Clinton to threaten recognition of Palestinian state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to 1999 in 3rd graf, ADDS 1 grafs on settlements &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton aims to put
pressure on Israel by threatening to recognize a Palestinian state
this spring if the two sides don't reach an agreement at the
Mideast summit outside Washington, Israel's army radio reported
Sunday.
	   The report, citing an unidentified American official, said
Clinton would use the tactic to try to propel Israel to accept a
long-sought after deal with the Palestinians, under which Israel
would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
security guarantees.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would declare a
Palestinian state unilaterally in May 1999, when the interim peace
talks between the sides are set to expire. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has threatened unspecified unilateral steps in response
that could include annexing chunks of the West Bank.
	   Talks at the Maryland retreat of Wye Plantation, in their third
day, were moving into high gear Sunday with the arrival of Israel's
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.
	   Upon their arrival, Netanyahu was to convene a special session
of his inner security cabinet on the grounds of the retreat, Israel
radio reported.
	   Israel radio also reported that an announcement would be made
Sunday night by the Americans on whether an agreement has been
reached or if the summit will be extended until one has been
struck.
	   Although a press blackout remains in effect on the summit,
details about the talks continued to leak out.
	   Several Israeli press reports painted a picture of a frustrated
Clinton who told both sides categorically that he intended to push
an agreement through.
	   ``I've been working on this deal for 17 months and I'm not
prepared to defer it any longer,'' Clinton was quoted by the
Israeli daily Maariv as having told both Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   Wide gaps still remain on security issues, Israeli media have
reported. The CIA has been helping broker talks between the sides
on security issues, Maariv said.
	   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, some 300 relatives of Palestinian
prisoners being held by Israel held a protest Sunday, chanting
slogans and holding up pictures of imprisoned family members. They
demanded that the release of Palestinian prisoners be put on the
summit agenda.
	   Also Sunday, Salah Taamari, a minister without portfolio in the
Palestinian Authority said that Israel has plans to build four new
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, army radio said. It said
settlers neither confirmed nor denied the report.

Fact-finding team finds nearly 820 killed or missing in Aceh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A local government fact-finding team
has compiled reports of nearly 820 soldiers and rebels killed or
missing in a military operation against Islamic separatist rebels
in Indonesia's northernmost province.
	   T.S. Sani, chairman of the team in Aceh province, was quoted
Sunday by the official Antara news agency as saying 344 were
reported killed and 475 missing. It was the third separate count in
the area. All have come up with totals of at least 760.
	   The local team was set up in September following reports by a
human rights group on the findings of mass graves in the regencies
of North and East Aceh.
	   Based on reports from local people, Sani said, 1,082 people had
been tortured, with 72 of them left disabled.
	   Earlier, the National Commission on Human Rights had concluded
that 781 people had been killed and at least another 160 were still
missing.
	   The Indonesian military said last month that for the 1990-98
period, its own fact-finding team had counted 760 deaths _ 406
rebels, 111 soldiers and 243 civilians killed by rebels.
	   The local team said the military operation had made a traumatic
impact on the villagers, especially in its early years, 1989-1992.
	   Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto decided in August to end the
military operation and withdrew troops from the tip of Sumatra
Island, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Aceh, a predominantly Muslim province, is one of three
Indonesian provinces where separatist rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   Sani did not rule out possible increases in the death toll as
more reports come in from the local people.

Ruling coalition becomes a single party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The ruling Union of Democratic Forces
concluded Sunday a year-long reform, transforming it from a
15-party alliance into a single party.
	   The change, approved by some 3,000 party members at a national
conference, aims to enhance the Union's efforts to win local
elections next year.
	   It controls the central government, while most mayoralties are
controlled by the opposition Socialist Party of renamed communists,
who won most of the local ballots four years ago.
	   Petty struggles between parties and leaders in the Union of
Democratic Forces have caused it a series of political defeats in
the past.
	   The party leader, Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, started building a
single party out of the quarreling coalition a year ago and dealt a
crushing defeat to former communists in 1997 general elections.
	   Kostov told the meeting that the UDF was bound to become a party
of the European Christian-Democratic type and attract centrist
voters who have been traditionally lukewarm to it.
	   In 1997, the UDF came to power on a wave of popular discontent
with economic mismanagement by the Socialists.

Archeologists discover Byzantine pot of gold

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Archeologists needed only bare hands _ not a
rainbow _ to unearth a pot of gold at an excavation site in
northern Israel Sunday.
	   Workers digging at Bet Shean, known for its extensive ruins
dating back to Roman times, found a 6th-century ceramic jug
containing between 200 and 400 gold coins.
	   The jug was found hidden beneath the floor of a room in a
Byzantine-era neighborhood outside Bet Shean's ancient city walls.
	   ``This is very important,'' said Ofer Sion, an archeologist with
Israel's Antiquities Authority. ``We find coins every day, but not
so many.''
	   Sion believes someone stashed the treasure underneath the floor
but never had the chance to reclaim it.
	   The site where the jug was found is believed to have been a
wealthy neighborhood during Byzantine rule, which began in the 4th
century after the fall of the Roman empire and lasted until the 7th
century.
	   Today there are plans to build a youth hostel on the site. In
accordance with Israel law, about 60 workers are now conducting a
four-month ``rescue dig'' before construction starts. Archeologists
have one month left to dig.
	   Sion said the coins will be cleaned and counted during the next
few days and eventually turned over to the Rockefeller Museum in
Jerusalem, which is devoted to archaeology.

Woods leads O'Meara by three holes after first 18 of 36
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will update at end of second 18 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Tiger Woods, putting better and
taking advantage of his friend Mark O'Meara's cold putter, grabbed
a three-hole lead after the first 18 of 36 in Sunday's World Match
Play final.
	   Woods shot 4-under 31 on the front nine and had a quick
four-hole lead with birdies on four of the opening six holes _
which included a 35-footer (12 meters) at No. 3.
	   O'Meara cut the lead to three after 11 with an 18-inch putt
(half meter) for birdie, a putt his friend good naturedly refused
to concede.
	   ``You'll give me this hole, won't you?'' O'Meara shouted across
the green. Woods looked sheepishly away and O'Meara replied, ``I'm
gonna remember that next week.''
	   O'Meara _ this year's Masters and British Open champion _
dropped the putt. Then, playing to a gallery evenly divided in
their loyalty, he measured it with his putter shaft _ not once but
twice to roaring applause.
	   Unlike earlier matches when a British player faced the
Americans, this time crowd at the Wentworth Club south of London
just took in the perfect fall day and the sight of two players who
have been linked together all season and the game's No. 1 story.
	   Woods, the world's top-ranked player, went back up by four on 16
with another birdie from two feet (half meter) with a perfect wedge
to the green. But he conceded 17 when he hit a fairway wood into an
unplayable lie in a thick of trees. O'Meara was just off the fringe
in two and was bound to make at least par.
	   O'Meara had chances with at least five putts of 20 feet (6
meters) or fewer but missed them all. Woods made more of his
chances and was consistent in lagging long putts close to make
birdies or save par.
	   A chance to go four up on the 18th got away when he missed from
10 feet (3 meters).
	   ``I just didn't play very well and Tiger played better,'' said
O'Meara coming off 18.
	   The two Florida neighbors reached the finals of the
170,000-pound tournament Saturday when Woods beat Lee Westwood 5
and 4 and O'Meara crushed defending champion _ and U.S. PGA
champion Vijay Singh _ by a record 11 and 10.
	   It's the first all-U.S. final since 1975 when Hale Irwin beat Al
Geiberger and only the fourth in the tournament's 34-year history.
	   ``This is definitely a great final,'' Woods said Saturday. ``No
doubt about it. It will be fun playing against one of my best
friends, someone I consider like an older brother, I'll be happy if
he wins and he'll be happy if I win.''
	   Woods said they've never played together in the final of a
match-play event or as the last twosome on the final day of a
stroke-play tournament.
	   ``Playing head-to-head, we don't get that chance very often
where we're in the same tournament and just happen to play well at
the same time.''
	   O'Meara, who broke the old tournament record set in 1978 when
Tom Watson beat Dale Hayes 11 and 9, suggested it'll just be
another round of golf with Tiger _ but for more cash.
	   ``We play a lot together,'' O'Meara said. ``He (Woods) has been
playing pretty well at home. I think he took 30 bucks off me the
last time we played.''
	   ``I'm pretty smart,'' he went on. ``I'm no idiot. I go to the
putting green afterwards and try to go nine, double-or-nothing. I
can usually win my money back on the putting green.''

Two more arrests in attack on Swiss women in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Two more men were arrested Sunday in
connection with the abduction of three Swiss tourists and the rape
of two of them.
	   Police spokesman Bala Naidoo said the arrests of the men brought
to four the number of people apprehended in the Wednesday attack. A
final suspect is being sought.
	   Five men abducted the women as they were leaving a game reserve
in northern KwaZulu-Natal province. Two were repeatedly raped
through the night. A third woman escaped being raped by saying she
was ill.
	   The victims were found Thursday morning. Their burned-out
vehicle has since been found and some of their belongings
recovered, Naidoo said.
	   The four suspects _ two of whom were arrested Friday _ would
appear in court on Monday morning, he said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After a day of frank, sometimes forceful talk
with senior Chinese leaders, Taiwan's chief envoy to China said
Sunday that differences between the rival governments remain great
but will narrow only through more talks. Koo Chen-fu capped his
path-breaking five-day visit to the mainland by meeting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. Although the two have met previously,
Sunday's get-together was the first inside China. Koo described
Jiang as an ``old friend.'' In their meeting, which ran a half-hour
beyond its scheduled hour's length, he said the two very generally
discussed relations between the governments _ the political heirs
to the unfinished Chinese civil war. The talk was more pointed in
Koo's first appointment Sunday with Vice Premier Qian Qichen, the
communist government's leading strategist on dealing with the
island. Koo told Qian Taipei flatly rejects Beijing's most
fundamental positions: that Taiwan is a part of one China and that
the island should accept a local autonomy formula similar to the
one given Hong Kong last year. (CHINA-TAIWAN)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Negotiators of the world's newest
nuclear states emerged Sunday from three days of talks without an
agreement, but with a promise to meet again in February 1999.
``It's not that talks have failed ... this was just a beginning,''
said India's chief negotiator and foreign secretary K.Raghunath.
The joint communique was a brief statement that said the two
foreign secretaries discussed confidence building measures, but
there were none agreed upon. They also discussed peace and security
in a volatile region that has already seen three wars and is
threatened by nuclear weapons. At the heart of their talks was the
dispute over Kashmir, which has dogged relations since independence
from British colonial rule in 1947. There was no resolution or
statement related to Kashmir, where a bloody guerrilla war is being
waged on the Indian side of the border. India accuses Pakistan of
fomenting violence on its side of the border, a charge that
Islamabad denies. Both sides reiterated their positions on Kashmir,
they said. (PAKISTAN-INDIA)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A typhoon which cut a destructive swath through
Asia, killing dozens and severely disrupting major transportation
routes, weakened to a tropical storm Sunday as it crossed over the
Japanese archipelago and moved into the Sea of Japan. Typhoon Zeb,
which killed at least 74 people in the Philippines and 18 in
Taiwan, was downgraded to a tropical storm by Japan's
Meteorological Agency as of 9:00 a.m. (0000 GMT) as it swirled
about 150 kilometers (93 miles) west of Aomori, a city 576
kilometers (360 miles) northeast of Tokyo. At least 11 people in
Japan were killed by landslides and weather-related accidents and
three others were reported missing, national broadcaster NHK said.
More than 1,500 people were forced to flee their homes.
(JAPAN-TYPHOON)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's former No. 2 leader
said his release from detention under a harsh security law was
prompted by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's fear of his
countrymen's wrath and pressure from the international community.
In the first statement issued since his arrest nearly a month ago,
dismissed deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim protested his treatment in
prison, but vowed that neither he nor his reform movement would be
beaten into submission. ``The detention was an attempt to weaken my
resolve. They have failed,'' the dissident said in the statement
from his jail cell. ``It is time for change.'' Anwar, who was
arrested under Malaysia's draconian Internal Security Act, has
alleged he has suffered from police beatings while awaiting trial
to face a number of corruption and sex charges. In the statement,
circulated by Anwar's wife Azizah Ismail late Saturday night, the
dismissed former deputy prime minister revived his attack on the
government and his calls for reform. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Wrapping up a week of celebration of 20
years as pontiff, John Paul II on Sunday asked for prayers to keep
him going in guiding his church and helping people find truth in
the world. Two days earlier, it was his fellow Poles who feted the
former archbishop of Krakow in St. Peter's Square. On Sunday, tens
of thousands of Romans and other Italians turned out for the pope's
Mass on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica. His thin, white hair
blowing in a warm breeze, the 78-year-old pope appeared tired but
his voice was strong as he thanked all those who in the days
leading up to the anniversary of his Oct. 16, 1978 election as
pontiff sent him messages of solidarity. ``Above all, thanks for
the constant recollection in prayer,'' John Paul said. ``I feel
near to me the heart of the church.'' ``I'd like in this moment to
tell all of you dear people how precious your support for me was in
these 20 years of service,'' the pope added in his homily.

Paper says action will be taken to prevent U.N. spying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi newspaper on Sunday reiterated the
country's allegations that U.N. weapons inspectors are spying and
warned that ``proper measures'' would be taken to protect Iraq's
security.
	   The editorial in Al-Thawra, published by Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's ruling Baath party, came a day after Iraq disclosed a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urging him to stop the
inspectors' ``dangerous practices.''
	   The letter, the paper said, ``intends to remind the
international community that if such an action is not taken (by the
United Nations), then Iraq is liable to take the proper measures to
protect its safety and sovereignty.''
	   The paper did not say what those measures might be.
	   Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees weapons inspections, of spying. Its charges gained more
attention after Scott Ritter, an American, quit the team and
disclosed that U.N. inspectors had been cooperating with Israeli
and American intelligence agencies.
	   Iraq has been under punishing trade sanctions that were imposed
by the U.N. Security Council after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
council has said they will not be lifted until the U.N. inspectors
certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Aug. 5,
effectively blocking spot checks for weapons. But it has continued
to cooperate with U.N. monitors working at sites that were
previously surveyed.
	   In his letter to Annan, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq
Aziz, demanded an investigation into the practices of the 40 U.N.
monitors still in the country.
	   Al-Thawra, in its editorial, said: ``They are not acting as
international representatives. They are acting as spies under
international cover using the domination of the United States on
the Special Commission.''
	   Both the letter and the editorial said the monitors had asked
about Iraq's agricultural and water resources _ issues, they said,
were beyond the purview of the inspectors.
	   The paper warned that if the monitors' spying activities were
not stopped, ``Iraq will have to act in the same way it does when
facing an exposed plot ... in order to protect its safety,
sovereignty and independence.''

 &UR; Serbian parliament to pass more restrictive information law &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Eager to impose full control over
all media, the Serbian government has drafted a new information law
expected to further restrict the work of the independent media and
pave the way for a shutdown of those deemed disobedient, critics
said Sunday.
	   The Serbian parliament will meet Tuesday to pass the law. The
announcement followed a government decree last week imposing
censorship and a shutdown of three independent newspapers and a
radio who refused to obey the decree.
	   No details of the law were immediately available but
representatives of Serbia's independent media said Sunday the new
information law is aimed at legalizing the government crackdown.
	   ``I think this law will be more restrictive than any previous
one and probably the worst media law in Serbia ever,'' said
Aleksandar Tijanic, a former information minister and a columnist
in the banned Dnevni Telegraf daily.
	   He said the government has ``introduced a state of emergency in
the Serbian media and society.''
	   The government loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
has used the concern over the possibility of NATO air attacks on
military targets in Serb-led Yugoslavia to clamp down on its
opponents. It has issued a series of decrees tightening state
control in the country.
	   One such decrees imposed a temporary ban on broadcasts of
Serbian-language programs by foreign media and demanded
``patriotic'' reporting from the independent media critical of
Milosevic's policies.
	   Throughout the eight-month Kosovo crisis, state officials have
accused the media of betraying Serbia's national interests by
reporting ethnic Albanian stands in the conflict. Last week, the
government shut down prominent Nasa Borba, Danas and Dnevni
Telegraf dailies, following eviction of the popular Index radio
from its premises.
	   The moves have triggered a wave of domestic and international
protests but to no effect.
	   The bellicose deputy premier, who has threatened retaliation
against foreigners in Serbia, announced that the new information
law would permanently ban foreign media broadcasts in Yugoslavia.
Vojislav Seselj also said that ethnic Albanian media in Kosovo were
being closely monitored.
	   Veran Matic, head of an association of independent media, said
he expected the law also to restrict the possibility that
independent media be assigned broadcasting frequencies or given
work permits. Matic also said he expected introduction of a wide
range of possible penalties for non-government reporting, including
financial fees.
	   ``This is an ideal moment for them (authorities) to bring such a
restrictive law,'' said Matic, echoing warnings by intellectuals
and independent analysts in Serbia that international pressure on
Milosevic over Kosovo only gave the Serb strongman an alibi to
tighten his grip on power at home.

German female politicians demand woman as next president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Female politicians in Germany's incoming
center-left government pressed demands Sunday that a woman be
nominated as the next president, while party leaders insisted they
already had their candidate _ a man.
	   ``It's high time that a woman takes over the office of
president,'' Social Democratic lawmaker Hanna Wolf said in the Bild
am Sonntag newspaper.
	   A newly elected lawmaker, Monika Griefahn, called on Johannes
Rau, the choice of Social Democratic party leaders, to step aside
and let ``a woman come up.''
	   They recommended Jutta Limbach, chief justice of Germany's
Constitutional Court.
	   But media reports said Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder and
his Social Democratic party chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, still
intend to nominate Rau, the 67-year-old retired governor of North
Rhine-Westphalia state.
	   ``He's it for me, and for Lafontaine and Schroeder and many
others who have said it again and again,'' SPD general manager
Franz Muentefering told German television.
	   Roman Herzog, who currently holds the mainly ceremonial post,
has said he would not stand again when his five-year term expires
in May. The president is nominated by the chancellor and elected by
parliament.

Four missing in mud slide near Taipei
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Four people were feared buried by a mud
slide in suburban Taipei Sunday, the second such disaster triggered
by torrential rains that followed Typhoon Zeb.
	   Earth above three homes and a factory in Wuku, west of Taipei,
broke loose at midafternoon, releasing a wave of mud that buried
seven people, witnesses said.
	   Neighbors rescued three, and scores of rescuers were moving
earth with back hoes and probing pools of mud with poles in hopes
of finding the other four.
	   On Friday, five people, including a married couple and one of
their daughters, died when their home was buried by loose rock and
mud.
	   Zeb killed 25 people and left another dozen missing when it
raged through Taiwan last Thursday and Friday, washing out bridges
and embankments and flooding large parts of suburban Taipei.
	   Repeated mud slide tragedies during typhoon season have prompted
calls for tighter rules on development of slope land.

Iranian opposition group says no injuries in car bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Mujahedeen Khalq said Sunday that a car
bomb exploded as a bus belonging to the Iranian opposition group
was passing but caused no casualties.
	   The group said that the incident occurred Saturday near the town
of Khalis, which is 60 kilometers (36 miles) north of Baghdad.
	   Farid Suleimani, a spokesman for the group, blamed the Iranian
government. He said that the bomb in the car had been triggered by
remote control.
	   On Aug. 7, a bomb exploded near the Mujahedeen Khalq's
headquarters in Baghdad, killing three Iraqis. Eleven Iraqis and
two members of the opposition group were injured.
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq is the largest faction in the National
Liberation Army, a fighting force formed in Iraq more than a decade
ago to try to overthrow the Islamic regime in Iran.

Eight newspapers fail to publish in Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Eight Algerian newspapers failed to
appear Sunday following a decision by independent editors to
suspend publication over a dispute with state-run printing plants.
	   The ``unlimited'' suspension was provoked by demands by three
state printing plants that four newspapers, El Watan, Le Matin, La
Tribune et Le Soir d'Algerie pay overdue bills for 1996 and 1997.
	   Four other newspapers have joined the protest, which comes amid
a power struggle that ensued after President Liamine Zeroual
decided in September to step down and call early elections
	   Ahmed Ancer, a senior editor at El Watan, said he believed the
decision by the state printing plants was ``political'' and ``aimed
at shutting down the newspapers.''
	   The executive editor of El Watan, Omar Belhouchet, said the move
was ``retaliation'' for articles in the newspaper that were
critical of Justice Minister Mohamed Adami.
	   Last week, both El Watan and Le Matin published articles written
by a group of magistrates describing Adami's alleged escapades with
prisoners and prostitutes.
	   Adami resigned Sunday, Algerian radio reported.
	   Earlier Sunday, the newspapers issued a communique saying the
demand for overdue payments were ``false commercial pretexts, but
real political reasons.''
	   On Wednesday, the four main independent newspapers were given
until January to pay their debts to the state-run printing plants.
	   The government has a monopoly on printing plants, and on three
occasions since 1993 it has opposed efforts by independent
newspapers to import their own presses.

	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ This eastern port city tried Sunday
for the 14th time to elect a city council _ an apparently failed
once again.
	   Vladivostok, the largest city on Russia's east coast, has not
had a working city legislature for five years because at least 25
percent of the eligible voters have to cast ballots to make the
election valid.
	   Initial results showed that only about 16 percent of eligible
voters turned out Sunday to elect representatives for the 22-member
legislature, said Andrei Astvatsturov, deputy chairman of
Vladivostok's Electoral Commission.
	   Vladivostok has been plagued by poor management and a lack of
basic services for years, including chronic shortages of
electricity and hot water.
	   But voters have been too apathetic to elect a new legislature
despite regular attempts.
	   The next vote for the city council will be held again Jan. 17,
when Vladivostok will also hold yet another election to try to fill
the mayor's post, Astvatsturov said.
	   The first vote for mayor, held last month, was declared invalid
after more than 50 percent of voters cast their ballots against all
the candidates on the ballot.

Report: Clinton to threaten recognition of Palestinian state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton aims to put
pressure on Israel by threatening to recognize a Palestinian state
this spring if the two sides don't reach an agreement at the
Mideast summit outside Washington, Israel's army radio reported
Sunday.
	   The report, citing an unidentified American official, said
Clinton would use the tactic to try to propel Israel to accept a
long-sought after deal with the Palestinians, under which Israel
would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
security guarantees.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would declare a
Palestinian state unilaterally in May 1999, when the interim peace
talks between the sides are set to expire. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has threatened unspecified unilateral steps in response
that could include annexing chunks of the West Bank.
	   Talks at the Maryland retreat of Wye Plantation, in their third
day, were moving into high gear Sunday with the arrival of Israel's
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.
	   Upon their arrival, Netanyahu was to convene a special session
of his inner security cabinet on the grounds of the retreat, Israel
radio reported.
	   Israel radio also reported that an announcement would be made
Sunday night by the Americans on whether an agreement has been
reached or if the summit will be extended until one has been
struck.
	   Although a press blackout remains in effect on the summit,
details about the talks continued to leak out.
	   Several Israeli press reports painted a picture of a frustrated
Clinton who told both sides categorically that he intended to push
an agreement through.
	   ``I've been working on this deal for 17 months and I'm not
prepared to defer it any longer,'' Clinton was quoted by the
Israeli daily Maariv as having told both Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   Wide gaps still remain on security issues, Israeli media have
reported. The CIA has been helping broker talks between the sides
on security issues, Maariv said.

Latin American leaders call for help, warn of world recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Latin American leaders warned Sunday
that the looming collapse of their economies would usher in a
worldwide recession and urged rich nations and financial
institutions to come to their aid.
	   With a global financial crisis menacing them, the leaders said
at a one-day summit here that they were the world's last line of
defense against the unfolding financial crisis that already has
devastated economies in Asia and Russia.
	   Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera said the world's seven
richest nations must ``take measures to keep the Asiatic crisis
from creating a profound crisis in Latin America, from which even
the developed countries would not be able to escape.''
	   The Group of Seven is comprised of the United States, Japan,
Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
	   The United States and Europe, by cutting their interest rates
further to kick-start growth and dampen speculative flows, would
not only help Latin America but also would help avert a worldwide
economic domino effect, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres
said.
	   The participants in the annual Ibero-American summit which also
included European Union members Spain and Portugal, were due to
sign a joint declaration later in the day in this northern
Portuguese port city.
	   In a draft statement, the leaders of 19 Latin American nations
pledged to introduce economic reforms, including potentially
unpopular austerity packages, to ward off the spreading financial
crisis.
	   However, they said the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank must also help check the spread of the crisis by deploying
financial resources swiftly.
	   The most urgent case is Brazil, the continent's largest economy
and a potential bulwark against creeping recession there, which is
waiting for news of a dlrs 30 billion rescue package from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   President Bill Clinton, mindful of the threat to the U.S. of a
Latin American meltdown, Saturday described the United States'
newly approved dlrs 17.9 billion contribution to the IMF as ``an
insurance policy for our own economy.''
	   EU leaders meeting in Vienna later this month will examine
measures to quell the global financial crisis, according to
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama
	   The summit called for curbs on the international flow of
speculative money to buffer emerging markets against turmoil
elsewhere.
	   The loss of investor confidence and consequent outflow of
capital threw Latin American markets into a tailspin and punched a
large hole in their foreign currency reserves.
	   ``One good day _ or better said, one bad day _ a malfunction
occurs in the stock market of a distant financial center in the Far
East and in a matter of hours the finances of the entire world are
shaken,'' Caldera complained.
	   The Latin American crisis could wipe out a decade of free-market
reforms, like deregulation and privatization, and austerity
packages could also spark social unrest across the continent.
	   A strike being waged by state employees in Colombia against a
government austerity package offers a glimpse of the trouble that
could arise if biting reforms are introduced.
	   Guterres appealed to the IMF to ``abandon economic orthodoxies
... and heed the social repercussions'' of its policies when
imposing conditions for bailouts.

Car crashes into Berlin's most famous landmark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ It was only for a movie, but the damage to
Berlin's historic Brandenburg Gate was real, if minor.
	   A film crew was shooting a scene early Saturday morning where a
car was supposed to zip through the city's most famous landmark.
	   The car sprang from a track, however, and rammed one of the
gate's pillars, breaking off a roughly 30 by 40 centimeter (square
foot) chunk of stone.
	   Police called the damage light and said the arch's structural
integrity was not compromised.
	   The gate was built under 18th-century Prussian rulers in the
heart of Berlin, and was part of the Berlin Wall until 1989.

Human rights group complains of police harassment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian human rights group charged on
Sunday that police repeatedly visited its office in recent days and
complained that the visits constituted harassment.
	   A lawyer for the Arab Program for Human Rights Activists said
police had questioned the group's employees about a conference
planned for Dec. 21 in support of Tunisian human rights activists.
	   The lawyer, Sabri Mohammed, said police first visited the office
of the group at 3 a.m. (0100 gmt) on Thursday and said there were
reports that the group was planning a demonstration.
	   He said that similar visits occurred Friday and Saturday and
that police were maintaining a stakeout outside the group's office
in suburban Cairo.
	   The Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal
security, said it had no information about the incidents.
	   Mohammed accused the police of harassment, saying: ``They didn't
make any kind of overt threats, but it's clear that they are trying
to intimidate.'' He also described the police action as illegal and
unconstitutional.
	   He said the conference would be held as planned.
	   ``What we will hold is a conference in support of Tunisian human
rights activists, not a demonstration,'' Mohammed said.

Inzamamul Haq misses century for third time in Peshawar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with close of play score. No Pick up. &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Middle-order batsman Inzamamul Haq
missed a century at the Arbab Niaz Stadium for third time as the
second Test between Pakistan and Australia headed toward a draw
Sunday, the penultimate day of the match.
	   Pakistan gave a befitting reply to Australia's massive first
innings total of 599 for four declared with 580 for nine declared.
Leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed remained 48 not out with six fours and a
six.
	   When stumps were drawn for the day, Australia was 21 without
loss with Mark Taylor not out 13 and Michael Slater not out7.
	   Earlier, 28-year-old Haq got out for 97 edging paceman Glenn
McGrath's delivery to wicketkeeper Ian Healy after hitting 16 fours
during a four-hour effort.
	   ``I don't know whether this ground is lucky or unlucky for me,''
said Haq. He ran short of partners after scoring 92 not out at the
same venue last year against the West Indies. And in the inaugural
Test here at the Arbab Niaz Stadium in 1995-96 season the burly
batsman was dismissed for 95 against Arjuna Ranatunga-led Sri Lanka
in Peshawar.
	   ``There is always some pressure when a player crosses the 90-run
mark,'' Haq said after missing his seventh Test hundred in 48th
Test match. He had missed the three-figure mark on two more
occasions -- both against South Africa. He was out for 95 in a
one-off Test at Johannesburg in 1994-95 and was dismissed for 96 at
Faisalabad in Pakistan.
	   Australian bowlers toiled hard on a placid wicket Sunday with
Pakistan top order batsman amongst runs.
	   Neither the leg-spin of Stuart MacGill was effective nor seamers
Damien Fleming and MacGrath extracted help from the track.
	   Earlier, Pakistan averted the follow-on when they resumed at the
overnight total of 329 for two -- needing another 71 runs to make
Australia bat again. Australian seamers kept the overnight batsmen
Ijaz Ahmed and Haq on defensive for half hour before both batsmen
settled down.
	   Pakistan crossed the 400 mark with Haq's exquisite cover drive
off McGrath. Ahmed, 125 overnight, ran out of patience soon after
his career-best 155 when he needlessly chased a wide MacGill
delivery to keeper Healy and walked off dejectedly. His innings
contained two dozen boundaries and came off 386 minutes.
	   After Haq's 115-run third wicket stand with Ahmed, he put on
another 83 runs for the fifth wicket with Salim Malik (49) before
Haq was dismissed by McGrath.
	   Steve Waugh and part-time medium fast Ricky Ponting got one
wicket each in the space of two runs. Waugh had Malik caught behind
and Ponting with his gentle medium pace had Moin Khan out for
nought which gave Healy his fourth catch of the innings behind the
wickets.
	   Yousuf Youhanna, played some attractive strokes on the on side
before he became one of two MacGill's victims. McGrath, the most
successful bowler (3-131) picked the scalp of Azhar Mahmood.
	   And when Fleming had Muhammad Zahid out leg before at the total
of 580, Pakistan captain Aamir Sohail declared the innings,
conceding a slim 19-run first innings lead.

Reputed Hong Kong gangster to stand trial in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong gang boss and his
underlings will stand trial in southern China later this week on
charges of cross-border kidnapping, murder and smuggling of
explosives, local press reports said Sunday.
	   Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' and 30 other members of
his gang were arrested in the neighboring Chinese province of
Guangdong in July.
	   The newspaper Hong Kong Standard said a notice was put up
Saturday outside the Guangdong Provincial High People's Court in
Guangzhou saying that Cheung would go on trial Tuesday.
	   Although the notice said the hearing would be public, it was
understood that only those with permits would be allowed inside the
court, the paper said.
	   Chinese police have charged Cheung and the others with murdering
a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed
robbery at seven gold shops and smuggling explosives into Hong
Kong.
	   The gang, which has been operating since 1990, also allegedly
kidnapped two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom. However, police
have not given any details of the kidnappings.
	   In Hong Kong, police detained 15 people in August for allegedly
laundering money for the gang.
	   Hong Kong police also have frozen the assets of 17 relatives of
Cheung. More than 160 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 20.5
million) in property, bank accounts and vehicles is covered by the
order.

Car thief implicates South African police in thefts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A convicted carjacker is
accusing police of having helped him steal cars and of taking
bribes to foil the justice system, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Xolani Mlilwana, serving a 125-year sentence after pleading
guilty in April to 11 counts of hijacking and to a charge of
escaping from prison, said police escorted hijacked cars, arranged
for false license plates and assisted in jailbreaks, the Sunday
Times reported.
	   Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi planned to meet
soon with Mlilwana to hear his accusations, the Johannesburg
newspaper said.
	   Mlilwana, 25, is the son of police Gen. Niki Mlilwana, the
assistant commissioner of police in Queenstown, a town in eastern
South Africa. The elder Mlilwana is encouraging his son to spill
the beans.
	   ``I have said all I want is for Xolani to reveal all he knows,
and at the end of the day the will of God will prevail,'' Gen.
Mlilwana was quoted as saying.
	   The car thief has, in an affidavit, accused a police sergeant of
taking a 10,000 rands (dlrs 1,800) bribe to let him slip away from
prison during an earlier arrest, before the April conviction.
	   Mlilwana alleges he also paid 10,000 rands (dlrs 1,800) to
another police sergeant to allow Mlilwana to steal his criminal
files from police headquarters in Johannesburg, the Sunday Times
said.
	   Mlilwana also alleged other police officers had helped him and
his accomplices escape with stolen cars by escorting them in
vehlcies with flashing police lights.
	   Police spokesman Jabu Dhlamini confirmed that Mlilwana's
allegations were being investigated.

After the Poles, pope celebrates 20 years with Romans

Warsaw cardinal saying pope considered resigning in 1981 over
Polish situation &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Wiping away a tear, Pope John Paul II on
Sunday reflected on his 20 years as pontiff and wondered aloud how
well he has served the church and what he called the world's
longing for truth.
	   The pontiff looked teary-eyed after he hugged, one by one, Roman
schoolchildren who had just waved colored scarves in a dance of joy
for him on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica.
	   The 40 children were part of a crowd of about 75,000
well-wishers in sunny St. Peter's square for the pope's Mass to
mark the anniversary of his Oct. 16, 1978 election to the papacy.
	   ``After 20 years of service on Peter's seat, on this day I
cannot help but ask myself some questions,'' the pope said.
	   ``Have you carried out all this? Have you been a diligent and
vigilant master of the faith of the Church?''
	   And, another question to himself: ``Have you tried to satisfy
the expectations of the faithful of the church and also the hunger
for truth that we feel in the world, outside of the Church?''
	   His thin, white hair tossed by a warm breeze, the 78-year-old
pope offered no answers. He looked tired but his voice was strong
as he thanked people for their ``precious'' support in these two
decades.
	   ``The prayer of the pastor supports his flock. That's for sure.
It's also still true, however, that the people's prayer supports he
who has the task of guiding them,'' said the ailing John Paul, who
walks with difficulty and has a constant hand tremor.
	   The pope asked for more prayers so that he ``may carry out his
mission right to the end.''
	   Among those who came from the Polish pope's homeland for the
anniversary was Warsaw Cardinal Jozef Glemp, who, in an interview
published Sunday in Rome daily La Repubblica, said the pope had
considered resigning in 1981 to help his countrymen struggling
against Communism.
	   Asked if it were true that John Paul let Moscow know that he was
ready to quit and return to Poland if Soviet troops invaded his
homeland, Glemp replied: ``Yes. That was a hypothesis that in
several moments had great basis.''
	   Referring to the martial-law crackdown on the Solidarity free
trade movement, Glemp added: ``The Holy Father in those days was
very troubled and worried about the fate of his country. He was
ready to do anything, even leaving the leadership of the church in
order to be able to defend the freedom of his country.''
	   Added Glemp: ``As we all know, naturally, there was no invasion,
and, I believe, thanks in part to the determination shown by the
pope.''
	   After the Mass, John Paul again turned his thoughts to the value
of truth.
	   ``Woe to humanity which loses the sense of truth, the courage to
seek it, the faith to find it,'' the pope told the crowd.
	   Many tourists joining the faithful in Sunday's crowd appeared
touched by the pope's appearance.
	   ``As much as you want to say you're not Catholic, it gives you
the chills,'' said a honeymooner from Boston, Jude Stearns.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A typhoon that cut a destructive swath through
Asia, killing dozens and severely disrupting transportation,
weakened to a tropical storm Sunday as it crossed over the Japanese
archipelago and moved into the Sea of Japan.
	   Typhoon Zeb, which killed at least 74 people in the Philippines
and 18 in Taiwan, was downgraded to a tropical storm by Japan's
Meteorological Agency as of 9 a.m. (0000 GMT) as it swirled about
150 kilometers (93 miles) west of Aomori, a city 576 kilometers
(360 miles) northeast of Tokyo.
	   At least 12 people in Japan were killed by landslides and
weather-related accidents and one other was reported missing,
national police said. More than 1,500 people were forced to flee
their homes.
	   After coming ashore late Saturday in southern Japan, the storm
blew into the Sea of Japan. Sunday afternoon, it was still at sea,
off the west coast of the northern main island of Hokkaido.
	   Rain, however, was heaviest on the island's east coast, where
108 millimeters (4.25 inches) fell in the 24 hours up to 9 p.m.
(1200 GMT) in an area about 800 kilometers (500 miles) northeast of
Tokyo.
	   In southwestern Japan's Okayama prefecture, a 40-year-old woman
and her two school-age sons died after a landslide destroyed their
house early Sunday, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Another landslide killed an elderly couple and their 41-year-old
son late Saturday in neighboring Hiroshima prefecture.
	   The storm caused the cancellation of domestic flights, including
some departing from Tokyo's Haneda Airport, and disrupted train and
ferry service all across Japan.
	   Before landing in Japan, Typhoon Zeb devastated parts of the
Philippines and Taiwan late last week.
	   Most of the 74 people killed in the Philippines drowned or were
buried in landslides. Ten people were still missing as of late
Saturday and the casualty figure was expected to rise as reports
come in from isolated villages.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   In Taiwan, 18 people were dead and up to 19 missing after Zeb
roared across the island Friday.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kph (150 mph) and gusts measuring (295 kph)
184 mph.

Secluded talks could yield partial agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with arrivals of Sharon and Mordechai &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ A partial West Bank agreement is
likely to emerge from the Mideast summit talks President Bill
Clinton is hosting, but completion of a full accord would probably
take several weeks, diplomatic sources said Sunday.
	   As Clinton prepared to return here for a third day of U.S.
mediation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the sources told The Associated
Press that security remains the main hurdle to such an agreement,
in which Israel would exchange territory for tougher security
measures by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The newly appointed, hard-line Israeli foreign minister, Ariel
Sharon, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai arrived at this
resort area on Maryland's Eastern Shore early Sunday morning to
join the talks. Asked by reporters if he was optimistic, Mordechai
said, ``Yes, I am.''
	   Clinton is trying to break a 19-month stalemate, but U.S.
officials have made no claims of progress since the talks began
Thursday.
	   The Clinton administration, without setting a deadline, has
expressed hope the agreement could be concluded Sunday. But the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said concluding a
comprehensive agreement in the next day or two was unlikely.
	   The sources also dismissed reports broadcast Sunday by Israeli
army radio that Clinton would try to pressure Israel by threatening
to recognize a Palestinian state this spring if the two sides don't
reach an agreement at the summit.
	   It may take the parties a couple of weeks to work out the steps
Arafat is prepared to take to fight terrorism, and then there would
probably have to be another three-way meeting convened by the
United States, the sources said.
	   At stake was a long-sought accord that would give the
Palestinians control over more land on which they hope to establish
a state.
	   Netanyahu has agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the
West Bank, with 3 percent designated as a nature preserve, but has
declared there will be no agreement without new security guarantees
from Arafat.

Singapore leader urges mental strength amid tension with Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong urged
the people of his small city-state Sunday to remain mentally tough
amid tensions with its larger neighbor Malaysia.
	   Goh said Singaporeans must be psychologically fit to withstand
all the pressures on society and the country in general. He
referred to the icy treatment of Singapore athletes by Malaysian
spectators at last month's Commonwealth Games.
	   ``Amidst the boos and jeers reserved only for Singaporeans, our
officials and athletes stood tall, remained calm, smiled and waved
their flags,'' Goh said to strong applause at the launch of a
workers' sports program.
	   ``They made Singaporeans feel proud that we could stand up to
stress, and that's the kind of spirit we want to encourage in
Singaporeans,'' he added.
	   From the opening ceremony to the closing festivities, Singapore
athletes were repeatedly jeered by the predominantly Malaysian
crowds during the games.
	   Once united in a short-lived federation in the 1960s, the two
neighbors have been mired in political and economic disputes for
months, and Malaysia's leaders have been increasingly vociferous in
their contempt for the island republic.
	   While less vocal, Singaporeans have bristled at the criticism
from Malaysia.
	   Goh said Sunday that despite winning no medals at the games, the
athletes' ``performance and behavior under pressure have won our
respect.''
	   The two Southeast Asian nations have argued recently over a host
of thorny issues, including the relocation of a border checkpoint,
disputed land, competition between their ports and banks, and a
memoir by Singapore patriarch Lee Kuan Yew that criticizes
Malaysia's past leaders.
	   On Saturday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said his
country will find it difficult to be friendly again with Singapore,
saying the island republic has not shown the sensitivity of a good
neighbor.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb official on Sunday accused
ethnic Albanian rebels of increasing attacks on police in Kosovo to
try to scuttle last week's peace agreement intended to avert NATO
air strikes.
	   ``These latest attacks show that the Albanian terrorsts are
trying by all possible means to prevent the realization of the ...
agreement,'' said Veljko Odalovic, the head of Kosovo's regional
government.
	   He spoke a day after NATO spy planes began overflying Kosovo and
an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived as
steps toward assessing whether Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic was complying with the peace agreement reached last
Tuesday with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Also Saturday, the Serb Media Center reported more than a dozen
attacks by Albanian guerrillas throughout the province. Associated
Press journalists witnessed the aftermath of the worst attack,
which killed three Serbian policemen in Orlate, 30 kilometers (20
miles) southwest of Pristina late Saturday night.
	   The conflicting events represented progress and setback for last
week's agreement that was intended to peacefully resolve the
conflict in the secessionist province in southern Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   A NATO attack plan remains on standby if Milosevic fails to
comply fully with the agreement, which calls for him to reduce
military forces in Kosovo to the levels before his crackdown on
Albanian separatists in February.
	   He also must give full access to the 2,000 ``compliance
verifiers'' and relief agencies trying to help scores of thousands
of Albanian refugees return to their homes before winter sets in.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have reported significant pullbacks by
Yugoslav forces in recent days but say the number remaining exceeds
the level required by the agreement reached by Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   But just a day after NATO gave Milosevic 10 more days to fulfill
his peace pledge, new attacks reported throughout the province put
new urgency into implementing the agreement.
	   In the Orlate attack, a grenade explosion in a house occupied by
Serbian policemen killed three and wounded two. The AP journalists
who drove by the house shortly afterward saw the bloodied bodies of
the three slain policemen in the attic.
	   Other attacks reported by the Serb Media Center in Pristina
allegedly involved machine-gun fire, mortars and grenades.
	   ``This confirms what the international community has never
wanted to admit, that these bands of terrorists are not in favor of
a peaceful solution to the problem and are trying to take advantage
of the withdrawal of the police and military forces from Kosovo,''
Odalovic said.
	   The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs for at least two of the
incidents, saying police in the Pristina suburb of Vranjevac had
opened fire, hitting several Albanian houses and a car.
	   The conflicting claims could not be independently confirmed.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the KLA. More than
300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been displaced from
their homes.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. But aid workers
and U.S. officials have reported a steady return in the last few
days.
	   NATO began an aerial surveillance mission Saturday by sending
U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern
Balkans. Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights Thursday as
part the peace agreements.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic was pulling back at
least two of seven force battalions as demanded by NATO commander
Wesley Clark on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   The new deadline for compliance is Oct. 27.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. A sizable number of monitors were expected
to be in place in two weeks, and more than 20 members of an advance
team for the mission had arrived by Sunday afternoon.
	   John Sandrock, an American who is chief of mission support for
OSCE in Vienna, said upon arrival Sunday, ``We're glad we're here.
We're ready to do the preparatory work for the Kosovo Verification
mission. We're looking very much forward to consultations with the
people who have been here already, the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission. I hope to meet with them a little bit later, and we will
go from there.''
	   ``We will bring as many people in as quickly as possible, as the
infrastructure permits. I don't want to give you any numbers, or
any deadlines or any times, but we will respond to this issue as
quickly as we can,'' he added.

Spanish papers hail arrest of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish newspapers on Sunday hailed the
arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet as a
triumph for justice and a warning to other despots.
	   Pinochet, 82 and in London for medical treatment, was arrested
late Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a
Spanish judge probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in
Chile under his iron-fisted rule in the 1970s and 80s.
	   The center-right daily El Mundo said in an editorial that
regardless of whether Pinochet is extradited to Spain, the mere
fact that he was arrested is charged with symbolism.
	   ``It is a lesson that the decrepit, retired executioner ... will
finally be treated as a criminal and forced to answer for his
actions before international justice,'' the paper said.
	   ``Not just for him, but for other despots and would-be despots
around the world,'' the pape added. ``There can be no borders for
prosecuting violations of human rights.''
	   The daily El Pais echoed this sentiment, saying ``Pinochet's
arrest is a warning for those who think that the borders of their
country save them from any judge.''
	   Spanish state radio said judges Baltasar Garzon and Manuel
Garcia Castellon need to complete several more legal technicalities
before traveling to London to question Pinochet, who was arrested
in a clinic where he was recovering from back surgery.
	   Quoting lawyers for relatives of victims of the Pinochet regime,
the radio denied news reports that the judges would travel to
London as early as Sunday to question Pinochet.
	   The Spanish government remained tight-lipped about the arrest,
with deputy prime minister Rodrigo Rato saying only that it
respected decisions taken by courts.
	   Human rights groups called a demonstration for Monday outside
the Chilean embassy in Madrid to call for Pinochet to be extradited
for trial in Spain, the state news agency Efe reported.

Latin American leaders call for help, warn of world recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos OPO109-113 &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Latin American leaders warned Sunday
that the looming collapse of their economies would usher in a
worldwide recession and urged rich nations and financial
institutions to come to their aid.
	   With a global financial crisis menacing them, the leaders said
at a one-day summit here that they were the world's last line of
defense against the unfolding financial crisis that already has
devastated economies in Asia and Russia.
	   Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera said the world's seven
richest nations must ``take measures to keep the Asiatic crisis
from creating a profound crisis in Latin America, from which even
the developed countries would not be able to escape.''
	   The Group of Seven is comprised of the United States, Japan,
Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
	   The United States and Europe, by cutting their interest rates
further to kick-start growth and dampen speculative flows, would
not only help Latin America but also would help avert a worldwide
economic domino effect, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres
said.
	   The participants in the annual Ibero-American summit, which also
included European Union members Spain and Portugal, were due to
sign a joint declaration later in the day in this northern
Portuguese port city.
	   In a draft statement, the leaders of 19 Latin American nations
pledged to introduce economic reforms, including potentially
unpopular austerity packages, to ward off the spreading financial
crisis.
	   However, they said the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank must also help check the spread of the crisis by deploying
financial resources swiftly.
	   The most urgent case is Brazil, the continent's largest economy
and a potential bulwark against creeping recession there, which is
waiting for news of a dlrs 30 billion rescue package from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, mindful of the threat to the United
States of a Latin American meltdown, on Saturday described his
country's newly approved dlrs 17.9 billion contribution to the IMF
as ``an insurance policy for our own economy.''
	   EU leaders will examine measures to quell the global financial
crisis at a meeting later this month, according to Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama
	   The summit called for curbs on the international flow of
speculative money to buffer emerging markets against turmoil
elsewhere.
	   The loss of investor confidence and consequent outflow of
capital threw Latin American markets into a tailspin and punched a
large hole in their foreign currency reserves.
	   ``One good day _ or better said, one bad day _ a malfunction
occurs in the stock market of a distant financial center in the Far
East and in a matter of hours the finances of the entire world are
shaken,'' Caldera complained.
	   The Latin American crisis could wipe out a decade of free-market
reforms, like deregulation and privatization, and austerity
packages could also spark social unrest across the continent.
	   A strike being waged by state employees in Colombia against a
government austerity package offers a glimpse of the trouble that
could arise if biting reforms are introduced.
	   Guterres appealed to the IMF to ``abandon economic orthodoxies
... and heed the social repercussions'' of its policies when
imposing conditions for bailouts.

Britain dismisses Chile protests at arrest of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dismissing Chile's protest over the arrest in
London of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a Cabinet minister said Sunday
most Britons would find it ``gut-wrenching'' to give diplomatic
immunity to the Chilean former dictator.
	   Chanting demonstrators, delighted at the move, gathered outside
the private clinic in London where the 82-year-old Pinochet is
presumed still to be a patient. He has been under police guard
since his arrest Friday, in response to a Spanish extradition
request, for questioning about allegations of murder in the first
decade after he seized power in 1973.
	   Pinochet has been a regular visitor to Britain, generally
without publicity. His arrest this time appeared partly to reflect
a tougher attitude toward right-wing dictators by Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Labor Party government which replaced a Conservative
Party administration 18 months ago.
	   ``The idea that such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should claim
diplomatic immunity I think for most people in this country would
be pretty gut-wrenching stuff,'' Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson
said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
	   Scotland Yard police headquarters and the government refused to
disclose Pinochet's whereabouts, but police mounted guard outside a
hospital called the London Clinic. His spokesman in Chile, Fernando
Martinez, said that Pinochet was in hospital when police came to
arrest him on Friday. He underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated
disc, a spinal disorder.
	   ``Gen. Pinochet has committed crimes humanity _ many atrocities,
torture, murder,'' said Vincete Allegria, a Chilean exile who fled
Pinochet's regime.
	   ``We all know he is responsible for these murders ... he gave
the orders to commit these crimes,'' he added, speaking to
reporters outside the clinic.
	   Under extradition laws, Spain has 40 days from last Friday to
lodge a formal request for extradition, and the final decision lies
with Jack Straw, the Home Secretary in Blair's Cabinet.
	   There was no immediate word on when Pinochet would be
questioned. But police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said questioning was not expected for a week or two.
	   Relations between Britain and Chile immediately soured, with
Chile maintaining that Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic
immunity, granted in his native land.
	   Home Office Minister Alun Michael, an aide to Straw,
acknowledged Sunday that Pinochet had entered Britain on a
diplomatic passport, but added, ``That does no necessarily convey
diplomatic immunity.''
	   ``He would have provided evidence of coming for medical
treatment, and there's no reason for the immigration authorities to
stop him at that stage,'' Michael said in a BBC radio interview.
	   The Foreign Office said under British law only visiting
government officials and accredited diplomats have diplomatic
immunity.
	   Pinochet, who ruled for 17 years after ousting leftist President
Salvador Allende in 1973, has been widely accused of running a
ruthless regime marked by disappearances and deaths of political
opponents.
	   His arrest was prompted by separate applications last week to
question him by two Spanish judges investigating human rights
violations. One of the judges, Baltasar Garzon, is also
investigating the disappearances of Chilean dissidents in Argentina
and also wants to question Pinochet about non-Spaniards.
	   However, Scotland Yard said Pinochet was arrested only for
questioning about allegations that he murdered Spaniards in Chile
between 1973 and 1983. No number was given. According to a Chilean
government report, a total of 4,299 political opponents died or
disappeared during Pinochet's term.
	   Pinochet, who remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until March, has immunity from prosecution in Chile as a
senator-for-life, and also under an amnesty covering crimes
committed before 1978 _ when most of the human rights abuses took
place.

Malaysian press chides Sean Connery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A Malaysian newspaper says
Hollywood star Sean Connery won't win any new fans in Malaysia
after his behavior when he was here to film his new movie
``Entrapment.''
	   ``The handsome actor who used to set a million hearts aflutter
with his Scottish brogue and devilish eyes turned out to be a sad,
vain old man with little regard for the media or his fans,'' said
Sunday newspaper.
	   It said the original James Bond ``breezed into town, insulted
everyone with his uncooperative behavior, and left without a
whimper.''
	   The local press was barred from meeting with the high-profile
cast of ``Entrapment,'' which also stars Britons Catherine
Zeta-Jones and Anthony Hopkins, the newspaper said.
	   Repeated interview requests were ignored and a scheduled press
conference was canceled at the last minute, only to be rescheduled
minus the celebrities, the report said.
	   The paper scolded the 60-year-old actor and his crew for not
apologizing to Kuala Lumpur train commuters after one segment of
shooting disrupted local train service.
	   ``Sean Connery may be a bona fide Hollywood star but his
behavior in Malaysia certainly didn't win him any new fans here,''
the article said.
	   In contrast, it said, Hong Kong star Jackie Chan was an
``absolute gentleman'' while in Kuala Lumpur several years ago to
shoot ``Police Story 2.''
	   ``Jackie was humble and polite, and repeatedly apologized for
causing so much chaos,'' the article said, forgiving Chan for the
massive traffic jams caused by the filming of his daredevil stunts.
	   ``We are nice people, so don't go out of your way to treat us
badly. We don't deserve it _ even from an aging star like you,''
the newspaper added.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police arrested a suspect in a stabbing attack on
two Mormon church missionaries in central Russia that left one dead
and the other hospitalized, police said Sunday.
	   A group of assailants stabbed to death Jose Manuel Mackintosh,
20, and wounded Bradley Alan Borden, 20, after the pair left the
home of a Mormon family in Ufa, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
east of Moscow, according to a press release issued by the church
in the United States.
	   Borden was in stable condition in an Ufa hospital, the statement
added. Both the missionaries are from the United States.
	   Police would not release any information about the arrested man.
	   Investigators believe the stabbing was an indiscriminate attack
and was not directed toward the Mormon church, said Rais Galin,
police spokesman for the district that includes Ufa.
	   Witnesses said that the man who killed Mackintosh was drunk at
the time, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   ``We understand that this tragedy was a random act of violence
and that there was no premeditation,'' said L. Aldin Porter, an
official with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in
Utah. ``Our representatives in Russia will cooperate fully with
local authorities in their investigation.''
	   Attempts Sunday to reach the Mormon mission in Moscow and
Yekaterinburg, which oversees work in Ufa, were unsuccessful.
	   Mackintosh, from Hiko, Nevada, had been a missionary in Russia
for just over a year. Borden, of Mesa, Arizona, arrived in January.
	   The young missionaries, dressed in white shirts and dark ties,
work in pairs and are easy targets for harassment. In March, two
Mormon missionaries were held hostage for four days in southern
Russia before being released unharmed.
	   There are about 500 Mormon missionaries in Russia, among 57,000
mostly young men the church has deployed around the globe.

Defector says Odai Hussein critical of father's Gulf War tactics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A former aide to Saddam Hussein's oldest son
was quoted Sunday as saying that Odai was critical of his father's
tactics in the 1990-91 Gulf crisis.
	   In an interview with the London-based Al-Hayat, Abbas al-Janabi,
who was the personal secretary of Odai Hussein, said Odai felt Iraq
should have occupied Saudi Arabia's oil fields ``and threatened to
set them on fire if the Americans attacked Iraq.''
	   Iraq, which invaded Kuwait in August 1990, set hundreds of
Kuwait's oil wells ablaze before retreating from U.S.-led coalition
forces in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Al-Janabi, who defected to the West last spring, also believed
his father made a mistake in releasing dozens of Europeans and
Americans held as ``human shields'' before the war, Al-Hayat said,
suggesting their presence would have discouraged the allied
offensive.
	   He also said Odai felt Saddam should never have allowed allied
troops to concentrate in the Hafar al-Batin area of Saudi Arabia,
close to both Iraqi and Kuwaiti borders.
	   ``He (Saddam) should have attacked them from the beginning and
fought any individual unit that reached the area,'' al-Janabi
quoted Odai as saying.
	   Al-Janabi, 50, worked for the Iraqi national news agency and was
later appointed editor of Odai's daily newspaper Babel.
	   He now lives in hiding in Europe, fearing Iraqi retribution.
Al-Hayat said its interview was carried out in a European country,
which it did not name.
	   The paper also quoted al-Janabi as confirming that Saddam has a
son, 13-year-old Ali, by his second wife, Samira Shahbander.
	   Odai, 34, and Qusai, 32, are the sons of Saddam's first wife,
Sajida. The couple also has three daughters.
	   ``Ali is a senior member of the Zawra'a sports club and enjoys
especial care from his father with heavy guards, but the press,
upon Odai's orders, ignores him,'' al-Janabi was quoted as saying.
	   Muslims are allowed to have as many as four wives.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month,
al-Janabi said that he watched his boss kill four men and torture
others.

1997 aerobatics champion killed in plane crash near Warsaw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Two experienced pilots, including the 1997
world aerobatics champion, were killed when their light plane
crashed late Saturday near Warsaw, the PAP news agency reported.
	   Janusz Kasperek, 37, and Grzegorz Moskalenko, 36, both pilots
for the Polish national airline LOT, died when their German-built
two-seater went down in the woods about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
east of Warsaw.
	   The plane had just taken off minutes earlier from a military
airport. There was no fire or explosion, crash investigator Andrzej
Winiewski told PAP.
	   He said it would take a week before the cause of the crash was
known.
	   Kasperek won a gold medal for individual overall performance in
the Advanced World Aerobatics Championships in Lawrence, Kansas, in
July 1997 _ his fourth gold medal in the contest.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A British woman critically injured during an armed
robbery at a Barbados hotel is showing no improvement and her
life-support machine may be switched off, her boyfriend was quoted
as saying in a newspaper interview Sunday.
	   Paula Bridges, 41, was flown home in critical condition a week
ago. She was shot in the heart Oct. 1 while in the bar at Barbados'
Palm Court Hotel with her boyfriend, John Martin.
	   Martin, 53, in an interview with The Mail on Sunday, said a
neurology report is due Thursday.
	   ``I don't know what the neurologist will say. I fear I know what
he will tell us,'' Martin was quoted as adding. ``I still have
hope, but at the back of my mind something tells me to expect the
worst.''
	   A spokeswoman at the James Paget Hospital near Great Yarmouth,
on England's east coast, said Mrs. Bridges was ``critical but
stable.''
	   ``There's little improvement. That's all I can say,'' added
Rosemary Smalley, clinical operational manager at the hospital's
intensive care unit.

Eight newspapers fail to publish in Algeria

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Eight Algerian newspapers failed to
appear Sunday following a decision by independent editors to
suspend publication over a dispute with state-run printing plants.
	   The ``unlimited'' suspension was provoked by demands by three
state printing plants that four newspapers, El Watan, Le Matin, La
Tribune et Le Soir d'Algerie pay overdue bills for 1996 and 1997.
	   Four other newspapers have joined the protest, which comes amid
a power struggle that ensued after President Liamine Zeroual
decided in September to step down and call early elections
	   Meanwhile, an upsurge in violence since Zeroual's announcement
continued Sunday, with reports of 12 deaths since Friday.
	   Ahmed Ancer, a senior editor at El Watan, said he believed the
decision by the state printing plants was ``political'' and ``aimed
at shutting down the newspapers.''
	   The executive editor of El Watan, Omar Belhouchet, said the move
was ``retaliation'' for articles in the newspaper that were
critical of Justice Minister Mohamed Adami.
	   Last week, both El Watan and Le Matin published articles written
by a group of magistrates describing Adami's alleged escapades with
prisoners and prostitutes.
	   Adami resigned Sunday, Algerian radio reported.
	   Earlier Sunday, the newspapers issued a communique saying the
demand for overdue payments were ``false commercial pretexts, but
real political reasons.''
	   On Wednesday, the four main independent newspapers were given
until January to pay their debts to the state-run printing plants.
	   The government has a monopoly on printing plants, and on three
occasions since 1993 it has opposed efforts by independent
newspapers to import their own presses.
	   Meanwhile, there were reports of new violence across Algeria.
	   The killings were the latest in an insurgency that has claimed
at least 75,000 lives since the military-backed government canceled
January 1992 elections the Islamic Salvation Front was set to win.
	   Nine people were massacred early Sunday near the town of Hammam
Bouzine in eastern Algeria, the security forces said. No further
details were available.
	   In Hassi El Ghella, near Ain Temouchent about 400 kilometers
(250 miles) west of Algiers, three villagers had their throats slit
Friday night, a hospital worker said.
	   On Saturday, Algerian newspapers reported government security
forces killed 30 Muslim militants during a week-long offensive in
the brush east of the capital.

Deposed Malaysian leader says Prime Minister Mahathir fears
</HEADLINE>
people's wrath &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to clarify Anwar not released from detention, UPDATES
with peaceful protest, graf 8 &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's former No. 2 leader
says an easing of the conditions of his detention was prompted by
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's fear of his countrymen's wrath
and pressure from the international community.
	   In the first statement issued since his arrest nearly a month
ago, dismissed deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim protested his
treatment in prison, but vowed that neither he nor his reform
movement would be beaten into submission.
	   After he had organized mammoth rallies against the government,
Anwar, 51, was taken into custody Sept. 20 under the Internal
Security Act, which allows for indefinite imprisonment without
trial. After 24 days, he was placed under a less strict form of
custody that permits access to his lawyers and family.
	   ``The detention was an attempt to weaken my resolve. They have
failed,'' the dissident said in the statement from his jail cell.
``It is time for change.''
	   Anwar has alleged he has suffered from police beatings while
awaiting trial on a number of corruption and sex charges.
	   In the statement, circulated by his wife Azizah Ismail late
Saturday, Anwar revived his calls for reform and his attack on the
government.
	   ``There must be an end to the abuse of instruments of
government; we must rid the country of corruption, cronyism and
nepotism,'' he said.
	   Sunday evening, about 70 people gathered in downtown Kuala
Lumpur and lit lanterns, announcing their solidarity with the
ousted leader. The peaceful protest outside the capital's Central
Market came one day ahead of a Hindu festival of lights.
	   Anwar said Mahathir's government had eased conditions of his
detention to stem growing public sympathy for Anwar and ease
pressure from abroad before Malaysia plays host to a summit meeting
next month of leaders from members of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   ``The plan was to get me out of ISA detention before APEC
begins,'' Anwar said.
	   He also accused Mahathir of using the security act, which was
enacted in 1960 to combat militant communists, as a means of
clinging to power.
	   Malaysia's police chief, meanwhile, said more charges could be
brought against Anwar, The Star newspaper reported Sunday. Rahim
Noor was quoted as saying that an investigation into the activities
of the dissident politician was continuing.
	   Anwar's case drew international condemnation after he appeared
in court with bruises and a black eye, and alleged he was a victim
of police brutality.
	   Among those sympathetic to him were governments of several
countries scheduled to attend the November APEC summit meeting in
Kuala Lumpur. The president of the Philippines has not yet
confirmed his attendance.
	   Malaysia says the economic forum should not be politicized.
	   Within Malaysia, protests have continued over Anwar's Sept. 2
dismissal and his subsequent arrest.
	   Defying a police order, Anwar's wife, Azizah, joined thousands
of protesters demanding Mahathir's resignation Saturday.
	   It was the first protest in which Azizah has participated since
her husband was arrested last month. Police have warned her against
getting involved in the reform campaign her husband began.
	   Hundreds of people rushed to Azizah's car shouting ``Reforms!
Reforms!'' and ``Mahathir Resign!'' She shook hands with some from
inside her car. The couple's 18-year-old daughter, Nurul Izzah,
accompanied her.
	   Later, police beat protesters with rattan canes to get them off
the streets. About 140 people were arrested, the Star reported.
	   Police fired a water cannon to disperse the crowd of nearly
10,000 protesters who had marched to the palace of Malaysia's
constitutional monarch, demanding that Anwar be reinstated as the
nation's deputy prime minister.
	   Mahathir, 72, has said he fired Anwar because the former
heir-apparent was morally unfit to rule. Anwar has denied the
charges, saying they were fabricated to eliminate the challenge he
had posed to Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   His trial begins Nov. 2.

Havel cleared by doctors to visit Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Doctors cleared President Vaclav
Havel to leave for an official visit to Britain starting on Monday,
his personal doctor said Sunday.
	   ``The president took some rest and his condition stabilized over
the weekend,'' Havel's doctor Ilja Kotik told Czech radio.
	   Havel, 62, fought off a life-threatening case of pneumonia in
August and had an emergency surgery for a ruptured colon in April.
	   After his visit to the United States last month, followed by
weeks of a busy program at home, Havel looked tired and had
breathing difficulties, raising suspicion his trip to Britain may
be postponed.
	   But Kotik said Havel underwent medical checks which proved the
president's condition is good.
	   ``We have no objections to the president's trip,'' Kotik said.
	   Havel is to leave for the four-day official visit on Monday. In
London, he is scheduled to meet with Queen Elizabeth II and Prime
Minister Tony Blair. He will also travel to Belfast, Glasgow and
Oxford.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With pointed talk about democracy, rivals China
and Taiwan on Sunday wrapped up talks that failed to bridge wide
differences but ended a hostile freeze in relations.
	   Taiwan's chief envoy to China, Koo Chen-fu, capped his
path-breaking five-day visit by urging President Jiang Zemin that
China needs to follow Taiwan's example as a democracy.
	   But the atmosphere was comfortable, the 81-year-old negotiator
for Taiwan said afterward, calling Jiang ``an old friend'' whom he
has met several times at international meetings.
	   ``Not a single person was angry. If there was anger, we would
not have been able to talk with each other for an hour and a
half,'' Koo told reporters.
	   The talk was more blunt in Koo's first appointment Sunday, with
Vice Premier Qian Qichen, the communist government's leading
strategist on dealing with the island. Both sides _ political heirs
to the combatants in the Chinese civil war _ laid out long-held
positions that have frustrated compromise in the past.
	   Koo argued that Taiwan is a sovereign state and will accept no
lesser status. He said reunification has to wait until China
becomes a democracy.
	   Qian insisted Taiwan was just a part of China with no right to
sovereignty. But he said the island could keep its capitalist
system after reunification.
	   ``It is obviously not realistic for some people in Taiwan to
preach that `Taiwan-style democracy' should be the decisive factor
of the reunification,'' the state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted
Qian as telling Koo.
	   Tang Shubei, one of China's most senior negotiators with Taiwan,
warned Taipei to change its position or risk harming the progress
the two sides have made.
	   China and Taiwan split into rival governments after Mao
Tse-tung's Communists sent Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fleeing
from the mainland in 1949.
	   The two sides have rarely dealt face-to-face since. Talks
started in 1993 by Koo, an influential business tycoon and
Nationalist Party member, and Wang Daohan, an ex-mayor of Shanghai
and mentor to Chinese President Jiang, were scrubbed two years
later by Beijing out of anger over perceived Taiwanese moves toward
independence.
	   Meeting for only the second time ever, the two elder statesmen
agreed in Shanghai last week to have the government-backed groups
they head look into restarting the talks.
	   Koo said he never expected to resolve differences quickly. His
main achievement was exploring how to revive the talks. He added
that President Jiang approved of the agreement and hoped for more
discussions.
	   ``I thought the atmosphere was very good,'' Koo said. ``Although
we have different positions, we do not fear the differences. There
were no barbs.''
	   Taiwan believes future dialogue can narrow differences, ``and we
do have the patience,'' Koo said.
	   Koo said he spoke of democracy only in general terms with Jiang.
The envoy said he recognized Taiwan's version may not be a perfect
fit, but ``if the Chinese mainland wishes to promote its economic
development in the future, it has to take a brave stride forward on
the path to democratization.''
	   Taipei has tried to use Koo's visit to increase China's
understanding of its vibrant democracy. Koo invited Wang to visit
Taiwan, and suggested he come during the December general election.
	   Wang is expected to make the trip early next year.
	   In another sign of China's prickliness over democracy, Beijing
refused to allow Kang Ning-hsiang, a leading figure in Taiwan's
democracy movement who was part of Koo's delegation, to attend the
meeting with Jiang. Chinese officials wanted a small meeting.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Seven people were feared buried by a mud
slide in suburban Taipei Sunday, the second such disaster triggered
by torrential rains that followed Typhoon Zeb.
	   Earth above three homes and a factory in Wuku, west of Taipei,
broke loose at midafternoon, releasing a wave of mud that buried 11
people, witnesses said.
	   Neighbors rescued four, and scores of rescuers were moving earth
with back hoes and probing pools of mud with poles in hopes of
finding the other seven.
	   On Friday, five people, including a married couple and one of
their daughters, died when their home was buried by loose rock and
mud.
	   Zeb killed 25 people and left another dozen missing when it
raged through Taiwan last Thursday and Friday, washing out bridges
and embankments and flooding large parts of suburban Taipei.
	   Repeated mud slide tragedies during typhoon season have prompted
calls for tighter rules on development of slope land.

Russian peacekeeper killed in breakaway Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen attacked a
peacekeeping outpost in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia
on Sunday, killing one Russian soldier, officials said.
	   The attackers opened fire on the post in the restive Ghali
district just after midnight, said Nikolai Komarov, a duty officer
at the headquarters of the Russian peacekeeping force.
	   The Russian soldier died on the way to the hospital after
getting hit twice in the chest and once in the arm.
	   Reserve Russian troops went to the scene and briefly exchanged
fire with the attackers, who then fled, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Georgia lost Abkhazia, a region on the Black Sea, to
secessionist forces in 1993 after 13 months of fighting. About
250,000 Georgians were forced to flee their homes.
	   Russian peacekeepers have kept the two sides apart since June
1994, enforcing a security zone in the Ghali district between
Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia. But peacekeepers have been unable
to stem the frequent outbursts of violence that continue to plague
the region.

Serbian parliament to pass more restrictive information law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Serbian government has drafted a
new information law expected to further restrict the work of the
independent media and pave the way for a shutdown of those deemed
disobedient, critics said Sunday.
	   The Serbian parliament will meet Tuesday to pass the proposed
law. The announcement followed a government decree last week
imposing censorship and a shutdown of three independent newspapers
and a radio station that refused to obey the decree.
	   No details of the draft were immediately available but
representatives of Serbia's independent media said Sunday it is
aimed at legalizing the government crackdown.
	   ``I think this law will be more restrictive than any previous
one and probably the worst media law in Serbia ever,'' said
Aleksandar Tijanic, a former information minister and a columnist
in the banned Dnevni Telegraf daily.
	   He said the government has ``introduced a state of emergency in
the Serbian media and society.''
	   The government, loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
has used the concern over possible NATO air attacks on military
targets in Serb-led Yugoslavia to clamp down on its opponents. It
has issued a series of decrees tightening state control in the
country.
	   One such decree imposed a temporary ban on broadcasts of
Serbian-language programs by foreign media and demanded
``patriotic'' reporting from the independent media critical of
Milosevic's policies.
	   Throughout the eight-month Kosovo crisis, state officials have
accused the media of betraying Serbia's national interests by
reporting ethnic Albanian stands in the conflict. Last week, the
government shut down prominent Nasa Borba, Danas and Dnevni
Telegraf dailies, following eviction of the popular Index radio
from its premises.
	   The moves have triggered a wave of domestic and international
protests but to no effect.
	   The bellicose deputy premier, who has threatened retaliation
against foreigners in Serbia, announced that the new information
law would permanently ban foreign media broadcasts in Yugoslavia.
Vojislav Seselj also said that ethnic Albanian media in Kosovo were
being closely monitored.
	   Veran Matic, head of an independent media association, said he
expected the law also will restrict the possibility that
independent media will be assigned broadcasting frequencies or
given work permits. Matic also said he expected introduction of a
wide range of possible penalties for non-government reporting,
including financial fees.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt and Turkey aim to boost trade between
the two countries to dlrs 1 billion over the next two years,
Egyptian Trade Minister Ahmed Guweili said Sunday.
	   Two-way trade between the two countries totaled dlrs 700 million
in 1997, the minister told the opening ceremony of a joint
Egyptian-Turkish trade conference. About 100 Turkish businessmen
are participating.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Visiting Turkish official Mehmet Batalli
held talks Sunday with Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan,
over increasing trade, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   The agency said Ramadan told Batalli, a state minister with
special responsibility for Iraq, that it was important to expand
trade relations ``in the interests of both nations.''
	   Batalli said his visit ``shows the keenness of his country on
finding new means of economic cooperation,'' INA said.
	   Turkey says it has lost more than 30 billion dollars worth of
business with Iraq because of U.N. trade sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Batalli also met Sunday with Iraq's finance minister and its
housing minister, INA said.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's Cabinet on Sunday approved the first
reading of a bill to allow the private sector to open universities
and technical colleges.
	   Kuwaitis have complained that the country's only university,
which is run by the state, is unable to accommodate the increasing
numbers of high school graduates who want to attend.
	   According to a Cabinet statement, the proposed law also would
allow foreign universities to open branches in this oil-rich Gulf
country.
	   The Cabinet has to approve a second reading of the bill before
it is forwarded to the 50-seat National Assembly.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A New York-based humanitarian organization
said Sunday it will issue grants to Palestinian refugees to help
them start small, income-generating projects in Jordan, an official
said Sunday.
	   The assistance from the American Near East Refugee Aid is in
line with government efforts to improve the living conditions of
more than 2 million Palestinian refugees who fled or were driven
from their homes in the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars.
	   ANERA plans a survey soon to determine the needs of refugee camp
residents, said Ibrahim Badran, director of the Jordanian
government's Palestinian Affairs Department.
	   The Jordan news agency Petra quoted ANERA president Peter Gubser
as saying his organization already is giving funds to Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Badran said ``there is a dire need'' to improve living
conditions in Jordan's 13 Palestinian refugee camps, which lack
basic infrastructure and services.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait, the second
largest commercial bank on the island, said Sunday its net profit
during the third quarter rose to 8.2 million dinars (dlrs 21.7
million) from 8.1 million dinars (dlrs 21.4 million) in the
year-earlier period.
	   The bank also said that total assets fell slightly to 903.2
million dinars (dlrs 2.3 billion) from 906.9 million dinars (dlrs
2.4 billion) in the same period in 1997.
	   The bank, which is listed on the Bahrain and Kuwait stock
exchanges, published a full balance sheet but did not comment on
the results.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Manufactured goods constitute more than half
of Iran's non-oil exports, an export official was quoted Sunday as
saying.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Hossein Soltani,
deputy head of the Export Promotion Center of Iran, said industrial
goods made up 60 percent of the country's non-oil exports in the
first half of the fiscal year, which ended Sept. 22.
	   Soltani said that in the past, the majority of non-oil exports
were carpets, pistachios and other commodities.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Japanese Ambassador Takeshi Ohara and
Suzanne Mubarak, the wife of President Hosni Mubarak, on Sunday
reopened the Cairo University Pediatric Hospital after a dlrs 11.2
million upgrade.
	   The renovation, funded by a grant from Japan, included
improvements in patient and nursing staff areas and a better
ventilation system, according to a statement from the embassy.
	   The hospital was built with a dlrs 17 million grant from Japan
in 1981. It is the only pediatric hospital in Egypt and serves as a
research center for Africa and the Middle East, the statement said.

Archaeologists discover Byzantine pot of gold

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Archaeologists needed only bare hands _ not a
rainbow _ to unearth a pot of gold at an excavation site in
northern Israel Sunday.
	   Workers digging at Bet Shean, known for its extensive ruins
dating back to Roman times, found a 6th-century ceramic jug
containing between 200 and 400 gold coins.
	   The jug was found hidden beneath the floor of a room in a
Byzantine-era neighborhood outside Bet Shean's ancient city walls.
	   ``This is very important,'' said Ofer Sion, an archaeologist
with Israel's Antiquities Authority. ``We find coins every day, but
not so many.''
	   Sion believes someone stashed the treasure underneath the floor
but never had the chance to reclaim it.
	   The site where the jug was found is believed to have been a
wealthy neighborhood during Byzantine rule, which began in the 4th
century after the fall of the Roman empire and lasted until the 7th
century.
	   There are plans to build a youth hostel on the site. In
accordance with Israel law, about 60 workers are now conducting a
four-month ``rescue dig'' before construction starts.
Archaeologists have one month left to dig.
	   Sion said the coins will be cleaned and counted during the next
few days and eventually turned over to the Rockefeller Museum in
Jerusalem, which is devoted to archaeology.

Report: Clinton to threaten recognition of Palestinian state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3 and 12 with reports partial agreement
likely to emerge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton aims to put
pressure on Israel by threatening to recognize a Palestinian state
this spring if the two sides don't reach an agreement at the
Mideast summit outside Washington, Israel's army radio reported
Sunday.
	   The report, citing an unidentified American official, said
Clinton would use the tactic to try to propel Israel to accept a
long-sought after deal with the Palestinians, under which Israel
would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
security guarantees.
	   However, diplomatic sources said Sunday that only a partial West
Bank agreement is likely to emerge from the talks, but completion
of a full accord would probably take several weeks.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would declare a
Palestinian state unilaterally in May 1999, when the interim peace
talks between the sides are set to expire. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has threatened unspecified unilateral steps in response
that could include annexing chunks of the West Bank.
	   Talks at the Maryland retreat of Wye Plantation, in their third
day, were moving into high gear Sunday with the arrival of Israel's
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.
	   Upon their arrival, Netanyahu was to convene a special session
of his inner security cabinet on the grounds of the retreat, Israel
radio reported.
	   Israel radio also reported that an announcement would be made
Sunday night by the Americans on whether an agreement has been
reached or if the summit will be extended until one has been
struck.
	   Although a press blackout remains in effect on the summit,
details about the talks continued to leak out.
	   Several Israeli press reports painted a picture of a frustrated
Clinton who told both sides categorically that he intended to push
an agreement through.
	   ``I've been working on this deal for 17 months and I'm not
prepared to defer it any longer,'' Clinton was quoted by the
Israeli daily Maariv as having told both Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   Wide gaps still remain on security issues, Israeli media have
reported. The CIA has been helping broker talks between the sides
on security issues, Maariv said.
	   In addition, Israel radio reported that the Palestinians said
Israeli negotiators have refused to take up three issues: the scope
of later West Bank troop withdrawals, the release of Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails, and a commitment to halt house
demolitions and confiscation of Palestinian property.
	   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, some 300 relatives of Palestinian
prisoners being held by Israel held a protest Sunday, chanting
slogans and holding up pictures of imprisoned family members. They
demanded that the release of the prisoners be put on the summit
agenda.
	   Also Sunday, Salah Taamari, a minister without portfolio in the
Palestinian Authority said that Israel has plans to build four new
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, army radio said. It said
settlers neither confirmed nor denied the report.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ New world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport won
the battle of the women's top guns on Sunday, successfully
defending her crown from second-seed Venus Williams in the
all-American final of the dlrs 1 million European Championships.
	   Davenport overcame her younger compatriot 7-5, 6-3 in 73
minutes, becoming the first women's player to capture six titles
this year.
	   Davenport, who officially took over as the world's top player
from Martina Hingis this week, will remain atop the world rankings
another week, while Williams maintains her place at number five.
	   The win extends Davenport's five year winning streak in
Switzerland to 17 victories. The American has not dropped a set for
the past two years at the Zurich tournament, which was renamed
Swisscom Challenge mid-way through the event.

Kuwait arrests 2 Iraqis for illegally entering country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Authorities have arrested two Iraqis for illegally
entering Kuwait, the Interior Ministry said Sunday.
	   A statement by the ministry did not give the names of the men or
say why they wanted to be in Kuwait. But it said they first crossed
to Saudi Arabia, then entered Kuwait from the kingdom.
	   The men could stand trial and then face prison terms or
deportation.
	   Kuwait's border with Iraq has been closed since the 1991 Gulf
War, which ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of this oil-rich
country.
	   Since the war, Kuwait has built a trench along its 210-kilometer
(130 mile) desert border to prevent any entry by Iraqis.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A former aide to Saddam Hussein's oldest son
was quoted Sunday as saying that Odai was critical of his father's
tactics in the 1990-91 Gulf crisis.
	   In an interview with the London-based Al-Hayat, Abbas al-Janabi,
who was the personal secretary of Odai Hussein, said Odai felt Iraq
should have occupied Saudi Arabia's oil fields ``and threatened to
set them on fire if the Americans attacked Iraq.''
	   Iraq, which invaded Kuwait in August 1990, set hundreds of
Kuwait's oil wells ablaze before retreating from U.S.-led coalition
forces in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Al-Janabi, who defected to the West last spring, said Odai also
believed his father made a mistake in releasing dozens of Europeans
and Americans held as ``human shields'' before the war, Al-Hayat
said, suggesting their presence would have discouraged the allied
offensive.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The presidents of Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania called Sunday for a cessation of hostilities in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and for the installation of an
international peacekeeping force to enforce it.
	   The call came following a summit hosted by President Daniel arap
Moi in the Kenyan capital with Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda
and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania.
	   In a printed statement issued at the conclusion of the meeting,
the East African Cooperation Consultative Summit called for nine
steps to end the crisis.
	   The statement called for the immediate cessation of hostilities,
the negotation of a cease-fire agreement and a troop standstill and
the ``emplacement of a neutral international peacekeeping force''
under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity and the
United Nations.
	   No indication was given which countries would participate in
such a force or if any plans were already drawn up.
	   The three leaders did not address reporters but entered directly
into their cars following the nearly three-hour meeting.
	   An official at State House, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed reports that the meeting was delayed in starting because
the leaders had waited for Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   But Kabila, who accuses Uganda and Rwanda of spearheading the
rebellion that broke out in the east of his vast central African
nation on Aug. 2, did not show up.
	   Rwanda and Uganda have not openly acknowledged their support for
the Congolese rebels, but have maintained they have legitimate
security concerns along their western borders with Congo.
	   Both complain that rebels from their country have been able to
operate freely in eastern Congo and launch cross-border attacks
aimed at destabilizing the two countries.
	   Museveni has downright denied his troops are participating in
the Congolese war, and says they are only inside Congo along the
Ugandan border to fight the Ugandan Allied Democratic Rebels based
there. An Associated Press reporter has seen Rwandan troops at the
Congolese war front.
	   The statement Sunday said the leaders ``reaffirmed the unity and
territorial integrity of the D.R.C. '' but further stressed ``the
need to address the genuine security concerns of the countries
neighboring the D.R.C.''
	   Kabila has so far refused to meet with the rebels saying they
are puppets of Rwanda and Uganda whom he claims invaded his
country.
	   In an apparent call to Kabila to hold direct talks with the
rebels, the leaders also called for the opening of ``all-inclusive
political dialogue.''
	   Several countries in the region have also been drawn into the
conflict in support of Kabila. Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad
have all acknowledged sending troops to support Kabila; rebel
officials say Sudan has also sent troops.
	   Kabila visited the Sudanese capital Khartoum Saturday and held
talks with Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir.
	   ``The summit noted with grave concern the escalation of the
conflict which has taken wider dimension threatening to engulf the
whole region including the East African sub region,'' the statement
said, calling also for the ``orderly withdrawal of all foreign
troops.''
	   The meeting Sunday followed what rebels claim was a major
victory last week when they captured the eastern town of Kindu and
its strategic air base.
	   Kabila's forces had been using the base to attack rebel
strongholds in the east.

Rosenborg clinches Norwegian league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ For the seventh consecutive time
Rosenborg finally cemented the Norwegian league title after
trouncing the bottom team Sogndal 4-0 Sunday.
	   Jan Derek Sorensen scored two goals in the 32nd and 59th
minutes. With two goals in the 43rd and 88th, Sigurd Rushfeldt has
27 goals for the season. Sogndal never had a chance.
	   Rosenborg trailed Molde for much of the season, but after they
beat Molde 2-0 in Molde on Sept. 26 much was settled. Rosenborg was
not going to give up their lead.
	   Before the last round on Oct. 24, Rosenborg will win the league
with at least five points because Molde lost their home game
against Stromsgodset 1-3.
	   Sogndal has been doomed for a while, and they will play in the
first division and not the elite division next season. Either
Haugesund or Kongsvinger will follow Sogndal down.
	   In the next round these two teams will play the bottom final at
Haugesund. Only victory is good enough for Haugesund because
Kongsvinger only needs a tie to avoid going directly down the tube.
	   The loser will play two qualifiers against the first division
team Kjelsas for the place in the elite division. Next season Odd
Grenland and Skeid will join Rosenborg in the elite division.

Russians assign 200 to observer mission in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia started assigning 200 observers Sunday to
the international monitoring force overseeing a peace plan to avert
NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, a lawmaker said.
	   Sergei Baburin, hard-line vice speaker of the lower house of
Russia's parliament, made his comments Sunday after leading a
Russian delegation to Yugoslavia to discuss the Kosovo conflict,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Russia shares Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian religion
with Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, and strongly
opposes NATO's proposed airstrikes.
	   The 2,000-strong monitoring force, part of a peace deal reached
last week, must verify that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
pulls his troops from Kosovo.
	   A leading liberal lawmaker in the Russian delegation to
Belgrade, Vladimir Lukin, joined calls for supporting the Serbs on
Sunday.
	   ``We should be with old traditional friends at difficult
times,'' ITAR-Tass quoted Lukin as saying in Belgrade. Lukin chairs
the parliament's foreign affairs committee and is a member of the
Yabloko party.
	   He was more cautious about the peace deal than other Russian
politicians, who have claimed credit for bringing about peace
agreement and have sounded confident that it will hold.
	   ``The situation is somewhat euphoric .... However, conflicts
still may break up, and preparations should be made for them,''
Lukin said.
	   Meanwhile, a Belarusian nationalist party has recruited at least
300 people to fight alongside the Serbs in case NATO strikes,
prompting a reprimand from the justice ministry.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party's recruiting activities violate
Belarus' constitution, chief justice ministry spokesman Vladimir
Matveyev said Sunday. The party is linked to Russian
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who leads a Russian party of
the same name.
	   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has promised to help
Serbia with weapons if NATO proceeds with airstrikes, but not
troops.

General strike paralyzes Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ At least 50 people were injured in
Bangladesh's capital Sunday in clashes during a general strike
called by the opposition protesting harassment and the government's
handling of flood relief.
	   The protesters and the supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina clashed with crude bombs and exchanged gunfire, police said.
Rafiqual Islam, a former minister, was among the injured.
	   Police said several people were shot and taken to hospitals.
Hasina's supporters marched through the Dhaka streets, leading to
confrontation with opposition activists.
	   Nearly 5,000 police and paramilitary soldiers were deployed in
Dhaka, the Home Ministry said.
	   An alliance of seven opposition parties enforced a 12-hour
shutdown accusing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government of
harassing opposition activists and siphoning off funds meant for
people affected by recent floods.
	   Hasina denied the allegations in a speech over state-run radio
and television Saturday night.
	   Most traffic was stopped and stores closed Sunday, paralyzing
the city of nine million people.
	   Police detained at least 70 protesters on charges of exploding
homemade firecrackers and smashing vehicles of people who defied
the strike, United News of Bangladesh said.
	   Sunday is a working day in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh,
where the sabbath is observed on Friday.

BayStars beat Lions 9-4 in Japan Series opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) _ Robert Rose doubled home a run in the
three-run third inning as the Yokohama BayStars beat the Seibu
Lions 9-4 Sunday in the opening game of Japan's professional
baseball championship series.
	   The BayStars, who had waited 38 years since their only other
Central League championship, wasted no time building a 7-0 lead
after four innings in the opener of the best-of-seven Japan Series
before a capacity crowd of 29,000 at Yokohama Stadium.
	   Takanori Suzuki, the Central League's leading hitter for two
consecutive years, singled home the first run in the first inning
against Fumiya Nishiguchi (13-12), who led the Pacific League in
strikeouts with 148 this season.
	   Suzuki, a .337 hitter in the regular season, singled home
another run in the third inning and scored on the double by Rose,
who formerly played for the California Angels. Rose scored on
Takahiro Saeki's single.
	   The BayStars added three runs in the fourth inning on three hits
and a wild pitch by Lions reliever Shinji Mori.
	   The closest the Lions could come was 7-2 in the sixth inning and
8-4 in the seventh. The Lions, Pacific League champions for the
second consecutive year, scored on a two-run home run by Taisei
Takagi after a triple by Tatsuya Ozeki, and then on an RBI double
by pinch hitter Yoshiaki Kanemura and a single by Kazuo Matsui.
	   The BayStars scored one run each in the seventh and eighth
innings.
	   Their ace reliever, Kazuhiro Sasaki, who had 45 saves in the
regular season, retired the last four Lions batters.
	   The series opener, originally scheduled Saturday, had been
postponed because of Typhoon Zeb.
	   Game 2 will be played at Yokohama Stadium Monday.
	   The Seibu Lions have won the Japan Series eight times, but lost
last year to the Yakult Swallows, four games to one. The BayStars
have never won a Japan Series.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ New world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport won
the battle of the women's top guns on Sunday, successfully
defending her crown from second-seed Venus Williams in the
all-American final of the dlrs 1 million European Championships.
	   Davenport overcame her younger compatriot 7-5, 6-3 in 73
minutes, becoming the first women's player to capture six titles
this year.
	   Davenport, who officially took over as the world's top player
from Martina Hingis this week, will remain atop the world rankings
another week, while Williams maintains her place at number five.
	   The win extends Davenport's five year winning streak in
Switzerland to 17 victories. The American has not dropped a set for
the past two years at the Zurich tournament, which was renamed
Swisscom Challenge mid-way through the event.

Rosenborg clinches Norwegian league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ For the seventh consecutive time,
Rosenborg finally cemented the Norwegian league title after
trouncing the bottom team Sogndal 4-0 Sunday.
	   Jan Derek Sorensen scored two goals in the 32nd and 59th
minutes. With two goals in the 43rd and 88th, Sigurd Rushfeldt has
27 goals for the season. Sogndal never had a chance.
	   Rosenborg trailed Molde for much of the season, but after they
beat Molde 2-0 in Molde on Sept. 26, Rosenborg was about going to
give up a hard-won lead.
	   The last round is on Oct. 24, but Rosenborg has wrapped up the
league with at least five points because Molde lost their home game
against Stromsgodset 1-3.
	   Sogndal has been doomed for a while, and they will play in the
first division and not the elite division next season. Either
Haugesund or Kongsvinger will follow Sogndal down.
	   In the next round, these two teams will play the bottom final at
Haugesund. Haugesund needs victory, but Kongsvinger only needs a
tie to avoid going directly down the tube.
	   The loser will play two qualifiers against the first division
team Kjelsas for the place in the elite division. Next season Odd
Grenland and Skeid will join Rosenborg in the elite division.

Castro disagrees with arrest of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIVIAN SEQUERA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ President Fidel Castro said Sunday he
disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of ``international meddling.''
	   Castro compared the action with the establishment in Rome in
August of an International Criminal Court, a move Cuba has
expressed reservations about.
	   ``It seems to me that what has happened there (in London) is
universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters covering the
Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday. Castro had just
finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel.
	   He said the case seemed to be ``unprecedented and unusual.''
	   Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by
British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. The
judge is probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile
under his rule in the 1970s and 80s.
	   Castro, Latin America's only remaining authoritarian leader,
said he lacked details on the case against Pinochet, but said he
thought it placed the government of Chile and President Eduardo
Frei in an uncomfortable position while Frei is attending the
summit.
	   Castro said the International Criminal Court ought to be
independent of the U.N. Security Council, because ``we already know
who commands there,'' an obvious reference to the United States.
	   The United States was one of only seven countries that voted
against creating the court.
	   ``The (Pinochet) case is serious ... the problem is delicate''
and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament and armed forces bear
watching, Castro said.
	   He expressed surprise that the British had arrested Pinochet,
especially since he had provided support for England during its
1982 war with Argentina over the Malvina or Falkland Islands.
Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war, it was accused
of providing military intelligence to the British.
	   Castro joked that he would have thought police could have waited
another 24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow
the summit being held here.
	   ``Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet instead of
the summit,'' he said.
	   Pinochet left government in 1990, but remained as army chief
until March when he became a senator-for-life.
	   The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's arrest,
insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic
passport and had immunity from arrest.

Iraqi newspaper says action will be taken to prevent U.N. spying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi newspaper on Sunday reiterated the
country's allegations that U.N. weapons inspectors are spying and
warned that ``proper measures'' would be taken to protect Iraq's
security.
	   The editorial in Al-Thawra, published by Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's ruling Baath party, came a day after Iraq disclosed a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urging him to stop the
inspectors' ``dangerous practices.''
	   The letter, the paper said, ``intends to remind the
international community that if such an action is not taken (by the
United Nations), then Iraq is liable to take the proper measures to
protect its safety and sovereignty.''
	   The paper did not say what those measures might be.
	   Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees weapons inspections, of spying. Its charges gained more
attention after Scott Ritter, an American, quit the team and
disclosed that U.N. inspectors had been cooperating with Israeli
and American intelligence agencies.
	   Iraq has been under trade sanctions that were imposed by the
U.N. Security Council after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
council has said they will not be lifted until the U.N. inspectors
certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Aug. 5,
effectively blocking spot checks for weapons. But it has continued
to cooperate with U.N. monitors working at sites that were
previously surveyed.
	   In his letter to Annan, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq
Aziz, demanded an investigation into the practices of the 40 U.N.
monitors still in the country.
	   Al-Thawra, in its editorial, said: ``They are not acting as
international representatives. They are acting as spies under
international cover using the domination of the United States on
the Special Commission.''
	   Both the letter and the editorial said the monitors had asked
about Iraq's agricultural and water resources _ issues, they said,
were beyond the purview of the inspectors.
	   The paper warned that if the monitors' spying activities were
not stopped, ``Iraq will have to act in the same way it does when
facing an exposed plot ... in order to protect its safety,
sovereignty and independence.''

Netanyahu denies U.S. threatening to recognize Palestinian state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton aims to put
pressure on Israel by threatening to recognize a Palestinian state
this spring if the two sides don't reach a swift agreement,
Israel's army radio reported Sunday.
	   The report, citing an unidentified American official, said
Clinton would use the tactic to try to propel Israel to accept a
long-sought after deal with the Palestinians, under which Israel
would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
security guarantees.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied any such pressure had
been applied so far during the U.S.-hosted talks at a retreat on
Maryland's Eastern Shore.
	   ``The reports are baseless and that option was never discussed
in conversations with the prime minister and his delegation at Wye
Plantation,'' Netanyahu's office said in a statement issued in
Jerusalem.
	   Diplomatic sources said Sunday that only a partial West Bank
agreement is likely to emerge from the talks, and completion of a
full accord would probably take several weeks.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would declare a
Palestinian state unilaterally in May 1999, when the interim peace
talks between the sides are set to expire. Netanyahu has threatened
unspecified unilateral steps in response that could include
annexing chunks of the West Bank.
	   Talks at the Maryland retreat of Wye Plantation, in their third
day, were moving into high gear Sunday with the arrival of Israel's
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.
	   Upon their arrival, Netanyahu was convening a special session of
his inner security cabinet on the grounds of the retreat, Israel
radio reported.
	   Israel radio also reported that an announcement would be made
Sunday night by the Americans on whether an agreement has been
reached or if the summit would be extended until one has been
struck.
	   Although a press blackout remains in effect, details about the
talks continued to leak out. Several Israeli press reports painted
a picture of a frustrated Clinton who told both sides categorically
that he intended to push an agreement through.
	   ``I've been working on this deal for 17 months and I'm not
prepared to defer it any longer,'' Clinton was quoted by the
Israeli daily Maariv as having told both Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   Wide gaps still remain on security issues, Israeli media have
reported. The CIA has been helping broker talks between the sides
on security issues, Maariv said.
	   In addition, Israel radio reported that the Palestinians said
Israeli negotiators have refused to take up three issues: the scope
of later West Bank troop withdrawals, the release of Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails, and a commitment to halt house
demolitions and confiscation of Palestinian property.
	   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, some 300 relatives of Palestinian
prisoners being held by Israel held a protest Sunday, chanting
slogans and holding up pictures of imprisoned family members. They
demanded that the release of the prisoners be put on the summit
agenda.
	   Also Sunday, Salah Taamari, a minister without portfolio in the
Palestinian Authority said that Israel has plans to build four new
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, army radio said. It said
settlers neither confirmed nor denied the report.

Sculptures to be removed amid storm over artist remarks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Protesters on Sunday demanded removal of two
sculptures on display at Israel's Supreme Court after the artist
was quoted as saying disabled and elderly people and homosexuals
are ``superfluous'' and should be ``eliminated by the state.''
	   A court spokesman said the sculptures were already slated for
removal because an exhibit of works by artist Uri Lipschitz had
ended.
	   The protesters likened Lipschitz' remarks, made in an interview
published in the weekend magazine of the Haaretz newspaper, to
views of the Nazis.
	   About 100 protesters, made up of members of a leftist political
party, gay and lesbian activists and the disabled and their
supporters covered one of the sculptures with paper on Sunday to
protest the comments. They demanded its removal, along with that of
another Lipschitz sculpture inside the building.
	   Works by Lipschitz were displayed at the court for a month as
part of an exhibit marking Israel's 50th anniversary. The paintings
were taken down Thursday when the exhibit ended, before his
comments were published.
	   Court spokesman Moshe Gorali said the justices ``condemn
severely'' Lipschitz's remarks and added that his views were not
known to exhibit organizers earlier.
	   The sculptures were to have been removed at the end of the
exhibit, but equipment was not immediately available, Gorali said.
They were to be removed within a day or two, he said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police arrested a suspect in a stabbing attack on
two Mormon church missionaries in central Russia that left one dead
and the other hospitalized, police said Sunday.
	   A group of assailants stabbed to death Jose Manuel Mackintosh,
20, and wounded Bradley Alan Borden, 20, after the pair left the
home of a Mormon family in Ufa, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
east of Moscow, according to a press release issued by the church
in the United States.
	   Both missionaries are from the United States.
	   Borden, who was stabbed in the liver and stomach, was in
critical but stable condition in an Ufa hospital, Donald Jarvis,
head of the Mormon mission for the region, said Sunday. Mackintosh
was stabbed in the heart.
	   Police would not release any information about the arrested man.
Witnesses said the man who killed Mackintosh was drunk at the time,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Investigators believe the stabbing was an indiscriminate attack
and was not directed toward the Mormon church, said Rais Galin,
police spokesman for the district that includes Ufa.
	   Jarvis said he was convinced there were no religious or
political motives for the attack, and thanked police and doctors
for their ``friendly attitude'' in handling the case.
	   L. Aldin Porter, an official with The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints in Utah, said, ``We understand that this tragedy
was a random act of violence and that there was no premeditation.
Our representatives in Russia will cooperate fully with local
authorities in their investigation.''

AIDS to cut life expectancy in Zimbabwe _ report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ AIDS may cut life expectancy of
Zimbabweans to only 30 years over the next decade, a newspaper
reported Sunday, citing a new report from the United States.
	   The independent Sunday Standard newspaper said the U.S. Census
Bureau, in a new report, said AIDS brought life expectancy down
from 60 to between 40 and 50 years in the past decade.
	   According to current trends, ``life expectancy for babies born
in 2010 could be as low as 30 years,'' the report said, according
to the newspaper.
	   On Sunday, Census Bureau offices in Washington were closed and
no one was immediately available to comment on the newspaper report
or provide details.
	   Up to 25 percent of urban blacks in Zimbabwe are estimated to be
infected with the virus that causes AIDS, for which there is no
known cure.
	   According to the independent AIDS Counseling Trust, about 1.2
million Zimbabweans _ 10 percent of the overall population _ are
carriers of the AIDS virus.
	   Health officials say at least 800 Zimbabweans are dying of AIDS
each week. The figure could be far higher as many deaths are not
reported as AIDS-related.

Rockets hit Afghani capital, killing 3: Taliban claim to recapture
</HEADLINE>
key town &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Rockets hit an eastern neighborhood of
Afghanistan's capital Sunday, killing three people, all of them
civilians, said witnesses.
	   The rocket attack comes as the Taliban religious army, which
rules the capital and 90 percent of the country, is waging fierce
battles on three different fronts against its enemies, a
northern-based alliance led by former military chief Ahmed Shah
Massood.
	   There were conflicting reports that the Taliban had retaken the
northern Afghan city of Taloqan, which they lost a day earlier to
Massood's forces.
	   According to a Taliban spokesman Jehangir Wal, contacted by
telephone in southern Kandahar, the religious militia retook
control on late around 4 p.m. local time (11:30 GMT).
	   ``We have complete control'' he said.
	   However, a spokesman for the opposition, who gave his name only
as Arif, said the front line in Takhar province, of which Taloqan
is the capital, is still at Bangi, about 10 kilometers (six miles)
outside the city.
	   He said the Taliban launched a big offensive to try to recapture
the city, but were repulsed.
	   Both sides in Afghanistan's protracted conflict routinely make
claims that are difficult to independently confirm because of the
remoteness of the area.
	   In Kabul, residents ran for cover as rockets hit a residential
area near the combined military and civilian airport as night fell
Sunday.
	   Although no one took responsibility for the attack, the rockets
came from the direction of Massood's forces, eyewitnesses said.
	   Several rockets also landed at the airport, they said.
	   Dozens of Taliban fighter jets took off from the airport
throughout the day, apparently headed toward the front lines in
Takhar province and barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the
Kabul.
	   Arif said at least 10 people were wounded when Taliban jets
bombed Parwan and Kapisa provinces both north of the capital and
largely controlled by the opposition.
	   Heavy fighting raged in Sonakan Pass, about 80 kilometers (48
miles) north of Kabul, where the Taliban apparently have made some
gains. The pass is strategic because it gives protection to the
opposition soldiers at Baghram air force base.

New German government ready to launch post-Kohl era
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES and RECASTS with Schroeder popularity poll,
context. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Three weeks after voters dumped
long-serving Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Germany's election victors
have made clear the direction they want to take Europe's pivotal
nation: left.
	   The coalition deal completed by Social Democrats and Greens
shifts Germany's course in important areas such as atomic power,
the environment, integration of foreigners and taxes.
	   Final details announced Sunday include a pledge to scrap cuts in
retirement benefits pushed through by Kohl.
	   More broadly, the new leadership will guide Germans through
historic changes such as the government's return to the prewar
capital, Berlin, and the introduction of a common European
currency, the euro.
	   But with unemployment stuck above 10 percent and the economy
slowing, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has firmly set his No.
1 priority: jobs.
	   In a sign of high public expectations, his popularity soared to
an all-time high in a poll published Saturday. Schroeder overtook
Kohl protege Wolfgang Schaeuble at the top of the list, the
Electoral Research Group survey said.
	   While Germans seem ready to give Schroeder a chance, the
defeated administration around Kohl and other critics have been
quick to blast his emerging government's plans.
	   The latest target was Sunday's confirmation that the Social
Democrats and Greens intend to scrap cuts in retirement benefits
and health care that were part of the modest welfare reforms passed
by Kohl's government.
	   Peter Hintze, general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democrats,
called this approach ``a high risk for Germany as a business
location.''
	   Also under fire from business is the coalition's tax plan, which
would leave a bit more money in average earners' pockets but fill
the gap by curbing writeoffs for companies and well-off
individuals.
	   Bild am Sonntag, Germany's most-read Sunday paper, called the
reform ``pitiful'' because it didn't go far enough.
	   In a bigger policy shift, both parties agreed over the weekend
to raise energy taxes, something Kohl's government had shunned. The
first hike, to take effect Jan. 1, includes 6 pfennigs (4 cents) a
liter more on gasoline.
	   The new government insists voters gave it a mandate to try new
ways to put Germans back to work.
	   Higher energy taxes, for instance, are intended to finance a cut
in levies for social welfare programs that take a big bite out of
paychecks and push up costs for business, making German products
harder to sell abroad.
	   As the junior partner, the ecology-minded Greens were forced to
give up some of their more radical positions.
	   Their demand for a speed limit on the autobahn, Germany's
famously free superhighways, was shelved, along with calls for
ending compulsory army service, disbanding NATO in the long term
and a sharper hike in gas prices.
	   Still, the two parties are breaking new ground.
	   Talks with utilities on shutting down Germany's 19 nuclear power
plants are to start soon. And in a historic project recognizing
that Germany is more and more multicultural, children of foreigners
are to be offered automatic German citizenship for the first time.
	   On Monday, party leaders are to distribute Cabinet posts in
Germany's first center-left government in 16 years.
	   Schroeder has already announced his choice for finance minister:
Oskar Lafontaine, a traditional leftist who favors a strong social
welfare state and is the Social Democrats' national chairman.

Sculptures to be removed amid storm over artist remarks in Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Protesters on Sunday demanded removal of two
sculptures on display at Israel's Supreme Court after the artist
was quoted as saying disabled and elderly people and homosexuals
are ``superfluous'' and should be ``eliminated by the state.''
	   A court spokesman said the sculptures were already slated for
removal because an exhibit of works by artist Uri Lipschitz had
ended.
	   The protesters likened Lipschitz's remarks, made in an interview
published in the weekend magazine of the Haaretz newspaper, to
views of the Nazis.
	   About 100 protesters, made up of members of a leftist political
party, gay and lesbian activists and the disabled and their
supporters covered one of the sculptures with paper on Sunday to
protest the comments. They demanded its removal, along with that of
another Lipschitz sculpture inside the building.
	   Works by Lipschitz were displayed at the court for a month as
part of an exhibit marking Israel's 50th anniversary. The paintings
were taken down Thursday when the exhibit ended, before his
comments were published.
	   Court spokesman Moshe Gorali said the justices ``condemn
severely'' Lipschitz's remarks and added that his views were not
known to exhibit organizers earlier.
	   The sculptures were to have been removed at the end of the
exhibit, but equipment was not immediately available, Gorali said.
They were to be removed within a day or two, he said.

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday
he disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of ``universal meddling.''
	   Castro, Latin America's only remaining authoritarian leader,
said he lacked details on the case against Pinochet, but said he
thought it placed the government of Chile and President Eduardo
Frei in an uncomfortable position while Frei is attending the
Inter-American summit here.
	   ``It seems to me that what has happened there (in London) is
universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters covering the
Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday. Castro had just
finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel.
	   He said the case seemed to be ``unprecedented and unusual.''
	   Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by
British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. The
judge is probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile
under his rule in the 1970s and 80s.
	   The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's arrest,
insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic
passport and had immunity from arrest.
	   Castro, Latin America's only remaining authoritarian leader,
said he lacked details on the case against Pinochet, but said he
thought it placed the government of Chile and President Eduardo
Frei in an uncomfortable position while Frei is attending the
summit.
	   Castro compared the action with the establishment in Rome in
August of an International Criminal Court, a move Cuba has
expressed reservations about.
	   Castro said the court ought to be independent of the U.N.
Security Council, because ``we already know who commands there,''
an apparent reference to the United States.
	   The United States was one of only seven countries that voted
against creating the court.
	   ``The (Pinochet) case is serious ... the problem is delicate''
and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament and armed forces bear
watching, Castro said.
	   He expressed surprise that the British had arrested Pinochet,
especially since he had provided support to England during its 1982
war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands. Although Chile
maintained neutrality during the war, it was accused of providing
military intelligence to the British.
	   Castro joked that he would have thought police could have waited
another 24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow
the summit being held here.
	   ``Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet instead of
the summit,'' he said.
	   Pinochet left government in 1990, but remained as army chief
until March when he became a senator-for-life.

Poll says many Basques in Spain reject independence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Nearly half of Spain's Basques oppose
outright independence for their semi-autonomous region as sought by
the separatist group ETA, according to a poll released Sunday a
week before a key regional election.
	   While 42.8 percent of those surveyed oppose independence, 35.1
percent said they would vote to secede from Spain if a referendum
were held, said the poll carried out by Instituto Opina and
published by the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia.
	   The rest of those questioned either did not answer or said they
had no opinion.
	   But, paradoxically, 46.5 percent of Basques said their region
should have a constitutional right to break away from Spain, even
if they don't exercise it.
	   The survey was among a slew of polls released on the last day
such data can be made public before the Basque regional election
next Sunday, when voters will pick a new regional president and
renew a 75-seat legislature.
	   It will be the first election since ETA declared a ceasefire a
month ago after a 30-year campaign for an independent Basque
homeland.
	   Most of the polls predicted that the mainstream Basque
Nationalist Party, which pressed ETA for a truce, will remain the
region's top party but, as in the outgoing legislature, fall short
of a majority and need allies to pass bills.
	   A survey in El Mundo said the Popular Party, in power in Madrid,
would gain the most seats in the Basque election. It will go from
fourth place to possibly second.
	   Fighting it for second is a coalition that includes the pro-ETA
party Herri Batasuna, the poll said.
	   Another major daily, El Pais, said 40 percent of the people it
answered refused to say how they would vote.
	   The center-right government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
has said ETA must publicly accept the election results and lay down
its arms in order for a peace process to begin in earnest.
	   So far the government has reacted cautiously, saying it would
wait to see the elections results before acting. However last week
it did agree to move four ETA prisoners closer to home. Such
transfers are a long-standing ETA demand.

Serb official says rebels trying to scuttle peace agreement

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb official on Sunday accused
ethnic Albanian rebels of increasing attacks on police in Kosovo to
try to scuttle last week's peace agreement intended to avert NATO
air strikes.
	   ``These latest attacks show that the Albanian terrorsts are
trying by all possible means to prevent the realization of the ...
agreement,'' said Veljko Odalovic, the head of Kosovo's regional
government.
	   He spoke a day after NATO spy planes began flying over Kosovo
and an advance team for a 2,000-strong monitoring force arrived to
begin assessing whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was
complying with the peace agreement reached last Tuesday with U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Also Saturday, the Serb Media Center reported more than a dozen
attacks by Albanian guerrillas throughout the province. Associated
Press journalists witnessed the aftermath of the worst attack,
which killed three Serbian policemen in Orlate, 30 kilometers (20
miles) southwest of Pristina late Saturday night.
	   The conflicting events represented progress and setback for last
week's agreement that was intended to peacefully resolve the
conflict in the secessionist province in southern Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   A NATO attack plan remains on standby if Milosevic fails to
comply fully with the agreement, which calls for him to reduce
military forces in Kosovo to the levels before his crackdown on
Albanian separatists in February.
	   He also must give full access to the 2,000 ``compliance
verifiers'' and relief agencies trying to help scores of thousands
of Albanian refugees return to their homes before winter sets in.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have reported significant pullbacks by
Yugoslav forces in recent days but say the number remaining exceeds
the level required by the agreement reached by Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   But just a day after NATO gave Milosevic 10 more days to fulfill
his peace pledge, new attacks were reported throughout the
province.
	   In the Orlate attack, a grenade explosion in a house occupied by
Serbian policemen killed three and wounded two. The AP journalists
who drove by the house shortly afterward saw the bloodied bodies of
the three slain policemen in the attic.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina reported that other attacks
involved machine-gun fire, mortars and grenades.
	   ``This confirms what the international community has never
wanted to admit, that these bands of terrorists are not in favor of
a peaceful solution to the problem and are trying to take advantage
of the withdrawal of the police and military forces from Kosovo,''
Odalovic said.
	   The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs for at least two of the
incidents, saying police in the Pristina suburb of Vranjevac had
opened fire, hitting several Albanian houses and a car.
	   The conflicting claims could not be independently confirmed.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the KLA. More than
300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been forced from
their homes.
	   Many refugees have been afraid to return to their homes because
of the continuing presence of Serb police forces. But aid workers
and U.S. officials have reported a steady return in the last few
days.
	   NATO began an aerial surveillance mission Saturday by sending
U-2 planes high over Kosovo on a clear, sunny day in the southern
Balkans. Yugoslavia formally consented to the flights Thursday as
part the peace agreements.
	   After the first planes had returned, a White House official said
they found ``clear indications'' Milosevic was pulling back at
least two of seven force battalions as demanded by NATO commander
Wesley Clark on Thursday. They also showed improved access for
humanitarian and relief workers.
	   The new deadline for compliance is Oct. 27.
	   American diplomat William Graham Walker was appointed Saturday
to head the new mission by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. A sizable number of monitors were expected
to be in place in two weeks, and more than 20 members of an advance
team for the mission had arrived by Sunday afternoon.
	   John Sandrock, an American who is chief of mission support for
OSCE in Vienna, said upon arrival Sunday, ``We're glad we're here.
We're ready to do the preparatory work for the Kosovo Verification
mission. We're looking very much forward to consultations with the
people who have been here already, the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission. I hope to meet with them a little bit later, and we will
go from there.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - The vanguard of what will be 2,000
unarmed international ``compliance verifiers'' arrived in Kosovo
Sunday, rolling into Pristina on the heels of a new wave of
violence in the strife-torn province.
	   Three Serb policemen died and three others were badly wounded by
a grenade at a police outpost in the town of Orlate, 30 kilometers
(20 miles) southwest of Pristina, where police have long complained
of frequent attacks by ethnic Albanians. An AP reporter verified
the Orlate clash. The Serb-run Kosovo Media Center in Pristina
reported a dozen other attacks around the province.
	   Serb officials blamed the stepped up violence on the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, loosely organized bands of
guerrillas still operating in wide areas of this poor southern
province of Serbia, the dominant republic in the shrunken Yugoslav
federation.
	   ``These latest attacks show that the Albanian terrorists are
trying by all possible means to prevent the realization of the ...
agreement,'' said Veljko Odalovic, the head of Kosovo's regional
government, referring to the deal struck by President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Hydajet Hyseni, spokesman for the United Democratic Movement,
which is openly supportive of the KLA, accused the police of
attacking the ``innocent Albanian population,'' and said the KLA
were shooting back in self-defense.
	   ``There is no real withdrawal of Serb armed forces from Kosovo,
let alone demilitarization of Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Odalovic, however, said there was no doubt the Albanians were
responsible.
	   ``This confirms what the international community has never
wanted to admit, that these bands of terrorists are not in favor of
a peaceful solution to the problem and are trying to take advantage
of the withdrawal of police and military forces from Kosovo.''
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the KLA. An estimated
300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been driven from
their homes. Many of them have been afraid to return because of the
continuing presence of Serb police, though there has been a trickle
of returnees in a number of villages.
	   The United States and NATO have reported significant pullbacks
by Yugoslav forces in recent days but say numbers still exceed the
level required by the Belgrade agreement. NATO plans for air
attacks on Yugoslavia remained on hold as the North Atlantic
Council, NATO's top policymaking body, extended the deadline for
compliance from last Saturday to Oct. 27 and its spy planes
continued to scan the region.
	   As the violence escalated in this poor province of two million
people, 90 percent of whom are ethnic Albanian, an advance team
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
arrived in the provincial capital. The OSCE has been charged with
the responsibility of verifying that Milosevic sticks to the
promises he made in the agreement with Holbrooke.
	   Principal among the demands is that he draw down troops and
police to pre-February 1998 levels, the period when the current
conflict began. So far, nobody has specified exactly what those
levels are.
	   ``We will bring as many people in as quickly as possible, as the
infrastructure permits,'' said John Sandrock, an American who heads
the Vienna-based OSCE's mission support section. ``I don't want to
give you any numbers, or any deadlines or any times, but we will
respond to this issue as quickly as we can.''
	   Asked if he thought his current mission would have an effect on
the rising number of attacks, he said: ``We hope that the overall
presence of the OSCE can act in a stabilizing fashion and hopefully
we'll resolve many of the issues. Ours is a technical mission. We
are kind of an advance guard to try and assess where we will go
from here.''
	   He said the OSCE mission had a one-year mandate, which could be
extended.
	   In Belgrade, the Serbian government prepared to exert full
control over all media with a new law expected to restrict the work
of the independent press. The law, government critics said, paves
the way for shutting down media that don't toe the government line.
	   The Serbian parliament is to meet Tuesday to pass the law, which
follows a a government decree last week imposing censorship and
shutting down three independent newspapers and a radio station.
	   ``I think this law will be more restrictive than any previous
one and probably the worst media law in Serbia ever,'' said
Aleksandar Tijanic, a former information minister and a columnist
in the banned Dnevni Telegraf.

German Jewish leader accuses lawyer of misusing Holocaust victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The leader of Germany's Jewish
community accused a U.S. attorney of hindering talks aimed at
securing compensation for Holocaust victims from German companies.
	   Ignatz Bubis, president of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, said in Monday's Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper that
lawyer Ed Fagan was using Nazi victims for his own financial gain.
	   ``Fagan doesn't want anything more than to earn a lot of
money,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
	   Fagan has been the lead attorney in several lawsuits filed in
New York on behalf of Holocaust victims. He is seeking compensation
from German banks that handled assets of Holocaust victims, as well
as companies that used slave labor during World War II.
	   Bubis said he believed ``the companies would quickly reach an
agreement with the World Jewish Congress'' if they weren't facing
legal action from Fagan and other attorneys.
	   An advance copy of the interview was released Sunday.
	   Fagan did not immediately return a message left at his New York
office Sunday.
	   Last week, Bubis charged Fagan also wanted a dlrs 250 million
fee from the World Jewish Restitution Organization, which recently
came to a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement with Swiss banks for
compensation to Holocaust survivors and heirs.
	   Fagan, who initiated the action against Swiss banks two years
ago, has denied asking for a 20 percent commission.
	   He said in August he had not yet asked for any fee in the case
but would petition the court for payment as is standard in
class-action lawsuits.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A pipeline explosion spilled oil on a
rural hamlet early Sunday and fire raced through the village,
killing at least 13 people and leaving 66 injured, authorities
said. Police said leftist rebels were suspected in the blast.
	   ``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And no one
knows exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert
Valencia in Segovia, the largest town near Machuca, where the
deaths occurred. ``People were asleep at the time and the fire
spread quickly.''

Iranian villagers offer reward for killing Rushdie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Residents of a village in northern Iran have
offered land and carpets to anyone who kills British author Salman
Rushdie, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The people of Kiapey will give 10 carpets, 4,500 sq. meters
(5,400 sq. yards) of agricultural land and a house with a 1500 sq.
meter (1,800 sq. yard) garden in their Caspian Sea coastal village
to Rushdie's assassin, the Farsi-language paper Kayhan said.
	   The move follows the Iranian government's distancing itself last
month from bounties offered for the death of Rushdie and a strong
reaction by hard-liners who support the killing of the Booker
Prize-winning author.
	   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual
leader of the Islamic republic, condemned Rushdie to death in 1989,
ruling that his book, ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
	   The villagers have also invited the parents of Mustapha Mazeh,
who blew himself up while working on a home-made bomb in a London
hotel in 1989, to live in Kiapey, which has a population of 2,000
and is near Sari, the capital of Mazandaran province.
	   Iranians believe Mazeh, a French citizen of Moroccan origin,
intended to kill Rushdie, but British police have dismissed this
theory.
	   Last week, a semi-government foundation in Iran raised the
bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million.
And hard-liners staged two demonstrations in Tehran in support of
the death sentence.
	   The government said last month it did not support the bounty
and, after a meeting between their foreign ministers in New York on
Sept. 24, Britain and Iran decided to upgrade their relations to
ambassadorial level.

Italian hopeful appeals to respected minister to stay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Anxious for broad support, Massimo D'Alema, a former
Communist who is trying to put together Italy's next government,
appealed Sunday to a miffed and highly respected minister to keep
his post.
	   Italian newspapers reported that Carlo Ciampi, the treasury and
budget minister who helped oversee Italy's acceptance into European
Monetary Union, was threatening not to join any government which
D'Alema might assemble.
	   Ciampi was said to be offended by criticism from centrist leader
Francesco Cossiga, a former premier whose followers can give
D'Alema the votes he needs for a majority in the Chamber of
Deputies.
	   Ciampi's role is crucial because the new government's first and
most important task will be passage of the 1999 budget.
	   Communist complaints that the budget didn't contain enough funds
for job creation sparked the crisis which led to Romano Prodi's
resignation as premier on Oct. 9.
	   Ciampi was a key component of Prodi's center-left coalition,
which, at 2 1-2 years, lasted longer than all but one government in
Italy since World War II.
	   D'Alema, who is due to report back Monday evening to President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on whether he has enough backing for a
majority, tried to smoothe over ruffled feelings.
	   ``Should conditions be ripe for me to lead a government, a
fundamental condition for me to form one would be the
participation'' of Ciampi, D'Alema said.
	   Ciampi, who made his career at the central bank, is considered
above partisan politics.
	   D'Alema described him as a someone ``whom the government and the
country can't do without, especially in the difficult and decisive
phase'' for the European single currency.
	   Cossiga on Sunday, saying he didn't mean to offend Ciampi,
offered to apologize.
	   In an interview last week, Cossiga was quoted as describing
Ciampi as a pawn of Fiat, Italy's largest industrial group.

Colombian militias execute 11 peasants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Paramilitary gunmen executed at least 11
peasants this week after tying up the victims and accusing them of
belonging to leftist guerrilla groups, Colombia's Defense Minister
has confirmed.
	   A force of about 200 heavily armed men reportedly carried out
the massacre Wednesday in San Pedro, a small town in the Sierra
Nevada mountains about 320 miles (510 kilometers) north of Bogota.
	   The killings took place after militia members sealed off roads
leading in and out of town, the army reported.
	   Human rights monitors charge the government has done little to
rein in the paramilitary groups, who have committed massacres and
who are supported by elements within the Colombian army.
	   Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda on Friday vowed to pursue the
killers with ``all the force of the state.''

Davenport successfully defends European Championships title

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ New world No.1 Lindsay Davenport won
the battle of the women's big guns on Sunday, successfully
defending her crown from second-seed Venus Williams in the
all-American final of the dlrs 1 million European Championships.
	   Combining experience with physical force, Davenport overcame her
younger compatriot 7-5, 6-3 in 73 minutes, becoming the first
women's player to capture six titles this year.
	   ``Definitely when I became No.1 there was more pressure and
incentive to win the tournament,'' said Davenport, who last week
brought to an end Martina Hingis's 80 week stay at the top of the
rankings. ``People are saying `she's No.1 but does she deserve it?'
and you always get that talk.
	   ``I'm not uncomfortable with the ranking but once you get to
No.1 it's nice to win and be able to play as well as during the
chase to one.''
	   The two women traded breaks in the opening set to go 2-2.
	   At 5-5 it appeared the set was headed for a tiebreak until,
leading 40-30, Williams gave up the next seven points to give
Davenport the break and the set.
	   The next set opened with a shining display of the players'
physical power, neither able to score a point on the other's
service for the first three games.
	   But at 2-2, Davenport finally prevailed, breaking Williams then
holding for a decisive 4-2 lead. Davenport then broke the younger
American again at 3-5 and 15-40, when Williams ended her own
campaign with a smashing forehand into the net.
	   ``I'm not too disappointed,'' said Williams, 18, who served a
record-breaking 205 km/hour (127.4 miles/hour) ace on Friday.
``Lindsay played better today and there's going to be days when
people play better. I just had a tough day.
	   ``She playing well, improving her game,'' reasoned Williams, who
won her third career singles title at the Grand Slam Cup in Munich
two weeks ago. ``Right now I'm in the beginning stages and
obviously Lindsay is a strong player. I've just been on the Tour
for 1 1/2 years and I'm trying to make my improvements, too.''
	   The win extends Davenport's five year winning streak in
Switzerland to 17 victories. The American has not dropped a set for
the past two years at the Zurich tournament, which was renamed
Swisscom Challenge mid-way through the event.
	   The 22-year-old American's run began at the 1993 European Open
in Lucerne when she won her first career title at the age of 16.
Davenport went on the successfully defend that title in 1994,
before winning here in Zurich last year.
	   ``You can never explain why you play well in certain places, but
definitely the last two years I've played great tennis here,'' said
Davenport. ``I won my first tournament ever here in Switzerland and
now my first tournament as the No.1 player in the world, so it will
always have great meaning for me to play here.''
	   Davenport will remain atop the world rankings another week,
while Williams maintains her place at number five.
	   The race for the end-of-year No. 1 ranking is still very much
on, with Davenport holding a 396 point lead over Hingis, and the
two scheduled to play in Philadelphia and the Chase Championships
before the year's end.
	   Davenport has withdrawn from next week's tournament in Moscow
with an arm injury.
	   ``I've been struggling for months with an arm problem,'' said
Davenport. ``Nothing major but my arm has been sore now for awhile
it's been a long summer, with a lot of tournaments.
	   ``I just didn't feel mentally and physically up to playing
Moscow.''

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Mark O'Meara, rallying from as
many as four holes down _ and three after 18 _ defeated his friend
Tiger Woods 1-up Sunday in the 36-hole final of the World Match
Play Championship to pick up 170,000 pounds (dlrs 290,000).
	   It was a dramatic finish to a perfect final as O'Meara dropped a
15-foot (5 meter) putt on the 36th hole from just off the fringe to
make birdie. Woods, awaiting his 10-foot (3 meters) for birdie
rushed over to hug his friend.
	   It was the first all-U.S. final since 1975 when Hale Irwin beat
Al Geiberger and only the fourth in the tournament's 34-year
history.
	   Close friends, and a closer match. On a perfect fall day, the
two players linked all season as golf's No. 1 story showed why.
They lagged treacherous long putts to a few inches _ dropped a few
en route _ and rapped long and medium irons just as close.

	   Davenport has withdrawn from next week's tournament in Moscow
with an arm injury.
	   ``I've been struggling for months with an arm problem,'' said
Davenport. ``Nothing major but my arm has been sore now for awhile
it's been a long summer, with a lot of tournaments.
	   ``I just didn't feel mentally and physically up to playing
Moscow.''

	   Valencia told The Associated Press by telephone that the
explosion occurred at 2:45 a.m. in the village 300 kilometers (180
miles) north of Bogota. He said many of the victims, rushed to at
least four area hospitals, had 3rd-degree burns.
	   Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said at least 13 people were
killed and 66 injured and that leftist rebels, who frequently
sabotage Colombia's oil pipelines, were suspected.
	   ``The people in the area say it was the ELN,'' said Valencia,
referring to the National Liberation Army, which operates in the
area and is blamed for most oil pipeline attacks.

	   Woods was three holes up after the first 18 _ putting better and
taking advantage of O'Meara's cold putter. He raced off to a
four-hole lead after just six with four birdies that included a
35-footer (12 meters).
	   That didn't last long.
	   O'Meara birdied four of the first seven holes on the second 18 _
coupled with Woods' first bogey of the day _ to take a one-hole
lead after 25.
	   Three times he chipped to within a foot (30 cm) of the pin in
that stretch _ two for birdies and one to save par. On another, he
hit a 9-iron to five feet (1.3 meters) for a birdie and also
dropped an 11-footer (3 meters) for another.
	   But Woods fought back, rifling a 6-iron to a foot (30 cm) for a
birdie on 27 to square and then dropped an eight-foot (2.5 meters)
putt for a birdie on 28 to lead by one again.
	   Not to be outdone, O'Meara won the 30th with an eagle, knocking
a 2-iron to two feet (70 cm) to square.
	   At the 32nd, O'Meara moved on top again, dropping a 10-foot (3
meter) birdie putt as Woods missed his attempt from six feet (two
meters).
	   But Woods won the next hole to square when O'Meara drove into
the trees, took a penalty and took bogey and Woods birdied.
	   The 34th was pivotal as O'Meara took a one-hole a lead _ a hole
Woods should have won. O'Meara drove just a few feet from the woods
and then found a greenside bunker with a half-swing escape shot.
	   But he chipped out to 10 feet (3 meters) and dropped the putt to
save par. Woods, in his first putting lapse all day, three-putted
for bogey from six feet (two meters).
	   Woods made a critical 10-footer (3 meters) on the 35th for a
birdie, staving off O'Meara as he tapped in from two feet (70 cm)
for his birdie.

Iranian villagers offer reward for killing Rushdie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Residents of a village in northern Iran have
offered land and carpets to anyone who kills British author Salman
Rushdie, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The people of Kiapey will give 10 carpets, 4,500 square meters
(5,400 square yards) of agricultural land and a house with a
1,500-square-meter (1,800-square-yard) garden in their Caspian Sea
coastal village to Rushdie's assassin, the Farsi-language paper
Kayhan said.
	   The move follows the Iranian government's distancing itself last
month from bounties offered for the death of Rushdie and a strong
reaction by hard-liners who support the killing of the Booker
Prize-winning author.
	   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual
leader of the Islamic republic, condemned Rushdie to death in 1989,
ruling that his book, ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
	   The villagers have also invited the parents of Mustapha Mazeh,
who blew himself up while working on a homemade bomb in a London
hotel in 1989, to live in Kiapey, which has a population of 2,000
and is near Sari, the capital of Mazandaran province.
	   Iranians believe Mazeh, a French citizen of Moroccan origin,
intended to kill Rushdie, but British police have dismissed this
theory.
	   Last week, a semi-government foundation in Iran raised the
bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million.
And hard-liners staged two demonstrations in Tehran in support of
the death sentence.
	   The government said last month it did not support the bounty
and, after a meeting between their foreign ministers in New York on
Sept. 24, Britain and Iran decided to upgrade their relations to
ambassadorial level.

Britain dismisses Chile protests at arrest of Pinochet

	   LONDON (AP) _ Dismissing Chile's protest over the arrest in
London of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a Cabinet minister said Sunday
most Britons would find it ``gut-wrenching'' to give diplomatic
immunity to the Chilean former dictator.
	   Chanting demonstrators, delighted at the move, gathered outside
the private clinic in London where the 82-year-old Pinochet is
presumed still to be a patient. He has been under police guard
since his arrest Friday _ in response to a Spanish extradition
request _ for questioning about allegations of murder in the first
decade after he seized power in 1973.
	   Pinochet has been a regular visitor to Britain, generally
without publicity. His arrest this time appeared partly to reflect
a tougher attitude toward right-wing dictators by Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Labor Party government which replaced a Conservative
Party administration 18 months ago.
	   ``The idea that such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be
claiming diplomatic immunity I think for most people in this
country would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff,'' Trade Secretary
Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television
interview.
	   However, Michael Howard, a Conservative Party spokesman and
former Cabinet minister, said he was concerned that Pinochet was
arrested because of pressure from Labor lawmakers and lobby groups.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro, attending a meeting in Oporto,
Portugal, described the arrest as ``universal meddling.''
	   In London, police mounted guard outside a hospital called the
London Clinic. Pinochet's spokesman in Chile, Fernando Martinez,
said Pinochet was in hospital when police came to arrest him. He
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a spinal disorder.
	   ``Gen. Pinochet has committed crimes humanity _ many atrocities,
torture, murder,'' Vincete Allegria, an exile who fled Pinochet's
regime, told reporters outside the clinic.
	   Under extradition laws, Spain has 40 days from last Friday to
lodge a formal request for extradition. The final decision lies
with Home Secretary Jack Straw.
	   There was no immediate word on when Pinochet would be
questioned. But police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said questioning was not expected for a week or two.
	   Relations between Britain and Chile immediately soured, with
Chile maintaining that Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic
immunity.
	   Home Office Minister Alun Michael acknowledged Sunday that
Pinochet had entered Britain on a diplomatic passport, but added,
``That does no necessarily convey diplomatic immunity.''
	   ``He would have provided evidence of coming for medical
treatment, and there's no reason for the immigration authorities to
stop him at that stage,'' Michael said in a BBC radio interview.
	   The Foreign Office said only visiting government officials and
accredited diplomats have diplomatic immunity.
	   Pinochet, who ruled for 17 years, has been widely accused of
running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances and deaths of
political opponents.
	   His arrest was prompted by applications last week to question
him by two Spanish judges investigating human rights violations.
One of them, Baltasar Garzon, also wants to question Pinochet about
the disappearances of Chilean dissidents in Argentina.
	   The arrest warrant, however, referred only to questioning about
allegations that he murdered Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and
1983.
	   In Chile, seven Spaniards have been identified as missing or
dead under the Pinochet regime, including two Catholic priests and
a U.N. official.
	   According to a Chilean government report, a total of 4,299
political opponents died or disappeared during Pinochet's term.
	   Pinochet, commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March,
has immunity from prosecution in Chile as a senator-for-life, and
also under an amnesty covering crimes committed before 1978 _ when
most of the human rights abuses took place.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A pipeline explosion spilled oil on a
rural hamlet early Sunday and fire raced through the village,
killing at least 13 people and leaving 66 injured, authorities
said. Police said leftist rebels were suspected in the blast.
	   ``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And no one
knows exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert
Valencia in Segovia, the largest town near Machuca, where the
deaths occurred. ``People were asleep at the time and the fire
spread quickly.''
	   Valencia told The Associated Press by telephone that the
explosion occurred at 2:45 a.m. in the village 300 kilometers (180
miles) north of Bogota. He said many of the victims, rushed to at
least four area hospitals, had 3rd-degree burns.
	   Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said at least 13 people were
killed and 66 injured and that leftist rebels, who frequently
sabotage Colombia's oil pipelines, were suspected.
	   ``The people in the area say it was the ELN,'' said Valencia,
referring to the National Liberation Army, which operates in the
area and is blamed for most oil pipeline attacks.
	   The houses of Machuca, a village of about 150 residents, were
largely destroyed, Valencia said.
	   The pipeline, a frequent target of ELN sabotage, transports
100,000 barrels of oil daily. Leaders of the rebel band, Colombia's
second-largest, say they blow up oil pipelines because the
government wrongly allows foreign oil companies to exploit the
country's mineral resources.

O'Meara beats Woods 1-up in 36-hole World Match Play final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Mark O'Meara, rallying from as
many as four holes down _ and three after 18 _ defeated his friend
Tiger Woods 1-up Sunday in the 36-hole final of the World Match
Play Championship to pick up 170,000 pounds (dlrs 290,000).
	   Woods won 90,000 pounds (dlrs 150,000), slightly more than they
usually play for back home as neighbors in Florida.
	   It was a dramatic finish to a perfect final as O'Meara dropped a
15-foot (5 meter) putt on the 36th hole from just off the fringe to
make birdie. Woods, awaiting his 10-foot (3 meter) putt for birdie
rushed over to hug his friend.
	   It was the first all-U.S. final since 1975 when Hale Irwin beat
Al Geiberger and only the fourth in the tournament's 34-year
history.
	   Close friends, and a closer match. On a perfect fall day, the
two players linked all season as golf's No. 1 story showed why.
They lagged treacherous long putts to a few inches _ dropped a few
en route _ and rapped long and medium irons just as close.
	   But, as luck would have it, it was Woods' mistake on the 34th
hole that cost him. With a chance to take a one-hole lead, Woods
instead three-putted from six feet (2 meter) for bogey.
	   O'Meara, meanwhile, scrambled to save par. He hit a half-swing
escape shot from the edge of the woods _ into a greenside bunker.
But he chipped out from 10 feet (3 meters) and dropped the putt.
	   Woods was three holes up after the first 18 _ putting better and
taking advantage of O'Meara's cold putter. He raced off to a
four-hole lead after just six with four birdies that included a
35-footer (12 meters).
	   That didn't last long.
	   O'Meara birdied four of the first seven holes on the second 18 _
coupled with Woods' first bogey of the day _ to take a one-hole
lead after 25.
	   Three times he chipped to within a foot (30 cm) of the pin in
that stretch _ two for birdies and one to save par. On another, he
hit a 9-iron to five feet (1.3 meters) for a birdie and also
dropped an 11-footer (3 meters) for another.
	   But Woods fought back, rifling a 6-iron to a foot (30 cm) for a
birdie on 27 to square and then dropped an eight-foot (2.5 meters)
putt for a birdie on 28 to lead by one again.
	   Not to be outdone, O'Meara won the 30th with an eagle, knocking
a 2-iron to two feet (70 cm) to square.
	   At the 32nd, O'Meara moved on top again, dropping a 10-foot (3
meter) birdie putt as Woods missed his attempt from six feet (two
meters).
	   But Woods won the next hole to square when O'Meara drove into
the trees, took a penalty and took bogey and Woods birdied.
	   The 34th was pivotal as O'Meara took a one-hole a lead _ a hole
Woods should have won. O'Meara drove just a few feet from the woods
and then found a greenside bunker with a half-swing escape shot.
	   But he chipped out to 10 feet (3 meters) and dropped the putt to
save par. Woods, in his first putting lapse all day, three-putted
for bogey from six feet (two meters).
	   Woods made a critical 10-footer (3 meters) on the 35th for a
birdie, staving off O'Meara as he tapped in from two feet (70 cm)
for his birdie.

Juventus, Milan waste chances to move into first place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian League's little clubs roughed up
established ones Sunday as Juventus of Turin and AC Milan both
wasted chances to move into a tie for first place.
	   Tiziano De Patre's goal from close range in the 19th minute gave
Cagliari a 1-0 upset of Milan, which saw German striker Oliver
Bierhoff miss a penalty kick in the 43rd.
	   Two-time defending champion Juventus of Turin was also outplayed
by an unheralded club and settled for a 1-1 draw against Vicenza,
while Udinese allowed Bari to pull into a 1-1 tie on a goal in
injury time.
	   Nine-man AS Roma's stunning 2-1 comeback victory Saturday over
league leader Fiorentina, on goals by Dmitri Alenichev and
Francesco Totti in the final five minutes, had provided an opening
for the other clubs.
	   Instead, Fiorentina still sits alone atop the Serie A standings
with 12 points, two ahead of Roma, Juventus and Internazionale of
Milan. AC Parma and Milan are next with nine points and Udinese has
eight.
	   In other games Sunday, 39-year-old defender Pietro Verichowod
scored as Piacenza beat Sampdoria of Genoa 4-1, while Perugia
notched a 1-0 win over Venezia, which still has yet to score a goal
this season.
	   On Saturday, AC Parma tripled its season scoring output by
beating winless Salernitana 2-0 on goals nine minutes apart by
Italian internationals Enrico Chiesa and Diego Fuser, and Empoli
drew with Bologna 0-0.

Swedes triumph in Perrier Pairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Jarmo Sandelin and Olle Karlsson both
birdied the last hole to seal a comfortable three-shot victory
Sunday in the dlrs 595,000 Perrier Pairs tournament.
	   Karlsson shot a final-round, five-under-par 66 and Sandelin
fired 70 for a Sunday aggregate of 136 and an overall total of 329
(-20).
	   The Swedish duo shared the dlrs 120,000 winners' check.
	   ``It's always great to finish like that,'' Sandelin said.
	   Sandelin hit an eight-iron to 6 meters (25 feet) and Karlsson
hugged the flag with his eight-iron, his ball finishing 18 inches
(45 centimeters) from the hole.
	   Karlsson who was ninth reserve only learned he was playing five
days before the tournament.
	   ``It was the first time we played together but everything
clicked this week,'' Sandelin said.
	   England's Derrick Cooper, (67 Sunday) and Richard Boxall (66),
finished in second place three shots back at 332.
	   Cooper and Boxall and shared dlrs 85,000.
	   Severiano Ballesteros leaned heavily on partner and
fellow-countryman Miguel Angel Jimenez on Sunday to move into third
slot two further shots back at 334.
	   Jimenez fired 65 and Ballesteros carded 69 over the rain-slowed,
6,316-meter, (6,909-yard), Medoc golf course, to total 334 overall
and pick up dlrs 30,000.
	   ``Miguel played so well today,'' Ballesteros said. ``But we had
no luck on the greens coming in.''
	   Ballesteros missed three putts inside 3.5 meter (12 feet) on
each of the last three greens.
	   The French pairing of Jeff Remesy and Raphael Jacquelin took
forth place at 335 (-20) and collected dlrs 21,000.

Indian spinner dropped for suspect bowling action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian selectors on Sunday dropped young
off-spinner Harbhajan Singh from the Indian cricket team following
complaints about his bowling action, United News of India news
agency said.
	   The selectors acted in response to a letter from the
International Cricket Council, a London-based body that governs
international cricket, questioning Singh's bowling action. Details
were not immediately available.
	   The ICC received complaints from two international match
referees who had watched Singh bowling in international matches in
India recently, said Jaywant Lele, the secretary of the Board of
Control for Cricket in India.
	   Singh is the second Indian spinner whose bowling action has been
found suspect in the recent past. Sri Lanka's off-spinner M.
Muralitharan had also faced similar problems.
	   Muralitharan and India's Rajesh Chauhan were cleared after a
panel of top spinners helped them correct their bowling actions.
	   The selectors retained Mohammed Azharudinn as India's captain
for the nine-nation cricket tournament beginning later this month
in the Bangladesh capital.
	   Indian team: Mohammed Azharuddin (captain), Ajay Jadeja
(vice-captain), Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid,
Robin Singh, Nayan Mongia (wicket-keeper), Javagal Srinath, Anil
Kumble, Ajit Agarkar, Sunil Joshi, Venkatesh Prasadm V.V.S. Laxman
and Nikhil Chopra.

Sampras beats Kucera to win Vienna tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-seed Pete Sampras on Sunday clearly
outplayed fifth-seeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1
to win the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP tennis tournament.
	   The world's No. 1 player took 2:04 hours to win his fourth
tournament victory this year _ the 56th in his career. The
American, who was Grand Slam winner eleven times, took a check of
drls 125,400 in prize money and, more importantly, 361 important
ATP points.
	   ``It's a great feeling every time you get through a week like
this,'' an elated Sampras commented his near-flawless performance
in Vienna.
	   ``The field was very strong here, and it's amazing how things
can turn around so quickly in life,'' he said, referring to his
first-round loss in Basel, Switzerland, last week.
	   ``I enjoyed playing here.'' Sampras said. ``There was a very
good crowd every day, and the people support very much the event.
They are very knowledgeable, and it's almost like you feel their
energy.''
	   Sampras, who has reached his best form again, dominated play
from the start. The winner had no trouble breaking Kucera at 3-1
with fabulous returns and serve out after 31 minutes.
	   He again excelled in the second set to begin with, stunning his
opponent and the crowd with his powerful serve and breaking for
1-0. But then Sampras faded somewhat, and Kucera made valuable
points. The Slovak challenger broke the American for 4-4 and forced
a tiebreak.
	   But that was about as much as Kucera could do, and Sampras won
the tiebreak 7-3.
	   ``The huge key was the second set that decided the match,'' the
winner confirmed. ``I knew it would be hard for him to come back
after being two sets to love down.''
	   Many of the 6,591 people watching Sampras wondered how might be
the one to beat him if the American keeps hi  Sampras landed aces on his second serve and in the third set
crushed the Slovak, who is now the world's 7th best player.
	   Kucera won applause from the crowd for some of his serves,
including six aces, and surprised the favorite with some beautiful
precision backhand strokes.
	   With his triumph at Vienna Sampras made a big stride toward his
goal: to become the first player to finish the season as the
world's top player for sixth consecutive time.
	   ``I played Pete four times now, and he played his best match
against me today,'' the Slovak commented, paying tribute to the
winner's top-notch performance.
	   ``I should have served a little better,'' he said, but added ``I
am happy to be in the top ten, and I am enjoying it, and I hope I
will stay as long as possible.''
	   Kucera consoldiated his position on the road to Hanover for the
ATP World Championship.
	   Sampras is playing three more consecutive events in Europe: at
Lyon, Stuttgart and Paris.

	   At Cagliari, after De Patre gave the hosts (2-1-2) the lead,
Milan coach Alberto Zaccheroni's unusual strategy kept Milan
(3-0-2) in the game. When German 'keeper Jens Lehmann fouled
Cagliari striker Roberto Muzzi in the penalty area in the 28th
minute, Zaccheroni replaced Lehmann with substitute Sebastiano
Rossi immediately. Rossi saved Muzzi's ensuing shot from the
penalty spot.
	   But Bierhoff, who led Serie A with 27 goals for Udinese last
season, had his chance to tie the game saved by Cagliari 'keeper
Alessio Scarpi.
 &UR; Vicenza 1, Juventus 1 &QC; 
	   At Vicenza, winger Lamberto Zauli scored off a rebound in the
40th minute for Vicenza (1-2-2), and Juventus (3-1-1) equalized on
star striker Alessandro Del Piero's first goal of the season, in
first-half injury time. Del Piero had both goals in Italy's 2-0
Euro 2000 qualifier win over Switzerland last weekend and appears
to be out of his six-month slump. Juve's chances for a win dimmed
in the 69th minute, when defender Alessandro Birindelli was
expelled.
 &UR; Bari 1, Udinese 1 &QC; 
	   At Bari, substitute Gionathan Spinosi headed in Mauro Bressan's
cross in the fourth minute of extra time to stun Udinese (2-2-1).
Alessandro Pierini had put the visitors up 1-0 in the 68th minute.
Bari is 1-3-1.
 &UR; Piacenza 4, Sampdoria 1 &QC; 
	   At Piacenza, Vierchowod scored against the team he spent 12
years with to give the hosts (2-1-2) the lead after three minutes,
but Sampdoria (1-2-2) leveled on Argentine striker Ariel Ortega's
penalty kick in the 28th. Piacenza then tallied three unanswered
goals.
 &UR; Perugia 1, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, midfielder Renato Olive sent a header under the
crossbar in the 43rd minute for Perugia (1-2-2). Venezia is 0-1-4.
 &UR; Saturday's action &QC; 
 &UR; Roma 2, Fiorentina 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Fiorentina led 1-0 from the 31st minute on Argentine
star Gabriel Batistuta's league-high sixth goal of the season, and
looked set to pocket another win after Roma had midfielder Luigi Di
Biagio and French defender Vincent Candela sent off in separate
incidents in the second half.
	   But Argentine substitute Gustavo Bartelt found Alenichev open
just steps away from the net and the Russian turned the ball home
for his first goal of the league season to make it 1-1. Bartelt
then helped create the opening for Totti to win the entertaining
match, firing a deflected shot that allowed the 22-year-old Italian
to send the ball into the net.
 &UR; Parma 2, Salernitana 0 &QC; 
	   At Parma, Enrico Chiesa scored in the 72nd minute and assisted
on midfielder Diego Fuser's goal nine minutes later for the hosts
(2-3-0) nine minutes later. Salernitana dropped to 0-1-4.
 &UR; Empoli 0, Bologna 0 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, Bologna twice sent shots off the woodwork. Both clubs
are 0-3-2.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Vandals looted a prehistoric cave Sunday that was
discovered by road workers late last week, making off with a skull,
an axe and pottery believed to be at least 4,000 years old.
	   The thieves penetrated the cave, which had been left unguarded,
through a hole in the side that had been blocked by a large rock,
police said.
	   Local archeologists called the cave an ``exceptional discovery''
after it was discovered Friday by two workers building the new A75
highway in the Languedoc region of southern France.
	   Four human skeletons, three adults and a child who was believed
to be a little girl, were preserved in the cave, as well as cooking
pots, an axe and a vase.
	   Archeologist Christian Olive said he believed was a burial site
that could date back to 2,000 B.C.
	   The area immediately was sealed off and work stopped on that
part of the new highway. But the cave was not guarded.
	   France's most famous prehistoric is Lascaux in the Dordogne
region, where magnificent paintings of animals have been preserved.

Azerbaijan inaugurates re-elected president

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijan's President Geidar Aliev was
inaugurated Sunday, a week after winning re-election in a vote
boycotted by the opposition and called undemocratic by foreign
observers.
	   Aliev, a leader in this oil-rich former Soviet republic for much
of the past three decades, said he was ready for a ``constructive
dialogue'' with the opposition.
	   The existence of opposition ``is an important attribute of
democracy,'' Aliev said in his inauguration speech. He took his
oath on the Azerbaijani constitution and the Koran, the Islamic
holy book.
	   He promised to devote more attention to social policies, and
continue to pursue economic growth.
	   Aliev has overseen the development of Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea
oil fields, but chronic corruption and sagging world oil prices
have meant that the country has yet to enjoy the economic windfall
Aliev has been predicting for years.
	   He reiterated his commitment to peace talks on Nagorno-Karabakh,
an Armenian-controlled enclave within Azerbaijan over which the two
countries fought a war.
	   Azerbaijan's opposition refused to take part in the Oct. 11
election to protest Aliev's control of the Central Electoral
Commission and the media and his crackdown on opposition rallies.
	   U.S. and European election monitors said ballot boxes were
stuffed and Azerbaijani observers were intimidated during the
elections.
	   Aliev, 76, was Azerbaijan's KGB chief and then Communist Party
boss during the Soviet era and retook power in a bloodless 1993
coup.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent his congratulations via his
foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, who attended the inauguration.

Macedonians decide whether to opt for change at elections

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Voters in Macedonia were deciding
Sunday whether to confirm in office the politicians who lead them
out of former Yugoslavia peacefully or opt for a change promised by
a team of younger politicians.
	   Thirty-eight parties, including the ruling coalition of the
Social Democratic Alliance and their allies, all have promised a
better future, concentrating their election campaigns on
Macedonia's growing economic woes.
	   Only minor irregularities were reported at the polls by Sunday
afternoon. Election officials said some 18 percent of Macedonia's
1,5 million voters turned up at the polling stations by 2 p.m.
local time (noon GMT).
	   The multitude of parties in the third parliamentary elections
since Macedonia abandoned its Communist single-party system in 1990
could mean that none would win an outright majority in the 120-seat
assembly.
	   Favorites of the pro-reform voters were an opposition coalition
who have challenged the ruling coalition led by renamed Communists,
in power since Macedonia gained independence in 1992.
	   ``I vote for changes and I hope all people in Macedonia will
vote for changes,'' declared Ljupco Georgievski, one of the
opposition leaders.
	   His partner, Vasil Tupurkovski, cast his ballot at one minute
before noon to symbolize that time is running out to lead out
Macedonia from the economic crisis.
	   Macedonia was the poorest of all six republics in the former
Yugoslav federation, and its economy remains feeble with about 30
percent unemployment and a dlrs 210 monthly average salary.
	   Situated in the neighborhood of the volatile Kosovo province,
with unsolved disputes with all of its neighbors, and a restive
ethnic Albanian minority, Macedonia is a key country for stability
in the Balkans.
	   U.N. peacekeepers and the ruling alliance led by former
Communists turned pragmatists _ notably Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski and President Kiro Gligorov _ are credited with keeping
the country out of the trouble that engulfed much of former
Yugoslavia.
	   Upon casting his ballot Sunday, Crvenkovski said he hoped the
future government ``will be able to preserve peace and stability.''
	   During the election campaign, Tupurkovski drafted an economic
program which, he said, would attract dlrs one billion of foreign
investment. He said Macedonia must rely on agriculture and small,
family-run businesses contrary to old-time Communist-era
enterprises.
	   Tupurkovski, 47, was one of the youngest and most popular
politicians in former Communist-run Yugoslavia for his reformist
stands and casual style.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 440,000 of Macedonia's 2 million
population, were expected to increase their representation in the
assembly. Their desire for self-rule has given rise to concern
because of similar aims of the Albanian minority in rump
Yugoslavia.
	   Gligorov said he hoped the elections will result in a
``continuation of Macedonia's democratic traditions.''

the National Weather Service.
	   A very weak tropical wave will progress westward across the
Caribbean waters south of our area this afternoon.

the coastal waters overnight.
	   For this afternoon, most of the showers and thunderstorms will
be focused over northern inland sections and the northwest quarter
of Puerto Rico.
	   The increased wind flow out of the east to southeast will create

Mormon missionary stabbed to death in Russia, suspect arrested

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police arrested a suspect in a stabbing attack on
two Mormon church missionaries in central Russia that left one dead
and the other hospitalized, police said Sunday.
	   A group of assailants stabbed to death Jose Manuel Mackintosh,
20, and wounded Bradley Alan Borden, 20, after the pair left the
home of a Mormon family in Ufa, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
east of Moscow, according to a press release issued by the church
in the United States.
	   Both missionaries are from the United States.
	   Borden, who was stabbed in the liver and stomach, was in
critical but stable condition in an Ufa hospital, Donald Jarvis,
head of the Mormon mission for the region, said Sunday. Mackintosh
was stabbed in the heart.
	   Police would not release any information about the arrested man,
but said they were continuing to look for the other assailants.
Witnesses said the man who killed Mackintosh was drunk at the time,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Investigators believe the stabbing was an indiscriminate attack
and was not directed toward the Mormon church, said Rais Galin,
police spokesman for the district that includes Ufa.
	   Jarvis said he was convinced there were no religious or
political motives for the attack, and thanked police and doctors
for their ``friendly attitude'' in handling the case.
	   L. Aldin Porter, an official with The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints in Utah, said, ``We understand that this tragedy
was a random act of violence and that there was no premeditation.
Our representatives in Russia will cooperate fully with local
authorities in their investigation.''
	   Porter said the church has no plans to pull missionaries from
Russia, though missionaries may be asked to stay in their
apartments and venture out only in groups of four.
	   Mackintosh, from Hiko, Nevada, had been a missionary in Russia
for just over a year. Borden, of Mesa, Arizona, arrived in January.
	   The young missionaries, dressed in white shirts and dark ties,
work in pairs and are easy targets for harassment. In March, two
Mormon missionaries were held hostage for four days in southern
Russia before being released unharmed.
	   ``It's a tragedy and my heart goes out to their families,'' U.S.
Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah and a Mormon himself,
told The Salt Lake Tribune. ``We've done a lot to make sure that
Russia accepts our people.''
	   There are about 500 Mormon missionaries in Russia, among 57,000
mostly young men the church has deployed around the globe.

Sampras beats Kucera to win Vienna tournament\

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-seed Pete Sampras on Sunday clearly
outplayed fifth-seeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1
to win the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP tennis tournament.
	   The world's No. 1 player took 2:04 hours to win his fourth
tournament victory this year _ the 56th in his career. The
American, who was Grand Slam winner eleven times, took a check of
drls 125,400 in prize money and, more importantly, 361 important
ATP points.
	   ``It's a great feeling every time you get through a week like
this,'' an elated Sampras commented his near-flawless performance
in Vienna.
	   ``The field was very strong here, and it's amazing how things
can turn around so quickly in life,'' he said, referring to his
first-round loss in Basel, Switzerland, last week.
	   ``I enjoyed playing here.'' Sampras said. ``There was a very
good crowd every day, and the people support very much the event.
They are very knowledgeable, and it's almost like you feel their
energy.''
	   Sampras, who has reached his best form again, dominated play
from the start. The winner had no trouble breaking Kucera at 3-1
with fabulous returns and serve out after 31 minutes.
	   He again excelled in the second set to begin with, stunning his
opponent and the crowd with his powerful serve and breaking for
1-0. But then Sampras faded somewhat, and Kucera made valuable
points. The Slovak challenger broke the American for 4-4 and forced
a tiebreak.
	   But that was about as much as Kucera could do, and Sampras won
the tiebreak 7-3.
	   ``The huge key was the second set that decided the match,'' the
winner confirmed. ``I knew it would be hard for him to come back
after being two sets to love down.''
	   Many of the 6,591 people watching Sampras wondered who might be
the one to beat him if the American keeps his current form. And he
knows it.

Actress Joan Hickson dies at 92
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Actress Joan Hickson, best known for her portrayal
of Miss Marple, the shrewd amateur detective created by crime
writer Agatha Christie, has died, her family said Sunday. She was
92.
	   Miss Hickson died Saturday in hospital in Colchester, 55 miles
(90 kms) northeast of London. The cause of death was not announced.
	   Her acting career began in 1927, and her biggest break came when
she was 78 and was cast as Miss Marple in a British Broadcasting
Corp. television series that was shown some 30 countries.
	   Her last acting appearance was in 1992 in a film called
``Century.''
	   After leaving high school, Miss Hickson spent three years at
Britain's premier drama school, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.
Her career included roles in more than 100 films.
	   She was married to Eric Butler, a doctor, who died in 1967. She
is survived by their two children.

Secluded talks could yield partial agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Israel-Mideast Talks &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ A partial West Bank agreement is
likely to emerge from the Mideast summit talks President Bill
Clinton is hosting, but completion of a full accord would probably
take several weeks, diplomatic sources said Sunday.
	   Clinton prepared to return here for a third day of U.S.
mediation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, this time with Vice President Al
Gore at his side.
	   The diplomatic sources told The Associated Press that security
remains the main hurdle to an agreement in which Israel would
exchange territory for tougher security measures by the Palestinian
Authority.
	   It may take the parties a couple of weeks to work out the steps
Arafat is prepared to take to fight Islamic militants, and then
there would probably have to be another three-way meeting convened
by the United States, the diplomatic sources said.
	   James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, reiterated,
however, that ``our goal continues to be to do all the work that
needs to be done by today,'' the unofficial deadline for an
agreement. Clinton reportedly wants a signing ceremony on Monday.
	   He said he had not ``heard any serious discussion about a
multiweek extension.''
	   Rubin also denied an Israeli army radio report that Clinton had
warned the Israelis he would support a Palestinian state if no West
Bank agreement was reached.
	   He said that did not ``resembly any account that I've heard at
the Wye talks and I find it difficult to imagine.''
	   Netanyahu's office also denied any such pressure.
	   ``The reports are baseless and that option was never discussed
in conversations with the prime minister and his delegation at Wye
Plantation,'' Netanyahu's office said in a statement issued in
Jerusalem.
	   The newly appointed, hard-line Israeli foreign minister, Ariel
Sharon, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai arrived at this
resort area on Maryland's Eastern Shore early Sunday morning to
join the talks. Asked by reporters if he was optimistic, Mordechai
said, ``Yes, I am.''
	   Clinton is trying to break a 19-month stalemate, but U.S.
officials have made no claims of progress since the talks began
Thursday.
	   Although a press blackout remains in effect, details about the
talks continued to leak out. Several Israeli press reports painted
a picture of a frustrated Clinton who told both sides categorically
that he intended to push an agreement through.
	   ``I've been working on this deal for 17 months and I'm not
prepared to defer it any longer,'' Clinton was quoted by the
Israeli daily Maariv as having told both Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   Wide gaps still remain on security issues, Israeli media have
reported. The CIA has been helping broker talks between the sides
on security issues, Maariv said.
	   In addition, Israel radio reported that the Palestinians said
Israeli negotiators have refused to take up three issues: the scope
of later West Bank troop withdrawals, the release of Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails, and a commitment to halt house
demolitions and confiscation of Palestinian property.
	   At stake was a long-sought accord that would give the
Palestinians control over more land on which they hope to establish
a state.
	   Arafat has said he would declare a Palestinian state
unilaterally in May 1999, when the interim peace talks between the
sides are set to expire. Netanyahu has threatened unspecified
unilateral steps in response that could include annexing chunks of
the West Bank.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A pipeline explosion spilled oil on a
rural hamlet early Sunday and fire raced through the village,
killing at least 13 people and leaving 66 injured, authorities
said. Police said leftist rebels were suspected in the blast.
	   ``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And no one
knows exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert
Valencia in Segovia, the largest town near Machuca, where the
deaths occurred. ``People were asleep at the time and the fire
spread quickly.''
	   ``There was a huge explosion and afterward a ball of flame
erupted, according to survivors,'' said Gen. Alfredo Salgado,
operations director of the national police.
	   Valencia told The Associated Press by telephone that the
explosion occurred at 2:45 a.m. in the village 300 kilometers (180
miles) north of Bogota, and that many victims _ including at least
two women and a female child_ were trapped by the flames. He said
many of the victims, who were rushed to at least four area
hospitals, had 3rd-degree burns.
	   Among the wounded were 15 women, 15 men and 12 children being
treated in San Juan de Dios hospital in Segovia, Valencia reported.
	   Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said at least 13 people were
killed and 66 injured and that leftist rebels, who frequently
sabotage Colombia's oil pipelines, were suspected.
	   ``The people in the area say it was the ELN,'' said Valencia,
referring to the National Liberation Army, which operates in the
area and is blamed for most oil pipeline attacks.
	   The houses of Machuca, a village of about 150 residents, were
largely destroyed, Valencia said.
	   The damagedd Colombia Central pipeline, a frequent target of ELN
sabotage operated by the state-owned Ecopetrol oil company,
transports 100,000 barrels of crude daily, most of it from the
Cusiana oil field in east-central Colombia to the Covenas terminal
on the Caribbean.
	   Leaders of the rebel band, Colombia's second-largest, say they
blow up oil pipelines because the government wrongly allows foreign
oil companies to exploit the country's mineral resources.
	   Sunday's deaths occurred exactly a week after ELN leaders held
talks in mountains not far from Segovia with representatives of
government and civil society to establish parameters for peace
talks that are to begin in February.
	   In talks with civilian leaders in July, the rebel group said it
would curtail its attacks on pipelines. The ELN has not, however,
denounced the armed struggle or said when it might agree to a
cease-fire.
	   The rebel movement extorts money from companies that operate in
rural areas it controls, and those businesses that refuse to pay
its ``war taxes'' are frequently attacked or have executives
kidnapped.
	   The ELN has no history, however, of intentionally targeting
civilians in dynamiting oil facilities.

O'Meara beats Woods 1-up in 36-hole World Match Play final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS O'Meara, Woods quotes; changes Woods putt on 34th to 10
feet sted 6 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Mark O'Meara, rallying from as
many as four holes down _ and three after 18 _ defeated his friend
Tiger Woods 1-up Sunday in the 36-hole final of the World Match
Play Championship to pick up 170,000 pounds (dlrs 290,000).
	   Woods won 90,000 pounds (dlrs 150,000), slightly more than they
usually play for back home as neighbors in Florida.
	   It was a dramatic finish to a perfect final as O'Meara dropped a
15-foot (5 meter) putt on the 36th hole from just off the fringe to
make birdie. Woods, awaiting his 10-foot (3 meter) putt for birdie
rushed over to hug his friend.
	   ``I relish that putt, to make it when the heats on like that,''
O'Meara said.
	   ``I hit a good putt, it was rolling and died on the back edge.
What a fitting way to win a golf tournament.''
	   It was the first all-U.S. final since 1975 when Hale Irwin beat
Al Geiberger and only the fourth in the tournament's 34-year
history.
	   Close friends, and a closer match. On a perfect fall day, the
two players linked all season as golf's No. 1 story showed why.
They lagged treacherous long putts to a few inches _ dropped a few
en route _ and rapped long and medium irons just as close.
	   But, as luck would have it, it was Woods' mistake on the 34th
hole that cost him. With a chance to take a one-hole lead, Woods
instead three-putted from 10 feet (2.5 meters) for bogey.
	   O'Meara, meanwhile, scrambled to save par. He hit a half-swing
escape shot from the edge of the woods on his second shot _ into a
greenside bunker. But he chipped out from 10 feet (3 meters) and
dropped the putt.
	   ``I hit a bad putt, I pushed it,'' Woods said. ``And I pushed
the second one coming back.''
	   ``But the ebb and flow was tremendous with four or five
shifts,'' Woods added. ``It's a special thing and it can only
happen when you play 36 holes.''
	   Woods was three holes up after the first 18 _ putting better and
taking advantage of O'Meara's cold putter. He raced off to a
four-hole lead after just six with four birdies that included a
35-footer (12 meters).
	   That didn't last long.
	   O'Meara birdied four of the first seven holes on the second 18 _
coupled with Woods' first bogey of the day _ to take a one-hole
lead after 25.
	   Three times he chipped to within a foot (30 cm) of the pin in
that stretch _ two for birdies and one to save par. On another, he
hit a 9-iron to five feet (1.3 meters) for a birdie and also
dropped an 11-footer (3 meters) for another.
	   But Woods fought back, rifling a 6-iron to a foot (30 cm) for a
birdie on 27 to square and then dropped an eight-foot (2.5 meters)
putt for a birdie on 28 to lead by one again.
	   Not to be outdone, O'Meara won the 30th with an eagle, knocking
a 2-iron to two feet (70 cm) _ hitting the flag stick _ to square.
	   At the 32nd, O'Meara moved on top again, dropping a 10-foot (3
meter) birdie putt as Woods missed his attempt from six feet (two
meters).
	   But Woods won the next hole to square when O'Meara drove into
the trees, took a penalty and took bogey and Woods birdied.
	   The 34th was pivotal as O'Meara took a one-hole a lead _ a hole
Woods should have won. O'Meara drove just a few feet from the woods
and then found a greenside bunker with a half-swing escape shot.
	   But he chipped out to 10 feet (3 meters) and dropped the putt to
save par. Woods, in his first putting lapse all day, three-putted
for bogey from six feet (two meters).
	   Woods made a critical 10-footer (3 meters) on the 35th for a
birdie, staving off O'Meara as he tapped in from two feet (70 cm)
for his birdie.

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday
he disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of ``universal meddling.''
	   ``It seems to me that what has happened there (in London) is
universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters covering the
Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday. Castro had just
finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel.
	   He said the case seemed to be ``unprecedented and unusual.''
	   Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by
British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. The
judge is probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile
under his rule in the 1970s and 80s.
	   The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's arrest,
insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic
passport and had immunity from arrest.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, also attending an
Ibero-American summit here, said the ``task of government is to
comply with the law and cooperate with the judiciary.''
	   Aznar said he hoped the case would not alter Spanish and Chilean
relations, which he described as ``excellent, extraordinary.''

75 Kosovo Albanian refugees caught trying to enter Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   REGENSBURG, Germany (AP) _ Three men who tried to smuggle 75
Kosovo Albanian refugees into Germany by packing them into the back
of a truck were ordered jailed Sunday by a judge.
	   The truck was stopped early Saturday near the wooded
German-Czech border, a favored crossing point for people trying to
enter Germany illegally.
	   German authorities have stepped up patrols in recent months to
deal with what they say is a considerably increased influx of
refugees from Serbia's strife-torn Kosovo province.
	   Nineteen of the refugees caught Saturday were treated for
dizziness and shortness of breath after being taken out of the
rented truck, which was airtight and had only 8 square meters (10
square yards) of floor space.
	   All 75 were then deported back to the Czech Republic.
	   Under German asylum law, refugees who can be shown to have
arrived from a safe third country are sent back there if they want
to apply for asylum.
	   Police discovered the smuggling operation when they stopped a
car accompanying the truck for a routine check in Tirschenreuth in
the state of Bavaria.
	   The driver of the car got away, but police arrested the truck
driver and two men in another car. They were brought before a judge
Sunday, who ordered them jailed pending charges.

Prime Minister `optimistic' for Palestinian-Israeli deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh said Sunday
he was optimistic Israel and the Palestinians can reach a peace
deal because they have bridged many gaps.
	   He said meetings in Amman with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Monday and two days later with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu made him ``feel the different moods on both sides and
this gave us a more optimistic outlook.''
	   ``At the same time, the United States is more determined this
time,'' he added, referring to President Clinton's role in meetings
going on in Maryland between Netanyahu and Arafat on Israeli troop
withdrawals from a further 13.1 percent from the West Bank.
	   He said the Palestinians and Israelis have concluded talks on
difficult points such as a Gaza Strip airport, a safe passage
between Gaza and the West Bank, and the freeing of many Palestinian
prisoners.
	   ``It seems they have closed many files with details, not
generalities,'' he said. He said the most important issue remaining
for Israel was security, noting that the Palestinians are being
flexible on the question.
	   Tarawneh said Netanyahu was in a stronger position to conclude a
deal because of the appointment of hawkish leader Ariel Sharon as
foreign minister which ``is another assurance that the government
coalition will not collapse.''
	   Addressing reporters for foreign media, Tarawneh also said
efforts to improve Jordan's relations with neighboring Syria were
not moving forward.
	   He said Syria has not been forthcoming about Jordan's requests
to free more than 500 Jordanians detained since the 1970s,
including some government officials. Syria has not admitted it
holds any Jordanians.
	   Tarawneh also criticized recent remarks by Syrian Defense
Minister Mustafa Tlass, who accused Jordan of adopting pro-Israeli
policies and obstructing Arab armies from joining in the 1973 war
against Israel _ an accusation that Jordan denied.
	   ``We don't understand this campaign by the Syrian media and
officials,'' Tarawneh said.
	   Relations with Syria chilled after the 1994 Jordanian-Israeli
peace treaty, which Damascus believed weakened its bargaining
position in negotiations talks with Israel.

Newly expanded Israeli-Jordanian border crossing to open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A newly expanded bridge over the Jordan river
linking Israel and Jordan will open next week, Israeli officials
said Sunday.
	   Israel and Jordan signed an agreement last week for the joint
operation and maintenance of the Sheikh Hussein bridge which runs
along a northern section of the border. New lanes on the border
crossing will help eliminate delays for tourists traveling by car,
said a statement issued by Israel's national infrastructure
ministry.
	   The announcement came after Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, who also holds the infrastructures portfolio visited with
Jordan's King Hussein earlier this week in Rochester, Minnesota
where the king is undergoing treatment for lymphatic cancer.
	   Sharon said in the statement that the project was an important
step in a series of cooperative ventures between the countries in
the field of transportation and roads.
	   Construction on the Israeli side of the bridge was completed a
year and half ago, but the new lanes remained closed until last
week, when construction on the Jordanian side was completed with
the aid of funding from Japan.
	   The bridge is one of three border crossings between Israel and
Jordan, made more accessible to tourists since the two countries
signed an historic peace treaty in 1994.

Macedonians decide whether to opt for change at elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Voters in Macedonia were deciding
Sunday whether to re-elect the politicians who lead them out of
former Yugoslavia peacefully or opt for a change promised by a team
of younger politicians.
	   Thirty-eight parties, including the ruling coalition of the
Social Democratic Alliance and their allies, all have promised a
better future, concentrating their election campaigns on
Macedonia's growing economic woes.
	   Only minor irregularities were reported at the polls by Sunday
afternoon. Election officials said some 18 percent of Macedonia's
1.5 million voters turned up at the polling stations by 2 p.m.
local time (noon GMT).
	   The multitude of parties in the third parliamentary elections
since Macedonia abandoned its Communist single-party system in 1990
could mean that none will win an outright majority in the 120-seat
assembly.
	   Favorites of the pro-reform voters were an opposition coalition
who have challenged the ruling coalition led by renamed Communists,
in power since Macedonia gained independence in 1992.
	   ``I vote for changes and I hope all people in Macedonia will
vote for changes,'' declared Ljupco Georgievski, one of the
opposition leaders.
	   His partner, Vasil Tupurkovski, cast his ballot at one minute
before noon to symbolize that time is running out to lead out
Macedonia from the economic crisis.
	   Macedonia was the poorest of all six republics in the former
Yugoslav federation, and its economy remains feeble with about 30
percent unemployment and a dlrs 210 monthly average salary.
	   Situated near the volatile Kosovo province, with unsolved
disputes with all of its neighbors, and a restive ethnic Albanian
minority, Macedonia is a key country for stability in the Balkans.
	   U.N. peacekeepers and the ruling alliance led by former
Communists turned pragmatists _ notably Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski and President Kiro Gligorov _ are credited with keeping
the country out of the trouble that engulfed much of former
Yugoslavia.
	   Upon casting his ballot Sunday, Crvenkovski said he hoped the
future government ``will be able to preserve peace and stability.''
	   During the election campaign, Tupurkovski drafted an economic
program which, he said, would attract dlrs one billion of foreign
investment. He said Macedonia must rely on agriculture and small,
family-run businesses in contrast to old-time Communist-era
enterprises.
	   Tupurkovski, 47, was one of the youngest and most popular
politicians in former Communist-run Yugoslavia for his reformist
stands and casual style.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 440,000 of Macedonia's 2 million
population, were expected to increase their representation in the
assembly. Their desire for self-rule has given rise to concern
because of similar aims of the Albanian minority in rump
Yugoslavia.
	   Gligorov said he hoped the elections will result in a
``continuation of Macedonia's democratic traditions.''

Sampras beats Kucera to win Vienna tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-seed Pete Sampras on Sunday outplayed
fifth-seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1 to win the
dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP tennis tournament.
	   The world's No. 1 player took two hours and four minutes to win
his fourth tournament victory this year _ the 56th in his career.
The American, an 11-time Grand-Slam winner, won dlrs 125,400 and,
more importantly, 361 ATP points.
	   ``It's a great feeling every time you get through a week like
this,'' said Sampras.
	   ``The field was very strong here, and it's amazing how things
can turn around so quickly in life,'' he said, referring to his
first-round loss in Basel, Switzerland, last week.
	   ``I enjoyed playing here.'' Sampras said. ``There was a very
good crowd every day ... it's almost like you feel their energy.''
	   Sampras dominated play from the start. In the first set he broke
Kucera at 3-1.
	   In the second set, Sampras broke for 1-0. But then he faded
somewhat, and Kucera broke the American for 4-4 and forced a
tiebreaker. Sampras managed to come back and win the tiebreaker
7-3.
	   ``The huge key was the second set that decided the match,''
Sampras said. ``I knew it would be hard for him to come back after
being two sets to love down.''
	   His victory in Vienna helps Sampras toward his goal of becoming
the first player to finish the season as the world's top player for
the sixth consecutive time.
	   ``I played Pete four times now, and he played his best match
against me today,'' said Kucera, No. 7 in the world.
	   Sampras is playing three more events in Europe: at Lyon,
Stuttgart and Paris.

Wildlife group starts program to save Far East leopard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The World Wildlife Fund is spending dlrs 30,000 in
Russia to try to prevent the extinction of the Far Eastern leopard,
a news report said Sunday.
	   Only about 30 of the leopards are left in Russia, Natalya
Moraleva, manager of Far Eastern programs at the WWF's Moscow
office, told the Interfax news agency.
	   The new program is the first effort in Russia to protect the Far
Eastern leopard, she said. Wildlife experts will try to determine
how many leopards are left and monitor their habitat.
	   The program is to be funded by the U.S. branch of the
Switzerland-based fund and will start in December, Interfax said.
	   The Far Eastern leopard has a distinctive yellow coat with black
spots and ranges over a small territory of 2,170 square miles
(5,620 square kilometers) on the southernmost tip of Russia's
Pacific coast. Very small populations of leopards are believed to
survive across the nearby borders in North Korea and China.
	   Forest fires and poachers are reducing the number of the
leopards' prey, causing the cats' birth rate to plummet to about a
quarter of what it was in the 1970s.

New wave of ethnic violence hits Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - The advance team for 2,000 unarmed
international ``compliance verifiers'' arrived in Kosovo on Sunday,
rolling into its capital on the heels of a new wave of ethnic
violence in the Yugoslav province.
	   Three Serb policemen died and three others were badly wounded by
a grenade at a police outpost in the town of Orlate, 30 kilometers
(20 miles) southwest of the capital Pristina, where police have
long complained of frequent attacks by ethnic Albanians. An AP
reporter verified the Orlate clash. The Serb-run Kosovo Media
Center in Pristina reported a dozen other attacks around the
province.
	   Serb officials blamed the stepped up violence on the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, loosely organized bands of
guerrillas still operating in wide areas of this poor southern
province of Serbia, the dominant republic in the shrunken Yugoslav
federation.
	   ``These latest attacks show that the Albanian terrorists are
trying by all possible means to prevent the realization of the ...
agreement,'' said Veljko Odalovic, the head of Kosovo's regional
government, referring to the deal struck by President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Hydajet Hyseni, spokesman for the United Democratic Movement,
which is openly supportive of the KLA, accused the police of
attacking the ``innocent Albanian population,'' and said the KLA
were shooting back in self-defense.
	   ``There is no real withdrawal of Serb armed forces from Kosovo,
let alone demilitarization of Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Odalovic, however, said there was no doubt the Albanians were
responsible.
	   ``This confirms what the international community has never
wanted to admit, that these bands of terrorists are not in favor of
a peaceful solution to the problem and are trying to take advantage
of the withdrawal of police and military forces from Kosovo.''
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the KLA. An estimated
300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been driven from
their homes. Many of them have been afraid to return because of the
continuing presence of Serb police, though there has been a trickle
of returnees in a number of villages.
	   The United States and NATO have reported significant pullbacks
by Yugoslav forces in recent days but say numbers still exceed the
level required by the Belgrade agreement. NATO plans for air
attacks on Yugoslavia remained on hold as the North Atlantic
Council, NATO's top policymaking body, extended the deadline for
compliance from last Saturday to Oct. 27.
	   As the violence escalated in this poor province of two million
people, 90 percent of whom are ethnic Albanian, an advance team
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
arrived in the provincial capital. The OSCE has been charged with
the responsibility of verifying that Milosevic sticks to the
promises he made in the agreement with Holbrooke.
	   Principal among the demands is that he decrease the number of
troops and police to pre-February 1998 levels, the period when the
current conflict began. So far, nobody has specified exactly what
those levels are.
	   ``We will bring as many people in as quickly as possible, as the
infrastructure permits,'' said John Sandrock, an American who heads
the Vienna-based OSCE's mission support section. ``I don't want to
give you any numbers, or any deadlines or any times, but we will
respond to this issue as quickly as we can.''
	   Asked if he thought his current mission would have an effect on
the rising number of attacks, he said: ``We hope that the overall
presence of the OSCE can act in a stabilizing fashion and hopefully
we'll resolve many of the issues. Ours is a technical mission. We
are kind of an advance guard to try and assess where we will go
from here.''
	   He said the OSCE mission had a one-year mandate, which could be
extended.

Three prisoners escape from prison in Jammu-Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Three Pakistanis escaped from a
high-security prison in India's troubled Jammu-Kashmir state,
police said Sunday.
	   The three were arrested three years ago after being accused of
helping Muslim militants fighting a separatist war in Kashmir since
1989.
	   One of them was suspected in a bombing attack on a stadium
during India's national day parade in Jammu in 1995 that killed
eight people and wounded another 60, police said.
	   The three escaped early Saturday from the prison on the
outskirts of Jammu, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state.
	   On Saturday, 11 prison wardens were suspended under suspicions
that they colluded with the Pakistanis, said Mushtaq Ahmed Lone,
the state minister for internal security.
	   A top police officer was asked to probe the jail break, the
minister staid.
	   The Pakistanis, identified as Irfan Ahmed, Mohammed Salim and
Mohammed Khalid, had yet to be tried in court. The authorities have
the power to detain suspects for years without trial because of the
insurgency war in Jammu-Kashmir state.

Conservatives win big cities in mayoral races
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Conservatives won two key mayoral races
Sunday to add to the voter backlash against Premier Costas Simitis'
Socialist government, according to exit poll results.
	   The wins by the opposition New Democracy-backed candidates in
the northern city of Salonica and the busy port of Piraeus in the
run-off ballots give Simitis opponents control of city hall in
three of Greece's key cities. In the first-round elections Oct. 11,
Athens' conservative mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos won re-election by
a wide margin.
	   Some analysts considered the gains by conservatives a sign of
public discontent to the government's austerity measures aimed at
qualifying Greece for the European Union's single currency group by
2001. But the government has insisted it will not change its
policies, which include aggressive privatization plans and efforts
to trim Greece's vast public payroll.
	   The New Democracy party retained control of Salonica with the
election of former sports minister Vassilis Papagiorgopoulos. In
Piraeus, Greece's main port, conservative Christos Agrapidis
toppled the candidate backed by the traditionally dominant
Socialists, according to polls carried by private and state
broadcasters.
	   The Socialists also looked likely to lose the prestigious race
for regional governor, or prefect, of Athens and Piraeus. But the
governing party appeared to retain its grip in other regions and
big towns.

Sampras beats Kucera to win Vienna tournament

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO ADD LEAD DESIGNATOR &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS typo in 10 th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-seed Pete Sampras on Sunday clearly
outplayed fifth-seeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1
to win the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP tennis tournament.
	   The world's No. 1 player took 2:04 hours to win his fourth
tournament victory this year _ the 56th in his career. The
American, who was Grand Slam winner 11 times, took a check of drls
125,400 in prize money and, more importantly, 361 important ATP
points.
	   ``It's a great feeling every time you get through a week like
this,'' an elated Sampras commented his near-flawless performance
in Vienna.
	   ``The field was very strong here, and it's amazing how things
can turn around so quickly in life,'' he said, referring to his
first-round loss in Basel, Switzerland, last week.
	   ``I enjoyed playing here.'' Sampras said. ``There was a very
good crowd every day, and the people support very much the event.
They are very knowledgeable, and it's almost like you feel their
energy.''
	   Sampras, who has reached his best form again, dominated play
from the start. The winner had no trouble breaking Kucera at 3-1
with fabulous returns and serve out after 31 minutes.
	   He again excelled in the second set to begin with, stunning his
opponent and the crowd with his powerful serve and breaking for
1-0. But then Sampras faded somewhat, and Kucera made valuable
points. The Slovak challenger broke the American for 4-4 and forced
a tiebreak.
	   But that was about as much as Kucera could do, and Sampras won
the tiebreak 7-3.
	   ``The huge key was the second set that decided the match,'' the
winner confirmed. ``I knew it would be hard for him to come back
after being two sets to love down.''
	   Many of the 6,591 people watching Sampras wondered who might be
the one to beat him if the American keeps his current form. And he
knows it.

German Jewish leader accuses lawyer of misusing Holocaust victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 3 grafs with WJO comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The leader of Germany's Jewish
community accused a U.S. attorney of hindering talks aimed at
securing compensation for Holocaust victims from German companies.
	   Ignatz Bubis, president of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, said in Monday's Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper that
lawyer Ed Fagan was using Nazi victims for his own financial gain.
	   ``Fagan doesn't want anything more than to earn a lot of
money,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
	   Fagan has been the lead attorney in several lawsuits filed in
New York on behalf of Holocaust victims. He is seeking compensation
from German banks that handled assets of Holocaust victims, as well
as companies that used slave labor during World War II.
	   Bubis said he believed ``the companies would quickly reach an
agreement with the World Jewish Congress'' if they weren't facing
legal action from Fagan and other attorneys.
	   An advance copy of the interview was released Sunday.
	   Fagan did not immediately return a message left at his New York
office Sunday.
	   Last week, Bubis charged Fagan also wanted a dlrs 250 million
fee from the World Jewish Restitution Organization, which recently
came to a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement with Swiss banks for
compensation to Holocaust survivors and heirs.
	   Fagan, who initiated the action against Swiss banks two years
ago, has denied asking for a 20 percent commission.
	   He said in August he had not yet asked for any fee in the case
but would petition the court for payment as is standard in
class-action lawsuits.
	   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
said Sunday his group believed lawyers should not receive any fees
for working on Holocaust-related cases.
	   ``Neither lawyers nor anyone else should be making a profit from
the Holocaust,'' he said in New York.
	   The World Jewish Restitution Organization is a branch of the
World Jewish Congress.

Dublin strikes as Coventry beats fellow struggler Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COVENTRY, England (AP) _ Dion Dublin fired next-to-last Coventry
to a vital 1-0 victory over fellow struggler Sheffield Wednesday on
Sunday.
	   The England international striker turned in Noel Whelan's cross
after a slick move from deep with 15 minutes to go for his third
goal of the season.
	   Although the victory failed to lift the Sky Blues away from its
19th place, it left last place Southampton in even more trouble
despite its 1-1 tie at defending titlist Arsenal on Saturday.
	   The Saints only have two points from nine games and are six
behind Coventry, Nottingham Forest and Blackburn. Sunday's loss
meant that Wednesday slips down one place to 16th behind Leicester
on goal difference.
	   Coventry should have settled Sunday's game before Dublin's 75th
minute strike.
	   Facing an empty net, Dublin fired against the post from close
range in the 48th minute after Wednesday 'keeper Kevin Pressman had
fumbled Gary McAllister's corner.
	   Then Whelan got clear of the Wednesday defense but decided to
pass to Dublin instead of shooting and another chance was wasted.
	   Sunderland regained second place in division one and maintained
its unbeaten record by winning 3-2 at West Bromwich Albion after
trailing 2-0 at half time.
	   Lee Hughes took his total for the season to 14 with first half
strikes for the Baggies. But three goals in just 19 minutes from
Andy Melville, substitute Michael Bridges and Kevin Ball turned the
game around.
	   Peter Reid's team is two points behind leader Huddersfield who
beat Queens Park Rangers 2-0 Saturday and sent Gerry Francis' team
down to last in the standings.

Macedonians decide whether to opt for change at elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with polls closing at 7 p.m., first official results
expected on Monday in new 4th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Voters in Macedonia were deciding
Sunday whether to confirm in office the politicians who lead them
out of former Yugoslavia peacefully or opt for a change promised by
a team of younger politicians.
	   Thirty-eight parties, including the ruling coalition of the
Social Democratic Alliance and their allies, all have promised a
better future, concentrating their election campaigns on
Macedonia's growing economic woes.
	   Only minor irregularities were reported at the polls by Sunday
afternoon. Election officials said some 18 percent of Macedonia's
1,5 million voters turned up at the polling stations by 2 p.m.
local time (noon GMT).
	   Polls closed at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT), and first official results
were expected to be released Monday.
	   The multitude of parties in the third parliamentary elections
since Macedonia abandoned its Communist single-party system in 1990
could mean that none would win an outright majority in the 120-seat
assembly.
	   Favorites of the pro-reform voters were an opposition coalition
who have challenged the ruling coalition led by renamed Communists,
in power since Macedonia gained independence in 1992.
	   ``I vote for changes and I hope all people in Macedonia will
vote for changes,'' declared Ljupco Georgievski, one of the
opposition leaders.
	   His partner, Vasil Tupurkovski, cast his ballot at one minute
before noon to symbolize that time is running out to lead out
Macedonia from the economic crisis.
	   Macedonia was the poorest of all six republics in the former
Yugoslav federation, and its economy remains feeble with about 30
percent unemployment and a dlrs 210 monthly average salary.
	   Situated in the neighborhood of the volatile Kosovo province,
with unsolved disputes with all of its neighbors, and a restive
ethnic Albanian minority, Macedonia is a key country for stability
in the Balkans.
	   U.N. peacekeepers and the ruling alliance led by former
Communists turned pragmatists _ notably Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski and President Kiro Gligorov _ are credited with keeping
the country out of the trouble that engulfed much of former
Yugoslavia.
	   Upon casting his ballot Sunday, Crvenkovski said he hoped the
future government ``will be able to preserve peace and stability.''
	   During the election campaign, Tupurkovski drafted an economic
program which, he said, would attract dlrs one billion of foreign
investment. He said Macedonia must rely on agriculture and small,
family-run businesses contrary to old-time Communist-era
enterprises.
	   Tupurkovski, 47, was one of the youngest and most popular
politicians in former Communist-run Yugoslavia for his reformist
stands and casual style.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 440,000 of Macedonia's 2 million
population, were expected to increase their representation in the
assembly. Their desire for self-rule has given rise to concern
because of similar aims of the Albanian minority in rump
Yugoslavia.
	   Gligorov said he hoped the elections will result in a
``continuation of Macedonia's democratic traditions.''

Georgia to continue peace talks with Abkhazian separatists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VOULIAGMENI, Greece (AP) - Georgia and the breakaway Abkhazia
province agreed Sunday to continue negotiations to end their
six-year conflict and ensure the return of refugees in the former
Soviet republic on the Black Sea.
	   ``It was an important first step,'' Levan Alexidze, special
advisor to Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, said at the end
of three days of U.N.-sponsored talks at this seaside resort near
Athens. `We understand that by force we cannot win the war.''
	   Abkhazians declared an independent republic after driving out
Georgian government forces in 1993 following the end of a 13-month
war.
	   Despite the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in 1994, sporadic
clashes have continued. In May, Abkhazian forces took control of
Georgia's fertile Ghali region.
	   Since 1992, more than 300,000 people have fled their homes due
to the fighting. The United Nations wants both sides to adopt
confidence building measures to end the hostilities, ensure the
return of refugees and establish economic cooperation.
	   Alexidze said Abkhazia, which borders Russia and uses the ruble
as its currency, would be forced to cooperate with Georgia to
repair its war-shattered economy.
	   ``Russia is too busy with its own problems and cannot push them
in the other direction,'' he said.
	   Present at the negotiations were representatives from Russia,
the United States, Britain, France and Germany.

Bill Gates' tenacity colors his battle with the feds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo WX101 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID FOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Click here for the Bill Gates you recognize:
Merciless corporate titan? Idealistic visionary? Computer geek with
way too much money?
	   The world's richest man has stirred envy and admiration for
years, and the U.S. government's antitrust case against Microsoft
has only revved up the debate over what makes him tick.
	   Gates himself favors the vision thing.
	   ``When I was 19, I caught sight of the future and based my
career on what I saw. I turned out to have been right,'' he wrote
in his 1995 bestseller, ``The Road Ahead.''
	   A darker view is found in ``The Microsoft File: The Secret Case
Against Bill Gates.''
	   The new book, written by high-tech writer Wendy Goldman Rohm,
says:
	   ``He was a predator, said the CEOs of scores of competing
software companies: an ill-kempt, socially inept, scrawny,
insecure, ruthless Lex Luthor,'' a reference to the Superman comic
book villain motivated by an all-consuming inferiority complex.
	   Rohm's portrait of Gates _ as an unethical schemer who would
stop at nothing to dominate the Internet and computer industry _
appears to be shared by attorneys for the Justice Department and 20
states.
	   Their antitrust lawsuit, coming to trial Monday in Washington,
D.C., accuses Microsoft of illegally bullying rivals in an effort
to stifle competition in the Internet browser market and maintain
the dominance of Windows, the operating system that runs nine out
of 10 personal computers.
	   Both friends and foes say the high-stakes case has done little
to change Gates' take-no-prisoners approach to his business.
Whether motivated by lust for power and profit, as critics claim,
or by his self-declared vision of bringing the world into the
Information Age, Gates is known for impatience with limits.
	   ``Bill is a very rational person. He's very logical, and he
happens to be very competitive,'' said Scott Oki, a former
Microsoft executive who has seen Gates direct his zeal for winning
toward business ventures, water-skiing and even board games.
	   Whatever the contest, ``Bill enjoys doing it in part because
it's a competitive thing,'' Oki said. ``He can apply his brain
power to coming out on top.''
	   Those qualities helped make the young Gates a teen-age computer
whiz at Seattle's exclusive Lakeside School. At age 21, he dropped
out of Harvard to run Microsoft, the software company he'd founded
two years earlier with friend Paul Allen. At 31, he was a
billionaire, and today, at 42, he is the world's wealthiest man,
with a fortune pegged by Forbes magazine at more than dlrs 50
billion, give or take a few billion depending on the stock market's
performance on a given day.
	   With his wife, Melinda, and 2-year-old daughter, Jennifer, Gates
lives in a dlrs 53 million techno-dream house on the shore of
Seattle's Lake Washington.
	   Once stereotyped as the awkward computer nerd, Gates has grown
smoother and more complex with age. He has discovered philanthropy,
contributing more than dlrs 800 million of his fortune to charity.
	   And he has found it prudent to court the politicians he once
ignored. Microsoft has given almost dlrs 400,000 to the national
Democratic and Republican parties since January 1997, more money
than it gave in the previous six years combined, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics.
	   Gates also has learned how to deal with lawyers. He won't
testify at the antitrust trial, but his combative style was on
display at his August deposition. Government attorneys complained
that Gates, of the steel-trap mind, suffered ``a particular failure
of recollection'' and was ``evasive and non-responsive.''
	   Away from the lawyers, Gates is more congenial, keeping up a
steady schedule of public appearances in which he plays booster for
the brave new world of technology.
	   On Oct. 12, he addressed a crowd of more than 7,000 at Indiana
University. Dressed down in a red school sweatshirt, Gates
predicted a wondrous ``Web lifestyle'' in which the world will
shop, communicate and go to school over the Internet.
	   ``My vision is of a day not very far away when computers can
see, listen and learn,'' Gates said.
	   A few protesters criticized Microsoft's corporate overdrive, but
most listeners were enthralled by Gates.
	   ``I think he's the epitome of what's driving our generation,''
business major Andrea Masters told The Indianapolis Star. ``We're
the generation of technology. Who better to learn from than the
person who has created such a whirlwind of opportunities for us?''

Tony Blair will try to break deadlock on decommissioning of
</HEADLINE>
weapons &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair will attempt to get the
Northern Ireland peace process back on schedule when he holds
separate meetings Monday with Protestant and Catholic leaders about
the decommissioning of weapons.
	   Blair has invited David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist
Party, and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness to his Downing Street
office.
	   ``Obviously the prime minister will be pressing the
decommissioning issue and seeking to crack it,'' said Blair's
spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   Blair hopes to take advantage of renewed optimism following the
award Friday of the Nobel Peace Prize to Trimble and John Hume,
Catholic leader of the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party.
Blair's spokesman said the Nobel recognition could ``act as a
spur'' and break the deadlock.
	   A Northern Ireland administration of Protestants and Catholics
is supposed to hold an inaugural summit with the Irish Republic's
government by Oct. 31, one of the few specific deadlines within
April's historic peace accord.
	   But the potential 12-member administration has yet to be
appointed because two key politicians _ Trimble and Sinn Fein party
leader Gerry Adams _ can't agree whether the Irish Republican Army
must start disarming first.
	   The agreement says only that disarmament should happen by May
2000. But Trimble, chief representative of the north's British
Protestant majority, insists the IRA must demonstrate it has
renounced violence before Adams' IRA-allied party will be eligible
to participate in the new government.
	   The IRA is sticking to a July 1997 cease-fire but insists it
won't disarm, and Sinn Fein argues it shouldn't be responsible for
what the IRA does. But Sinn Fein has assigned McGuinness to work
with the official commission on surrendering weapons.
	   The Ulster Volunteer Force and the other major outlawed
pro-British group, the Ulster Defense Association, have observed a
truce since 1994 but are similarly determined to retain their less
elaborate arsenal.
	   Trimble, who is under pressure from his party to force the
decommissioning issue, has cited the Nobel prize as an added
incentive for the IRA to start disarming now.
	   ``I hope it's not premature in the sense that I hope the
republican movement will not let down everyone in Northern Ireland
who wants to see progress,'' Trimble said during a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview on Sunday.
	   But while Trimble contends that decommissioning should already
be underway, he downplayed the importance of the Oct. 31 deadline
for setting up the executive body.
	   Instead, he talked about meeting the target date of February
when Britain is due to transfer powers to the new Northern Ireland
government.
	   But Sinn Fein said McGuinness would impress on Blair the
``imperative'' of getting the executive body established by the end
of the month.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern on Sunday urged all the
parties to ``adopt a generous and forthcoming approach'' on the
weapons front and said it would be ``perverse'' if the issue was
allowed to destroy the peace process.

Thousands rally in Tehran to protest key assembly election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators
rallied in a Tehran park Sunday to protest the rejection of scores
of moderate candidates for the election of a powerful assembly.
	   The Council of Guardians, which is dominated by political
hard-liners, has rejected 214 candidates out of about 400 who
wanted to run in Friday's election to the 86-member Assembly of
Experts.
	   Many of the disqualified candidates were supporters of President
Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate. Twelve candidates withdrew
their names in protest against the screening.
	   The move by the 12-member Council of Guardians is seen as part
of the struggle between conservatives and reformists in Iran.
	   Khatami went on national television late Saturday to criticize
the selection of the candidates for the assembly, which has the
power to appoint or dismiss Iran's supreme leader.
	   ``There is no doubt that the number of wise and learned scholars
suitable for membership of the Assembly of Experts is greater than
the 400 or so candidates who have registered,'' the president said.
	   In a reference to expectations of a low turnout, Khatami said
that greater variety among the candidates would have increased
public enthusiasm for the polls.
	   Khatami said the council could be criticized for ``not creating
the climate and conditions which would have attracted eligible
individuals to enter the scene.''
	   ``We should not prevent people from criticizing the components
of the system, the institutions, the president, the Council of
Guardians, the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the judiciary,''
Khatami said.
	   The council has rejected criticism, saying its sole criteria for
judging candidates was the law. Candidates have to sit a test on
Islamic theology.
	   In Tehran's Laleh Park on Sunday, thousands turned out to hear
Heshmatollah Tabarzadi, a fiery student leader who waved his hands
as he spoke of the councilors that vetoed his own candidacy in
Friday's polls.
	   ``They have created a situation where a section of society will
not be taking part in the elections because qualified candidates
have been rejected, depriving a section of society from exercising
their rights,'' Tabarzadi said.
	   Declaring that people are born free and that Islam upholds
freedom of choice, Tabarzadi said: ``God has not forced anything on
humans.''
	   One spectator, Esfandiar Seyed Showqi, a medical student, said
he would not vote because there was ``no deserving candidate.''
	   ``We want the number of ballots to be small to show the world
the truth and the real results,'' Showqi said. ``By not voting, we
will be demonstrating our protest.''
	   Manouchehr Bigi, 40, said he would also boycott the polls
``because (the candidates) are all hard-liners.''
	   But a middle-aged woman in a black chador _ the Islamic garb
worn from head to toe _ said it was a national duty to vote.
	   ``We are responsible for the fate of our Islamic country and the
Islamic Constitution,'' the woman said, refusing to give her name.
	   Tabarzadi drew applause when he accused a hard-line vigilante
group, Ansar-e Hezbollah, of attacking women in a similar
demonstration last May. He attacked the legal authorities for not
punishing the assailants.
	   ``None of the religious leaders criticized the incident or
sought to take any action,'' Tabarzadi said.
	   The crowd also clapped when Tabarzadi spoke of corruption in
government, saying certain powerful officials were ``plundering
people's wealth as their stomachs grow fatter, while poor people
don't have even bread to eat.''

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Voters in Macedonia were deciding
Sunday whether to re-elect the politicians who lead them out of
former Yugoslavia peacefully or opt for a change promised by a team
of younger politicians.
	   Thirty-eight parties, including the ruling coalition of the
Social Democratic Alliance and their allies, all have promised a
better future, concentrating their election campaigns on
Macedonia's growing economic woes.
	   Only minor irregularities were reported at the polls by Sunday
afternoon. Election officials said some 18 percent of Macedonia's
1.5 million voters turned up at the polling stations by 2 p.m.
local time (noon GMT).
	   Polls closed at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT), and first official results
were expected to be released Monday.

Status of Milosevic's promises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The status Sunday of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic must back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's
deadline _ pushed back to Oct. 27 _ or face renewed threat of
airstrikes for his crackdown in Kosovo:
	   _ Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo:
	   Amid a new wave of violence, three Serb policemen died and three
others were badly wounded by a grenade at a police outpost in the
town of Orlate, 20 miles southwest of Pristina, but major
large-scale fighting has not occurred for about a month.
	   Both sides reported shooting incidents Saturday. Serb police
claimed ethnic Albanian ``extremists'' had attacked them more than
a dozen times across Kosovo. The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs
for at least two of the incidents, saying police in Vranjevac had
opened fire.
	   _ Withdraw forces and heavy armaments to levels before the
crackdown began Feb. 28:
	   NATO spy planes continued flying over Kosovo on Sunday to check
on the status of pullouts. NATO says more Serb troops and police
remain in the province than are permitted.
	   _ Start serious talks with ethnic Albanians on self-rule:
	   No date for the start of talks has been announced. The two sides
have been holding separate discussions with U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill. Ethnic Albanian political leaders reportedly met Saturday in
Turkey to discuss taking a united stand on independence or
autonomy.
	   _ Help refugees return to their homes:
	   Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages but many
remain wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused in
massacres of civilians.
	   _ Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian organizations:
	   The U.N. refugee agency and others have resumed aid convoys for
the past several days, and some workers say Serb police have been
less obstructive.
	   _ Cooperating with the International War Crimes Tribunal:
	   U.N. war crimes investigators have received Yugoslav visas and
plan to return to Kosovo soon.
	   _ Allowing a 2,000-member international verification force into
Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia is keeping its word:
	   An advance team for the monitors, to be overseen by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, arrived in
Pristina on Sunday. OSCE says it hopes a sizable number of monitors
would be in place in Kosovo in two weeks.

Train cars carrying chemicals derail, ignite fire in Ukraine

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four train cars carrying a liquid gas derailed in
western Ukraine and one of them caught fire, emergency officials
said Sunday.
	   The fire damaged the rails, though no casualties were reported,
Ukraine's Emergency Situations Ministry said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency. The accident occurred Saturday night in the
Lviv region, near Ukraine's border with Poland and Slovakia.
	   The train had 61 freight cars, most of which were carrying
chemicals from Slovakia to the Russian city of Ryazan. Some of the
cars were carrying ammonia and propane, ITAR-Tass said. It didn't
say what kind of gas was in the cars that derailed.
	   Train traffic resumed Sunday.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A pipeline explosion spilled oil on a
rural hamlet early Sunday and fire raced through the village,
killing at least 25 people and injuring 66, authorities said.
Police said leftist rebels were suspected in the blast.
	   ``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And no one
knows exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert
Valencia in Segovia, the largest town near Machuca, where the
deaths occurred. ``People were asleep at the time and the fire
spread quickly.''
	   ``There was a huge explosion and afterward a ball of flame
erupted, according to survivors,'' said Gen. Alfredo Salgado,
operations director of the national police.
	   Valencia told The Associated Press by telephone that the
explosion occurred at 2:45 a.m. in the village 300 kilometers (180
miles) north of Bogota, and that many of the victims were trapped
by the flames. He said many of the injured, rushed to at least four
area hospitals, had third-degree burns.
	   The Antioquia state governor's office said at least 25 people
were killed and 66 injured and Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda
said leftist rebels, who frequently sabotage Colombia's oil
pipelines, were suspected.
	   ``The chances that it was a terrorist attack are stronger than
the chances it was accident,'' Lloreda told the Radionet network.
	   ``The people in the area say it was the ELN,'' said Valencia,
referring to the National Liberation Army, which operates in the
area and is blamed for most oil pipeline attacks. There was no
immediate comment from the rebel group.
	   The houses of Machuca, a cluster of wooden houses with about 150
residents, were largely destroyed, Valencia said. The damaged
Colombia Central pipeline, a periodic target of ELN sabotage
operated by the state-owned Ecopetrol oil company, transports
100,000 barrels of crude daily, most of it from the Cusiana oil
field in east-central Colombia to the Covenas terminal on the
Caribbean. The blast halted pumping on the pipeline.
	   Leaders of the ELN, Colombia's second-largest rebel band, say
they blow up oil pipelines because the government has sold out to
foreign oil interests. Sunday's deaths occurred exactly a week
after ELN leaders held talks in mountains not far from Segovia with
government and civilian representatives to establish parameters for
peace talks scheduled for February.
	   In talks with civilian leaders in July, the rebel group said it
would curtail its attacks on pipelines. The ELN has not, however,
denounced the armed struggle or said when it might agree to a
cease-fire.
	   The rebel movement extorts money from companies that operate in
rural areas it controls, and those businesses that refuse to pay
its ``war taxes'' are frequently attacked or have executives
kidnapped.
	   The ELN has no history, however, of intentionally targeting
civilians in dynamiting oil facilities, attacks which usually occur
in unpopulated areas. This year, rebels have sabotaged Colombian
pipelines more than 62 times, or 50 percent more than last year.

Quakes rattle Nicaragua, one dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A series of small quakes rattled
central Nicaragua on Sunday, damaging homes near the epicenter and
killing one woman.
	   Three quakes, ranging in preliminary magnitude between 3.4 and
4, rattled Managua and sent residents scrambling from their homes
starting at 7:31 a.m. local time (1331 GMT). Several smaller
temblors were also reported.
	   One woman was crushed by a tree toppled in the first quake in
the village of Ticuantepe, six miles (11 kilometers) southeast of
Managua and two miles (3 kilometer) from the quake's epicenter,
firefighters reported.
	   Firefighters said they evacuated some residents of Ticuantepe.
	   Nicaragua's National Seismology Department said the quakes were
related to volcanic activity and movement along local fault lines.
The area is located near the active Masaya volcano, but experts
said there was no apparent threat of an eruption.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia started assigning 200 observers Sunday to
an international monitoring force overseeing a peace plan to avert
NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, a lawmaker said.
	   Sergei Baburin, hard-line vice speaker of the lower house of
Russia's parliament, made his comments Sunday after leading a
Russian delegation to Yugoslavia to discuss the Kosovo conflict,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Russia shares Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian religion
with Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, and strongly
opposes NATO's proposed airstrikes.
	   The 2,000-strong monitoring force, part of a peace deal reached
last week, is to verify that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
pulls his troops from Kosovo.
	   The Russian-Serb Friendship Fraternity rallied outside the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow on Sunday protesting NATO's potential strikes.
The group urged the Russian government ``to more decisively stand
for the interests of fraternal Serbia,'' ITAR-Tass said.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Carlos Ferrer Salat, chairman of the
Spanish Olympic Committee, died Sunday of a heart attack at the age
of 69.
	   Ferrer died at home in his native Barcelona, his daughter
Beatriz Ferrer told Spanish radio.
	   Ferrer had also been a member of the International Olympic
Committee since 1985. He had directed the Spanish Olympic Committee
since 1987 and played a key role in organizing the 1992 Olympic
Games in Barcelona.
	   Barcelona mayor Joan Clos praised Ferrer for getting civic
groups and businesses involved in the Games, especially a plan
under which private sector companies financed training of Spanish
athletes.
	   News of his death brought condolences from throughout the
Spanish sports world, from tennis star Arantxa Sanchez Vicario to
former national soccer coach Javier Clemente.
	   ``This is a great loss because he was a key promoter of
strengthening amateur sports,'' Clemente told the state news agency
Efe.

Spain elusive on whether it will back bid to extradite Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with comments from Aznar, background on legal
proceedings. CHANGES overline, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's government on Sunday avoided saying
whether it would back efforts to extradite former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet from London to face questioning about Spaniards
killed in Chile under his rule.
	   Investigating magistrates Baltasar Garzon and Manuel Garcia
Castellon were believed to be preparing to travel to London to
interrogate Pinochet, who was arrested there Friday by police
acting on a warrant submitted by Garzon.
	   The two magistrates have been investigating Pinochet's alleged
role in the deaths of Spaniards in Chile under his regime and of
Chileans in Argentina as part of an operation by South American
military juntas that teamed up to help each other crush dissent in
the 1970s and '80s.
	   Garzon has 40 days from Friday to present a formal extradition
request to Britain.
	   Any such request must first pass through the Spanish Justice
Ministry and then be approved by the cabinet of Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar, said an official in Aznar's office.
	   But a lawyer involved in efforts to bring Pinochet to trial in
Spain, Enrique Santiago, insisted that extradition requests are
made between judges and it would be illegal for Aznar to try to
block one.
	   The ultimate decision on whether to extradite Pinochet lies with
British Home Secretary Jack Straw.
	   Aznar was elusive on the issue Sunday. Speaking in Oporto,
Portugal where he was attending the Ibero-American summit, he said:
``the task of the government is to comply with the law and
cooperate with the judiciary.''
	   But he declined to say pointblank if he would in fact approve a
bid to extradite Pinochet. His deputy prime minister, Rodrigo Rato,
speaking to reporters in Bilbao, was equally vague.
	   Aznar's government has opposed the probes by Garzon and Garcia
Castellon, saying they could upset delicate political dynamics in
countries that suffered years of brutal military rule.
	   State prosecutors at Spain's National Court had filed appeals
seeking to block the probes on grounds that the crimes being
investigated were committed outside Spain.
	   Garzon argues that the Pinochet affair is a case of potential
genocide and thus covered under Spanish law no matter where it
occurred.
	   Spanish state radio said Garzon and Garcia Castellon need to
complete several more legal formalities before traveling to London
to question Pinochet, who was arrested in a clinic where he was
recovering from back surgery.
	   Earlier news reports had said they might travel as early as
Sunday.
	   Spanish newspapers on Sunday hailed the arrest of Pinochet as a
triumph for justice and a warning to other despots.
	   The center-right daily El Mundo said in an editorial that
regardless of whether Pinochet is extradited to Spain, the mere
fact that he was arrested is charged with symbolism.
	   ``It is a lesson that the decrepit, retired executioner ... will
finally be treated as a criminal and forced to answer for his
actions before international justice,'' the paper said.
	   ``Not just for him, but for other despots and would-be despots
around the world,'' the pape added. ``There can be no borders for
prosecuting violations of human rights.''

Report: Yeltsin's kidnapped envoy taken to Dagestan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A presidential envoy kidnapped in breakaway
Chechnya has been taken to the neighboring republic of Dagestan,
where a deal was being worked out for his release, a news report
said Sunday.
	   Valentin Vlasov, President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya,
was abducted at gunpoint in May while traveling from Grozny, the
Chechen capital, to the neighboring republic of Ingushetia.
	   He has now been taken from Chechnya to Dagestan, where his
captors are negotiating with law enforcement officials for a
ransom, Supyan Akhmadov, an official with the Chechen interior
ministry who monitors kidnappings, told the Interfax news agency
Sunday.
	   Akhmadov did not say how much ransom was being demanded. Russian
media have reported that the kidnappers have asked for up to dlrs 4
million.
	   Hundreds of people, including several foreigners, have been
kidnapped in Chechnya and surrounding regions, usually for ransom,
since the region's two-year war for independence from Russia ended
in 1996.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Syrian defense minister's comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ High-ranking officials from Turkey and
Syria will meet Monday at a secret location to hold security talks
aimed at easing tensions between the neighbors, foreign ministry
officials confirmed Sunday.
	   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said late Saturday that talks would
take place but gave no indication as to where and when they would
be held.
	   Turkey accuses Syria of sheltering Turkish Kurdish rebels
responsible for cross-border attacks and indicated last month it
might resort to military action unless Damascus halted alleged
support to the insurgents. The threat raised fears of war in the
region.
	   ``In the meeting our representatives will assess how well
Turkey's demands over separatist terrorism are being met,'' Cem
told the Anatolia news agency. ``And, if they are being met, (we
will assess) if the measures are enough and lasting.''
	   Syrian Defense Minister Moustafa Tlas said Sunday that his
government wanted to resolve its differences with Turkey through
diplomatic channels, the official Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
	   ``The language of reason and logic should prevail over the
language of threat. We should resort to international law,'' Gen.
Tlas told a graduation ceremony at the Syrian Air Force Academy.
	   Follow-up meetings would depend on how convincing Syrian
officials were on promises to clamp down on the activities of the
rebel group, said a foreign ministry official speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Turkish newspapers gave conflicting reports as to where the
talks would be held. Possible venues included the Turkish and
Syrian capitals as well as borders towns.

Peace agreement leaves Serbian police feeling cornered

	   ORLATE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In the attic of a roadside house, the
bodies of three Serbian policemen lay awkwardly while a searchlight
scanned the hillside for suspected ethnic Albanian rebels who
lobbed the grenade.
	   A few kilometers (miles) away, nine policemen smoked in the dark
at a gas station-turned-checkpoint and waited for a possible
guerrilla assault.
	   The commander, a broad-shouldered 27-year veteran who called
himself Baja, complained that last week's peace agreement between
President Slobodan Milosevic and Western powers threatening NATO
airstrikes stopped his side from wiping out rebel strongholds in
the Serbian province.
	   New orders, he said, allow Serb police to return fire only when
under attack, making his men sitting ducks while they secure the
road to Dragobilje in central Kosovo, the front line of the last
fighting.
	   ``We missed the opportunity by a few days to complete
everything,'' Baja said matter-of-factly, then pointed out a house
100 meters (yards) away where one of his men died in rebel gunfire
this week.
	   ``It's very difficult to work here under these circumstances.
Sitting here, waiting for them to open fire on us ...'' he said,
then paused. ``It's very difficult.''
	   The agreement was supposed to end the fighting in Kosovo, but
the winding, hilly road from Orlate to Dragobilje clearly was a war
zone Saturday night. Armored police vehicles patrolled darkened,
seemingly empty villages, and journalists with a police escort
drove without lights on under the moonless sky.
	   Much of the world's attention has focused on the Serb offensive
that decimated Albanian villages, sending thousands fleeing into
the hills.
	   With the harsh Balkan winter approaching, European powers and
the United States combined to threaten the NATO airstrikes unless
Milosevic halted the advance, withdrew forces sent into Kosovo in
February and allowed unarmed observers and relief agencies full
access to try to head off a humanitarian crisis.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, however, has rejected the
agreement Milosevic reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
Despite a cease-fire it declared earlier, the KLA appeared to step
up attacks over the weekend, with the Serb Media Center in Pristina
reporting more than a dozen.
	   In Kosovo's propaganda-driven atmosphere, it was impossible to
determine how many of the reports were true. But Associated Press
journalists saw the aftermath of the grenade attack in Orlate, 30
kilometers (18 miles) southwest of Pristina, as they returned from
the police checkpoint at Dragobilje, ten kilometers (six miles) up
the road.
	   The three policemen killed were staying in a two-story house
along the main road, a common practice in areas abandoned by
Albanian residents. The grenade, either tossed or fired from a
shoulder-held launcher, also seriously injured two other policemen.
	   All three of the dead, still in uniform with their rifles in
hand or near their bodies, appeared to have been crouching down as
though under attack. A few full ammunition clips lay near patches
of blood on the floor.
	   ``These latest attacks show that the Albanian terrorists are
trying by all possible means to prevent the realization of the
Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement,'' Serbian local governor Veljko
Odalovic said Sunday. ``This confirms what the international
community has never wanted to admit _ that these bands of
terrorists are not for a peaceful solution.''
	   Baja, speaking before the Orlate attack, said the rebels wanted
to take advantage of Serb withdrawals to start new fighting that
would prompt NATO to launch its threatened airstrikes on Yugoslav
military targets.
	   ``That's what they are trying to do _ use the agreement to open
fire on us,'' he argued. ``They want to provoke us into a response,
and get NATO to attack.''
	   Hydajet Hyseni, a spokesman for the United Democratic Movement,
an ethnic Albanian party that supports the KLA, said Sunday that
any violence was in response to attacks by Serb police.
	   ``There is no real withdrawal of Serb armed forces from Kosovo,
let alone demilitarization of Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Hyseni claimed Serb forces still shell and loot Albanian
villages and kill civilians.
	   ``Sometimes, that seems to provoke a self-defense reaction of
the harassed Albanians and action by KLA units,'' he said.

Thousands rally in Tehran to protest key assembly election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators
rallied in a Tehran park Sunday to protest the rejection of scores
of candidates for the election of a powerful assembly.
	   The Council of Guardians, which is dominated by political
hard-liners, has rejected 214 candidates out of 400 who wanted to
run in Friday's election to the 86-member Assembly of Experts.
	   Many of the disqualified candidates were supporters of President
Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate. Twelve candidates withdrew
their names in protest against the screening.
	   The move by the 12-member Council of Guardians is seen as part
of the struggle between conservatives and reformists in Iran.
	   Khatami went on national television late Saturday to criticize
the selection of the candidates for the assembly, which has the
power to appoint or dismiss Iran's supreme leader.
	   ``There is no doubt that the number of wise and learned scholars
suitable for membership of the Assembly of Experts is greater than
the 400 or so candidates who have registered,'' the president said.
	   In a reference to expectations of a low turnout, Khatami said
that greater variety among the candidates would have increased
public enthusiasm for the polls.
	   Khatami said the council could be criticized for ``not creating
the climate and conditions which would have attracted eligible
individuals to enter the scene.''
	   ``We should not prevent people from criticizing the components
of the system, the institutions, the president, the Council of
Guardians, the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the judiciary,''
Khatami said.
	   The council has rejected criticism, saying its sole criteria for
judging candidates was the law. Candidates have to take a test on
Islamic theology.
	   In Tehran's Laleh Park on Sunday, thousands turned out to hear
Heshmatollah Tabarzadi, a fiery student leader who spoke of the
councilors that vetoed his own candidacy in Friday's polls.
	   ``They have created a situation where a section of society will
not be taking part in the elections because qualified candidates
have been rejected, depriving a section of society from exercising
their rights,'' Tabarzadi said.

Romance vs. Minimalism for Spring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Minimal spare looks, or romantic, fussier styles?
That's the low-key battle on runways as the 1999 spring
ready-to-wear shows wind down.
	   Freak shows shows are out in favor of attracting by plain or
fancy styles.
	   It seems to be a draw.
	   Minimalism is starting to look boring, while romanticism hardly
looks geared for the year 2000, either.
	   On the romantic side, Franck Sorbier's Sunday show sparkled with
sunny and charmingly naive southern French color and details. He
dedicated it to the famous Colombe d'Or hotel-restaurant at St.
Paul de Vence, a painting of the establishment behind the runway.
	   The opulent romance of evening clothes dragged towards the end,
but the result was appealing and fresh, with more than a touch of
star quality - a reminder that Simone de Beauvoir, Yves Montand and
others loved the Colombe d'Or, along with artists like Matisse and
Picasso to Chagall, some of whom paid for their dinners with
paintings that decorated the walls.
	   Artistic references by Sorbier come up in some full skirts with
abstract prints full bloom.
	   More interesting are the pants or long skirt suits in oatmeal
shades with triple eyelet ruffles at cuffs, and hems. Sorbier uses
raffia beautifully in some gold-white or red fitted or full-skirted
country-girl skirts, as the maidens waltzed in carrying flower
baskets.
	   A gold raffia bird-cage A-line number with sun motifs recalled
the height of Paco Rabanne. Some new-look dresses with full skirts
in layers of hot-colored nylon thrilled the audience full of little
girls and Sorbier's friends.
	   The innocence of it all was touching, and the Mediterranean
sunny ideas quite nice. Jeans looks were dressy as if lacquered,
though the almost neon multicolored layering of polyester-nylon is
more cartoon than Riviera painter.
	   But right now, it's somehow hipper and younger to go sparely
minimalist. This is the story for Ines de la Fressange, a former
top model with her own sporty ready-to-wear line for several years
now.
	   She's into all black and white, very high quality but
unpretentious to the point of timidity. The various pullovers,
canvas and cotton pants, leather here and there and several simple
trouser suits, plus knee-length no-nonsense skirts could all drift
nicely into a crowd.
	   A strong point with Fressange is always the wonderful crisp
white poplin shirts in many menswear or more exotic styles - just
as the model-turned-businesswoman now wears them.
	   More minimalism turned up at Daniel Hechter, whose German
designer, Grit Seymour, trained at the famed St. Martin's school in
London, the alma mater of Alexander McQueen, among others.
	   The house is proud of its designer, bringing the ``new trends''
into what was just a practical manufacturing operation started in
1962. But all those unstructured suits, pearly-gray cropped pants,
an even the cobalt blue jersey tops start to become a big bore.
	   Silver jersey, metal-viscose blousons, pants and back-draped
tops can be worn by many who appreciate reachable prices and want
to look part of the fashion scene - however toned-down and
hesitant.
	   Yohji Yamamoto is in a different class. His witty statement was
a kind of showbiz strip-tease, to solve the fancy-or-simple
problem.
	   But it was modest, and fashionable.
	   He had a Victorian or 18th-century style full couture outfit
step out to rip it off, glove, veil, hat and overskirt bit by bit -
not into a g-string, but into a simpler but equally rich gown
underneath, sometimes with bare shoulders, a lace-up bustier, or
the popular dipped decollete backs. As the full crinolines
disappeared for fluid skirts underneath, the message seemed to be
``have fun with your clothes, whether haute couture dies or not.''

Yemeni court sentences three to death for bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three men were sentenced to death Sunday for
a series of bombings in eastern Yemen in 1996 that killed a number
of soldiers, a court official said.
	   Baghash Saeed al-Aghbary, Saeed bin Sulaiman and Mohammed Saleh
Haidarah were found guilty of bombing military posts, forming armed
gangs and working for foreign country, the official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The court also sentenced nine other men to prison terms of six
to 10 years. One defendant was acquitted.
	   The men were arrested in Nov. 1996 and charged with a series of
attacks on military posts during mid-1996 in the eastern province
of Mahara. It is not clear how many soldiers died in the attacks.
	   The death sentences will be submitted to President Ali Abdullah
Saleh for approval.
	   Yemen is still reeling from a 1994 civil war that nearly tore
apart the union reached in 1990 between the conservative north and
the socialist south. The government says subsequent acts of
violence were directed from abroad, but it has not named a country.

Chairman of Spanish Olympic Committee dead at 69
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Carlos Ferrer Salat, chairman of the
Spanish Olympic Committee, died Sunday of a heart attack at the age
of 69.
	   Ferrer died at home in his native Barcelona, his daughter
Beatriz Ferrer told Spanish radio.
	   Ferrer had also been a member of the International Olympic
Committee since 1985. He had directed the Spanish Olympic Committee
since 1987 and played a key role in organizing the 1992 Olympic
Games in Barcelona.
	   Barcelona mayor Joan Clos praised Ferrer for getting civic
groups and businesses involved in the Games, especially a plan
under which private companies financed training of Spanish
athletes.
	   News of his death brought condolences from throughout the
Spanish sports world, from tennis star Arantxa Sanchez Vicario to
former national soccer coach Javier Clemente.
	   ``This is a great loss because he was a key promoter of
strengthening amateur sports,'' Clemente told the state news agency
Efe.

Vandals loot prehistoric cave in southern France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Vandals looted a prehistoric cave Sunday that was
discovered by road workers late last week, making off with a skull,
an axe and pottery believed to be at least 4,000 years old.
	   The thieves penetrated the cave, which had been left unguarded,
through a hole in the side that had been blocked by a large rock,
police said.
	   Local archeologists called the cave an ``exceptional discovery''
after it was discovered Friday by two workers building the new A75
highway in the Languedoc region of southern France.
	   Four human skeletons, three adults and a child who was believed
to be a little girl, were preserved in the cave, as well as cooking
pots, an axe and a vase.
	   Archeologist Christian Olive said he believed was a burial site
that could date back to 2,000 B.C.
	   The area immediately was sealed off and work stopped on that
part of the new highway. But the cave was not guarded.
	   France's most famous prehistoric is Lascaux in the Dordogne
region, where magnificent paintings of animals have been preserved.

Friendship survives O'Meara's 1-up victory over Woods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RECASTS, adds quotes, details throughout &QL;  &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ The much advertised friendship
between Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara is still intact.
	   The two Florida neighbors gave nothing away over 36 holes in
Sunday's World Match Play final. Nothing, that is, until Woods
three-putted from 10-feet (3 meters) on the 34th, giving O'Meara a
one-hole lead he never gave up.
	   O'Meara dropped a tricky 15-foot (5 meters) from just off the
fringe on the 36th for birdie to close out Woods 1-up. Woods,
awaiting his 10-foot (3 meter) putt for birdie, rushed over to hug
O'Meara.
	   ``I hit a good putt, it was rolling and died on the back edge.
What a fitting way to win a golf tournament,'' O'Meara said.
	   ``I relish that putt, to make it when the heats on like that,''
he added.
	   O'Meara picked up 170,000 pounds (dlrs 290,000) and piled yet
another title on his Masters and British Open wins, and Woods
pocketed 90,000 pounds (dlrs 150,000) _ a bit more than they
usually play for in practice back home in Florida.
	   ``To win this after everything that's happened to me with the
Masters and winning the (British) Open, it's just been a dream year
for Mark O'Meara.''
	   Woods, the world's No. 1-ranked player (David Duval is No. 2 and
O'Meara No. 3), seemed more intense than O'Meara, particularly on
the first 18 as he piled up a three-hole lead.
	   ``He's still my friend, no matter what,'' Woods said. ``But
still we're playing competitors and I wanted to win the tournament
as much as he did. I know that, he knows that.''
	   The intensity showed up early on the 11th when Woods didn't
concede an 18-inch putt, which O'Meara made to win the hole.
	   ``You'll give me this hole, won't you?'' O'Meara shouted across
the green. Woods looked sheepishly away and O'Meara replied, ``I'm
gonna remember that next week.''
	   Then, playing to a gallery at a Wentworth Club evenly divided in
their loyalty, he measured it with his putter shaft _ not once but
twice to roaring applause.
	   ``I know he's 22,'' O'Meara said later, ``but I'll have to get
him a little WD40 and loosen him up a little bit out there.''
	   Walking off the 30th tee (par-5, 12th), where O'Meara would
eventually make an eagle to even the match _ knocking a 2-iron 215
yards to two feet (70 cm) and hitting the flagstick _ Woods wrapped
his arms around O'Meara.
	   O'Meara recounted the conversation. ``Whether I win or you win
or whatever,'' Woods said. ``I just want to tell you it's been a
heck of a match. So I'm just proud to be playing with you and
against you.''
	   On a perfect fall day, the two players linked all season as
golf's No. 1 story, showed why. They lagged long putts to a few
inches _ dropped a few en route _ and rapped long and medium irons
just as close.
	   As luck would have it, it was Woods' mistake on the 34th that
cost him. With a chance to take a one-hole lead, Woods instead
three-putted from 10 feet (3 meters) for bogey.
	   O'Meara, meanwhile, scrambled to save par. He hit a half-swing
escape shot from the edge of the woods on his second shot _ into a
greenside bunker. But he chipped out to 10 feet (3 meters) and
dropped the putt.
	   ``I hit a bad putt, I pushed it,'' Woods said. ``And I pushed
the second one coming back.''
	   ``But the ebb and flow was tremendous with four or five
shifts,'' Woods added. ``It's a special thing and it can only
happen when you play 36 holes.''
	   In mounting his comeback, O'Meara birdied four of the first
seven holes on the second 18 _ coupled with Woods' first bogey of
the day _ to take a one-hole lead after 25.
	   After that, the lead changed four times as O'Meara held it last.
	   ``To just keep coming through when you have to, when your back
is against the wall, that's meant a lot to me from a maturity
standpoint this year,'' O'Meara said. `Or to be a little iffy at
times _ like I was today _ and still get the job done.''

German Jewish leader accuses lawyer of misusing Holocaust victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fagan reax &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The leader of Germany's Jewish
community accused a U.S. attorney of hindering talks aimed at
securing compensation for Holocaust victims from German companies.
	   Ignatz Bubis, president of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, said in Monday's Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper that
lawyer Ed Fagan was using Nazi victims for his own financial gain.
	   ``Fagan doesn't want anything more than to earn a lot of
money,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
	   Fagan has been the lead attorney in several lawsuits filed in
New York on behalf of Holocaust victims. He is seeking compensation
from German banks that handled assets of Holocaust victims, as well
as companies that used slave labor during World War II.
	   Bubis said he believed ``the companies would quickly reach an
agreement with the World Jewish Congress'' if they weren't facing
legal action from Fagan and other attorneys.
	   An advance copy of the interview was released Sunday.
	   In New York, Fagan said his lawsuits were responsible for
forcing institutions to finally address the issue of money owed to
Holocaust survivors.
	   ``What Bubis and the organizations are worried about is being
exposed for their failure to do anything for the last 10 to 50
years,'' he said.
	   He also said Bubis and leaders of other Jewish organizations had
rebuffed overtures to work with him or to meet with the survivors
he represents.
	   Fagan also again denied charges by Bubis and others that he had
demanded a dlrs 250 million fee from the World Jewish Restitution
Organization, which recently came to a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement
with Swiss banks for compensation to Holocaust survivors and heirs.
	   Fagan, who initiated the action against Swiss banks two years
ago, said he is willing to accept whatever fee is deemed
appropriate by a court.
	   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
said Sunday his group believed lawyers should not receive any fees
for working on Holocaust-related cases.
	   ``Neither lawyers nor anyone else should be making a profit from
the Holocaust,'' he said in New York.
	   The World Jewish Restitution Organization is a branch of the
World Jewish Congress.

Vatican foreign minister holds talks with Egyptian counterpart
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes after meeting Egyptian minister

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ There will be no lasting peace in the Middle
East until the status of Jerusalem is decided, the Vatican's
foreign minister, Monsignor Jean Louis Tauran, said Sunday.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, Tauran said the peace process cannot remain stalled as the
people of the region, especially the Palestinians, were suffering.
	   Tauran's meeting with Mubarak and, later, with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa came as U.S. President Bill Clinton tried to
advance Israeli-Palestinian negotiations at a special summit
outside Washington.
	   ``The peace to which the people of the region are aspiring
cannot be realistically achieved if (they) are not convinced of
it,'' Tauran said after his talks with Moussa.
	   It ``is not possible to achieve security (for one party) at the
expense of the other,'' Egypt's official Middle East News Agency
quoted him as saying.
	   Tauran reiterated the Vatican's position that Jerusalem _ a city
revered by Muslims, Jews and Christians _ should be open to all
faiths and not just ``to one side.''
	   The Vatican has ``grave concerns over what is happening to
Jerusalem,'' MENA reported Tauran as saying.
	   ``We see the city exposed to change day after day, and I believe
that the international community ... must work to preserve the
sanctity and uniqueness of this city.''
	   Christians and Muslims have long charged that Israeli control of
the city has put limits on the ability of Christians and Muslims to
worship freely at their holy sites.
	   The Palestinians want Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of
their would-be state. But Israel, which captured the Arab sector in
the 1967 Middle East War and later annexed it, has rejected this.
	   After his meeting with Mubarak, Tauran met Mohammed Sayed
el-Tantawi, the head of Al-Azhar, the leading religious institution
in the Sunni Muslim world.

 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ A partial West Bank agreement is
likely to emerge from the Mideast summit talks President Bill
Clinton is hosting, but completion of a full accord would probably
take several weeks, diplomatic sources said Sunday.
	   Clinton prepared to return here for a third day of U.S.
mediation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, this time with Vice President Al
Gore at his side.
	   ``There's important work being done here,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters after Clinton and Gore
arrived on separate helicopters _ and steered clear of the news
media.
	   Palestinian sources told The Associated Press the talks ``have
become very difficult,'' particularly on whether another Israeli
pullback on the West Bank would follow the one being negotiated and
on Israel's demand that terrorism suspects be extradited to Israel
for trial.
	   However, the sources, insisting on anonymity, said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and Danny Naveh,
the Israeli Cabinet secretary, were working on drafts of other
provisions.
	   Also, the sources said, CIA director George Tenet had a long
meeting Saturday with Muhammed Dahlan, Palestinian security chief,
and their ideas would be presented Sunday to the Israelis.
	   James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, reiterated that
``our goal continues to be to do all the work that needs to be done
by today,'' the unofficial deadline for an agreement. Clinton
reportedly wants a signing ceremony on Monday.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Carlos Ferrer Salat, chairman of the
Spanish Olympic Committee, died Sunday of a heart attack at the age
of 69.
	   Ferrer died at home in his native Barcelona, his daughter
Beatriz Ferrer told Spanish radio.
	   Ferrer had also been a member of the International Olympic
Committee since 1985. He had directed the Spanish Olympic Committee
since 1987 and played a key role in organizing the 1992 Olympic
Games in Barcelona.
	   Barcelona mayor Joan Clos praised Ferrer for getting civic
groups and businesses involved in the Games, especially a plan
under which private sector companies financed training of Spanish
athletes.
	   News of his death brought condolences from throughout the
Spanish sports world, from tennis star Arantxa Sanchez Vicario to
former national soccer coach Javier Clemente.
	   ``This is a great loss because he was a key promoter of
strengthening amateur sports,'' Clemente told the state news agency
Efe.

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Voters in Macedonia were deciding
Sunday whether to confirm in office the politicians who lead them
out of former Yugoslavia peacefully or opt for a change promised by
a team of younger politicians.
	   Thirty-eight parties, including the ruling coalition of the
Social Democratic Alliance and their allies, all have promised a
better future, concentrating their election campaigns on
Macedonia's growing economic woes.
	   Only minor irregularities were reported at the polls by Sunday
afternoon. Election officials said some 18 percent of Macedonia's
1,5 million voters turned up at the polling stations by 2 p.m.
local time (noon GMT) for the first round of voting.
	   Under a complicated voting system, only about one third of the
120 seats in parliament will be awarded after Sunday's voting to
contesting parties and their candidates. The rest will be
determined in a second round of voting on Nov. 1.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ At least 40 people were killed Sunday when a
train jumped its tracks in Egypt's Nile Delta and plowed into
nearby houses, police officials said.
	   About 200 people were injured and more deaths are expected,
police officials said.
	   It was not immediately clear how many people were on board the
train, but such trains are usually packed with hundreds of
commuters.
	   The train was traveling from the port of Alexandria to Kafr
el-Sheik when it crashed in the town of Kafr el-Dawar, about 30
kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Alexandria, the officials
said.

the Middle East until the status of Jerusalem was decided.
	   He also told reporters after a meeting with President Hosni

Britain dismisses Chile protests at arrest of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add comments from Chilean foreign minister in grafs
15-16 that if matter proceeds to British courts, Pinochet's family
must pursue &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dismissing Chile's protest over the arrest in
London of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a Cabinet minister said Sunday
most Britons would find it ``gut-wrenching'' to give diplomatic
immunity to the Chilean former dictator.
	   Chanting demonstrators, delighted at the move, gathered outside
the private clinic in London where the 82-year-old Pinochet is
presumed still to be a patient. He has been under police guard
since his arrest Friday _ in response to a Spanish extradition
request _ for questioning about allegations of murder in the first
decade after he seized power in 1973.
	   Pinochet has been a regular visitor to Britain, generally
without publicity. His arrest this time appeared partly to reflect
a tougher attitude toward right-wing dictators by Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Labor Party government which replaced a Conservative
Party administration 18 months ago.
	   ``The idea that such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be
claiming diplomatic immunity I think for most people in this
country would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff,'' Trade Secretary
Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television
interview.
	   However, Michael Howard, a Conservative Party spokesman and
former Cabinet minister, said he was concerned that Pinochet was
arrested because of pressure from Labor lawmakers and lobby groups.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro, attending a meeting in Oporto,
Portugal, described the arrest as ``universal meddling.''
	   In London, police mounted guard outside a hospital called the
London Clinic. Pinochet's spokesman in Chile, Fernando Martinez,
said Pinochet was in hospital when police came to arrest him. He
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a spinal disorder.
	   ``Gen. Pinochet has committed crimes humanity _ many atrocities,
torture, murder,'' Vincete Allegria, an exile who fled Pinochet's
regime, told reporters outside the clinic.
	   Under extradition laws, Spain has 40 days from last Friday to
lodge a formal request for extradition. The final decision lies
with Home Secretary Jack Straw.
	   There was no immediate word on when Pinochet would be
questioned. But police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said questioning was not expected for a week or two.
	   Relations between Britain and Chile immediately soured, with
Chile maintaining that Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic
immunity.
	   Home Office Minister Alun Michael acknowledged Sunday that
Pinochet had entered Britain on a diplomatic passport, but added,
``That does no necessarily convey diplomatic immunity.''
	   ``He would have provided evidence of coming for medical
treatment, and there's no reason for the immigration authorities to
stop him at that stage,'' Michael said in a BBC radio interview.
	   The Foreign Office said only government officials visiting on
official business and accredited diplomats have diplomatic
immunity.
	   Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said Chile would
continue to protest Pinochet's arrest, but only through diplomatic
means.
	   If the British government definitely rejects Chilean claims that
Pinochet has immunity, then a legal defense may be needed, and that
would be up to Pinochet's family, Insulza said.

Britain begins trade mission to Bucharest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British trade mission left for Bucharest on
Sunday to expand business ties between the two countries, which
Britain said could boost Romania's chances of joining the European
Union.
	   Kim Howells, a minister in the Department of Trade and Industry,
is leading representatives of 17 businesses on the six-day visit.
	   He said Romania, with a potential market of 22 million people,
was becoming increasingly important to British business. In the
past five years, British exports to the Eastern European country
have more than doubled.
	   ''This growth in trade is something (we) are determined to see
continue,'' Howells said, adding that it would help bring Romania
into the EU.
	   To become an EU member, countries must adopt the entire spectrum
of EU rules, regulations and laws. These cover 31 chapters _ from
agriculture, energy, foreign affairs and monetary union to
corporate and banking laws, consumer health protection and
telecommunications standards and practices.
	   ''It is in Britain's own interest to get Romania into the EU,''
he said.

Three Palestinians wounded trying to avoid Israeli roadblock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops shot and wounded three
passengers in a vanload of Palestinian laborers who had skirted a
West Bank roadblock Sunday, the Palestinian driver of the van said.
	   The army did not immediately return a call requesting
confirmation and comment.
	   The incident took place near the Palestinian village of
Dahariya, south of the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Israeli troops began to follow the van after noticing it driving
along bumpy backroads. The van's driver, Abdallah Abu Shaz, said
Israel's border police signalled for him to stop and fired four
bullets into one side of the vehicle when he refused.
	   Abu Shaz said he was bringing back a group of Palestinian
workers from the Israeli city of Beersheva and took the backroads
in order to avoid the Israeli checkpoint.
	   Two of the passengers were lightly wounded from the bullets and
a third was injured from broken glass, doctors at Hebron's Alya
hospital said.
	   Only a limited number of some 2 million Palestinians have been
issued permits to work inside Israel, and each day thousands use
backroads and avoid checkpoints in order to reach menial day jobs.

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Voters in Macedonia were deciding
Sunday whether to re-elect the politicians who lead them out of
former Yugoslavia peacefully or opt for a change promised by a team
of younger politicians.
	   Thirty-eight parties, including the ruling coalition of the
Social Democratic Alliance and their allies, all have promised a
better future, concentrating their election campaigns on
Macedonia's growing economic woes.
	   Only minor irregularities were reported at the polls by Sunday
afternoon. Election officials said some 18 percent of Macedonia's
1,5 million voters turned up at the polling stations by 2 p.m.
local time (noon GMT) for the first round of voting.
	   Under a complicated voting system, only about one third of the
120 seats in parliament will be awarded after Sunday's voting to
contesting parties and their candidates. The rest will be
determined in a second round of voting on Nov. 1.

Ajax finds scoring touch; PSV comes back to draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax looked its old self again
Sunday, elegantly strolling to a 5-0 win over FC Twente, but PSV
Eindhoven had to be grateful for a 2-2 draw with NEC Nijmegen.
	   Ajax (5-2-2) leaped to fourth on 17 points while PSV (3-2-3) is
down in ninth on 11 points. Unbeaten Feyenoord still leads the
league with 20.
	   Ajax's early nerves were quieted by an Andrzej Rudy thunderbolt
on 13 minutes after Peter Hoekstra's low cross snaked back to the
Pole waiting on the edge of the area.
	   Just six minutes later, Andre Karnebeek was caught clinging on
to Arveladze's shirt as the Georgian turned in the box.
	   Litmanen thumped the penalty against the post but Richard
Witschge snapped up the rebound.
	   Half the Ajax team are dead-ball specialists, and it showed as
Litmanen's right foot and Frank de Boer's left stroked home free
kicks either side of half time.
	   Ajax brought on three substitutes and started to sit back,
thinking of Wednesday's trip to Greece for the Champions League
clash with Olympiakos.
	   But there was still time for Brazilian Wamberto's debut goal for
Ajax. His assured finish made it 5-0 after Twente captain Jan van
Halst accidentally set him up.
	   The game was played on the Ajax Arena's seventh newly-laid grass
pitch since its opening over two years ago.
	   Earlier in the afternoon PSV was saved from its fourth defeat of
the season by the 57th-minute sending off of NEC's Bart Latuheru
for upending Gilles de Bilde.
	   Up till then NEC's domination had produced a 2-0 lead with two
goals from the red-hot Maikel Renfurm, the first off the rebound
from a Luuk Maes free kick, the second a fine solo effort.
	   But with eleven against ten, the tide turned for PSV and
sharp-shooting from Ruud van Nistelrooy and Luc Nilis salvaged a
point.
	   Sunday's other fixture was a goalless draw between De Graafschap
Doetinchem and FC Utrecht.

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Florence's Academy Gallery, home to
Michelangelo's sculpture ``David,'' shut its doors for an hour
Sunday so firefighters and police could protect works of art from
heavy rain, which seeped into the building.
	   Some flooding was reported in the city after intense rain came
down for 40 minutes.
	   The art was moved to safe areas, and no damage was reported, the
Italian news agency ANSA reported. The water seeped into the
building in an area away from the sculpture.
	   In 1966, floodwaters damaged many paintings and other pieces of
art in the city.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ At least 40 people were killed Sunday when a
train jumped its tracks in Egypt's Nile Delta and plowed into
nearby houses, police officials said.
	   About 200 people were injured and more deaths are expected,
police officials said.
	   It was not immediately clear how many people were on board the
train, but such trains are usually packed with hundreds of
commuters.
	   The train was traveling from the port of Alexandria to Kafr
el-Sheik when it crashed in the town of Kafr el-Dawar, about 30
kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Alexandria, the officials
said.
	   The train went off the tracks when the driver turned into a
siding, the officials said speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Four of the passenger cars overturned, crashing into nearby
homes, the officials said.
	   It was not immediately clear why the driver took the wrong line.
	   Egypt's official Middle East News Agency said the driver could
not stop the train because free-riding passengers had tampered with
the brakes system between the cars.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam heard of the accident in Cairo and
went immediately to the site with a team of doctors, officials
said.

Three minor league games marred by police-fan clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police and hooligans clashed at three Italian minor
league soccer matches Sunday, resulting in injuries.
	   At Varese, eight officers and three supporters of the home team
were hurt during an hour of unrest outside the stadium after Varese
and Como played a 0-0 draw in Serie C.
	   Police used tear gas in efforts to prevent rival fans from
battling, and about 15 people were taken to police headquarters.
	   At Cosenza, local fans threw rocks and other objects at police
who were blocking their path to the section holding visiting fans.
Three officers were injured and one person was detained. The
violence started right after the final whistle of Cosenza's 1-0
loss to Verona in Serie B.
	   At Mantova, one fan required stitches and three people
identified as local hooligans were charged for their involvement in
scuffles inside and outside the stadium as Mantova and Viareggio
drew 0-0 in Serie C.

Lebed's brother considering presidential bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The younger brother of prominent governor
Alexander Lebed is considering running in Russia's presidential
elections in 2000, a news report said Sunday.
	   Both brothers head neighboring regions in Siberia. Alexei Lebed
was elected governor of Khakassia in 1996, while his older brother
won the gubernatorial race in the vast Krasnoyarsk region this
year.
	   Alexander Lebed came in third in the 1996 presidential election
and is considered a top contender in the next race, though he has
been coy about whether he will run.
	   Alexei Lebed told the Interfax news agency he was considering a
presidential run but hadn't made up his mind.
	   ``There's still a lot of time before 2000, and I have time to
think things over,'' he said.
	   Besides those who have already indicated they would run in the
presidential race, Lebed said he expected some strong new
candidates ``whose potential shouldn't be underestimated.''
	   Responding to the report on the Russian news program Itogi on
Sunday night, Alexander Lebed said, ``My brother has a good sense
of humor.'' He did not elaborate.
	   In the heat of Alexander Lebed's gubernatorial campaign in
Krasnoyarsk, a rumor circulated that the Lebed brothers were
planning to create an independent Siberian republic and secede from
Russia.
	   Both brothers are former paratroop officers.

Russians assign 200 to observer mission in Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 10-11 with lawmaker warning against
Kosovo independence. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia started assigning 200 observers Sunday to
an international monitoring force overseeing a peace plan to avert
NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, a lawmaker said.
	   Sergei Baburin, hard-line vice speaker of the lower house of
Russia's parliament, made his comments Sunday after leading a
Russian delegation to Yugoslavia to discuss the Kosovo conflict,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Russia shares Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian religion
with Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, and strongly
opposes NATO's proposed airstrikes.
	   The 2,000-strong monitoring force, part of a peace deal reached
last week, is to verify that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
pulls his troops from Kosovo.
	   The Russian-Serb Friendship Fraternity rallied outside the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow on Sunday protesting NATO's potential strikes.
The group urged the Russian government ``to more decisively stand
for the interests of fraternal Serbia,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   A leading liberal lawmaker in the Russian delegation to
Belgrade, Vladimir Lukin, joined calls for supporting the Serbs on
Sunday.
	   ``We should be with old traditional friends at difficult
times,'' ITAR-Tass quoted Lukin as saying in Belgrade. Lukin chairs
the parliament's foreign affairs committee and is a member of the
Yabloko party.
	   He was more cautious about the peace deal than other Russian
politicians, who have claimed credit for bringing about peace
agreement and have sounded confident that it will hold.
	   ``The situation is somewhat euphoric .... However, conflicts
still may break up, and preparations should be made for them,''
Lukin said.
	   The deputy chair of the parliament's defense committee, Alexei
Arbatov, predicted that NATO airstrikes would lead to independence
for the separatists in Kosovo, where Muslim Albanians make up the
majority.
	   ``The West should take off its anti-Serb blinkers. If Kosovo
becomes an independent Muslim quasi-state, that will boomerang
across all Europe,'' ITAR-Tass quoted Arbatov as saying.
	   Meanwhile, a Belarusian nationalist party has recruited at least
300 people to fight alongside the Serbs in case NATO strikes,
prompting a reprimand from the justice ministry.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party's recruiting activities violate
Belarus' constitution, chief justice ministry spokesman Vladimir
Matveyev said Sunday. The party is linked to Russian
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who leads a Russian party of
the same name.
	   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has promised to help
Serbia with weapons if NATO proceeds with airstrikes, but not
troops.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A pipeline explosion spilled oil down on
a hamlet early Sunday and fire raced through the village of wooden
houses with straw roofs, killing at least 43 people and injuring
63, authorities said. Leftist rebels were suspected in the blast.
	   ``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And no one
knows exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert
Valencia in Segovia, the largest town near Machuca, a village of
gold miners bordering the pipeline. ``People were asleep at the
time and the fire spread quickly.''
	   The pipeline was on a rise just above the hamlet, according to
Valencia. Most of the victims were women and young children, 34 of
whom were burned alive, said Guillermo Franco, the Antioquia state
health director. He told The Associated Press from the state
capital of Medellin that the rest died in hospitals.
	   ``There was a huge explosion and afterward a ball of flame
erupted, according to survivors,'' said Gen. Alfredo Salgado,
operations director of the national police.
	   Valencia said by telephone that the explosion occurred at 2:45
a.m. in the village 300 kilometers (180 miles) north of Bogota, and
that many of the victims were trapped by the flames. Many of the
injured, rushed to more than a half dozen hospitals, had
third-degree burns.
	   Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said leftist rebels, who
frequently sabotage Colombia's oil pipelines, were suspected.
	   ``The chances that it was a terrorist attack are stronger than
the chances it was accident,'' he told the Radionet network.
	   ``The people in the area say it was the ELN,'' said Valencia,
referring to the National Liberation Army, which operates in the
area and is blamed for most oil pipeline attacks. There was no
immediate comment from the rebel group.
	   Machuca, which had about 150 residents, was largely burned to
the ground, Valencia said.
	   The damaged Colombia Central pipeline, a periodic target of ELN
sabotage operated by the state-owned Ecopetrol oil company,
transports 100,000 barrels of crude daily, most of it from the
Cusiana oil field in east-central Colombia to the Covenas terminal
on the Caribbean. The blast halted pumping on the pipeline.

Conservatives win big cities in mayoral races

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Conservatives won two key mayoral races
Sunday to add to the voter backlash against Premier Costas Simitis'
Socialist government, according to exit poll results from the final
round of nationwide municipal elections.
	   The wins by the opposition New Democracy-backed candidates in
the northern city of Salonica and the busy port of Piraeus in the
run-off ballots give Simitis opponents control of city hall in
three of Greece's key cities. In the first-round elections Oct. 11,
Athens' conservative mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos won re-election by
a wide margin.
	   Some analysts considered the gains by conservatives a sign of
public discontent to the government's austerity measures aimed at
qualifying Greece for the European Union's single currency group by
2001. But the government has insisted it will not change its
policies, which include aggressive privatization plans and efforts
to trim Greece's vast public payroll.
	   The New Democracy party retained control of Salonica with the
election of former sports minister Vassilis Papagiorgopoulos. In
Piraeus, Greece's main port, conservative Christos Agrapidis
toppled the candidate backed by the traditionally dominant
Socialists, according to polls carried by private and state
broadcasters.
	   Final results were expected Monday.
	   With general elections two years away, the municipal vote
appeared to erode some of the Socialists' political dominance. The
Socialists have led Greece for all but three of the past 17 years.
	   Former Premier Constantine Mitsotakis, the leader emeritus of
New Democracy, believed voters were punishing the government for
moving too slowly on reforms to reshape Greece's economy to keep
pace with the rest of the EU.
	   ``But these promises have not materialized,'' said Mitsotakis.
	   The Socialists also looked likely to lose the prestigious race
for regional governor, or prefect, of Athens and Piraeus. But the
governing party appeared to retain its grip in other regions and
big towns.
	   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas rejected claims that the
Socialists losses represented a blow to the drive by the EU's
poorest nation to join the single currency group.
	   ``I think we are within our targets to join the (single
currency),'' said Reppas. ``What we must do is deal more
effectively with people's everyday problems.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb armored battle group moved
out of its barracks in Pristina Sunday and headed westward down the
main highway through central Kosovo, possibly to head off further
attacks by ethnic Albanian guerrillas, western sources reported.
	   The column of tanks , armored personnel carriers and trucks
traveled through the Komorane police checkpoint, about 20
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina, the provincial capital,
said the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified.
	   Their ultimate destination was not known but observers
speculated it was in response to recent attacks on police by the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army,
	   The exact number of troops on the move was not known, but they
came from the brigade normally stationed in Pristina.
	   The military movement comes on the heels of a new wave of
violence in the province and the same day the vanguard of what will
be 2,000 unarmed international ``compliance verifiers'' arrived in
Kosovo.

Ajax finds scoring touch; PSV comes back to draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS first names for Arveladze, Litmanen in grafs 4 and 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax looked its old self again
Sunday, elegantly strolling to a 5-0 win over FC Twente, but PSV
Eindhoven had to be grateful for a 2-2 draw with NEC Nijmegen.
	   Ajax (5-2-2) leaped to fourth on 17 points while PSV (3-2-3) is
down in ninth on 11 points. Unbeaten Feyenoord still leads the
league with 20.
	   Ajax's early nerves were quieted by an Andrzej Rudy thunderbolt
on 13 minutes after Peter Hoekstra's low cross snaked back to the
Pole waiting on the edge of the area.
	   Just six minutes later, Andre Karnebeek was caught clinging on
to Shota Arveladze's shirt as the Georgian turned in the box.
	   Jari Litmanen thumped the penalty against the post but Richard
Witschge snapped up the rebound.
	   Half the Ajax team are dead-ball specialists, and it showed as
Litmanen's right foot and Frank de Boer's left stroked home free
kicks either side of half time.
	   Ajax brought on three substitutes and started to sit back,
thinking of Wednesday's trip to Greece for the Champions League
clash with Olympiakos.
	   But there was still time for Brazilian Wamberto's debut goal for
Ajax. His assured finish made it 5-0 after Twente captain Jan van
Halst accidentally set him up.
	   The game was played on the Ajax Arena's seventh newly-laid grass
pitch since its opening over two years ago.
	   Earlier in the afternoon PSV was saved from its fourth defeat of
the season by the 57th-minute sending off of NEC's Bart Latuheru
for upending Gilles de Bilde.
	   Up till then NEC's domination had produced a 2-0 lead with two
goals from the red-hot Maikel Renfurm, the first off the rebound
from a Luuk Maes free kick, the second a fine solo effort.
	   But with eleven against ten, the tide turned for PSV and
sharp-shooting from Ruud van Nistelrooy and Luc Nilis salvaged a
point.
	   Sunday's other fixture was a goalless draw between De Graafschap
Doetinchem and FC Utrecht.

Syria to hold parliamentary election on Nov. 30
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ President Hafez Assad announced Sunday
that Syria's parliamentary elections will be held on Nov. 30, the
official Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
	   The polls are expected to be won by the National Progressive
Front, a coalition of seven parties led by the Baath Party which
has ruled Syria since 1963.
	   By the socialist-oriented constitution, 51 percent of the
250-seat People's Assembly is reserved for legislators from the
working class.
	   Parliamentary elections are held every four years. The outgoing
parliament finished its term on Aug. 9.
	   The assembly has some legislative power, but effective control
is held by the president. Assad came to power in a military coup in
1970.

Three Palestinians wounded trying to avoid Israeli roadblock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops shot and wounded three
passengers in a vanload of Palestinian laborers who had skirted a
West Bank roadblock Sunday, the Palestinian driver of the van said.
	   The army did not immediately return a call seeking comment on
the incident.
	   The incident took place near the Palestinian village of
Dahariya, south of the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Israeli troops began to follow the van after noticing it driving
along bumpy backroads. The van's driver, Abdallah Abu Shaz, said
Israel's border police signaled for him to stop and fired four
bullets into one side of the vehicle when he refused.
	   Abu Shaz said he was bringing back a group of Palestinian
workers from the Israeli city of Beersheva and took the backroads
to avoid the Israeli checkpoint.
	   Two of the passengers were lightly wounded from the bullets, and
a third was injured from broken glass, doctors at Hebron's Alya
hospital said.
	   Only a limited number of some 2 million Palestinians have been
issued permits to work inside Israel. Thousands use backroads each
day to avoid checkpoints to reach menial day jobs.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serb armored battle group moving westward through
central Kosovo, apparently in response to rebel attacks. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As a group of international
observers arrived in Kosovo to oversee the withdrawal of Serb
forces, an armored battle group moved out of its barracks and down
a main highway in an apparent move against ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, western sources said.
	   The column of Serb tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks
traveled through the Komorane police checkpoint, about 20
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina, the provincial capital, the
sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   Their ultimate destination was not known, but sources said it
appeared to be in response to recent attacks on police by the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. The exact number of troops on the move was
not known.
	   The deployment follows a new wave of violence in the province,
and came on the same day the first of an expected 2,000
international observers arrived in Kosovo. The observers are to
monitor the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, as agreed to
last week by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke.
	   Kosovo is a predominantly Albanian province of Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia. Hundreds of people have died in a
Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants that began in February.
	   Three Serb policemen died and three others were badly wounded by
a grenade at a police outpost in the town of Orlate, 30 kilometers
(20 miles) southwest of Pristina, where police have long complained
of frequent attacks by ethnic Albanians. An AP reporter verified
the Orlate clash. The Serb-run Kosovo Media Center in Pristina
reported a dozen other attacks around the province.
	   Serb officials have blamed the stepped up violence on the Kosovo
Liberation Army, loosely organized bands of ethnic Albanian
guerrillas still operating in wide areas of this poor southern
province.
	   ``These latest attacks show that the Albanian terrorists are
trying by all possible means to prevent the realization of the ...
agreement,'' said Veljko Odalovic, the head of Kosovo's regional
government.
	   Hydajet Hyseni, spokesman for the United Democratic Movement,
which supports the KLA, accused the police of attacking the
``innocent Albanian population,'' and said the KLA fired back in
self-defense.
	   ``There is no real withdrawal of Serb armed forces from Kosovo,
let alone demilitarization of Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Odalovic, however, said there was no doubt the Albanians were
responsible.
	   ``This confirms what the international community has never
wanted to admit, that these bands of terrorists are not in favor of
a peaceful solution to the problem and are trying to take advantage
of the withdrawal of police and military forces from Kosovo.''
	   During the Serb crackdown, an estimated 300,000 people, mostly
ethnic Albanians, have been driven from their homes. Many of them
have been afraid to return because of the continuing presence of
Serb police.
	   The United States and NATO have reported significant pullbacks
by Yugoslav forces in recent days but say numbers still exceed the
level required by the Belgrade agreement. NATO plans for air
attacks on Yugoslavia remained on hold as the North Atlantic
Council, NATO's top policymaking body, extended the deadline for
compliance from last Saturday to Oct. 27.
	   As the violence escalated, an advance team from the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe arrived in Pristina. The
OSCE has been charged with the responsibility of verifying that
Milosevic sticks to the promises he made in the agreement with
Holbrooke.
	   Principal among the demands is that he decrease the number of
troops and police to levels before the February crackdown. So far,
nobody has specified exactly what those levels are.
	   ``We will bring as many people in as quickly as possible, as the
infrastructure permits,'' said John Sandrock, an American who heads
the Vienna-based OSCE's mission support section. ``I don't want to
give you any numbers, or any deadlines or any times, but we will
respond to this issue as quickly as we can.''
	   Asked if he thought the mission could curb the violence, he
said: ``We hope that the overall presence of the OSCE can act in a
stabilizing fashion and hopefully we'll resolve many of the issues.
Ours is a technical mission. We are kind of an advance guard to try
and assess where we will go from here.''
	   He said the OSCE mission had a one-year mandate, which could be
extended.

Tyson, like a politician, is in search of votes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ All Mike Tyson needs is a measly three votes.
	   Three votes that will allow him to return to the sport he once
dominated. Three votes that will make him rich again.
	   Three votes that no one is quite sure he has.
	   ``I don't know, but I'm hopeful,'' Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel
said. ``I think our chances are better than they were before.''
	   Tyson again goes before Nevada boxing authorities Monday to try
and convince a majority of the five-member state athletic
commission that he has paid his price for biting Evander
Holyfield's ears and deserves a chance to fight again.
	   He comes armed with a psychological report that says he is
mentally fit to pound on people to make a living. He comes
contrite, eager to do whatever is necessary to convince at least
three commissioners that he should get another boxing license.
	   But he also comes with questions about a Maryland traffic
altercation still hanging over his head _ questions that he refused
to answer in his first Nevada hearing a month ago; questions that
will have to be answered if he is going to fight again.
	   ``I want to hear about Maryland directly from Mike,''
commissioner Luther Mack said. ``That is going to be the test. Mike
is going to have to explain what happened there and explain it in
his own words.''
	   A month to the day after he sat through a six-hour hearing that
ended with commissioners ordering him to undergo psychological
tests, Tyson goes back before the commission Monday with a decision
expected before the end of the day.
	   In a risky gamble, Tyson's advisers pushed for the earliest
possible hearing so that Tyson could fight before the end of the
year, probably Dec. 5 at the MGM Grand hotel-casino in Las Vegas.
	   If the gamble fails, he will be banned from the sport for at
least another year _ a crippling blow for a 32-year-old heavyweight
who owes the Internal Revenue Service dlrs 13 million in unpaid
taxes despite having made more than dlrs 100 million in purses
since his release from prison in 1995.
	   While his advisers are hopeful, Tyson isn't.
	   ``I don't think they are going to give me back my license,''
Tyson said after a workout last week in Phoenix. ``I'm not sure of
anything, especially anything nice happening to me.''
	   Tyson appears to have support from at least two of the
commissioners, and his advisers privately say they believe they can
pick up at least one more vote if Tyson is able to explain why he
allegedly punched and kicked two men following a traffic accident
Aug. 31 in Maryland.
	   Last-minute talks continued over the weekend with attorneys
representing the two men in hopes of reaching a civil settlement in
the case that likely would gut any criminal charges.
	   ``It's 50-50 that they settle,'' Tyson spokesman Peter Seligman
said. ``It's like Russian roulette. You put a number out there and
if it's enough, it's enough. If not, you don't settle.''
	   Tyson was to have undergone trial Monday on criminal charges in
the case, but they were postponed until Dec. 1 at the request of
his attorneys.
	   If a settlement isn't reached before Monday's meeting, Tyson's
advisers are hoping that Tyson can proclaim his innocence and be
given a license with the understanding that it would be stripped
from him if he were convicted of the charges.
	   There's even more at stake for Tyson in the matter. He is still
on probation for his rape conviction, and could be sent back to
prison if convicted.
	   ``The bigger problem is he'll go to jail,'' Seligman said.
``Then none of this matters.''
	   Tyson and his advisers left a Sept. 19 meeting before the
commission convinced that only a positive report from a panel of
doctors was enough to get him a new license. He got that report
last week, being declared mentally fit despite suffering from a
variety of psychological problems.
	   But in the days following the hearing, the positions of a few of
the five commissioners hardened as they grew increasingly angry
over Tyson's refusal to answer questions about what happened in
Maryland. This week, Mack said he was also unhappy over the casual
way Tyson dressed for the first hearing and concerned that he threw
his helmet to the ground in disgust when his motorcycle wouldn't
start following the hearing.
	   Tyson's supporters contend the former heavyweight champion
should be presumed innocent until proven guilty in Maryland. They
point to the fact that the same commission _ which has three of the
same members _ sanctioned a Tyson fight against Holyfield despite
the fact Tyson was then under indictment on felony rape charges.
	   That fight never came off at the time because Tyson was injured
in training.

Moeller free kick leads rising Dortmund past Rostock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Borussia Dortmund, appearing to be on the way back
up, beat Hansa Rostock 2-0 Sunday in the Bundesliga behind Andreas
Moeller's booming free kick.
	   Moeller, hoping to regain his spot on the German national team,
was the centerpiece of Dortmund's victory, capped by the goal he
unleashed from 25 meters (25 yards) in the 24th minute.
	   Dortmund, rebuilding this year, seems to have jelled with
another strong performance. After a slow season start, the former
Champions Cup winner has now climbed to eighth.
	   Dortmund squandered numerous chances in a one-sided match before
a former Rostock player, Sergei Barbarez, finally sealed the
victory with his goal in the 83rd minute.
	   Rostock, which has yet to win an away match this season, was
under pressure the entire match. Its national team defender Marco
Rehmer had to clear from the line twice, avoiding an own goal when
his kick bounced off the post and back into play.
	   Dortmund appeared, until recently, to be in an endless downward
spiral since capturing Europe's most prestigious club competition
two years.
	   The hero of that 3-1 win against Juventus Turin, Lars Ricken,
also provided some more good news for the club. The 22-year-old
midfielder resigned until 2003.
	   Dortmund showed that it had regained some of its prowress when
it battled Bayern Munich to a 1-1 draw in its last outing _ the
only blemish on Munich's record in the Bundesliga this season.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was not a good day for the state of Virginia.
	   Virginia and Virginia Tech lost for the first time this season,
and both took big falls in The Associated Press' Top 25 college
football poll.
	   The Cavaliers, 5-1 after a 41-38 loss to Georgia Tech on
Saturday, tumbled nine places to No. 16, while the Hokies (5-1)
also dropped nine spots to No. 23 following a shocking 28-22 loss
to Temple.
	   The top six teams remained the same Sunday, with No. 1 Ohio
State (6-0) receiving 64 of 70 first-place votes and 1,743 points
from the sportswriters and broadcasters on the AP panel. The
Buckeyes beat Minnesota 45-15.
	   UCLA (5-0), a 41-38 overtime winner over Oregon, was No. 2 with
one first-place vote and 1,674 points, followed by No. 3 Tennessee,

first-place votes and 1,558 points after its 52-20 win over
Oklahoma State.
	   Nebraska (6-1) got back on the winning track with a 41-0 victory
over Kansas and moved up a notch to No. 7, followed by No. 8 Texas
A and M, No. 9 Wisconsin and No. 10 Penn State. The Aggies, who
beat Baylor 35-14, and Nittany Lions, 34-13 winners over Purdue,
each improved two spots.
	   Georgia, which beat Vanderbilt 31-6, moved up two places to No.
11, followed by No. 12 Oregon, No. 13 West Virginia, No. 14 Arizona
, No. 15 Arkansas, No. 16 Virginia, No. 17 Colorado, No. 18 Notre
Dame, No. 19 Missouri and No. 20 Georgia Tech.
	   The Ducks (5-1) dropped only one spot after their loss to UCLA,
while the Yellow Jackets (5-1) moved up five places with the win
over Virginia.
	   Syracuse was No. 21, followed by No. 22 Tulane, No. 23 Virginia
Tech, No. 24 Mississippi State and No. 25 Texas Tech.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five were Ohio
State, UCLA, Kansas State, Tennessee and Florida.
	   Seven Top 25 teams are unbeaten _ Ohio State, UCLA, Tennessee,
Kansas State, Wisconsin, Arkansas and Tulane.
	   The Big Ten and Big 12 have three teams apiece in the Top 10 _
Ohio State, Wisconsin and Penn State for the Big Ten; Kansas State,
Nebraska and Texas A and M for the Big 12.
	   Mississippi State (5-1) moved into the Top 25, while LSU (3-3),
a 39-36 loser to Kentucky, dropped out for the first time this

Latin American leaders call for help, warn of world recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final declaration signed, new quotes, summit
ending, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos OPO101-136 &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Latin American leaders on Sunday warned
that the looming collapse of their economies would usher in a
worldwide recession, dragging the top industrialized nations down
with them.
	   The leaders, whose developing economies are menaced by an
unfolding financial crisis that already has rocked Asia and Russia,
said they were the world's last line of defense against ``a grave
global recession.''
	   They urged the rich industrialized nations belonging to the
so-called ``Group of Seven'' and international financial
institutions to adopt ``urgent measures'' to restore stability to
financial markets and help pull Latin America back from the brink.
	   The measures included the creation of a contingency fund,
administered by the International Monetary Fund, which could be
channeled promptly to nations like those in Latin America that have
set tough structural reforms in motion.
	   Otherwise, ``the difficulties which affect some will become a
crisis for all,'' they said in a joint declaration at the end of
the one-day Ibero-American summit in Oporto.
	   The Group of Seven includes the United States, Japan, Britain,
Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar berated wealthy European
Union countries for turning their back on Latin America and failing
to recognize the potential scale of the threat.
	   ``It's time to see how we can stop and overcome this crisis,''
Aznar said.
	   The summit's final declaration, which also referred to regional
cooperation measures in various fields, was signed by the 19 Latin
American countries and Spain and Portugal.
	   The United States and Europe should cut their interest rates
further to kick-start growth and dampen speculative flows,
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said.
	   The Latin American leaders pledged to pursue internal economic
reforms, including potentially unpopular austerity packages, to
fend off the encroaching financial crisis.
	   However, they said the IMF and the World Bank also must help
check the spread of the turmoil by deploying financial resources
more swiftly and focussing more on prevention.
	   The most urgent case is Brazil, South America's largest economy
and a potential bulwark against creeping recession, which is
waiting for news of a dlrs 30 billion IMF rescue package.
	   The summit called for curbs on the international flow of
speculative money to buffer emerging markets against turmoil
elsewhere.
	   The loss of investor confidence and consequent outflow of
capital threw Latin American markets into a tailspin and reduced
their foreign currency reserves.
	   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso favored a tax on
short-term capital movements.
	   The Latin American crisis could end a decade of free-market
reforms on the continent, like deregulation and privatization, and
austerity packages could also spark social unrest across the
continent.
	   A strike being waged by state employees in Colombia against a
government austerity package offers a glimpse of the trouble that
could arise if biting reforms are introduced.
	   Guterres appealed to the IMF to ``abandon economic orthodoxies
... and heed the social repercussions'' of its policies when
imposing conditions for bailouts.

Syria to hold parliamentary election on Nov. 30
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ President Hafez Assad announced Sunday
that parliamentary elections will be held on Nov. 30, the official
Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
	   The polls are expected to be won by the National Progressive
Front, a coalition of seven parties led by the Baath Party, which
has ruled Syria since 1963.
	   Elections for the 250-seat People's Assembly are held every four
years. The outgoing parliament finished its term on Aug. 9.
	   The assembly has some legislative power, but effective control
is held by the president. Assad came to power in a military coup in
1970.

Serb military force moves out of its barracks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES takes. ADDS details of attacks
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb armored battle group moved
out of its barracks in Pristina Sunday and headed westward down the
main highway through central Kosovo, possibly to head off further
attacks by ethnic Albanian guerrillas, western sources reported.
	   The column of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks
traveled through the Komorane police checkpoint, about 20
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina, the provincial capital,
said the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified.
	   Their ultimate destination was not known but observers
speculated it was in response to recent attacks on police by the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The exact number of troops on the move was not known, but they
came from the brigade normally stationed in Pristina, which means
it is a unit that would not have to withdraw under the agreement
with NATO.
	   The military movement comes on the heels of a new wave of
violence in the province and the same day the vanguard of what will
be 2,000 unarmed international ``compliance verifiers'' arrived in
Kosovo.
	   Three Serb policemen died and three others were badly wounded by
a grenade at a police outpost in the town of Orlate, 30 kilometers
(20 miles) southwest of the capital Pristina, where police have
long complained of frequent attacks by ethnic Albanians. An AP
reporter verified the Orlate clash. The Serb-run Kosovo Media
Center in Pristina reported a dozen other attacks around the
province.
	   The Center said ``Albanian extremists'' attacked a police car
with automatic weapons Saturday night 15 kilometers (10 mile)
southwest of Pristina. Another group of ``extremists,'' it said,
attacked the police checkpoint in Komorane, using rifles and
machine guns. Police came under fire in several other areas, the
Media Center said.
	   Serb officials blamed the stepped-up violence on the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, loosely organized bands of
guerrillas still operating in wide areas of this poor southern
province of Serbia, the dominant republic in the shrunken Yugoslav
federation.
	   ``These latest attacks show that the Albanian terrorists are
trying by all possible means to prevent the realization of the ...
agreement,'' said Veljko Odalovic, the head of Kosovo's regional
government, referring to the deal struck by President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Hydajet Hyseni, spokesman for the United Democratic Movement,
which is openly supportive of the KLA, accused the police of
attacking the ``innocent Albanian population,'' and said the KLA
were shooting back in self-defense.
	   ``There is no real withdrawal of Serb armed forces from Kosovo,
let alone demilitarization of Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Odalovic, however, said there was no doubt the Albanians were
responsible.
	   ``This confirms what the international community has never
wanted to admit, that these bands of terrorists are not in favor of
a peaceful solution to the problem and are trying to take advantage
of the withdrawal of police and military forces from Kosovo.''
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during seven
months of clashes between Serb forces and the KLA. An estimated
300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been driven from
their homes. Many of them have been afraid to return because of the
continuing presence of Serb police, though there has been a trickle
of returnees in a number of villages.
	   The United States and NATO have reported significant pullbacks
by Yugoslav forces in recent days but say numbers still exceed the
level required by the Belgrade agreement. NATO plans for air
attacks on Yugoslavia remained on hold as the North Atlantic
Council, NATO's top policymaking body, extended the deadline for
compliance from last Saturday to Oct. 27.
	   As the violence escalated in this poor province of two million
people, 90 percent of whom are ethnic Albanian, an advance team
from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
arrived in the provincial capital. The OSCE has been charged with
the responsibility of verifying that Milosevic sticks to the
promises he made in the agreement with Holbrooke.
	   Principal among the demands is that he decrease the number of
troops and police to pre-February 1998 levels, the period when the
current conflict began. So far, nobody has specified exactly what
those levels are.
	   ``We will bring as many people in as quickly as possible, as the
infrastructure permits,'' said John Sandrock, an American who heads
the Vienna-based OSCE's mission support section. ``I don't want to
give you any numbers, or any deadlines or any times, but we will
respond to this issue as quickly as we can.''
	   Asked if he thought his current mission would have an effect on
the rising number of attacks, he said: ``We hope that the overall
presence of the OSCE can act in a stabilizing fashion and hopefully
we'll resolve many of the issues. Ours is a technical mission. We
are kind of an advance guard to try and assess where we will go
from here.''
	   He said the OSCE mission had a one-year mandate, which could be
extended.

	   DORTMUND, Germany (AP) _ Borussia Dortmund announced Saturday
that Lars Ricken, a key player on its Champions Cup triumph of two
years ago, has extended his contract until 2003.
	   The 22-year-old German national team midfielder, a product of
the club's youth system, had been signed until 1999.

<TEXT>
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ A partial West Bank agreement is
likely to emerge from the Mideast summit talks President Bill
Clinton is hosting, but completion of a full accord would probably
take several weeks, diplomatic sources said Sunday.
	   On the fourth day of talks, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
flew to the Wye Plantations hideaway to work with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
break the impasse.
	   ``There's important work being done here,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters after Clinton and Gore
arrived on separate helicopters. Lockhart said Gore was included
because he has good relations with leaders of both sides.
	   The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which
Israel would exchange territory for tougher action by the
Palestinian Authority to prevent terror strikes against Israelis.
Diplomatic sources said completing a final deal could take weeks or
longer.
	   The negotiations were snagged Sunday over security guarantees
that Israel can expect in exchange for giving up West Bank land to
the Palestinian Authority, diplomatic sources said.
	   Clinton conferred with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
other senior advisers for 40 minutes, then had lunch with Arafat.
The Palestinian leader and Netanyahu have not met face-to-face for
two days, and there has been no three-way meeting.
	   ``There is time to complete the work if the political will is
there to make the tough decisions,'' James P. Rubin, the State
Department spokesman, said.
	   While diplomatic sources said the likely result of the summit
was a partial agreement, Rubin said ``we have no plan to defer
issues for many weeks.'' He also cautioned that without an accord
``there are serious dangers ahead for the people of the Middle
East,''
	   Palestinian sources told The Associated Press the talks ``have
become very difficult,'' particularly on whether another Israeli
pullback on the West Bank would follow the one being negotiated and
on Israel's demand that terrorism suspects be extradited to Israel
for trial.
	   However, the sources, insisting on anonymity, said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and Danny Naveh,
the Israeli Cabinet secretary, were working on drafts of other
provisions.
	   Also, the sources said, CIA director George Tenet had a long
meeting Saturday with Muhammed Dahlan, Palestinian security chief,
and their ideas would be presented Sunday to the Israelis.
	   Meanwhile, American assertions that the summit was timed to end
Sunday night gave way to a statement by Rubin that ``we are taking
this one meeting at a time.''
	   Rubin said he had not ``heard any serious discussion about a
multiweek extension.''
	   He also denied an Israeli army radio report that Clinton had
warned the Israelis he would support a Palestinian state if no West
Bank agreement was reached.
	   He said that did not ``resemble any account that I've heard at
the Wye talks and I find it difficult to imagine.''
	   Netanyahu's office also denied any such pressure.
	   ``The reports are baseless and that option was never discussed
in conversations with the prime minister and his delegation at Wye
Plantation,'' Netanyahu's office said in a statement issued in
Jerusalem.
	   The newly appointed, hard-line Israeli foreign minister, Ariel
Sharon, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai arrived at this
resort area on Maryland's Eastern Shore early Sunday morning to
join the talks. Asked by reporters if he was optimistic, Mordechai
said, ``Yes, I am.''
	   Clinton is trying to break a 19-month stalemate, but U.S.
officials have made no claims of progress since the talks began
Thursday.
	   Although a press blackout remains in effect, details about the
talks continued to leak out. Several Israeli press reports painted
a picture of a frustrated Clinton who told both sides categorically
that he intended to push an agreement through.
	   ``I've been working on this deal for 17 months and I'm not
prepared to defer it any longer,'' Clinton was quoted by the
Israeli daily Maariv as having told both Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   Wide gaps still remain on security issues, Israeli media have
reported. The CIA has been helping broker talks between the sides
on security issues, Maariv said.
	   In addition, Israel radio reported that the Palestinians said
Israeli negotiators have refused to take up three issues: the scope
of later West Bank troop withdrawals, the release of Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails, and a commitment to halt house
demolitions and confiscation of Palestinian property.
	   At stake was a long-sought accord that would give the
Palestinians control over more land on which they hope to establish
a state.
	   Arafat has said he would declare a Palestinian state
unilaterally in May 1999, when the interim peace talks between the
sides are set to expire. Netanyahu has threatened unspecified
unilateral steps in response that could include annexing chunks of
the West Bank.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A pipeline explosion splashed oil on a
rural Colombian hamlet Sunday and fire raced through the village,
killing at least 43 people and injuring more than 60. Leftist
rebels were suspected in the blast.
	   ``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And no one
knows exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert
Valencia in Segovia, the nearest town. The fire was in Machuca,
about 180 miles (300 kms) north of Bogota.
	   Valencia said by telephone that the 2:45 a.m. explosion
destroyed most of the wood huts with straw roofs in the settlement
of about 150 residents, most of them gold miners. The injured, many
with third-degree burns, were airlifted to at least six hospitals.
	   The pipeline was on a rise just above the hamlet, Valencia said.
Most of the victims were women and young children and died on the
spot, Guillermo Franco, the Antioquia state health director, said
from the state capital of Medellin.
	   Gen. Alfredo Salgado, operations director of the national
police, said survivors described ``a huge explosion and afterward a
ball of flame erupted.'' Army spokesman Col. Paulino Coronado said
the death toll would rise was expected to rise because ``three
entire houses were wiped out by the blast'' and their inhabitants
had not yet been included in the death toll.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Voters in Macedonia on Sunday cast
their ballot in what was the first step in a decision whether to
keep in office the incumbent politicians who led them peacefully
out of former Yugoslavia or opt for a change promised by a team of
younger politicians.
	   Under a complicated voting system, only about one third of the
120 seats in parliament will be awarded to contesting parties and
their candidates after Sunday's first round of voting. The rest
will be determined in a second round on Nov. 1.
	   The ruling three-partry coalition of the Socialist Party of
renamed Communists, the Social Democratic Alliance and an ethnic
Albanian party, has a comfortable majority in the current
legislature.
	   Thirty-eight parties, including the ruling coalition,all have
promised a better future, concentrating their election campaigns on
Macedonia's growing economic woes.
	   Only minor irregularities were reported at the polls by Sunday
afternoon.
	   Polls closed at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT), and first official results
were expected to be released Monday.
	   The large number of parties in the third parliamentary elections
since Macedonia abandoned its Communist single-party system in 1990
could mean that none would win an outright majority in the 120-seat
assembly.
	   Favorites of the pro-reform voters were an opposition coalition
who have challenged the ruling coalition led by the renamed
Communists, in power since Macedonia gained independence in 1992.
	   ``I vote for changes and I hope all people in Macedonia will
vote for changes,'' declared Ljupco Georgievski, one of the
opposition leaders.
	   His partner, Vasil Tupurkovski, cast his ballot at one minute
before noon to symbolize that time is running out to lead out
Macedonia from the economic crisis.
	   Macedonia, with a population of only about two million people,
was the poorest of all six republics in the former Yugoslav
federation, and its economy remains feeble with about 30 percent
unemployment and a dlrs 210 monthly average salary.
	   Situated in the neighborhood of the volatile Kosovo province,
with unsolved disputes with all of its neighbors, and a restive
ethnic Albanian minority, Macedonia is a key country for stability
in the Balkans.
	   U.N. peacekeepers and the ruling alliance led by the former
Communists turned pragmatists _ notably Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski and President Kiro Gligorov _ are credited with keeping
the country out of the trouble that engulfed much of former
Yugoslavia.
	   Upon casting his ballot Sunday, Crvenkovski said he hoped the
future government ``will be able to preserve peace and stability.''
	   During the election campaign, Tupurkovski drafted an economic
program which, he said, would attract dlrs one billion of foreign
investment. He said Macedonia must rely on agriculture and small,
family-run businesses contrary to old-time Communist-era
enterprises.
	   Tupurkovski, 47, was one of the youngest and most popular
politicians in former Communist-run Yugoslavia for his reformist
stands and casual style.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise 440,000 of Macedonia's 2 million
population, were expected to increase their representation in the
assembly. Their desire for self-rule has given rise to concern
because of similar aims of the Albanian minority in rump
Yugoslavia.
	   Gligorov said he hoped the elections will result in a
``continuation of Macedonia's democratic traditions.''

Hundreds reported killed in Nigerian oil pipeline explosion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Thieves sabotaging a trans-national oil
pipeline touched off an inferno that razed several villages and
destroyed a swath of surrounding cropland, witnesses and officials
said Sunday. About 200 people were reportedly burned alive.
	   Although an official death toll was not immediately available,
military commander Walter Feghabo ordered a mass burial for farmers
and villagers whose bodies were charred beyond recognition in the
blaze that began late Saturday near the town of Jesse in the
southeastern Delta State.
	   Journalists and witnesses on the scene estimated that at least
200 people were killed and said the death toll was likely to climb
as the search for survivors continued.
	   Many of the victims were farmers and villagers sleeping in their
homes.
	   Feghabo said more than 120 firefighters were battling late
Sunday to contain the flames which continued to burn in Jesse and
the nearby villages of Mossogar and Oghara.
	   The above-ground pipeline, linking an oil refinery in the
southeastern coastal city of Warri with the northern city of Kaduna
some 600 kilometers (380 miles) away, exploded when thieves
sabotaged the line hoping to syphon the oil in makeshift
containers, an official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation
said on condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear exactly what set the pipeline alight. Witnesses
said they heard a load roar and saw the oily flames spread quickly
as the slicks spread.
	   Vandals and protesters often sabotage petroleum pipelines in
Nigeria both as a way of protesting for greater financial
assistance from the government and multinational oil companies and
to collect the valuable fuel.
	   Despite Nigeria's massive oil wealth, years of government
misrule and corruption have resulted in almost perpetual fuel
shortages that result in skyrocketing black-market prices and long
line-ups by consumers at the gas pumps.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ At least 41 people were killed Sunday when a
train jumped its tracks at a north Egyptian station and plowed into
people, the Ministry of Interior said.
	   More than 80 people were injured, the ministry's statement said.
Police said earlier that about 200 people had been injured and more
deaths are expected.
	   Officials put the toll discrepancy down to the confusion at the
scene.
	   Egyptian television showed a crane raising one of the overturned
train cars as scores of riot police fended off hundreds of wailing
people.
	   The train was traveling from the port of Alexandria to Kafr
el-Sheik when it derailed in the station of Kafr el-Dawar, a town
about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Alexandria, the
ministry said.
	   The train went off the rails when the driver changed tracks ``at
high speed,'' the statement said.
	   The locomotive and the first two passenger cars toppled over and
careened through people and kiosks on the station platform, the
ministry said.
	   First reports said the train had crashed into houses near the
railway, but the ministry's report did not confirm this.
	   A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was
speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the
brakes system between the cars, Egypt's official Middle East News
Agency reported.
	   Such trains are usually packed with hundreds of commuters and it
is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on the roof and between
the cars.
	   Police at Kafr el-Dawar refused to take telephone calls, as did
officials at the Kafr el-Dawar General hospital and Alexandria
University hospital. Egyptian television said the injured had been
admitted to at least five hospitals.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam heard of the accident in Cairo and
went immediately to the site with a team of doctors, officials
said.

Central bankers say dlrs 1.5 trillion traded daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Nearly dlrs 1.5 trillion are traded on
the world's foreign exchange markets every day, 25 percent higher
than three years ago, according to a central bankers' survey
released Sunday.
	   London remained the world's leading financial center. Its share
of total foreign exchange turnover rose to 32 percent from 30
percent in the previous study in 1995, said the Bank for
International Settlements.
	   Second-placed New York also advanced. Its share of transactions
rose to 18 percent from 16 percent. But the Japanese market
declined from 10 to 8 percent.
	   The dollar dominated the market, the study said. It was involved
in 87 percent of foreign currency activity, compared with 83
percent three years before.
	   The BIS report said the rate of increase in transactions had
slowed between 1995 and 1998 urveys. Between 1992 and 1995, the
turnover on foreign exchange markets grew by 45 percent. An average
of dlrs 1.19 trillion was traded daily in 1995.
	   It averaged dlrs 1.49 trillion in April 1998, when the survey
was conducted.
	   The figures include spot transactions, outright forwards and
foreign exchange swaps.
	   The BIS used data from 43 countries for its report, conducted
every three years. The Basel-based organization groups central
banks worldwide.

Real Madrid reclaims first place, Mallorca takes share of second
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Upstart Mallorca grabbed a share of second
place behind a resurgent Real Madrid Sunday in the sixth week of
the Spanish first division soccer league.
	   The other titan of Spanish football, FC Barcelona, managed only
a 1-1 tie at home against Salamanca on Saturday and dropped to
sixth place in the standings.
	   Mallorca is tied on points with the season's other surprise,
Zaragoza, after beating Alaves 2-1.
	   After a scoreless first half, Mallorca struck twice in the space
of eight minutes on goals from Yugoslav midfielder Veljko Paunovic
and Argentine striker Leo Biagini.
	   Alaves, playing two men short after Brazilian Ivan Rocha got two
yellow cards and Manuel Canabal a red one, scored in the 90th
minute on a penalty kick by Hermes Aldio Desio.
	   In other games Sunday, Racing de Santander trounced last-place
Extremadura 3-1, Valladolid beat Espanyol 2-1 and Deportivo La
Coruna rolled over Oviedo 4-0.
	   In Saturday's games Atletico Madrid beat Tenerife 2-0, Celta
defeated Betis 3-0 to take fifth place, Villareal tied Real
Sociedad 1-1 and Athletic Bilbao beat Valencia 2-0.
	   The weekend's big matchup came Saturday with Real Madrid
bouncing back from two straight European and league losses to beat
Real Zaragoza 4-3 and oust it from first place.
	   Predag Mijatovic scored one and set up another for Real. Madrid
jumped out to a 3-1 lead by the 40th minute and then had to hang on
at Zaragoza to end the losing streak that dropped it behind
Zaragoza in the league standings.
	   In Barcelona, a missed penalty by Luis Enrique cost Barcelona
dearly when Eduardo Alonso scored in the 62nd minute and gave
Salamanca a 1-1 draw.
	   The Catalans jumped ahead in the 58th minute on a goal from
Dutch striker Philip Cocu. But two minutes later Enrique missed his
penalty attempt after Sergio Corino fouled Rivaldo.
	   Although the draw kept Barcelona as one of only three unbeatens
in the Spanish first division, it was its fourth tie and dropped it
from third to sixth place. Mallorca and Celta are the only other
unbeaten teams.

Status of Milosevic's promises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sunday developments in graf 7. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The status Sunday of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic must back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's
deadline _ pushed back to Oct. 27 _ or face renewed threat of
airstrikes for his crackdown in Kosovo:
	   _ Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo:
	   Amid a new wave of violence, three Serb policemen died and three
others were badly wounded Saturday by a grenade at a police outpost
in the town of Orlate, 20 miles southwest of Pristina, but major
large-scale fighting has not occurred for about a month.
	   Both sides reported shooting incidents Saturday. Serb police
claimed ethnic Albanian ``extremists'' had attacked them more than
a dozen times across Kosovo. The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs
for at least two of the incidents, saying police in Vranjevac had
opened fire.
	   _ Withdraw forces and heavy armaments to levels before the
crackdown began Feb. 28:
	   NATO spy planes continued flying over Kosovo on Sunday to check
on the status of pullouts. NATO says more Serb troops and police
remain in the province than are permitted.
	   On Sunday, western sources said, a Serb column of tanks, armored
personnel carriers and truck left their Pristina barracks and moved
westward down the main highway through central Kosovo, apparently
in response to recent attacks on police by the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   _ Start serious talks with ethnic Albanians on self-rule:
	   No date for the start of talks has been announced. The two sides
have been holding separate discussions with U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill. Ethnic Albanian political leaders reportedly met Saturday in
Turkey to discuss taking a united stand on independence or
autonomy.
	   _ Help refugees return to their homes:
	   Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages but many
remain wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused in
massacres of civilians.
	   _ Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian organizations:
	   The U.N. refugee agency and others have resumed aid convoys for
the past several days, and some workers say Serb police have been
less obstructive.
	   _ Cooperating with the International War Crimes Tribunal:
	   U.N. war crimes investigators have received Yugoslav visas and
plan to return to Kosovo soon.
	   _ Allowing a 2,000-member international verification force into
Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia is keeping its word:
	   An advance team for the monitors, to be overseen by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, arrived in
Pristina on Sunday. OSCE says it hopes a sizable number of monitors
would be in place in Kosovo in two weeks.

Three Palestinians wounded trying to avoid roadblock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops shot and wounded three
passengers in a van load of Palestinian laborers who had skirted a
West Bank roadblock Sunday, the Palestinian driver of the van said,
but Israeli army officials denied involvement in the incident.
	   The driver said that Israeli troops began to follow the van
after noticing it driving along bumpy back roads. The van's driver,
Abdallah Abu Shaz, said Israel's border police signaled for him to
stop and fired four bullets into one side of the vehicle when he
refused.
	   Abu Shaz said he was bringing back a group of Palestinian
workers from the Israeli city of Beersheva and took the back roads
in order to avoid the Israeli checkpoint.
	   But an Israeli army spokesman said that the army had no
knowledge of the alleged shooting by Israeli troops. The spokesman
said that because the van in question carried Israeli license
plates, the army was checking the possibility that Palestinians
opened fire on the car, thinking that the passengers were Jewish.
	   Two of the passengers were lightly wounded from the bullets and
a third was injured from broken glass, doctors at Hebron's Alya
hospital said.
	   Only a limited number of some 2 million Palestinians have been
issued permits to work inside Israel, and each day thousands use
back roads and avoid checkpoints in order to reach menial day jobs.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops shot and wounded three
passengers in a vanload of Palestinian laborers who had skirted a
West Bank roadblock Sunday, the Palestinian driver of the van said.
Israeli army officials denied involvement.
	   The driver said Israeli troops began to follow the van after
noticing it driving along bumpy back roads. The van's driver,
Abdallah Abu Shaz, said Israel's border police signaled for him to
stop and fired four bullets into one side of the vehicle when he
refused.
	   Abu Shaz said he was bringing back a group of Palestinian
workers from the Israeli city of Beersheva and took the back roads
to avoid the Israeli checkpoint.
	   But an Israeli army spokesman said the army had no knowledge of
the alleged incident. The spokesman said that because the van in
question carried Israeli license plates, the army was checking the
possibility that Palestinians opened fire on the car, thinking that
the passengers were Jewish.
	   Two of the passengers were lightly wounded from the bullets and
a third was injured from broken glass, doctors at Hebron's Alya
Hospital said.
	   Only a limited number of some 2 million Palestinians have been
issued permits to work inside Israel, and each day thousands use
back roads and avoid checkpoints to reach menial day jobs.

 &UR; Eds: ADDS that Serb forces deployed Sunday do not have to leave

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As a group of international
observers arrived in Kosovo to oversee the withdrawal of Serb
forces, an armored battle group moved out of its barracks and down
a main highway in an apparent move against ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, western sources said.
	   The column of Serb tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks
traveled through the Komorane police checkpoint, about 20
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina, the provincial capital, the
sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   Their ultimate destination was not known, but sources said it
appeared to be in response to recent attacks on police by the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. The exact number of troops on the move was
not known.
	   The deployment follows a new wave of violence in the province,
and came on the same day the first of an expected 2,000
international observers arrived in Kosovo. The observers are to
monitor the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, as agreed to
last week by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke.
	   The Serb forces that were deployed on Sunday are normally
stationed in Pristina, meaning it is a unit that would not have to
withdraw under the agreement.

With Spain-Pinochet

 &UR; Spain's judge Garzon no stranger to limelight
 &UR; By KERNAN TURNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish judge instrumental in getting
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet arrested in London was
already known as the ``super judge'' in Spain for his aggressive
pursuit of government ``dirty wars,'' at home and abroad.
	   The judge, Baltasar Garzon, earned his nickname by successfully
sending a former security chief and government minister to jail
this year for their role in Spain's own ``dirty war'' against the
armed ETA Basque separatists.
	   Garzon and Manuel Garcia Castellon, another Spanish judge
involved in the Pinochet case, have been investigating Pinochet's
alleged role in the deaths of Spaniards in Chile, and of Chileans
in Argentina as part of Operation Condor, a joint effort by South
American dictators to crush dissent in the 1970s and '80s.
	   Garzon and Garcia separately requested that Pinochet be held for
questioning, but it was Garzon who sought his extradition for
allegedly murdering an unspecified number of Spaniards in Chile
between the time he seized power on Sept. 11, 1973, and Dec. 31,
1983.
	   Garzon once hauled former Argentine President Isabel Peron into
court to testify about human rights abuses during her tenure that
expanded into the Argentine dirty war after the military overthrew
her.
	   Peron testified in 1997 during hearings into the disappearance
of 330 Spaniards in Argentina between 1976-1983.
	   Garzon was less successful earlier this year when he summoned an
Argentine parliamentary deputy who was visiting Madrid to testify
in the case. Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said the deputy,
Humberto Roggero, enjoyed parliamentary immunity and was not
required to appear before Garzon.
	   Spain's governing Popular Party and the main opposition
Socialist Party also declared their support for Roggero's position.
	   But the most sensational case in Spain itself has been Garzon's
handling of the dirty war against the ETA commandos, who have
killed nearly 800 people during a 30-year campaign for an
independent Basque homeland in northern Spain and southern France.
	   The case resulted in the jailing of former security chief Rafael
Vera and Jose Barrionuevo, former interior minister in charge of
the nation's police forces. They were convicted in July of
organizing the 1983 kidnapping of a Basque businessman who was
mistaken for an ETA hitman and was released unharmed 10 days later.
	   The operation was carried out by the Anti-terrorist Liberation
Groups, shadowy death squads known as the GAL.
	   The GAL killed 27 people between 1983-1987 in its campaign
against the ETA.
	   Vera claimed during his trial he was a victim of a smear
campaign by Garzon and others against former socialist Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez and members of his government.

Conceicao, Mihajlovic, Salas lead Lazio to 5-3 rout of Inter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with Inter-Lazio late match. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Sergio Conceicao tallied his first two goals of the
season and Sinisa Mihajlovic offered two assists as Lazio of Rome
dominated Internazionale 5-3 Sunday night to prevent the Milan club
from taking over first place in Serie A.
	   Lazio grabbed a 3-1 lead by halftime and, with Inter playing
with 10 men for the final 45 minutes after Argentine midfielder
Diego Simeone's expulsion, went up 5-1 before the hosts responded
with late two goals from substitute striker Nicola Ventola.
	   The match underlined Inter's defensive woes and the versatility
of Lazio, which was already hampered by injuries and saw Chile's
Marcelo Salas and veteran striker Roberto Mancini both leave hurt
after scoring.
	   It was Inter's first loss and left Lazio and AC Parma as the
league's only undefeated clubs. There are now eight teams bunched
within four points at the top of the standings.
	   Salas found the mark for the first time in Italy in the second
minute by deflecting in a Mihajlovic free kick, but Inter made it
1-1 on Dutch midfielder Aron Winter's 25-meter (yard) blast in the
21st.
	   After Mihajlovic twice sent free kicks against the base of the
post, the Yugoslav defender curled a corner kick that Portugal's
Conceicao headed in at the near post in the 36th.
	   Five minutes later, an unmarked Mancini slammed in a long
through ball from 12 meters (yards) to make it 3-1. Czech
midfielder Pavel Nedved set up Conceicao's second goal in the 53rd,
and then scored himself by firing into the upper left corner from 5
meters (yards) in the 75th.
	   Earlier Sunday, Juventus of Turin and AC Milan also wasted
chances to move into first place, as the league's little clubs
roughed up established ones.
	   Tiziano De Patre's goal from close range in the 19th minute gave
Cagliari a 1-0 upset of Milan, which saw German striker Oliver
Bierhoff miss a penalty kick in the 43rd.
	   Two-time defending champion Juventus was also outplayed by an
unheralded club and settled for a 1-1 draw against Vicenza, while
Udinese allowed Bari to pull into a 1-1 tie on a goal in injury
time.
	   Nine-man AS Roma's stunning 2-1 comeback victory Saturday over
previously unbeaten league leader Fiorentina, on goals by Dmitri
Alenichev and Francesco Totti in the final five minutes, had
provided an opening for the other clubs.
	   Instead, Fiorentina still sits alone atop the Serie A standings
after five games with 12 points, two ahead of Roma, Juventus and
Internazionale of Milan. Lazio, Parma and Milan are next with nine
points and Udinese has eight.
	   In other games Sunday, 39-year-old defender Pietro Verichowod
scored as Piacenza beat Sampdoria of Genoa 4-1, while Perugia
notched a 1-0 win over Venezia, which still has yet to score a goal
this season.
	   On Saturday, AC Parma tripled its season scoring output by
beating winless Salernitana 2-0 on goals nine minutes apart by
Italian internationals Enrico Chiesa and Diego Fuser, and Empoli
drew with Bologna 0-0.
	   At Milan, Lazio (2-3-0) gained a measure of revenge for its loss
to Inter (3-1-1) in last season's UEFA Cup final and won its second
straight after opening the season with three draws.
	   Salas iced his left foot after leaving the game shortly after
his goal, while Mancini limped off early in the second half. Lazio
was already without forwards Christian Vieri and Alen Boksic, as
well as starting defenders Alessandro Nesta and Paolo Negro.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Chairs that held the guests at Princess Diana's
funeral service are being sold for 3,000 pounds (dlrs 5,100) each,
The Sunday Times reported.
	   Westminster Abbey, which used the beech and elm chairs until
March, decided to sell them to help defray the cost of new chairs.
Pew Corner, a furniture company located in Surrey, southwest of
London, bought all 800 and now plans to market the chairs to buyers
in the United States, the newspaper said.
	   The chairs come with a certificate of authenticity signed by
Welsey Carr, the dean of Westminster, and a gold-plated plaque
saying, ''This bespoke congregation chair was used in Westminster
Abbey, England,'' The Sunday Times reported. The chairs were
purchased by the abbey at intervals since the 1920s, and some may
have been used during royal weddings and coronations. All were
likely used at Diana's funeral service last year.
	   The paper did not say how much Pew Corner paid for the chairs.
But a similar new chair would cost about 150 pounds (dlrs 250),
according to the paper.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A pipeline explosion splashed oil on a
rural Colombian hamlet Sunday and fire raced through the village,
killing at least 45 people and injuring more than 60. Leftist
rebels were suspected in the blast.
	   ``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And no one
knows exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert
Valencia in Segovia, the nearest town. The fire was in Machuca,
about 180 miles (300 kms) north of Bogota.
	   Valencia said y telephone that the 2:45 a.m. explosion destroyed
most of the wood huts with straw roofs in the settlement of about
150 residents, most of them gold miners. The injured were airlifted
to at least six area hospitals, most of them with third-degree
burns.
	   The pipeline was on a rise just above the hamlet, Valencia said.
More than half of the fatalities were children and 34 of the
victims died on the spot, Guillermo Franco, the Antioquia state
health director, said from the state capital of Medellin. He said
all 49 hospitalized survivors were badly burned, under anesthesia
and not able recount their ordeal.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Thieves sabotaging an oil pipeline touched
off an inferno that razed several villages and destroyed a swath of
surrounding cropland, witnesses and officials said Sunday. At least
200 people were reportedly burned alive.
	   Although an official death toll was not immediately available,
military commander Walter Feghabo ordered a mass burial for farmers
and villagers whose bodies were charred beyond recognition in the
blaze that began late Saturday near the town of Jesse in the
southeastern Delta State.
	   ``I just cannot believe this,'' Feghabo said as he surveyed a
pile of corpses.
	   Journalists and witnesses on the scene estimated that at least
200 people were killed and said the death toll was likely to climb
as the search for survivors continued.
	   Many of the victims were farmers and villagers sleeping in their
homes. Among the dead were vandals _ including children _ whose
corpses had been found still clutching plastic cups funnels and
jerry cans intended to collect fuel from the pipeline.
	   Feghabo said more than 120 firefighters were battling late
Sunday to contain the flames which continued to burn in Jesse and
the nearby villages of Mossogar and Oghara.
	   The above-ground pipeline, linking an oil refinery in the
southeastern coastal city of Warri about 350 kilometers (210 miles)
southeast of the commercial capital of Lagos with the northern city
of Kaduna some 600 kilometers (380 miles) away, exploded when
thieves sabotaged the line hoping to syphon the oil in makeshift
containers, an official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation
said on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said authorities believed the vandals' tools used
to break the pipe open had caused a spark, setting the pipeline
alight. Witnesses said they heard a load roar and saw the oily
flames spread quickly as the slicks spread.
	   Another petroleum official, Emmanuel Akhihiero expressed shock
after arriving on the scene.
	   ``I feel terrible. I cannot believe what I have seen. Corpses,
corpses,'' Akhihiero said.
	   Vandals and protesters often sabotage petroleum pipelines in
Nigeria both as a way of protesting for greater financial
assistance from the government and multinational oil companies and
to collect the valuable fuel.
	   Despite Nigeria's massive oil wealth, years of government
misrule and corruption have resulted in almost perpetual fuel
shortages that result in skyrocketing black-market prices and long
line-ups by consumers at the gas pumps.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ At least 45 people were killed Sunday when a
train jumped its tracks at a north Egyptian station and plowed into
people on the platform, Egypt's official news agency said.
	   About 100 people were injured, authorities at the scene told the
Middle East News Agency.
	   The train was traveling from the port of Alexandria to Kafr
el-Sheik when it derailed in the station of Kafr el-Dawar, a town
about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Alexandria, the
Interior Ministry said.
	   The train went off the rails when the driver changed tracks ``at
high speed,'' the ministry's statement said.
	   The locomotive and the first two passenger cars toppled over and
careened through people and kiosks on the platform, the ministry
said.
	   Egyptian television showed a crane moving toward one of the
overturned train cars as scores of riot police fended off hundreds
of wailing people. One train car appeared to have crashed into
small buildings near the railway.
	   A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was
speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the
brakes system between the cars, the news agency reported.
	   Such trains are usually packed with hundreds of commuters and it
is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on the roof and between
the cars.
	   Egyptian television said the injured had been admitted to at
least five hospitals.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam, a practicing surgeon, left his
office in Cairo and went to the site with a team of doctors,
officials said.

Americans win heavy divisions

<TEXT>
	   TAMPERE, Finland (AP) _ Davarryl Williamson of the United States
won the heavyweight title Sunday at the Tammer tournament.
	   Williamson knocked down Kai Brannkarr of Finland with two quick
rights. Brannkarr's corner threw in the towel after 20 seconds of
the first round as Williamson pummeled him with body punches.
	   The United States and Finland each won three titles in the
tournament, counting toward the international amateur rankings. The
Philippines won two titles, and Rumania, Norway, Sweden and Tunisia
one apiece.
	   Williamson and compatriots Anthony Stewart and Domenick Guinn
won the three heaviest divisions. Guinn got a walkover because of
an injury to Sami Jondoubi of Tunisia in the super heavyweight
class and Stewart outpointed Ervins Helmanis of Latvia 5-4 in the
light heavyweight division.
	   The U.S. team also had three losing finalists. Jose Navarro was
beaten 13-1 by Efren Desierto of the Philippines in the light
flyweight division. Mahlon Kerwick lost 8-6 to another Philippines
fighter, Ramil Zambales, in the lightweight class, and Andreas
Gustavsson of Sweden beat Randy Griffin 6-3 in the middleweight
final.

A policeman with no traffic, the surprising laughter of children
</HEADLINE>
and a lonely, old woman &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serb traffic policeman stood in the
deserted intersection, bright white sleeve covers on his arms,
white hat on his head _ ready to direct what was probably the only
car in this shattered Kosovo town.
	   The journalists' armored vehicle turned right and came to a
stop. Junik is ghostly. Two old men sat on a step quietly
conversing.
	   Are the ethnic Albanians driven from this village by Serb troops
and police returning to their homes now that President Slobodan
Milosevic has reached a deal with American troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke? a reporter asks. Yes, a lot of people are coming back,
the policeman responds.
	   Some people are indeed coming back, the two old men agree when
asked the same question. But only the elderly, a few women and some
children. The young people are still afraid, says an elderly man in
a dirty, blue beret.
	   Seventy percent of the people from Junik are in Albania, just
eight kilometers (five miles) over the mountains to the west, says
one of three women sitting in the dirt outside what used to be her
apartment, a once-elegant red-brick building now in tatters.
	   ``It used to be real nice,'' she says with an embarrassed shrug,
nodding toward her battered home.
	   When the international observers come, the people will come
back, she says. Perhaps.
	   Until then, the policeman will continue to direct non-existent
traffic, old men will hobble by on walking sticks. A few women and
children will try to piece their lives together. The two Yugoslav
army soldiers will remain camped in an abandoned building nearby.
And this once pretty little village under the towering Albanian
mountains will struggle between life and death.
 &UR; --- &QC; 
	   It's startling to hear the laughter of children. Up in the hills
of central Kosovo where thousands of families are living in the
open. Homeless. With little food. With not much hope. Children have
already died from exposure in this wretched province.
	   Yet they still can laugh.
	   In a field near a small stream outside the battered village of
Pagarusa, several families are camped under the ubiquitous plastic
sheets. Foam mattresses on the ground. The women, unwashed and
overworked, attend to the daily chores of cooking simple meals and
caring for children.
	   Despite everything, children can still be children. Shouts and
laughter can still be heard echoing through the verdant hills. Not
so often, perhaps, but sometimes.
 &UR; --- &QC; 
	   ``I'm tired,'' said the toothless old woman in the cream-colored
headscarf. ``I'm alone. I'm living only with my God.''
	   Limping slowly down the nearly deserted street in a
bullet-pocked Kosovo village, the ethnic Albanian woman said she
doesn't remember how old she is. She thinks she is either 76 or 80.
She can't quite remember her name either. She knows her family is
gone and that she fled her village at the foot of the mountains on
the western side of the province, but decided to come back. Being
home hasn't helped. She is so, so lonely.
	   ``My house was not shelled,'' she acknowledges, though many of
the others in the village were. ``But it's falling down anyway.''
	   It's the loneliness, she says, grasping the hand of the man who
stopped her in the street. ``Thank you. Thank you for talking to
me.''

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Voters in Macedonia cast ballots Sunday
in the first round of parliamentary elections, choosing between the
incumbent politicians who led the country peacefully to
independence from Yugoslavia or a team of younger politicians.
	   All 38 parties, including the ruling coalition of former
Communists, social democrats and ethnic Albanians that has been in
power since 1992, have concentrated their campaigns on Macedonia's
economic woes.
	   Macedonia, which was the poorest of all six republics in the
former Yugoslav federation, remains economically feeble with about
30 percent unemployment and an average salary of dlrs 210 a month.
	   Only minor irregularities were reported at the polls by Sunday
afternoon. Polls closed at 7 p.m., and the first official results
were expected Monday.
	   The multitude of parties contesting the third parliamentary
elections since Macedonia abandoned Communist single-party rule in
1990 could mean that none will win an outright majority in the
120-seat assembly. The ruling coalition currently holds a
comfortable majority.
	   Under a complicated voting system, only about one-third of the
120 seats are up for grabs in Sunday's voting. The rest will be
determined in a second round of voting on Nov. 1.
	   Situated near the volatile Yugoslav province of Kosovo,
Macedonia has disputes with all of its neighbors, and a restive
ethnic Albanian minority. However, the country has avoided the
violence that has engulfed much of the former Yugoslavia.
	   Upon casting his ballot Sunday, the prime minister said he hoped
the future government ``will be able to preserve peace and
stability.''
	   The leading opposition parties would form a coalition that
promises an economic program it says would attract dlrs 1 billion
of foreign investment. Opposition leader Vasil Tupurkovski, who
drafted the program, cast his ballot at one minute before noon to
symbolize that time is running out to lead the country from its
economic crisis.

NBA, union await ruling on contracts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a critical ruling for the North American
National Basketball Association and the players' union, arbitrator
John Feerick decides Monday whether more than 200 players with
guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout.
	   If the players win, the owners will be liable for about dlrs 800
million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed to appeal
if they lose. The league already has sued the players over
Feerick's jurisdiction.
	   ``If we win, I think it just emboldens the spirit and resolve of
the players,'' union director Billy Hunter said. ``But I don't
think there will be anybody celebrating because there's no
guarantee that it will end the lockout.
	   ``It only means they have to pay some 200 players, and they've
indicated to us their intent to file an immediate appeal and take
it as far as they have to in order to avoid payment.
	   ``So even if he does rule in our favor, at most it's a hollow
victory. The players aren't going to get paid Nov. 15 in any
circumstance,'' Hunter said.
	   If the owners win, it will remove the last wild card the players
had been holding.
	   The sides have not negotiated since last Tuesday, when the union
proposed a superstar tax on the highest contracts. The league made
a counterproposal Friday, asking that the tax be imposed with a
much lower threshold.
	   Hunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday
afternoon, then said both sides would be best served by awaiting
Feerick's ruling.
	   It's unlikely any negotiations will be held this week, since the
union is holding a meeting for all NBA players and the agents
advisory committee in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday.
	   ``We've got to get a sense of where the players are, what they
consider to be reasonable and what they're willing to do in order
to get the season to commence,'' Hunter said.
	   The union filed a grievance with Feerick before the lockout was
imposed July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they
would not honor guaranteed deals.
	   In a six-day hearing over the summer, the union argued that
owners should have protected themselves from being liable for
guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting lockout
language into the standard player contract.
	   The Sacramento Kings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden
Polynice's contract in 1994, and it was approved by the league. The
union used the existence of that clause to argue that all the other
teams should have protected themselves similarly.
	   Most players are due to receive their first paychecks Nov. 15,
although a dozen or so had clauses entitling them to be paid over
the summer. None has received a paycheck.
	   The NBA argued that a tenet of labor law allows employers to
withhold pay from employees during a lockout.
	   The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine to
testify. He said it was his understanding when he negotiated the
old labor agreement in 1995 that players would not be paid if the
owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose a lockout.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Thieves sabotaging an oil pipeline touched
off an inferno that razed several villages and destroyed a swath of
surrounding cropland, witnesses and officials said Sunday. At least
200 people were reportedly burned alive.
	   Although an official death toll was not immediately available,
military commander Walter Feghabo ordered a mass burial for farmers
and villagers whose bodies were charred beyond recognition in the
blaze that began late Saturday near the town of Jesse in the
southeastern Delta State.
	   ``I just cannot believe this,'' Feghabo said later in a
telephone interview, after surveying a pile of corpses.
	   Journalists and witnesses on the scene estimated that at least
200 people were killed and said the death toll was likely to climb
as the search for survivors continued.
	   Many of the victims were farmers and villagers sleeping in their
homes. Among the dead were vandals _ including children _ whose
corpses had been found still clutching plastic cups funnels and
jerry cans intended to collect fuel from the pipeline.
	   Feghabo said more than 120 firefighters were battling late
Sunday to contain the flames which continued to burn in Jesse,
about 300 kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Lagos, and the nearby
villages of Mossogar and Oghara.
	   The above-ground pipeline, linking an oil refinery in the
southeastern coastal city of Warri about 350 kilometers (210 miles)
southeast of the commercial capital of Lagos with the northern city
of Kaduna some 600 kilometers (380 miles) away, exploded when
thieves sabotaged the line hoping to siphon the oil in makeshift
containers, an official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation
said on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said authorities believed the vandals' tools used
to break the pipe open had caused a spark, setting the pipeline
alight. Witnesses said they heard a load roar and saw the oily
flames spread quickly as the slicks spread.
	   Another government petroleum official, Emmanuel Akhihiero,
expressed shock after arriving on the scene.
	   ``I feel terrible. I cannot believe what I have seen. Corpses,
corpses,'' Akhihiero said in a telephone interview.
	   Vandals and protesters often sabotage petroleum pipelines in
Nigeria both as a way of protesting for greater financial
assistance from the government and multinational oil companies and
to collect the valuable fuel.
	   Despite Nigeria's massive oil wealth, years of government
misrule and corruption have resulted in almost perpetual fuel
shortages that result in skyrocketing black-market prices and long
line-ups by consumers at the gas pumps.

Britain dismisses Chile protests at arrest of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add Chile sending international law expert to
Britain and pledge from Pinochet's family to hire lawyers if
necessary, in graf 15-17 &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dismissing Chile's protest over the arrest in
London of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a Cabinet minister said Sunday
most Britons would find it ``gut-wrenching'' to give diplomatic
immunity to the Chilean former dictator.
	   Chanting demonstrators, delighted at the move, gathered outside
the private clinic in London where the 82-year-old Pinochet is
presumed still to be a patient. He has been under police guard
since his arrest Friday _ in response to a Spanish extradition
request _ for questioning about allegations of murder in the first
decade after he seized power in 1973.
	   Pinochet has been a regular visitor to Britain, generally
without publicity. His arrest this time appeared partly to reflect
a tougher attitude toward right-wing dictators by Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Labor Party government which replaced a Conservative
Party administration 18 months ago.
	   ``The idea that such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be
claiming diplomatic immunity I think for most people in this
country would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff,'' Trade Secretary
Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television
interview.
	   However, Michael Howard, a Conservative Party spokesman and
former Cabinet minister, said he was concerned that Pinochet was
arrested because of pressure from Labor lawmakers and lobby groups.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro, attending a meeting in Oporto,
Portugal, described the arrest as ``universal meddling.''
	   In London, police mounted guard outside a hospital called the
London Clinic. Pinochet's spokesman in Chile, Fernando Martinez,
said Pinochet was in hospital when police came to arrest him. He
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a spinal disorder.
	   ``Gen. Pinochet has committed crimes humanity _ many atrocities,
torture, murder,'' Vincete Allegria, an exile who fled Pinochet's
regime, told reporters outside the clinic.
	   Under extradition laws, Spain has 40 days from last Friday to
lodge a formal request for extradition. The final decision lies
with Home Secretary Jack Straw.
	   There was no immediate word on when Pinochet would be
questioned. But police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said questioning was not expected for a week or two.
	   Relations between Britain and Chile immediately soured, with
Chile maintaining that Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic
immunity.
	   Home Office Minister Alun Michael acknowledged Sunday that
Pinochet had entered Britain on a diplomatic passport, but added,
``That does no necessarily convey diplomatic immunity.''
	   ``He would have provided evidence of coming for medical
treatment, and there's no reason for the immigration authorities to
stop him at that stage,'' Michael said in a BBC radio interview.
	   The Foreign Office said only government officials visiting on
official business and accredited diplomats have diplomatic
immunity.
	   Chile on Sunday sent an expert on international law to London to
argue for Pinochet's release. But Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza said the envoy, Santiago Benadava, will advise
Pinochet in whatever may be necessary, but only with ``diplomatic,
not judicial means.''
	   If the British government refuses to honor Chilean claims that
Pinochet has immunity, then a legal defense may be needed, and that
would be up to Pinochet's family, Insulza said.
	   Pinochet's son, Augusto, said the family would hire ``the best
legal team available in London'' to secure his father's release.
	   Pinochet, who ruled for 17 years, has been widely accused of
running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances and deaths of
political opponents.
	   His arrest was prompted by applications last week to question
him by two Spanish judges investigating human rights violations.
One of them, Baltasar Garzon, also wants to question Pinochet about
the disappearances of Chilean dissidents in Argentina.
	   The arrest warrant, however, referred only to questioning about
allegations that he murdered Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and
1983.
	   In Chile, seven Spaniards have been identified as missing or
dead under the Pinochet regime, including two Catholic priests and
a U.N. official.
	   According to a Chilean government report, a total of 4,299
political opponents died or disappeared during Pinochet's term.
	   Pinochet, commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March,
has immunity from prosecution in Chile as a senator-for-life, and
also under an amnesty covering crimes committed before 1978 _ when
most of the human rights abuses took place.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A train jumped its tracks at a north
Egyptian station and plowed into people on the platform, killing at
least 45 people, Egypt's official news agency said.
	   About 100 people were injured, authorities at the scene told the
Middle East News Agency.
	   The train was traveling from the port of Alexandria to Kafr
el-Sheik when it derailed in the station of Kafr el-Dawar, a town
about 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of Alexandria, the
Interior Ministry said.
	   The train went off the rails when the driver changed tracks ``at
high speed,'' the ministry said.
	   The locomotive and the first two passenger cars toppled over and
careened through people and kiosks on the platform, the ministry
said.
	   Egyptian television showed a crane moving toward one of the
overturned train cars as scores of riot police fended off hundreds
of wailing people. One train car appeared to have crashed into
small buildings near the railway.
	   A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was
speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the brake
system, the news agency reported.
	   Such trains are usually packed with hundreds of commuters,
people often hitch rides on the roof and between the cars.
	   Egyptian television said the injured had been admitted to at
least five hospitals.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam, a practicing surgeon, left his
office in Cairo and went to the site with a team of doctors,
officials said.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A pipeline explosion splashed oil on a
rural Colombian hamlet Sunday and fire raced through the village,
killing at least 45 people and injuring more than 60. Leftist
rebels were suspected in the blast.
	   ``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And no one
knows exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert
Valencia in Segovia, the nearest town. The fire was in Machuca,
about 180 miles (300 kms) north of Bogota.
	   Valencia said y telephone that the 2:45 a.m. explosion destroyed
most of the wood huts with straw roofs in the settlement of about
150 residents, most of them gold miners. The injured were airlifted
to at least six area hospitals, most of them with third-degree
burns.
	   The pipeline was on a rise just above the hamlet, Valencia said.
More than half of the fatalities were children and 34 of the
victims died on the spot, Guillermo Franco, the Antioquia state
health director, said from the state capital of Medellin. He said
all 49 hospitalized survivors were badly burned, under anesthesia
and not able recount their ordeal.
	   Gen. Alfredo Salgado, operations director of the national
police, said survivors described ``a huge explosion and afterward a
ball of flame erupted.'' Army spokesman Col. Paulino Coronado said
the death toll would rise was expected to rise because ``three
entire houses were wiped out by the blast'' and their inhabitants
had not yet been included in the death toll.
	   Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said leftist rebels, who
frequently sabotage Colombia's oil pipelines, were suspected.
	   ``The chances that it was a terrorist attack are stronger than
the chances it was accident,'' he told the Radionet network.
	   ``The people in the area say it was the ELN,'' said Valencia,
referring to the National Liberation Army, which operates in the
area and is blamed for most oil pipeline attacks. There was no
immediate comment from the rebel group.
	   Machuca, which had about 150 residents, was largely burned to
the ground, Valencia said.
	   President Andres Pastrana, in Portugal for a summit of
Iberoamerican leaders, called the incident ``a bloody attack'' and
sent condolences to the victims. He did not directly blame the
rebels but asked them for ``gestures of peace.''

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Thieves sabotaging an oil pipeline touched
off an inferno that razed several villages and destroyed a swath of
surrounding cropland, witnesses and officials said Sunday. At least
250 people were reportedly burned alive.
	   Although an official death toll was not immediately available,
military commander Walter Feghabo ordered a mass burial for farmers
and villagers whose bodies were charred beyond recognition in the
blaze that began late Saturday near the town of Jesse in the
southeastern Delta State.
	   ``I just cannot believe this,'' Feghabo said later in a
telephone interview, after surveying a pile of corpses.
	   Journalists on the scene estimated that at least 250 people _
and perhaps many more _ had been killed. There were 230 bodies in
one pile of corpses, journalists said, and local residents said at
least a dozen other bodies had already been taken away by
relatives. In addition, some of the injured taken to area hospitals
had died, officials said.

Central bankers say dlrs 1.5 trillion traded daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Nearly dlrs 1.5 trillion are traded on
the world's foreign exchange markets every day, 25 percent higher
than three years ago, according to a central bankers' survey
released Sunday.
	   London remained the world's leading financial center. Its share
of total foreign exchange turnover rose to 32 percent from 30
percent in the previous study in 1995, said the Bank for
International Settlements.
	   Second-placed New York also advanced. Its share of transactions
rose to 18 percent from 16 percent. But the Japanese market
declined from 10 to 8 percent.
	   The dollar dominated the market, the study said. It was involved
in 87 percent of foreign currency activity, compared with 83
percent three years before.
	   The BIS report said the average amount of money traded each day
rose from dlrs 1.19 trillion in 1995 to dlrs 1.49 trillion in April
1998, when the survey was conducted.
	   The figures include spot transactions, outright forwards and
foreign exchange swaps.
	   The BIS used data from 43 countries for its report, conducted
every three years. The Basel-based organization groups central
banks worldwide.

Status of Milosevic's promises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The status Sunday of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic must back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's
deadline _ pushed back to Oct. 27 _ or face renewed threat of
airstrikes for his crackdown in Kosovo:
	   _ Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo:
	   Amid a new wave of violence, three Serb policemen died and three
others were badly wounded Saturday by a grenade at a police outpost
in the town of Orlate, 20 miles (30 kms) southwest of Pristina, but
major large-scale fighting has not occurred for about a month.
	   Both sides reported shooting incidents Saturday. Serb police
claimed ethnic Albanian ``extremists'' had attacked them more than
a dozen times across Kosovo. The ethnic Albanians blamed the Serbs
for at least two of the incidents, saying police in Vranjevac had
opened fire.
	   _ Withdraw forces and heavy armaments to levels before the
crackdown began Feb. 28:
	   NATO spy planes continued flying over Kosovo on Sunday to check
on the status of pullouts. NATO says more Serb troops and police
remain in the province than are permitted.
	   On Sunday, western sources said, a Serb column of tanks, armored
personnel carriers and truck left their Pristina barracks and moved
westward down the main highway through central Kosovo, apparently
in response to recent attacks on police by the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   _ Start serious talks with ethnic Albanians on self-rule:
	   No date for the start of talks has been announced. The two sides
have been holding separate discussions with U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill. Ethnic Albanian political leaders reportedly met Saturday in
Turkey to discuss taking a united stand on independence or
autonomy.
	   _ Help refugees return to their homes:
	   Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages but many
remain wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused in
massacres of civilians.
	   _ Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian organizations:
	   The U.N. refugee agency and others have resumed aid convoys for
the past several days, and some workers say Serb police have been
less obstructive.
	   _ Cooperating with the International War Crimes Tribunal:
	   U.N. war crimes investigators have received Yugoslav visas and
plan to return to Kosovo soon.
	   _ Allowing a 2,000-member international verification force into
Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia is keeping its word:
	   An advance team for the monitors, to be overseen by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, arrived in
Pristina on Sunday. OSCE says it hopes a sizable number of monitors
would be in place in Kosovo in two weeks.

Sculptures to be removed amid storm over artist remarks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment, apology from artist &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Protesters on Sunday demanded removal of two
sculptures on display at Israel's Supreme Court after the artist
was quoted as saying disabled and elderly people and homosexuals
are ``superfluous'' and should be ``eliminated by the state.''
	   A court spokesman said the sculptures were already slated for
removal because an exhibit of works by artist Uri Lipschitz had
ended. The artist later apologized for offending anyone.
	   The protesters likened Lipschitz' remarks, made in an interview
published in the weekend magazine of the Haaretz newspaper, to
views of the Nazis.
	   About 100 protesters, made up of members of a leftist political
party, gay and lesbian activists and the disabled and their
supporters covered one of the sculptures with paper on Sunday to
protest the comments. They demanded its removal, along with that of
another Lipschitz sculpture inside the building.
	   ``I understand that my words hurt a lot of people,'' Lipschitz
told Israel's Channel 2 TV. ``I didn't mean to hurt any person or
group or to incite against them. I made a mistake, I'm sorry,'' he
said.
	   Works by Lipschitz were displayed at the court for a month as
part of an exhibit marking Israel's 50th anniversary. The paintings
were taken down Thursday when the exhibit ended, before his earlier
comments were published.
	   Court spokesman Moshe Gorali said the justices ``condemn
severely'' Lipschitz's earlier remarks and added that his views
were not known to exhibit organizers earlier.
	   The sculptures were to have been removed at the end of the
exhibit, but equipment was not immediately available, Gorali said.
They were to be removed within a day or two, he said.

Chile dispatches envoy to Britain to press for Pinochet's release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; By EVA VERGARA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The government dispatched a prominent
diplomat to London Sunday, hoping he can persuade British
authorities to release former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
custody.
	   The envoy, Santiago Benadava, will press Chile's claim that
Pinochet is protected from arrest by diplomatic immunity. Britain
has rejected the claim, saying Pinochet's diplomatic passport did
not shield him from an extradition request by a Spanish judge.
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the envoy would offer
Pinochet only diplomatic advice. Any courtroom counsel Pinochet may
eventually require must be arranged by the former leader's family,
he said.
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested Friday at the request of a Spanish
magistrate who is investigating the deaths of Spanish citizens
during the former leader's often harsh 17-year rule. Pinochet, who
holds a special lifetime seat in the Chilean Senate, was recovering
from back surgery at a London clinic at the time of his arrest.
	   Pinochet's family issued a statement Sunday in Chile Sunday
calling the arrest of the former leader ``an insult'' and thanking
the government, rightist politicians and the military for their
support.
	   The former leader's son, Augusto, said his family would hire
``the best legal team available in London'' to represent his
father.
	   Chile's President Eduardo Frei, attending a summit in Porto,
Portugal, said Spain's extradition request was tantamount to not
recognized Chile's institutions.
	   ``It is only for Chilean courts to try events occurred in
Chile,'' Frei said.
	   Several right-wing politicians, including some who held posts in
the Pinochet regime, also were flying to London to express their
support to their former boss.
	   Others in Chile praised the arrest, saying Pinochet may finally
have to account for alleged abuses committed by his regime.
	   According to a government report issued after Pinochet left
office, 4,299 political opponents were killed or disappeared during
his rule.
	   At least 12 lawsuits have been filed in Chile against Pinochet
by relatives of victims. But his diplomatic immunity as a senator
and a 1978 amnesty law issued by his regime has so far shielded him
from any questioning by a judge.
	   The Chilean capital was the scene of dualing demonstrations on
Sunday, reflecting the longstanding division of public opinion over
Pinochet.
	   Scores of demonstrators joined a march to Santiago's central
cemetery for a memorial ceremony honoring the victims of Pinochet's
government.
	   Almost simultaneously, a crowd of Pinochet supporters rallied
peacefully for the second straight day in front of the British and
Spanish embassies.

	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ A partial West Bank agreement is
likely to emerge from the Mideast summit talks President Bill
Clinton is hosting, but completion of a full accord would probably
take several weeks, diplomatic sources said Sunday.
	   The U.S. administration appealed to the two sides to find the
``political will'' to settle issues that have generated 19 months
of stalemate and extended the talks past Sunday's projected windup.
	   ``It is in the best interest of the peace process and the
discussions we have been having,'' State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said in announcing that the Israeli and Palestinian
delegations would remain overnight at the secluded summit retreat
and that there ``almost certainly'' would be talks on Monday.
	   On the fourth day of talks, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
flew to the Wye Plantations hideaway to work with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
break the impasse.
	   ``There's important work being done here,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters after Clinton and Gore
arrived on separate helicopters. Lockhart said Gore was included
because he has good relations with leaders of both sides.
	   The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which
Israel would exchange territory for tougher action by the
Palestinian Authority to prevent terror strikes against Israelis.
Diplomatic sources said completing a final deal could take weeks or
longer.
	   The negotiations were snagged Sunday over security guarantees
that Israel can expect in exchange for giving up West Bank land to
the Palestinian Authority, diplomatic sources said.
	   Clinton conferred with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
other senior advisers for 40 minutes, then had lunch with Arafat.
The Palestinian leader and Netanyahu have not met face-to-face for
two days, and there has been no three-way meeting.
	   ``There is time to complete the work if the political will is
there to make the tough decisions,'' Rubin said.
	   While diplomatic sources said the likely result of the summit
was a partial agreement, Rubin said ``we have no plan to defer
issues for many weeks.'' He also cautioned that without an accord
``there are serious dangers ahead for the people of the Middle
East,''
	   Palestinian sources told The Associated Press the talks ``have
become very difficult,'' particularly on whether another Israeli
pullback on the West Bank would follow the one being negotiated and
on Israel's demand that terrorism suspects be extradited to Israel
for trial.
	   However, the sources, insisting on anonymity, said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and Danny Naveh,
the Israeli Cabinet secretary, were working on drafts of other
provisions.
	   Also, the sources said, CIA director George Tenet had a long
meeting Saturday with Muhammed Dahlan, Palestinian security chief,
and their ideas would be presented Sunday to the Israelis.

NBA, union await ruling on contracts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS last graf to clarify Gourdine was prohibited from some
testimony &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a critical ruling for the North American
National Basketball Association and the players' union, arbitrator
John Feerick decides Monday whether more than 200 players with
guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout.
	   If the players win, the owners will be liable for about dlrs 800
million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed to appeal
if they lose. The league already has sued the players over
Feerick's jurisdiction.
	   ``If we win, I think it just emboldens the spirit and resolve of
the players,'' union director Billy Hunter said. ``But I don't
think there will be anybody celebrating because there's no
guarantee that it will end the lockout.
	   ``It only means they have to pay some 200 players, and they've
indicated to us their intent to file an immediate appeal and take
it as far as they have to in order to avoid payment.
	   ``So even if he does rule in our favor, at most it's a hollow
victory. The players aren't going to get paid Nov. 15 in any
circumstance,'' Hunter said.
	   If the owners win, it will remove the last wild card the players
had been holding.
	   The sides have not negotiated since last Tuesday, when the union
proposed a superstar tax on the highest contracts. The league made
a counterproposal Friday, asking that the tax be imposed with a
much lower threshold.
	   Hunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday
afternoon, then said both sides would be best served by awaiting
Feerick's ruling.
	   It's unlikely any negotiations will be held this week, since the
union is holding a meeting for all NBA players and the agents
advisory committee in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday.
	   ``We've got to get a sense of where the players are, what they
consider to be reasonable and what they're willing to do in order
to get the season to commence,'' Hunter said.
	   The union filed a grievance with Feerick before the lockout was
imposed July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they
would not honor guaranteed deals.
	   In a six-day hearing over the summer, the union argued that
owners should have protected themselves from being liable for
guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting lockout
language into the standard player contract.
	   The Sacramento Kings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden
Polynice's contract in 1994, and it was approved by the league. The
union used the existence of that clause to argue that all the other
teams should have protected themselves similarly.
	   Most players are due to receive their first paychecks Nov. 15,
although a dozen or so had clauses entitling them to be paid over
the summer. None has received a paycheck.
	   The NBA argued that a tenet of labor law allows employers to
withhold pay from employees during a lockout.
	   The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine to
testify, but Feerick upheld union objections and prohibited
Gourdine from saying whether it was his understanding when he
negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would not
be paid if the owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose a
lockout.

Sculptures to be removed amid storm over artist remarks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment, apology from artist &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Protesters on Sunday demanded removal of two
sculptures on display at Israel's Supreme Court after the artist
was quoted as saying disabled and elderly people and homosexuals
are ``superfluous'' and should be ``eliminated by the state.''
	   A court spokesman said the sculptures were already slated for
removal because an exhibit of works by artist Uri Lipschitz had
ended. The artist later apologized for offending anyone.
	   The protesters likened Lipschitz' remarks, made in an interview
published in the weekend magazine of the Haaretz newspaper, to
views of the Nazis.
	   About 100 protesters, made up of members of a leftist political
party, gay and lesbian activists and the disabled and their
supporters covered one of the sculptures with paper on Sunday to
protest the comments. They demanded its removal, along with that of
another Lipschitz sculpture inside the building.
	   ``I understand that my words hurt a lot of people,'' Lipschitz
told Israel's Channel 2 TV. ``I didn't mean to hurt any person or
group or to incite against them. I made a mistake, I'm sorry.''
	   Works by Lipschitz were displayed at the court for a month as
part of an exhibit marking Israel's 50th anniversary. The paintings
were taken down Thursday when the exhibit ended, before his earlier
comments were published.
	   Court spokesman Moshe Gorali said the justices ``condemn
severely'' Lipschitz's earlier remarks and added that his views
were not known to exhibit organizers earlier.
	   The sculptures were to have been removed at the end of the
exhibit, but equipment was not immediately available, Gorali said.
They were to be removed within a day or two, he said.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Thirty people were killed Sunday when a
train jumped its tracks at a north Egyptian station and careened
across the platform, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Ninety-six people were injured, the ministry's statement said,
referring to hospital figures.
	   Earlier the ministry and Egypt's official news agency had given
death tolls in the forties. A ministry spokesman blamed the higher
figures on confusion at the site.
	   The train was traveling from the port of Alexandria to Kafr
el-Sheik when it derailed in the station of Kafr el-Dawar, a town
about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Alexandria, the
ministry said.
	   The train went off the rails when the driver changed tracks ``at
high speed,'' the ministry's statement said.
	   The locomotive and the first two passenger cars toppled over and
plowed through people and kiosks on the platform, the ministry
said.
	   Egyptian television showed a crane moving toward one of the
overturned train cars as scores of riot police fended off hundreds
of wailing people. One train car appeared to have crashed into
small buildings near the railway.
	   Egyptian television appealed to citizens to donate blood.
	   Residents of Kafr el-Dawar had flocked to the local hospital to
give blood, the official Middle East News Agency reported. Others
at the site had used their own clothes to staunch the bleeding of
the wounded, the agency said.
	   A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was
speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the
brakes system between the cars, the news agency reported.
	   Such trains are usually packed with hundreds of commuters and it
is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on the roof and between
the cars.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam, a practicing surgeon, left his
office in Cairo and went to the site with a team of doctors,
officials said.
	   Egyptian railways have suffered a series of accidents in the
past four years. The most serious was in December 1995 when one
train crashed into another in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people
and injuring 76.

Report: Israeli army believes Hebron settlers planning violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A recent intelligence assessment by the Israeli
army found that extremism among Jewish settlers in the tense West
Bank city of Hebron is on the rise and warned that it could lead to
an act of terror, Israel TV reported Sunday.
	   Written three weeks ago, the classified report characterized the
situation among the settlers as dangerous and suggested that a
settler from the militant Jewish community may be planning an
attack similar to one which American-born Baruch Goldstein carried
out in 1994.
	   Then, Goldstein massacred 29 Muslim worshipers when he sprayed
machine-gun fire into a prayer hall in Hebron.
	   Israel TV said the report found that Hebron's settlers are
showing signs of real distress and a lack of security. They are
uncertain of their future there and are haunted by the threat of
attack from Palestinians, Israel TV reported.
	   The divided city, home to 450 settlers and 130,000 Palestinians,
is a hotbed of violence. In recent weeks, a settler rabbi was
stabbed to death, a Palestinian boy was killed by the Israeli army,
an Israeli woman was shot in the leg and clashes between Israeli
troops and Palestinian youths raged for days. In 1994, an
American-born settler from the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba
massacred 29 Muslim worshipers.
	   The Israeli army said it could not comment immediately on the
report. Spokesmen for the Hebron settlers were not immediately
available.
	   The document also made special mention of Moshe Levinger, the
founder and spiritual leader of the Hebron settlers, who has served
tim in jail for killing a Palestinian in Hebron, noting his
increased involvement in settlement activities and security
arrangements.

Conservatives win big cities in Greece's mayoral races
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Conservatives won two key mayoral races
Sunday to add to the voter backlash against Premier Costas Simitis'
Socialist government, according to exit polls from the final round
of nationwide municipal elections.
	   Victories would give the opposition New Democracy-backed
candidates in the northern city of Salonica and the busy port of
Piraeus control of city hall in three of Greece's key cities.
	   In the first-round elections Oct. 11, Athens' conservative mayor
Dimitris Avramopoulos won re-election by a wide margin.
	   Final election results were expected Monday.
	   Some analysts considered any gains by conservatives to be a sign
of public discontent over the government's austerity measures aimed
at qualifying Greece for the common European currency, the euro, by
2001. But the government has insisted it will not change its
policies, which include aggressive privatization plans and efforts
to trim Greece's vast public payroll.
	   Exit polls predicted that the New Democracy party retained
control of Salonica with the election of former sports minister
Vassilis Papagiorgopoulos. In Piraeus, conservative Christos
Agrapidis toppled the candidate backed by the traditionally
dominant Socialists, according to polls carried by private and
state broadcasters.
	   With general elections two years away, the municipal vote
appeared to erode some of the Socialists' political dominance. The
Socialists have led Greece for all but three of the past 17 years.

Dominicans throw party for Sosa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It didn't matter that he never lived here and
doesn't play here. New York's Dominican community gave Chicago Cubs
slugger Sammy Sosa a welcome home party Sunday.
	   It also didn't matter that he hit only 66 home runs, four fewer
than Mark McGwire. Or that he was two hours late for a breakfast
and then kept his fans waiting in the sun for three more hours as
he hobnobbed inside with politicians and other local dignitaries.
	   It was the moment that Washington Heights, the Manhattan
neighborhood that is home to the largest concentration of Dominican
immigrants in the United States, had been waiting for since Sosa
and McGwire wrapped up their record-smashing home run derby that
energized the baseball season.
	   ``This is what we've been waiting for. He's number one in the
Dominican family,'' said Rafael Perez, an apartment house
superintendent and one of thousands of fans waiting for a glimpse
of Sosa.
	   Many saw it as a symbolic way to dispel the area's long-standing
reputation as a center of drugs and drug-related violence.
	   ``He is encouraging us to to go forward, to accomplish whatever
we can,'' said Alberto Paret, an advertising agency employee.
	   Louis Lora, who was standing nearby, said, ``It is very
important to the community that he comes here. ... He is doing good
visiting the people, and he is a good role model.''
	   Like some others, Lora wondered why the event had such a heavy
police presence. Barricades lined an entire block of Dyckman Avenue
and police sealed off sidewalks on the restaurant side, while other
officers watched from nearby rooftops.
	   On Saturday, Sosa was feted by the city with a parade through
the downtown ``Canyon of Heroes'' and a City Hall ceremony hosted
by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ possibly the first such honor for an
individual baseball player who doesn't even wear a New York
uniform. He threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 1 of
the World Series.
	   On Sunday, the subject was hurricane relief. Invited to a dlrs
500-a-plate breakfast by a local city council member, Sosa was
given a dlrs 15,000 check, money collected in the local community
to add to his growing fund for victims of Hurricane Georges which
hit the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean nations earlier this
month.
	   The Sosa motorcade arrived in the manner of a president's _
flashing lights, guards wearing earphones leaping from cars and
madly slamming car doors as they hustled Sosa into the restaurant.
	   By the time he finally emerged from the Mirage restaurant, the
crowd behind the steel police barricades had grown to about 3,000
people, many chanting ``Sammy, Sammy,'' and waving ``We love you''
signs and Dominican flags.
	   Sosa rewarded them for their patience. Urged toward the open
door of his silver limousine by a phalanx of edgy bodyguards, he
walked into the street and then strolled the length of the block,
shaking hands with his screaming, adoring fans.
	   ``It means a lot to be one of the people who helps others, helps
the poor people. He is blessed by God,'' said David Rodriguez, a
college student.
	   Fior Santiago, attending the event with her 11-year-old son,
Ernesto Herrera, said Sosa was setting a standard.
	   ``He is showing the best of the community. There are a lot of
good people in this community, but they don't all have a chance to
show that,'' she said. ``He has the opportunity to show it and he
is doing that.''

Egyptian train overturns, killing 30

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ At least 30 people were killed Sunday when a
train jumped its tracks at a north Egyptian station and careened
across the platform, authorities said.
	   Health Minister Ismail Sallam said so far 33 people had died and
97 had been injured _ of which 45 were in critical condition, the
official Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The Interior Ministry gave casualty tolls of 30 dead and 96
wounded.
	   Officials warned the death toll was likely to rise and earlier
reports spoke of more than 40 killed. An Interior Ministry
spokesman blamed the higher figures on confusion at the site.
	   The train was traveling from the port of Alexandria to Kafr
el-Sheik when it derailed in the station of Kafr el-Dawar, a town
about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Alexandria, the
ministry said.
	   The train went off the rails when the driver changed tracks ``at
high speed,'' the ministry's statement said.
	   A teenager who saw the crash, Hany Roushdy, said the train was
moving very fast.
	   ``It did not seem to able to stop. It shot off the tracks and
went towards the town square,'' he said.
	   When the train slewed into a wall and shops at the side of the
railway, ``it sounded like thunder,'' said Roushdy, 18.
	   The ministry said the locomotive and the first two passenger
cars jumped the tracks and plowed through people and kiosks on the
platform.
	   Rescue teams used a crane to hoist one of the overturned train
cars.
	   Scores of riot police fended off hundreds of wailing people.
	   Egyptian television appealed to citizens to donate blood.
	   Residents of Kafr el-Dawar had flocked to the local hospital to
give blood, the official Middle East News Agency reported. Others
at the site had used their own clothes to staunch the bleeding of
the wounded, the agency said.
	   A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was
speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the
brakes system between the cars, the news agency reported.
	   Such trains are usually packed with hundreds of commuters and it
is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on the roof and between
the cars.
	   Health Minister Sallam, a practicing surgeon, left his office in
Cairo and went to the site with a team of doctors, officials said.
	   Egyptian railways have suffered a series of accidents in the
past four years. The most serious was in December 1995 when one
train crashed into another in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people
and injuring 76.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Chairs that held the guests at Princess Diana's
funeral service are being sold for 3,000 pounds (dlrs 5,100) each,
The Sunday Times reported.
	   Westminster Abbey, which used the beech and elm chairs until
March, decided to sell them to help defray the cost of new chairs.
Pew Corner, a furniture company located in Surrey, southwest of
London, bought all 800 and now plans to market the chairs to buyers
in the United States, the newspaper said.
	   The chairs come with a certificate of authenticity signed by
Welsey Carr, the dean of Westminster, and a gold-plated plaque
saying, ``This bespoke congregation chair was used in Westminster
Abbey, England,'' The Sunday Times reported. The chairs were
purchased by the abbey at intervals since the 1920s, and some may
have been used during royal weddings and coronations. All were
likely used at Diana's funeral service last year.
	   The paper did not say how much Pew Corner paid for the chairs.
But a similar new chair would cost about 150 pounds (dlrs 250),
according to the paper.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul McCartney credits his late wife Linda with
keeping him sane after the Beatles split up.
	   ``I felt completely useless when the Beatles broke up. I was
probably on the edge of a nervous breakdown,'' he said, according
to the Mail on Sunday.
	   ``She gave me confidence. She said, 'You're great, you're OK,'''
the singer-songwriter said of his American wife, who died of breast
cancer in April at age 56.
	   After the 1970 band breakup, the McCartneys spent time at a farm
in Scotland, where Mrs. McCartney taught her husband how to ride on
horseback.
	   ``We liked doing very simple and very down-to-earth things.
During the time we spent up there I did a lot of sheep-shearing.
It's the only time in my life I had shoulders,'' McCartney said.
``Through the nature in Scotland, through riding and through her
support I did manage to get it back together.''
	   McCartney gave the interview to promote the Oct. 26 release of a
solo album recorded by his wife.
	    &UR; ___
	   BERLIN (AP) _ It was only for a movie, but the damage to
Berlin's historic Brandenburg Gate was real, if minor.
	   A film crew was shooting a scene early Saturday morning where a
car was supposed to zip through the city's most famous landmark.
	   The car sprang from a track, however, and rammed one of the
gate's pillars, breaking off a roughly 30 by 40 centimeter (square
foot) chunk of stone.
	   Police called the damage light and said the arch's structural
integrity was not compromised.
	   The gate was built under 18th-century Prussian rulers in the
heart of Berlin, and was part of the Berlin Wall until 1989.
	    &UR; ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Deborah Harry is still peeved that during her
heyday critics never gave her voice any respect.
	   Instead, they focused on her brash image, Harry says in Sunday's
Los Angeles Times.
	   ``I don't think I was ever reviewed as a singer until a few
years ago,'' said Harry, 53. ``The focus was on my attitude. People
would ask `Why would a woman who could survive on her looks do
that?'
	   ``It was like I was making a political statement.''
	   Harry, who had hits when she was the lead singer of Blondie with
songs including ``Heart of Glass'' and ``Call Me,'' is planning a
Blondie reunion.
	    &UR; ___
	   BURBANK, California (AP) _ Before there was Mickey Mouse, there
was Alice.
	   Virginia Davis, who starred in early ``Alice'' cartoons by Walt
Disney, was honored on Friday at a ceremony marking the 75th
anniversary of Disney studios.
	   ``Walt said it all started with a mouse, but that wasn't quite
true. It started with a girl named Alice,'' said Roy E. Disney,
vice chairman of the Walt Disney Co.
	   ``It's about time, isn't it?'' said Davis, 79, who was 4 years
old in 1923 when Walt Disney turned out a series of cartoons that
combined live action with animation.
	   He went on to make dozens of ``Alice'' cartoons, with various
children as the star.
	   Mickey Mouse didn't make his appearance in a Disney cartoon
until years later.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Thieves sabotaging an oil pipeline touched
off an inferno that ripped through several villages and destroyed a
swath of surrounding cropland, witnesses and officials said Sunday.
At least 250 people were reportedly burned alive. The blaze began
late Saturday near the town of Jesse, about 300 kms (180 miles)
southeast of Lagos, in the southeastern Delta State. The
above-ground pipeline exploded when thieves sabotaged the line,
hoping to siphon the oil in makeshift containers, an official for
Nigeria's state petroleum corporation said on condition of
anonymity. The official said authorities believed the vandals'
tools used to break the pipe open had caused a spark, setting the
pipeline alight. (NIGERIA-OIL EXPLOSION)
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ Prodded by U.S. mediation at the
highest levels, Middle East peace negotiations were stalled Sunday
over key elements of a land-for-peace deal between Israel and the
Palestinians. The Clinton administration appealed to the two sides
to find the ``political will'' to settle issues that have generated
19 months of stalemate and extended the talks past Sunday's
projected windup. U.S. officials said talks would likely continue
on Monday. A significant stumbling block involved security
guarantees for Israel as part of a deal to give up land on the West
Bank to the Palestinian Authority, diplomatic sources said. The
U.S. strategy, at least for now, was to push for a full agreement.
But sources said the likely result of the summit was a partial
agreement. (US-MIDEAST TALKS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dismissing Chile's protest over the arrest in
London of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a Cabinet minister said Sunday
most Britons would find it ``gut-wrenching'' to give diplomatic
immunity to the Chilean former dictator. Chanting demonstrators,
delighted at the move, gathered outside the private clinic in
London where the 82-year-old Pinochet is presumed still to be a
patient. He has been under police guard since his arrest Friday _
in response to a Spanish extradition request _ for questioning
about allegations of murder in the first decade after he seized
power in 1973. Pinochet has been a regular visitor to Britain,
generally without publicity. His arrest this time appeared partly
to reflect a tougher attitude toward right-wing dictators by Prime
Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government, which replaced a
Conservative government 18 months ago. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET).
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As a group of international
observers arrived in Kosovo to oversee the withdrawal of Serb
forces, an armored battle group moved out of its barracks and down
a main highway in an apparent move against ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, western sources said. The destination of the Serb
tanks, armored vehicles and trucks was not known. But the
deployment follows a new wave of violence. It also came on the same
day the first of an expected 2,000 international observers arrived
in Kosovo. The observers are to monitor the withdrawal of Serb
forces from Kosovo, as agreed to last week by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. Milosevic
agreed to the deal after threats by NATO to carry out airstrikes on
Yugoslavia if his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo did not
halt. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A pipeline explosion splashed oil on a
rural Colombian hamlet Sunday and fire raced through the village,
killing at least 45 people and injuring more than 60. Leftist
rebels were suspected in the blast. ``The liquid spilled all over
houses in the village. And no one knows exactly how the fire
started,'' said police officer Robert Valencia in Segovia, the
nearest town. The fire was in Machuca, about 180 miles (300 kms)
north of Bogota. Valencia said by telephone that the explosion
destroyed most of the wood huts with straw roofs in the settlement
of about 150 residents, most of them gold miners. The injured were
airlifted to at least six area hospitals, most of them with
third-degree burns. (COLOMBIA-PIPELINE BLAST)

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The opposition National Action Party called
for a thorough investigation into the shooting of one its
congressmen in an attempted robbery in Mexico City, local media
reported Sunday.
	   National Action congressman Jeffrey Max Jones suffered gunshot
wounds during a scuffle with assailants who apparently tried to rob
him aboard a Mexico City taxi Friday.
	   Both the congressman and his brother, also wounded in the
incident, were recovering from bullet wounds at a Mexico City
hospital, and relatives reported their condition was improving, the
newspaper El Universal reported.
	   Jones was apparently the latest victim of thieves who wait for
travelers to board gypsy cabs at the city's international airport.
	   The congressman, who represents a district in the northern state
of Chihuahua, had reportedly arrived in the capital from there and
boarded such a cab, only to be assaulted by thieves who followed
the cab and forced it to stop at a well-traveled intersection.
	   There have no arrests in connection with the attack.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A series of small quakes shook central
Nicaragua on Sunday, damaging homes near the temblors' epicenter
and killing one woman in an outlying town.
	   Three quakes, ranging in magnitude between 3.4 and 4, rattled
Managua and sent residents scrambling from their homes. Several
smaller temblors were also reported.
	   One woman was crushed by a tree that fell after the first quake
in the village of Ticuantepe, six miles southeast of Managua and
two miles from the quake's epicenter, firefighters reported.
	   Firefighters said they had begun evacuating some residents of
Ticuantepe.
	   Nicaragua's National Seismology Department said the quakes were
related to volcanic activity and movement along local fault lines.
The area is located near the active Masaya volcano, but experts
said there was no apparent threat of an eruption.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ A federally funded economic institute is
advocating a partial government shutdown as a way for Brazil to
save money, the Jornal do Brasil newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Economists with the government-run Economic Research Institute
are proposing the shutdown of nonessential public services,
including embassies, as a way for Brazil to contain its burgeoning
public sector deficit.
	   The deficit, which now stands at about 7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product, has been flagged as one of the
most worrisome indicators in Brazil's financial crisis.
	   The advantage of a partial shutdown is that it can be done
quickly and would not require new laws or Congressional approval,
said IPEA economist Francisco das Chagas Pereira.
	   ``Some agencies can stop for a few months,'' Pereira was quoted
as saying by the Jornal do Brasil.
	   Since Russia's debt default in August, Brazil has lost more than
dlrs 20 billion in foreign reserves, and its stock market has lost
more than 34 percent of its value as investors fled emerging
markets.

Report: Nomura Securities may suffer big fiscal first half loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nomura Securities Co., Japan's top brokerage, may
suffer a group net loss of 150 billion yen (dlrs 1.30 billion) in
the fiscal first half on huge overseas losses amid global financial
turmoil, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The Nihon Keizai business daily, quoting sources it did not
name, said Nomura Holding America Inc., a U.S. holding company, is
expected to record red ink of dlrs 1 billion.
	   Businesses at Nomura's unit in the United Kingdom also posted
poor results, the sources said, according to the paper.
	   The report comes amid recent market rumors about huge losses at
the brokerage that have pushed down the company's share price in
recent trading sessions on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   Nomura Securities in Tokyo said it had no comment on the report.
The company is to announce its interim results for the current
fiscal half-year ended Sept. 30 on Thursday.
	   Last month, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the giant
brokerage's debt rating, pointing to losses in its international
operations and troubles in its domestic business.
	   The Nihon Keizai also said the parent company has suffered
securities valuation losses worth 33.7 billion yen (dlrs 292
million).
	   The daily added that a huge loss in Nomura's real estate
securitization operation was the major cause of red ink in the U.S.
unit, the sources said.
	   Securitization of loans extended to commercial real estate
businesses has been earning the majority of profits at Nomura's
U.S. holding company in the past several years, the report said.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ With campaigns focused on Macedonia's
economic woes, voters in the first round of parliamentary elections
chose between incumbents who led the country peacefully to
independence from Yugoslavia or a team of younger politicians.
	   Under a complicated voting system, only about one-third of the
120 seats were up for grabs in Sunday's voting. The rest will be
determined in a second round of voting on Nov. 1.
	   Only minor irregularities were reported at the polls by Sunday
afternoon. First official results were expected Monday.
	   All 38 parties, including the coalition of former Communists,
social democrats and ethnic Albanians that has been in power since
1992, concentrated their campaigns on Macedonia's economic
problems.
	   Macedonia, which was the poorest of all six republics in the
former Yugoslav federation, remains economically feeble with about
30 percent unemployment and an average salary of dlrs 210 a month.
	   The multitude of parties contesting the third parliamentary
elections since Macedonia abandoned Communist single-party rule in
1990 could mean that none will win an outright majority in the
120-seat assembly.
	   Situated near the volatile Serbian province of Kosovo in
Yugoslavia, Macedonia has disputes with all of its neighbors, and a
restive ethnic Albanian minority. However, the country has avoided
the violence that has engulfed much of the former Yugoslavia.
	   Upon casting his ballot Sunday, the prime minister said he hoped
the future government ``will be able to preserve peace and
stability.''
	   The leading opposition group is a coalition that promises an
economic program it says would attract dlrs 1 billion of foreign
investment.
	   Opposition leader Vasil Tupurkovski, who drafted the program,
cast his ballot at one minute before noon to symbolize that time is
running out to lead the country from its economic crisis.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army tanks and other armor
have moved close to the area of a deadly attack on Serb police in
Kosovo, raising the possibility of retaliatory strikes on ethnic
Albanian guerrillas responsible for the police killings.
	   Western observers said the armored battle group moved out of its
base in the provincial capital of Pristina on Sunday and headed
westward down a main highway through a police checkpoint about 20
miles (30 kms) to the west.
	   Their ultimate destination was not known, but the observers
speculated they were moved in response to recent attacks on police
by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The troop movements come despite the continued threat of NATO
airstrikes. Fearing a NATO attack, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed last week to withdraw his forces from Kosovo. The
alliance has given him until Oct. 27 to comply.
	   It was not immediately clear how many troops had been moved out
of Pristina on Sunday. But because the force is normally stationed
in the capital, it would not have to withdraw under the pullback
plan.
	   The plan, negotiated by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, seeks to
end the bloodshed in Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian
province of Serbia. Serb-led Yugoslav launched a crackdown in the
province in February.
	   Amid the threat of new conflict, more members of an advance team
of an expected 2,000 unarmed international monitors arrived Sunday
in Kosovo.
	   The team was sent by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is responsible for verifying that
Milosevic sticks to the agreement.
	   Principal among the demands is that he decrease the number of
troops and police to levels before the February crackdown. So far,
nobody has specified exactly what those levels are.
	   Asked if he thought his current mission would have an effect on
the rising number of attacks, John Sandrock, the American heading
the Vienna-based OSCE's mission support section, said: ``We hope
that the overall presence of the OSCE can act in a stabilizing
fashion and hopefully we'll resolve many of the issues.''
	   He said the OSCE mission had a one-year mandate, which could be
extended.
	   Three Serb policemen died over the weekend and three others were
badly wounded by a grenade at a police outpost in the town of
Orlate, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of the capital Pristina.
	   The Serb-run Kosovo Media Center in Pristina reported a dozen
other attacks around Kosovo. There was no word of casualties.
	   It was unclear how the any government response to the attacks
would be received by the West, which threatened NATO airstrikes to
end Milosevic's seven-month crackdown. Hundreds have died, mostly
ethnic Albanian civilians, and hundreds of thousands have been left
homeless.
	   Serb officials blamed the stepped up violence on the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``These latest attacks show that the Albanian terrorists are
trying by all possible means to prevent the realization of the ...
agreement,'' said Veljko Odalovic, the head of Kosovo's regional
government, referring to the deal struck by Milosevic and
Holbrooke.
	   Hydajet Hyseni, spokesman for the United Democratic Movement,
which supports the rebels, accused the police of attacking the
``innocent Albanian population,'' and said the KLA was shooting
back in self-defense.
	   The United States and NATO have reported significant pullbacks
by Yugoslav forces in recent days but say numbers still exceed the
level required by the Belgrade agreement.
	   NATO plans for air attacks on Yugoslavia remain on hold after
the North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policymaking body, extended
the deadline for compliance from last Saturday to Oct. 27.

Furyk breaks victory drought
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Jim Furyk, easily the best player without a win
in professional golf the last two years, nearly lost a five-stroke
lead over the last four holes Sunday before making an 8-footer
(2.5-meters) for par on the last hole to win the Las Vegas
Invitational.
	   Furyk ended his victory drought with a putt that nearly lipped
out on the 18th green even as he was pumping his fist in triumph.
	   He finished with a 4-under-par 68 to edge Mark Calcavecchia, who
birdied three of the last four holes to finish a stroke back at 24
under. Scott Verplank was third, another two shots back.
	   ``I always had confidence in myself I was good enough to win a
golf tournament,'' said Furyk, who moved into second place on the
season money winning list. ``But every time you come close and it
doesn't happen, it seems that much harder to get over the hill.''
	   Furyk, two strokes ahead going to 18, had to get up-and-down
from a greenside bunker on the final hole after Calcavecchia,
playing with him in the final group, hit a 7-iron within three feet
(1 meter).
	   He hit his sand shot eight feet (2.5 meters) past the hole, then
hit a left-to-right breaking putt that almost lipped out before
dropping in the right side of the hole. Calcavecchia then made his
putt to finish a 66.
	   Furyk almost celebrated prematurely, however, as the final putt
took a dive to the right before barely dropping in.
	   ``I almost called it too early,'' he said. ``I got kind of
excited. My mind was going 10,000 miles a minute there. I was
pretty tight.''
	   Calcavecchia was the only player to challenge Furyk, and could
have made it even closer if a 20-footer (6-meter shot) for birdie
on 17 had dropped instead of hitting the hole and going by.
	   ``It turned out to be a good show after all,'' Calcavecchia
said. ``Those five- or six-shot wins can be boring. I've had a few
of those myself.''
	   Furyk opened the day with a three-shot lead and led by five
shots as late as 14. But Calcavecchia, who birdied five of his last
eight holes, birdied 15 and 16 and, when Furyk made bogey out of a
bunker on 17, the lead was cut to two.
	   Furyk hit first from the 18th fairway and put it into the right
trap, and Calcavecchia stepped up and hit his shot stiff.
	   ``If Jim missed his putt I knew I was going to make it to get in
a playoff,'' Calcavecchia said.
	   The win was the first for Furyk since the 1996 Hawaiian Open and
the dlrs 360,000 first-place check pushed him past Tiger Woods and
four others into second place on the PGA Tour season money list
with dlrs 1.82 million.

	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ Prodded by U.S. mediation at the
highest levels, Middle East peace negotiations were extended until
Monday after they stalled over key elements of a land-for-peace
deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Eager to nail down a deal, President Bill Clinton and members of
his administration worked well into the evening for a second
consecutive day and extended the difficult talks for at least one
more day.
	   But a senior U.S. official, steering clear of any claims of
progress or optimism, said on condition of anonymity that he did
not think the extension necessarily enhanced prospects for
resolving some of the knotty issues.
	   Nonetheless, the administration appealed to the two sides to
find the ``political will'' to settle issues that have generated 19
months of stalemate and extended the talks past Sunday's projected
conclusion.
	   ``It is in the best interest of the peace process and the
discussions we have been having,'' State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said Sunday evening in announcing that the Israeli and
Palestinian delegations would remain overnight at the secluded
summit retreat and that there ``almost certainly'' would be talks
on Monday.
	   The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which
Israel would exchange territory for tougher action by the
Palestinian Authority to prevent terror strikes against Israelis.
Diplomatic sources said completing a final deal could take weeks or
longer.
	   Clinton met over lunch with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for an hour and 45 minutes, then strolled along the Wye
River.
	   In early evening, Clinton turned to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, meeting with him in the president's quarters for an hour.
	   The president took a one-hour dinner break with his staff and
arranged separate back-to-back meetings later in the evening with
Netanyahu and Arafat. But White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
nothing indicated that a three-way meeting of the three leaders was
in the works for Sunday night.
	   Arafat and Netanyahu have not met face-to-face since Friday.
	   Clinton, who stayed here past 10 p.m. Saturday, was expected to
go back to Washington later Sunday night. Rubin said he did not
know whether the president would return to the bargaining site
Monday, but that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
continuing the negotiations.
	   A significant stumbling block involved security guarantees for
Israel as part of a deal to give up land on the West Bank to the
Palestinian Authority, diplomatic sources said.
	   Palestinian sources told The Associated Press that Arafat's
demand for a phased release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons
remained unresolved. The sources, insisting on anonymity, said that
was the main request Arafat made of Clinton at their meeting
Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, the sources said, Arafat is seeking Israeli
acceptance U.S. monitoring of Palestinian prisons to make sure
terrorism suspects are not set free. This is part of an overall
U.S. proposal for phased Israeli pullbacks linked to anti-terrorism
efforts by the Palestinians.
	   The U.S. strategy, at least for now, was to push for a full
agreement and not sign off on the approach Israel evidently favors
of ``locking in'' the issues resolved and declaring them settled.
	   On the fourth day of talks, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
rode separate helicopters to the Wye Plantations hideaway on
Maryland's Eastern Shore to work with Netanyahu and Arafat to break
the impasse.
	   ``There is time to complete the work if the political will is
there to make the tough decisions,'' Rubin said. While diplomatic
sources said the likely result of the summit was a partial
agreement, Rubin said, ``We have no plan to defer issues for many
weeks.''
	   Palestinian sources told The Associated Press the talks ``have
become very difficult,'' particularly on whether another Israeli
pullback on the West Bank would follow the one being negotiated and
on Israel's demand that terrorism suspects be extradited to Israel
for trial.
	   However, the sources, insisting on anonymity, said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and Danny Naveh,
the Israeli Cabinet secretary, were working on drafts of other
provisions.
	   Also, the sources said, CIA director George Tenet had a long
meeting Saturday with Muhammed Dahlan, Palestinian security chief,
and their ideas would be presented to the Israelis.
	   Rubin denied an Israeli army radio report that Clinton had
warned the Israelis he would support a Palestinian state if no West
Bank agreement was reached. He said that did not ``resemble any
account that I've heard at the Wye talks, and I find it difficult
to imagine.''
	   Netanyahu also denied any such pressure had been applied.
	   ``The reports are baseless, and that option was never discussed
in conversations with the prime minister and his delegation at Wye
Plantation,'' Netanyahu's office said in Jerusalem.
	   Israel's newly appointed hard-line foreign minister, Ariel
Sharon, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai arrived early Sunday
to join the talks. Asked by reporters if he was optimistic,
Mordechai said, ``Yes, I am.''
	   But U.S. officials have made no claims of progress since the
talks began Thursday.
	   At stake was a long-sought accord that would give the
Palestinians control over more land on which they hope to establish
a state.
	   Netanyahu has agreed to relinquish another 13 percent but only
if Arafat takes stronger action against terrorists.

O'Meara, Woods friendship survives, but who's No. 1?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ So, should Mark O'Meara be the
world's top-ranked golfer?
	   After all, he beat his friend and No. 1 Tiger Woods Sunday in
the 36-hole finals of the World Match Play Championship. O'Meara
has also won two of golf's four majors this year _ the Masters and
British Open _ and Woods has only one victory all season on the
U.S. PGA Tour.
	   So is Tiger Woods still No. 1, which he will be when this week's
weekly rankings come out? Or should Mark O'Meara be higher than No.
3 behind David Duval?
	   ``No,'' said O'Meara, who beat Woods 1-up, closing him out with
a 15-foot (5-meter) birdie putt from just off the fringe on the
36th hole.
	   ``If I play well and win The Tour Championship (Oct. 29-Nov. 1),
maybe then I might say yes,'' O'Meara said. ``But right now I
probably deserve being where I am.''
	   Not only did he beat Woods, but he humbled defending champion
and PGA winner Vijay Singh 11 and 10 in Saturday's semifinal _ a
record in the 34-year-old tournament.
	   Woods, who led by three holes after the first 18, gave Sunday's
match away when he three-putted from 10 feet (3 meters) on the 34th
for bogey as O'Meara scrambled for par and a one-hole lead he never
relinquished.
	   He gave O'Meara a vote.
	   '' I'm very happy for Mark,'' Woods said. ``Mark hasn't been
getting enough credit for being as good a player as he is. He's a
great player. He's won two majors, the World Match Play now, with
six top-three finishes. He's getting his just due. It's about
time.''
	   Sunday's final at the 7,006-yard (6,404 meters) West course at
Wentworth was congenial _ and cut-throat _ with O'Meara pocketing
170,000 pounds (dlrs 290,000) and Woods 90,000 pounds (dlrs
150,000), slightly more than they wager on practice rounds at home
in Florida.
	   ``He's still my friend, no matter what,'' Woods said. ``But
still we're playing competitors and I wanted to win the tournament
as much as he did. I know that, he knows that.''
	   The intensity showed early on the 11th when Woods didn't concede
an 18-inch (50 cm) putt, which O'Meara made to win the hole.
	   ``You'll give me this hole, won't you?'' O'Meara shouted across
the green. Woods looked sheepishly away and O'Meara replied, ``I'm
gonna remember that next week.''
	   Then, playing to a gallery at a Wentworth Club evenly divided in
their loyalty, he measured it with his putter shaft _ not once but
twice to roaring applause.
	   ``I know he's 22,'' the 41-year-old O'Meara said later, ``but
I'll have to get him a little WD40 (oil) and loosen him up a little
bit out there.''
	   Hours later, walking down the fairway from the 30th tee (par-5,
12th) _ just minutes before O'Meara mad an eagle to even the match,
knocking a 2-iron 215 yards to two feet (70 cm) _ Woods wrapped his
arms around his friend.
	   O'Meara recounted the conversation. ``Whether I win or you win
or whatever,'' Woods said. ``I just want to tell you it's been a
heck of a match. So I'm just proud to be playing with you and
against you.''
	   On a perfect fall day, the two men linked all season as golf's
No. 1 story, showed why. They lagged long putts to a few inches
(centimeters) _ dropped a few en route _ and rapped long and medium
irons just as close.
	   As luck would have it, it was Woods' mistake on the 34th that
cost him. With a chance to take a one-hole lead _ with two par-5
holes favoring him down the stretch _ Woods three-putted from 10
feet (3 meters) for bogey.
	   ``I hit a bad putt, I pushed it,'' Woods said. ``And I pushed
the second one coming back.''
	   ``But the ebb and flow was tremendous with four or five
shifts,'' Woods added. ``It's a special thing and it can only
happen when you play 36 holes.''
	   In mounting his comeback, O'Meara birdied four of the first
seven holes on the second 18 _ coupled with Woods' first bogey of
the day _ to take a one-hole lead after 25.
	   After that, the lead changed four times as O'Meara held it last.
	   ``To just keep coming through when you have to, when your back
is against the wall, that's meant a lot to me from a maturity
standpoint this year,'' O'Meara said. `Or to be a little iffy at
times _ like I was today _ and still get the job done.''

Talks do little to ease world's nuclear worries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The vaguely worded statement that
emerged from talks between India and Pakistan did little to ease
global worries about the development of nuclear weapons by the
historic enemies.
	   Even the good news that negotiations would resume in February
was tempered by the fact that the two had agreed at the outset of
the talks to meet again as early as next month. Why the delay?
Neither side was saying.
	   Forced to the negotiation table by a nervous world community
following their tit-for-tat nuclear explosions in May, the world's
newest nuclear powers discussed Kashmir, the Himalayan territory
over which the countries have fought two of their three wars.
	   No one expected a major breakthrough on a dispute that has
poisoned relations between the two since British colonial rule
ended in 1947.
	   But the final statement made it appear the uneasy neighbors went
through the motions of the meeting simply to appease other nations,
most notably the United States.
	   The United States and other nations imposed economic sanctions
on both countries after May's nuclear tests. And last month U.S.
President Bill Clinton canceled plans to visit the subcontinent,
saying the sanctions would remain in place until there was some
sign of change in both countries' nuclear policies.
	   Sunday's statement listed the topics discussed, among them
confidence-building measures, nuclear restraint and their
commitment to avert a nuclear war on the South Asian subcontinent.
	   But there were no signs of even the smallest confidence-building
measure and nothing in the documents or in statements of the
foreign ministers indicated how either nation hoped to accomplish
any of the items listed.
	   Some defense analysts, for example, had suggested that the two
could agree to resurrect collapsed hot lines between prime
ministers and military officials without appearing to have given
anything away.
	   But not even that came out of the talks, and it's difficult to
see what did emerge that would allow a world trying to adjust to a
new nuclear order to sleep any easier.
	   Now that India and Pakistan have dropped the veil of secrecy
that surrounded their nuclear programs for nearly two decades, the
next big worry must be whether they will move toward building and
deploying nuclear weapons.
	   It's not an unrealistic worry, given that neither India nor
Pakistan is willing to rule out the possibility.
	   Pakistan says it will deploy nuclear weapons if India does.
India says it's not Pakistan it fears, but a much larger and better
armed China, against whom it fought and lost one war.
	   However, India has not adequately explained its fear of China,
given that Beijing does not have any weapons aimed at India, or
even have ``India-specific'' weapons in its arsenal.
	   But if the nuclear positions of either country moves forward,
the next step has to be weaponization.
	   And apparently the international community will have to decide
again whether it is willing to push even harder, because the nudge
that brought about these talks doesn't seem to have accomplished
much.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Firefighters were battling an oil-fed
inferno that swept through several villages and killed at least 250
people after thieves apparently trying to siphon fuel from a
pipeline sparked an explosion.
	   The fire, which began late Saturday, was still blazing Sunday
night.
	   An official death toll was not available, but journalists and
witnesses on the scene near the town of Jesse, about 300 kilometers
(180 miles) southeast of Lagos, estimated that at least 250 people
were killed.
	   Among the dead were vandals _ including children _ whose corpses
were found still clutching plastic cups, funnels and jerry cans
intended to collect fuel from the pipeline. Many other victims were
farmers and villagers sleeping in their homes.
	   ``I cannot believe what I have seen. Corpses, corpses,''
Emmanuel Akhihiero, an official with the government oil company,
said in a telephone interview.
	   There were 230 bodies in one mound of corpses, journalists said,
and residents said at least a dozen more bodies already had been
taken away by relatives. In addition, some of the injured taken to
area hospitals had died, officials said.
	   Military commander Walter Feghabo ordered a mass burial for
bodies charred beyond recognition.
	   Feghabo said that more than 120 firefighters still were trying
late Sunday to contain the flames in Jesse and the nearby villages
of Mossogar and Oghara.
	   ``I just cannot believe this,'' Feghabo said by telephone after
surveying one pile of corpses.
	   The above-ground pipeline links an oil refinery in the
southeastern city of Warri, 350 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of
the commercial capital of Lagos, with the northern city of Kaduna,
nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles) away.
	   It exploded when thieves sabotaged the line hoping to siphon off
oil, an official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The official said authorities believed the vandals' tools used
to break the pipe open had caused a spark, setting the pipeline on
fire. Witnesses said they heard a load roar and saw oily flames
spread quickly as the slicks spread.
	   Vandals and protesters often sabotage petroleum pipelines in
Nigeria as a way of demanding greater financial assistance from the
government and multinational oil companies and to collect the
valuable fuel.
	   Despite Nigeria's enormous oil wealth, years of government
misrule and corruption have resulted in almost perpetual fuel
shortages that result in skyrocketing black-market prices and long
lines at the gas pumps.
	   In other parts of southeastern Nigeria, ethnic Ijaw youths have
attacked Western oil installations in recent weeks, demanding
schools, better roads and political representation. The weekend
fire, though, was not believed to be related to those incidents.

Report: Mexico's ex-president directed brother to handle bribes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Raul Salinas may have been acting on behalf
of his family _ including his brother, former President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari _ when he stashed millions of dollars in foreign
bank accounts, a Mexican newspaper reported.
	   Citing unidentified sources in the federal prosecutors' office,
the newspaper El Universal reported that Carlos Salinas may have
given his brother responsibility for receiving graft payments and
bribes.
	   Carlos Salinas has denied any knowledge of his brother's
financial dealings, including Raul's transfer of dlrs 132 million
to Swiss bank accounts, some opened under aliases. The former
president has never been charged with any crime
	   Raul Salinas is imprisoned and standing trial on charges of
illegally enriching himself during his brother's administration. He
also is accused of masterminding the 1994 murder of a political
rival, and has been acquitted on money laundering charges.
	   The former president has lived abroad, mainly in Ireland, since
leaving Mexico in disgrace shortly after leaving office in December
1994.
	   El Universal also quoted sources close to the Salinas family as
saying Carlos is now in Cuba, consulting with advisers on how to
defend his brother against money-laundering accusations by Swiss
prosecutors who reportedly plan to seize some of the money on the
grounds it may have come from drug-traffickers' bribes.
	   The newspaper said his trip to Cuba may have been motivated by
fears that he and other relatives might be named in future
accusations.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Chris Osgood stopped 34 shots for his 21st career
shutout and Brendan Shanahan scored his fifth goal of the season as
the Detroit Red Wings beat the Calgary Flames 2-0 Sunday.
	   Mathieu Dandenault also scored for the Red Wings, who have won
three straight since a season-opening loss at Toronto.
	   Osgood is 12-4-4 with three shutouts in his career against the
Flames. The Red Wings extended their unbeaten streak against
Calgary to 6-0-2, last losing to the Flames on Oct. 11, 1996.
	   Dandenault broke a scoreless tie 15:10 into the second period
when his shot from the right point got past Ken Wregget. Shanahan,
who had three goals in Detroit's 4-1 win Friday over St. Louis,
scored on a wrist shot from the left slot past Wregget to give the
Red Wings a 2-0 lead 8:21 into the third period.

Law of the jungle rules the autobahn _ and Germans like it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Driving on the broad, well-maintained
autobahns in Germany can be a test of nerves. The road rules here
have more to do with the law of the jungle than any German sense of
order.
	   With no speed limit, everyone's out to prove who's the fastest.
	   Big sedans and zippy roadsters rocket along at 200 kph (125 mph)
or more, appearing seemingly out of nowhere to fill the rearview
mirror of lesser models that wander into the fast lane to pass a
truck or other slowpoke.
	   Some dart back behind whatever they were trying to get around,
duly intimidated. Those who don't get quickly out of the way must
endure a tailgater flashing his lights until they do.
	   There's even a pecking order of sorts: Volkswagen drivers pull
aside for an Audi, Audi for BMW, and BMW for Mercedes _ depending,
of course, on the driver's testosterone level. Other makes squeeze
in where they can, but everyone bows to the occasional Porsche.
	   ``I love driving really fast,'' says Peter Kadel, a sales
director from Heidelberg who stopped at a rest stop near Bonn in
his purple BMW. ``The faster I drive, the safer I am, because then
I concentrate completely.''
	   But the time-honored tradition of pedal to the medal faces an
uncertain future under the incoming center-left government. The
ecology-minded Greens, the likely junior partner, are especially
intent on slowing down traffic and raising gas taxes to break the
German love affair with their cars.
	   Tabloid headlines expressed shock when the Greens proposed a 100
kph (60 mph) limit. Daytime TV talkmeisters skipped the usual sex
and relationship fare to do shows with themes like ``I drive as
fast as I want.''
	   Self-described ``car-man'' Gerhard Schroeder, who sat on
Volkswagen's supervisory board until he was elected chancellor last
month, quickly squashed the discussion, warning against anything
that might hurt the auto industry.
	   On Saturday, the two parties reached a deal that gives
municipalities more leeway to reduce speeds on city streets, while
leaving the autobahn alone _ for now.
	   Both sides remain open for an eventual ``harmonization'' of
traffic laws with the rest of the European Union, where speeds are
generally capped at around 130 kph (80 mph).
	   ``I'm optimistic that we're going to have a European solution,''
Greens leader Gunda Roestel said, despite the fact that the Social
Democrat expected to become transport minister, Franz Muentefering,
seemed less determined.
	   Studies have shown slower driving is generally safer driving,
but Germans passionately defend their status as the only country in
Europe without a superhighway speed limit. ``Free driving for free
citizens'' is the rallying cry for speed junkies who see themselves
as defenders of a basic human right.
	   ``Personally, I don't understand why other countries have speed
limits,'' says Wolfgang Wuthe, spokesman for Germany's highly
revered ADAC auto club, when asked to explain why Germany doesn't.
	   ``Why should you put a speed limit on the safest roads in the
country,'' asks Franz-Josef Schneiders, spokesman for the federal
Transportation Ministry. ``It's not necessary.''
	   Of course, about 30 percent of the 11,000 kilometers (6,800
miles) of the German autobahn system already has a permanent speed
limit, mainly through urban areas and dangerous stretches. Another
20 percent is temporarily limited _ due to construction or when
weather is bad.
	   On the rest, the government ``recommends'' drivers not exceed
130 kph (80 mph). But hardly anyone listens.
	   Even as the roads get more crowded and the stretches where
drivers can really floor it shrink, support for autobahn limits has
dropped, from 71 percent in 1991 to about half in a poll this year.
	   Some speed limit advocates blame German carmakers for fueling
the lust for speed with advertisements for sleek, fast cars, like
tobacco companies hawking cigarettes.
	   ``That's why it's so hard to stop,'' says Werner Winkler, a
traffic psychologist in Hanover. ``An addiction can't be cured by a
ticket.''
	   Yet in a society where everything from shopping hours to
acceptable names for children is strictly regulated _ and accepted
_ many Germans view the wide open autobahn as a last escape.
	   Manfred, a Muelheim lawyer who only gave his first name, doesn't
like the ``stress'' of autobahn driving, but notices that no one
rides his tail when he's in his Mercedes convertible coupe.
	   ``Germans are under pressure from the government, under pressure
from their employer,'' he explains at the reststop. ``They have no
say in their profession or at home. But on the autobahn, they can
let it all out.''

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Rescue teams were working Monday to
extricate people trapped under a train that jumped its tracks and
crashed into a north Egyptian town, killing 46 citizens.
	   The train injured 101 people when it derailed in Kafr el-Dawar,
about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of the port of
Alexandria, at 5:10 p.m. local time (1510 GMT) on Sunday, said
Nabih Yousef Shaltout, the head of health in the local province of
Buheira.
	   Limbs could be seen protruding from beneath derailed train
carriages early Monday, but police held out little hope of
survivors.
	   Shaltout said most of the injured were passengers on the train,
while most of the 46 dead were people in the town.
	   The train, which was traveling south from Alexandria, left the
rails when the driver changed tracks ``at high speed,'' the
Interior Ministry said in a statement.
	   A teenager who saw the crash, Hany Roushdy, said the train was
moving very fast.
	   ``It did not seem to able to stop. It shot off the tracks and
went towards the town square,'' he said.
	   The train crashed through a wall beside the railway and slammed
into seven shops, police at the scene said.
	   When the train hit the buildings, ``it sounded like thunder,''
said Roushdy, 18.
	   The ministry said the locomotive and the first two passenger
cars had left the tracks. A crane was being used to hoist the
carriages.
	   As hundreds of townsfolk tried to break through a cordon of riot
police armed with shields and bamboo canes, other citizens
responded to calls for blood and other things.
	   Residents donated 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of blood in the
first few hours after the crash, Shaltout said.
	   ``Police asked me to buy 45 coffins and shrouds for the dead,''
said Ahmed Mohammed Abdallah, an inhabitant of Kafr el-Dawar.
	   Some people used their clothes to staunch the bleeding of the
wounded, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency reported.
	   But there were angry scenes outside the local hospital where
police armed with automatic rifles kept relatives at bay.
	   ``I just want to ask about my family,'' yelled one man at an
officer.
	   ``Don't drive me crazy. I have my orders not to let anyone in,''
the officer yelled back.
	   A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was
speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the
brakes system between the cars, the news agency reported.
	   Such trains are usually packed with hundreds of commuters and it
is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on the roof and between
the cars.
	   Egyptian railways have suffered a series of accidents in the
past four years. The most serious was in December 1995 when one
train crashed into another in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people
and injuring 76.

Struggle to save Old World cafes, shrines of Argentine culture

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The sign out front says Las
Violetas is closed. But neighborhood residents continue to slip in
the cafe's side door to an aroma of buttery croissants and dark
coffee.
	   Cups and teaspoons clatter. Caffeine-fueled conversation echoes
off the walls and around antique ceiling lights.
	   Officially, Las Violetas has shut down, going the way of many
traditional European-style cafes in Argentina that have fallen
victim to changing tastes and growing debts.
	   But its waiters, cooks and remaining customers hope to prevent
Las Violetas' demise. The workers took over the building, bringing
in mattresses to sleep on, and invited longtime customers inside.
The owners haven't tried to stop them.
	   Some of the patrons bring sugar, flour and other cooking
ingredients. Others hope their piecemeal purchases can help the
workers persuade the owners to reopen.
	   ``For years, it's been the heart of this neighborhood,'' said
Daniel Tejada, a cook who's leading the occupation.
	   The cafe opened in 1884, and the rainbow-colored French stained
glass, ornate woodwork on a winding staircase and lights dangling
from high ceilings reflect that era.
	   Such Argentine cafes _ known as ``confiterias'' _ have been the
birthplace of revolutions and political movements. Monuments to a
culture bequeathed by European immigrants, they have inspired tango
songs, poetry and books.
	   Now the Old World cafes are an endangered species, sagging under
a falloff in customers, heavy expenses and, in some cases,
mismanagement. Modern, sleeker cafes have gained favor. Tighter
economic times haven't helped either.
	   The list of old cafes that have closed in recent years include
names that evoke for residents the city's rich history: El Molino,
Cafe de los Angelitos, La Victoria, La Paz.
	   And now Las Violetas.
	   The cafe officially closed July 1 after its owners decided the
expense to maintain the building had grown too great.
	   They laid off the staff, or at least tried to.
	   ``We aren't looking just to save our jobs,'' Tejada said. ``We
are fighting to preserve one of this country's monuments.''
	   ``This is Las Violetas!'' he added. ``A part of Argentine
history. It's been in newspapers, magazines, not to mention
survived 100 years in this country _ a pretty hard thing to do.''
	   Their cause is supported by nostalgic Argentines who worry about
losing traditions. The city legislature voted in August to make Las
Violetas and another cafe, La Ideal, historically protected places,
meaning no structural changes can be made to the buildings.
	   Cafes of all kinds still dot Buenos Aires' broad avenues. Many
are packed from morning until night with patrons who gather to
catch up on news or gossip.
	   But the older confiterias are different.
	   ``They have history, a story, a feeling'' said Jorge Vieites, a
manager at La Ideal, one of the few confiterias still open.
	   Another is Cafe Tortoni, where author Jose Luis Borges is said
to have worked on his poems and stories.
	   ``They're an institution,'' said Eduardo Nunez, a film producer.
	   The service of confiterias is reminiscent of another time.
	   ``What we do is an art form,'' Tejada said. ``These guys have
done this for 20, 30, 40 years.
	   ``You have to know how to arrange the little plates on the
table. The one for the butter, the lemon, the hot water, the
cookies, the strainer, the milk.''
	   More than that, Tejada cherishes the friendships forged with
regulars he's served for decades. Many greet him with a hug. ``It's
like I'm a part of the family,'' he said. ``I've seen kids grow up.
I know all about the family problems.''
	   But the younger crowds go elsewhere.
	   ``I guess kids think it's too expensive,'' Tejada said. ``We're
abandoning places like this for fast-food hamburger places.''
	   Still, many of Las Violetas' patrons hope the owners will
reconsider.
	   ``This kind of traditional place has to be preserved,'' said
Silvia D'Albo, stopping in to unwind with an afternoon coffee.

Some Chileans bothered as cafes turn risque

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ For decades Santiago's businessmen and
politicians have traded gossip and sealed their deals in coffee
shops where statuesque waitresses in tight uniforms and high heels
serve small cups of espresso.
	   A case of Latin sexism? Unquestionably. Some Chilean women took
offense, and never had coffee there.
	   But there was little if any public criticism of the popular
cafes, where a stand-up counter and the traditional Chilean sense
of decency stood between the customers in their dark suits and the
women whose style of dress produced the nickname: ``Coffee with
legs.''
	   That is, until the patrons started getting to see a lot more
than just legs.
	   The waitress's uniforms recently started shrinking _ in some
cases right down to lacy underwear or bikinis _ and public concern
started growing. A couple of police raids, uncovering cases of
prostitution, aggravated matters.
	   Santiago's mayor ordered owners to blacken their windows, so
schoolboys couldn't gawk from the sidewalk. Women's rights
activists have declared the shops an abomination.
	   Maria Antonieta Saa, a feminist congresswoman, says the shops
are ``using men's fantasies to sell coffee.''
	   ``It breaks my heart, the exploitation of the girls,'' she said
in an interview.
	   Mayor Jaime Ravinet says the risque cafes aren't breaking the
law, so he can't close any down unless prostitution is proven.
	   ``I hope this is a fad that will not last too long,'' he said.
	   He may have to wait. The chains that operate the cafes, with
names like Luna Negra and Aruba, are seeing profits going up.
	   Miguel Angel Morales, who runs the Baron Rojo (Red Baron) chain,
said his business has grown to some 90 cafes across the city. They
average about 1,000 customers a day who pay 510 pesos (dlrs 1.25)
for a demitasse of coffee.
	   Waitresses at the Baron Rojo cafes get minimum wage _ about
82,000 pesos (dlrs 175) a month _ but their tips from customers can
add up to 10 or 15 times that.
	   ``This is the best job you can have these days,'' said Paola
Contreras, a 22-year-old waitress.
	   To those who say her black bikini is demeaning, she replies: ``A
job lacks dignity only if you lack dignity.''
	   Waitress Eliana Zukova, 25, argues that ``women wear smaller
bikinis at the beach. If you have a nice body there's nothing wrong
with showing it.''
	   One argument for keeping the cafes open seems to win the most
supporters in Santiago, where restaurant coffee often is pale and
watery.
	   ``The coffee is excellent,'' said Dario Leiva, sipping a cup.

Britain defends arrest of Pinochet

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British government has defended its arrest of
former Chilean President Gen. Augusto Pinochet, denying claims by
Chile that Britain violated the former dictator's diplomatic
immunity.
	   In response to a request from Spain, British police arrested
Pinochet in his bed Friday as he was recovering from back surgery
at a private London hospital. Spain wants to question Pinochet
about alleged murders during the first decade after he seized power
in 1973.
	   Chile has protested the arrest, saying that Pinochet traveled to
London on a diplomatic passport and has diplomatic immunity. On
Sunday, it sent an expert on international law to London to argue
for Pinochet's release.
	   ``The idea that such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be
claiming diplomatic immunity I think for most people in this
country would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff,'' Trade Secretary
Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television
interview Sunday.
	   Home Office Minister Alun Michael acknowledged Sunday that
Pinochet had entered Britain on a diplomatic passport, but added,
``That does not necessarily convey diplomatic immunity.''
	   The Foreign Office said only government officials visiting on
official business and accredited diplomats have diplomatic
immunity.
	   Pinochet, now a lifetime member of Chile's senate, has been a
regular visitor to Britain, generally without publicity. His arrest
this time appeared to reflect a tougher attitude toward right-wing
dictators by Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government,
which replaced a Conservative Party administration 18 months ago
and promised an ``ethical'' foreign policy.
	   However, Michael Howard, a Conservative spokesman and former
Cabinet minister, said he was concerned that Pinochet was arrested
as a result of pressure from Labor lawmakers and lobby groups.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro, attending a meeting in Oporto,
Portugal, described the arrest as ``universal meddling.''
	   Police stood guard Sunday outside the London Clinic, where the
82-year-old Pinochet is presumed to still be a patient. Pinochet
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a spinal disorder.
	   A group of about 100 Chilean demonstrators gathered outside the
London Clinic Sunday, some chanting and waving placards bearing
faded black and white portraits with the caption ``Disappeared in
Chile.''
	   ``Gen. Pinochet has committed crimes (against) humanity _ many
atrocities, torture, murder,'' Vincete Allegria, an exile who fled
Pinochet's regime, said outside the clinic.
	   Under extradition laws, Spain has 40 days from last Friday to
formally apply for extradition. The final decision lies with Home
Secretary Jack Straw. He has not said whether he would honor such a
request.
	   The envoy sent to London to argue for Pinochet's release,
Santiago Benadava, would offer only diplomatic advice, said Chilean
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza. Any legal defense would be up
to Pinochet's family.
	   Pinochet's son, Augusto, said the family would hire ``the best
legal team available in London'' to secure his father's release.
	   There was no immediate word on when Pinochet would be
questioned. But police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said questioning was not expected for a week or two.
	   Pinochet, who ruled for 17 years, has been widely accused of
running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances and deaths of
political opponents.
	   His arrest was prompted by applications last week to question
him by two Spanish judges investigating human rights violations.
One of them, Baltasar Garzon, also wants to question Pinochet about
the disappearances of Chilean dissidents in Argentina.
	   The arrest warrant, however, referred only to questioning about
allegations that he murdered Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and
1983.
	   In Chile, seven Spaniards have been identified as missing or
dead under the Pinochet regime, including two Catholic priests and
a U.N. official.
	   According to a Chilean government report, a total of 4,299
political opponents died or disappeared during Pinochet's term.
	   Pinochet, commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March,
has immunity from prosecution in Chile as a senator-for-life, and
also under an amnesty covering crimes committed before 1978 _ when
most of the human rights abuses took place.

Davenports aims for No.1 spot at year end
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous. &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH (AP) _ When American Lindsay Davenport reached number one
in the world rankings last week, she felt she'd reached the
ultimate goal.
	   But after defeating compatriot Venus Williams 7-5, 6-3 in the
final of the European Championships on Sunday, Davenport has
decided she quite likes the view from the top.
	   ``At first I was just happy to become world No.1 for the first
time in my career,'' said Davenport, who brought to an end Martina
Hingis's 80-week stay atop the world rankings last Monday. ``But
now my goal is to finish the year as one.
	   ``Once you get to No.1 it's nice to win and keep playing as well
as you did to get there,'' deemed Davenport. ``You can't help but
want to remain there _ maybe even end the year in one.''
	   Davenport, who began her reign in Hingis' own backyard, held a
396 point lead at the start of the week over the Swiss star, who
withdrew from her home tournament with a strained ankle.
	   The four-time Grand Slam champion will likely resume play in
Philadelphia and then end the season at the Chase Championships in
New York.
	   After pulling out of this week's WTA stop in Moscow because of a
sore arm, Davenport will close out her campaign by playing the same
two events as Hingis, setting up a number one showdown with the
Swiss teen-ager.
	   While Davenport diffused any suggestion of a bitter battle
brewing over the final weeks of the season, the soft-spoken
22-year-old American made no secret of her determination to hold
onto her mantle.
	   ``Both of us did well in Philly last year so I think it will all
come down to New York, which is very exciting,'' said the U.S. Open
champion. ``It's not a battle by any means, but it's kind of fun to
compete with her to see who will end the year No.1.''
	   While the American was convincing in her role the world's top
women's tennis player in Zurich _ defending her crown without
dropping a set _ Davenport admitted feeling the pressures attached
to her new status.
	   ``There was pressure for sure,'' said Davenport. ``It was my
first week and I had to defend my tier-one title. I had a lot of
points to defend, and people talking about how the race is really
close.
	   ``People are saying `she's No.1 but does she deserve it?' and
you always get that talk,'' Davenport said. ``But I think I handled
the situation well, and I tried not to let anything worry me.''
	   Davenport's worries are not limited to Hingis storming back to
reclaim her position in the immediate future.
	   She also must deal with her younger compatriot Venus Williams,
who announced early in her tender career her aspirations of
becoming the world's top player.
	   The 18-year-old American has three career singles titles, has
twice broken the record for the fastest women's serve this year,
reached seven finals in 14 events this season and is currently
ranked fifth in the world.
	   ``I played her here a year ago and she's a far better player
this year,'' said Davenport, who eliminated Williams in the
quarterfinals 6-0, 6-4 in Zurich last year. ``And she's still young
and she's going to get better. She's by far the most athletic girl
on the Tour.
	   ``I definitely think she can be No.1 in a couple of years if
things keep progressing the way they are,'' estimated Davenport.
``I'm not going to bet against her. I'm not going to bet against
Hingis either.''

Chile dispatches envoy to Britain to press for Pinochet's release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with daughter of regime victim
reporting death threats; ADDS more quotes from Chilean president. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Pinochet &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The Chilean government has dispatched a
prominent diplomat to London, hoping he can persuade British
authorities to release former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
custody.
	   The envoy, Santiago Benadava, will press Chile's claim that
Pinochet is protected from arrest by diplomatic immunity. Britain
has rejected the claim, saying Pinochet's diplomatic passport did
not shield him from questioning by a Spanish judge.
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the envoy would offer
Pinochet only diplomatic advice. Any courtroom counsel Pinochet may
eventually require must be arranged by the former leader's family,
he said.
	   The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at the request of a
Spanish magistrate who is investigating the deaths of unidentified
Spanish citizens during the former leader's often harsh 17-year
rule. He was recovering from back surgery at a London clinic at the
time of his arrest.
	   Pinochet's family issued a statement Sunday in Chile calling the
arrest ``an insult'' and thanking the government, rightist
politicians and the military for their support.
	   The former leader's son, Augusto, has said his family would hire
``the best legal team available in London'' to represent his
father, who has a lifetime seat in Chile's senate.
	   Several right-wing politicians, including some who held posts in
the Pinochet regime, also were flying to London to show their
support to their former boss.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei said the request by Spanish
magistrate Sebastian Garzon that triggered Pinochet's arrest was
tantamount to not recognizing Chile's institutions.
	   ``Spain also lived under an authoritarian for 40 years and many
of its present institutions are inherited from of that regime,''
Frei said in Porto, Portugal, where he was attending the
Ibero-American Summit. ``What would happen if we were to disrespect
those Spanish institutions?''
	   ``Would a Chilean court be allowed to start trial for abuses
occurred under the Spanish authoritarian regime?'' of Francisco
Franco, which ended in 1975, Frei asked. ``It is only for Chilean
courts to try events that occurred in Chile.''
	   According to a government report issued after Pinochet left
office, 4,299 political opponents were killed or disappeared during
his rule.
	   At least 12 lawsuits have been filed in Chile against Pinochet
by relatives of victims. But his diplomatic immunity as a senator
and a 1978 amnesty law issued by his regime has so far enabled him
to skirt any response.
	   The Spanish government has 40 days from the time of Friday's
arrest to submit a formal extradition request. If Spain files the
request, then the final decision on extradition rests with Home
Secretary Jack Straw.
	   The Chilean capital was the scene of dueling demonstrations on
Sunday, reflecting the long-standing division of public opinion
over Pinochet.
	   A crowd of Pinochet supporters rallied peacefully for the second
straight day in front of the British and Spanish embassies.
	   Almost simultaneously, scores of demonstrators celebrating
Pinochet's detention joined a march to Santiago's central cemetery
for a ceremony in memory of the victims of Pinochet's government.
	   One of the demonstrators, Carmen Soria, told reporters she had
received death threats since the arrest.
	   Soria, the daughter of a Spanish U.N. official killed during
Pinochet's regime, said she had reported the telephoned threats to
the Spanish government, which has asked Chilean authorities to
provide her police protection.
	   Carmelo Soria was working for a U.N. think-tank in Santiago in
1976 when he arrested. Two days later, his body was found in a car
at the bottom of a canal.

Quigley wins Gold Rush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EL DORADO HILLS, California (AP) _ Dana Quigley birdied four
straight holes on the back nine and shot a final-round 64 to win
the Raley's Senior Gold Rush Classic by three strokes.
	   Quigley started the final round Sunday in a four-way tie for
second, three strokes behind John Morgan, and finished with a
12-under 202 total at the Serrano Country Club course.
	   Morgan, who shot a course-record 63 Saturday, began the final
round with seven straight pars. He made the turn at 10 under, one
stroke ahead of Quigley, who was playing one group ahead, and
finished second after a 70.
	   David Graham, who shot a final-round 67, finished third at 207,
one stroke ahead of Dale Douglass (69) and Allen Doyle (68).
	   Quigley and Morgan matched pars for three holes on the back nine
before Quigley started his birdie spree on No. 13 that led him to
his second victory of the year and third in his two seasons on the
Senior PGA Tour.
	   Quigley, who won the Emerald Coast Classic last month, played
the final 20 holes of the tournament without a bogey.
	   ``When I get my putter going, I'm as good as anyone out here,''
said Quigley, a non-winner in his nearly 20-year PGA Tour career.
	   Quigley, whose dlrs 150,000 winner's purse pushed him over the
dlrs 1 million mark for the season, nearly made five straight
birdies. His chip shot from the fringe hit the pin and rolled two
feet (70 cms) away on 17.

Zanardi after eighth win to tie CART record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) _ With seven CART FedEx series
wins under his belt this season, Italian Alex Zanardi can only hope
a potential record-tying eighth in two weeks comes as easy as the
end of Sunday's Australian IndyCarnival.
	   A race-long duel with Dario Franchitti of Scotland, the
circuit's other top performer this season, ended in familiar
circumstances _ under a yellow flag. On several occasions late in
the race, just when it appeared that Franchitti, winner of three of
his past four races, might catch Zanardi, a caution flag put an end
to the threat.
	   ``The only chance I had to catch him was on one of those
restarts,'' Franchitti said after following Zanardi meekly across
the finish line. ``Other than that, I couldn't get close enough.''
	   Zanardi, who is heading to the Williams team in Formula One next
season, can tie for the most number of victories in a season if he
wins the Marlboro 500 in California on Nov. 1. Michael Andretti, in
1991, and Al Unser Jr., in 1994, have won eight races in a single
season.
	   The Italian driver has reached 15 career wins faster than any
driver in CART history.
	   In a race slowed by seven cautions for a total of 19 laps,
Zanardi finished .322 seconds ahead of pole winner Franchitti. The
race was shortened from its scheduled 65 laps to 2 hours, allowing
only 62 laps to be completed on the 4.5-kilometer (2.795-mile)
Surfers Paradise street circuit.
	   The win came after Zanardi, driving a Target/Chip Ganassi
Reynard Honda, edged ahead of Franchitti on a 13th-lap pit change _
the race's only lead change _ allowing the Italian to begin early
celebrations for his 32nd birthday on Friday.
	   Third place went to Christian Fittipaldi, who broke his leg in
an accident in last year's race here, while fourth was claimed by
defending champion Scott Pruett and fifth J.J. Lehto of Finland.
	   Seven cars went out of the race due to contact on the track,
including previous Australian winners Andretti (1994), Paul Tracy
(1995), Jimmy Vasser (1996) and the retiring Bobby Rahal.
	   Tracy and Andretti blamed each other for a collision between the
two. Following the race, CART announced that chief steward Wally
Dallenbach will conduct a review of videotapes of the incident with
both drivers on Oct. 30 before the Marlboro 500, with the
possibility that disciplinary action will be taken.
	   Zanardi celebrated his win by doing five of his trademark
``doughnut'' circular spins in his car on the track immediately
after the race.
	   ``This circuit seems to be designed for my driving, so I'm very
pleased to come away with a win,'' said Zanardi. ``We have always
gone fast here, but victory seemed to have escaped us.''
	   Queensland state government officials and race organizers met
Monday with CART executives to discuss the future of the race. The
current contract with CART has two years to run, but the groups
hope to sign a new deal that will extend the race from 2000 for
another five years. (djp)

Hundreds of Salvadorans survive at nation's huge trash dump

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Eleven-year-old Patricia
Yamilet's first baby doll came from the garbage dump where she
lives with her parents.
	   So does their food. So did the cardboard and wood used to build
the shack they call home.
	   ``I have always lived here, working,'' says Patricia, one of
dozens of children who recycle trash rather than go to school.
``Ever since I can remember, I've worked to help my parents.''
	   The market-based reforms that have fueled El Salvador's economic
growth since civil war ended in 1992 have not trickled down to the
poorest in this Central American nation of 5.5 million people.
	   The Economics Ministry's statistics office says nearly 8 percent
of working age people don't have jobs. The private National Council
of Science and Technology says unemployment and underemployment
combined are as high as 40 percent.
	   In their battle to survive, many Salvadorans become vendors
selling plastic trinkets at traffic intersections, or criminals _
or trash pickers.
	   ``I live from this trash. From it I get clothes and food for my
four children,'' said Alejandra del Carmen Osegueda, 26, who hikes
the reeking mountains of garbage daily, collecting aluminum cans,
bottles and other sellable items.
	   About 700 people live at the 25-hectare (60-acre) dump on the
northern edge of the nation's capital, where an estimated 1,500
metric tons of garbage from the municipal area is left daily.
	   They have a village of shacks built with scraps of tin,
laminated fiberglass, cardboard and wood at the dump's entrance.
There is no electricity or plumbing.
	   ``My youngest son was born here and he is now 2,'' said Susana
Ortiz, 57. ``We don't have water, or medicine, and we eat what we
can. But thanks to God we never have gotten sick.''
	   Every day the trash pickers fan out over the hills of garbage,
usually in organized work crews. About two-thirds of the scavengers
are children, some as young as 5, according to a study by El
Salvador University.
	   Like Patricia, most children who live at the dump have never
been to school. Instead, they spend their days searching for paper,
plastic, cloth and glass to be sold by their parents for the family
income.
	   Patricia also helps her neighbors keep an eye on their
3-month-old son, Wilfred. The infant smiles and hugs her with his
dirty little arms when she picks him up.
	   ``My wife searches in the trash for a while, and then I do,''
said the boy's father, Matilde Guardado, 38. ``Whoever stays behind
watches the boy.''
	   The couple and their eight children live in a shack at the dump,
but during the day, Wilfred naps in a dismantled car. Together, the
couple earn about 80 colons a day _ nearly dlrs 9 _ scavenging
recyclable materials.
	   While some hope that being a trash picker is just a temporary
job, others accept it as a way of life. Many expect to move to a
new 70-hectare (170-acre) dump nearby that will replace the current
dump early next year.
	   ``All my life I have worked sifting through the garbage,'' said
Ortiz. ``My parents first brought me here when I was 12. Now look
at me, I have been doing this work for 46 years.''

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Rescue teams were working Monday to pull out
people trapped under a train that jumped its tracks and crashed
into a crowded platform in northern Egypt, killing at least 46
people.
	   The train also injured 101 people when it derailed in Kafr
el-Dawar, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the port of
Alexandria, late Sunday afternoon, said Nabih Yousef Shaltout, the
head of health in the local province of Buheira.
	   Limbs protruded from beneath the derailed train carriages early
Monday, but police held out little hope of survivors.
	   Shaltout said most of the dead were bystanders, while most of
the injured people were passengers on the train.
	   The train, which was traveling south from Alexandria, left the
rails when the driver changed tracks ``at high speed,'' the
Interior Ministry said.
	   A teen-ager who saw the crash, Hany Roushdy, said the train was
moving very fast.
	   ``It did not seem to able to stop. It shot off the tracks and
went toward the town square,'' he said.
	   The train crashed through a wall beside the railway and slammed
into seven shops, police at the scene said.
	   When the train hit the buildings, ``it sounded like thunder,''
said Roushdy, 18.
	   The ministry said the locomotive and the first two passenger
cars had left the tracks. A crane was being used to hoist the
carriages.
	   As hundreds of townsfolk tried to break through a cordon of riot
police armed with shields and bamboo canes, other citizens
responded to calls to donate blood and other rescue supplies.
	   Residents donated 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of blood in the
first few hours after the crash, Shaltout said.
	   ``Police asked me to buy 45 coffins and shrouds for the dead,''
said Ahmed Mohammed Abdallah, a resident of Kafr el-Dawar.
	   Some people used their clothes to staunch the bleeding of the
wounded, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency reported.
	   But there were angry scenes outside the local hospital, where
police armed with automatic rifles kept relatives at bay.
	   ``I just want to ask about my family,'' one man yelled at an
officer.
	   ``Don't drive me crazy. I have my orders not to let anyone in,''
the officer yelled back.
	   A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was
speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the brake
system between the cars, the news agency reported.
	   Such trains are usually packed with hundreds of commuters and it
is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on the roof and between
the cars.
	   Egyptian railways have suffered a series of accidents in the
past four years. The most serious was in December 1995 when one
train crashed into another in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people
and injuring 76.

Movement to rebuild the Jewish Temple enters mainstream

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ At the foot of the Temple Mount, dozens of
people waving Israeli flags and blowing rams' horns crowded around
a man with a knitted skullcap shouting into a bullhorn.
	   The time has come to rebuild the Jewish Temple destroyed two
millenniums ago, said Gershon Solomon of the Temple Mount Faithful,
a group that advocates razing the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock
mosques now on the site.
	   ``We came to say to the whole world that the Arab occupation of
the Temple Mount is finished forever,'' Solomon said before leading
his followers up a ramp to the mosque compound's Moghrabi Gate
during a rally on Oct. 7.
	   Underscoring his point, Solomon brought along a flatbed truck
carrying a 4 1-2 -ton marble ``cornerstone'' for a new temple.
	   Israeli police blocked Solomon at the Moghrabi Gate and
prevented the truck parked about 200 yards (180 meters) away from
unloading its cargo.
	   Only a decade ago, people like Solomon were dismissed as
eccentrics on the fringe of Israeli society. Most observant Jews
stayed away from the Temple Mount, heeding rabbis' rulings that
they cannot tread on such holy soil unless they have undergone an
extensive ritual of purification.
	   However, in recent years those seeking to reclaim the Temple
Mount for the Jews have increasingly moved into the mainstream,
winning support from some rabbis and prominent politicians.
	   A Jerusalem convention of the movement in September drew some
1,000 people _ double last year's turnout _ who cheered speaker
after speaker demanding that the building of a new temple.
	   In the convention center, musicians in biblical costumes coaxed
wailing sounds from replicas of silver trumpets played at
ceremonies in the ancient Jewish Temple before it was torn down by
Roman soldiers. A large oil painting depicted a fantasy scene of
Jews filing out of 20th century buses into a new shrine.
	   The movement's growing legitimacy could encourage violence, warn
experts who track extremist groups. Israeli police reportedly
beefed up their watch over the Temple Mount recently amid warnings
that Jewish militants were plotting attacks on Muslims worshippers.
	   Even the slightest confrontation can trigger violence over the
Temple Mount, known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble
Sanctuary.
	   When rumors spread one day in October 1990 among Muslims that
Solomon and his followers planned to take over the mosque compound,
Palestinian riots erupted. Israeli police stormed the site and
killed 17 Palestinians.
	   In 1996, Israel's opening of an archaeological tunnel alongside
the Temple Mount triggered Palestinian protests that escalated into
gunbattles that killed 80 people.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas,
said an attempt by Jewish militants to seize control of the Islamic
shrines would lead to a bloodbath. ``They will start a fire in
which they shall perish,'' Yassin said.
	   The Temple Mount is in the walled Old City, which was captured
by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Immediately after the war, then-Defense Minister Moshe Dayan
decided to give Muslim clerics from the Islamic Trust, or Waqf,
autonomy in administering the mosques.
	   Jews were allowed to enter the compound, but could not pray.
	   At the time, Dayan did not want to provoke the Muslim world by
taking control of the Temple Mount. He did not face opposition at
home because of the rabbinical ban on Jews visiting the site.
	   Yet, the 1967 war planted the seeds for the movement to reclaim
the Temple Mount for the Jews. Israel's capture of the West Bank,
Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem _ part of the biblical Land of Israel
_ was seen by some as a sign from God that the messianic age of
redemption was drawing near, a time to rebuild the Jewish Temple.
	   At first, there were just a few firebrands, such as Solomon and
Yehuda Etzion, who served four years in prison in the 1980s for
plotting to blow up the mosques.
	   From time to time, usually on Jewish holidays, they would try to
enter the compound. Police would bar them. Sometimes, they'd walk
way. Sometimes, they'd get arrested.
	   But in recent years, the movement to reclaim the Temple Mount
has gained a new respectability.
	   In 1995, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the time the
opposition leader, asserted the right of Jews to pray on the Temple
Mount. At the gathering of the temple movement in September, Deputy
Education Minister Moshe Peled sent videotaped greetings.
	   ``Without a doubt, there is an increase in numbers,'' said Hanan
Porat, a legislator in Netanyahu's coalition and a patron of the
Jewish settlement movement in the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Porat said he and Peled were helping to lend greater legitimacy
to the movement. He said the immediate goal is to fight for
permission for Jews to pray on the Temple Mount, until the day
``when, with the help of God, the Waqf won't be there.''
	   Porat said there was nothing wrong with dreaming about a new
temple. He dismissed concerns that encouraging such ideas could
tempt some to take violent action.
	   Ehud Sprinzak, an academic who studies right-wing groups in
Israel, said that as long as Jerusalem's future remains uncertain,
Jewish radicals will probably not feel compelled to take action.
	   However, this would change if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
goes ahead with plans to declare a Palestinian state in May, with
east Jerusalem as its capital, or if the Israeli government agrees
in a future peace agreement to give up parts of the city, Sprinzak
said.
	   Menachem Friedman, a sociologist at Bar Ilan University, said
Porat and others are playing with fire. ``No one can be sure where
it will end,'' he said.

Rebels suspected in deadly pipeline explosion

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana has pleaded
for ``gestures of peace'' from leftist rebels suspected in an oil
pipeline blast that killed 45 villagers and injured 60 when it sent
flames racing through a rural hamlet.
	   Officials were still investigating the explosion in Machuca, a
village 180 miles (300 kms) from Bogota, but they said late Sunday
that evidence pointed to Colombia's second-largest rebel group, the
National Liberation Army, or ELN.
	   The group has carried out 62 dynamite attacks on pipelines this
year, protesting what it calls government subservience to foreign
oil companies.
	   ``Evidently it was a terrorist attack,'' Defense Minister
Rodrigo Lloreda said in a television interview, citing army
inspections of the pipeline wreckage and of a nearby bridge which
he said was also blown up early Sunday.
	   If rebel involvement is proven, said Lloreda, it would be a
``severe blow'' to efforts to end a 34-year civil war.
	   Pastrana, who spoke Sunday from Portugal where he was attending
a summit of leaders from Spain, Portugal and Latin America, is
scheduled to begin peace talks with Colombia's other major guerilla
faction Nov. 7.
	   Sunday's deaths occurred exactly a week after ELN leaders held
talks with government and civilian officials to prepare the agenda
for separate peace talks that are to begin in February.
	   Television reports Sunday evening showed survivors sifting
through blackened houses and dozens of charred corpses _ many those
of small children_ laid out on the floor of a church in Segovia,
the town nearest the afflicted village of 150 residents in central
Antioquia state.
	   Most of the victims died on the scene and were women and
children, health officials said. The injured, many with second- and
third-degree burns over forty to sixty percent of their bodies,
were airlifted to six hospitals.
	   The fires began sometime before dawn Sunday when an explosion
tore through the elevated pipeline, sending oil gushing toward a
cluster of wooden, straw-roofed homes located below.
	   ``The liquid spilled all over houses in the village. And no one
knows exactly how the fire started,'' said police officer Robert
Valencia in Segovia.
	   Gen. Alfredo Salgado, operations director of the national
police, said survivors described ``a huge explosion and afterward a
ball of flame erupted.''
	   There was no immediate comment from the ELN, which typically
sabotages pipelines in unpopulated areas.
	   The blast shut down the Colombia Central pipeline, which
transports 100,000 barrels of crude oil daily from oil fields in
east-central Colombia to the Caribbean coast.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The Chilean government has dispatched a
prominent diplomat to London, hoping he can persuade British
authorities to release former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
custody.
	   The envoy, Santiago Benadava, will press Chile's claim that
Pinochet is protected from arrest by diplomatic immunity. Britain
has rejected the claim, saying Pinochet's diplomatic passport did
not shield him from questioning by a Spanish judge.
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the envoy would offer
Pinochet only diplomatic advice. Any courtroom counsel Pinochet may
eventually require must be arranged by the former leader's family,
he said.
	   The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at the request of a
Spanish magistrate who is investigating the deaths of unidentified
Spanish citizens during the former leader's often harsh 17-year
rule. He was recovering from back surgery at a London clinic at the
time of his arrest.
	   Pinochet's family issued a statement Sunday in Chile calling the
arrest ``an insult'' and thanking the government, rightist
politicians and the military for their support.
	   The former leader's son, Augusto, has said his family would hire
``the best legal team available in London'' to represent his
father, who has a lifetime seat in Chile's senate.
	   Several right-wing politicians, including some who held posts in
the Pinochet regime, also were flying to London to show their
support to their former boss.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei said the request by Spanish
magistrate Sebastian Garzon that triggered Pinochet's arrest was
tantamount to not recognizing Chile's institutions.
	   ``Spain also lived under an authoritarian for 40 years and many
of its present institutions are inherited from of that regime,''
Frei said in Porto, Portugal, where he was attending the
Ibero-American Summit. ``What would happen if we were to disrespect
those Spanish institutions?''
	   ``Would a Chilean court be allowed to start trial for abuses
occurred under the Spanish authoritarian regime?'' of Francisco
Franco, which ended in 1975, Frei asked. ``It is only for Chilean
courts to try events that occurred in Chile.''
	   According to a government report issued after Pinochet left
office, 4,299 political opponents were killed or disappeared during
his rule.
	   At least 12 lawsuits have been filed in Chile against Pinochet
by relatives of victims. But his diplomatic immunity as a senator
and a 1978 amnesty law issued by his regime has so far enabled him
to skirt any response.
	   The Spanish government has 40 days from the time of Friday's
arrest to submit a formal extradition request. If Spain files the
request, then the final decision on extradition rests with Home
Secretary Jack Straw.
	   The Chilean capital was the scene of dueling demonstrations on
Sunday, reflecting the long-standing division of public opinion
over Pinochet.
	   A crowd of about 1,000 Pinochet supporters rallied for the
second straight day in front of the British and Spanish embassies.
	   The rallies were mostly peaceful, although riot police used tear
gas and water canons on some protesters trying to break through
police lines into the British embassy on Sunday evening. No arrests
or injuries were reported.
	   Also Sunday, scores of demonstrators celebrating Pinochet's
detention joined a march to Santiago's central cemetery for a
ceremony in memory of the victims of Pinochet's government.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Rescue teams were working Monday to retrieve
people trapped under a train that jumped its tracks and crashed
into a north Egyptian town, killing at least 47 citizens.
	   The train injured also 101 people when it derailed in Kafr
el-Dawar, about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of the port of
Alexandria, at 5:10 p.m. local time (1510 GMT) on Sunday, said
Nabih Yousef Shaltout, the head of health care in the local
province of Buheira.
	   Limbs protruded from beneath derailed train carriages early
Monday, but police held out little hope of survivors.
	   Shaltout said most of the 47 dead were bystanders in the town,
while most of the injured were passengers on the train.
	   Town residents who helped transport the casualties to hospitals
said they must have seen well over 50 dead.
	   The train, which was traveling south from Alexandria, left the
rails when the driver changed tracks ``at high speed,'' the
Interior Ministry said in a statement.
	   A teenager who saw the crash, Hany Roushdy, said the train was
moving very fast.
	   ``It did not seem to able to stop. It shot off the tracks and
went towards the town square,'' he said.
	   The train crashed through a wall beside the railway, hit a war
memorial in the square and slammed into seven shops, witnesses
said.
	   When the train hit the buildings, ``it sounded like thunder,''
said Roushdy, 18.
	   A businessman in the square, Mustafa Attiya, said he heard girls
screaming. ``I turned around and saw the train shoot across and hit
the girls.''
	   The train snared the leg of a fruit vendor. Taxi driver Saeid
Saleh said the merchant was screaming ``Help me! Help me!''
	   People did manage to free him, but he emerged with blood gushing
from his leg, Saleh said.
	   A crane was brought in to hoist the locomotive and the first two
passenger cars, which had overturned.
	   As hundreds of townsfolk tried to break through a cordon of riot
police armed with shields and bamboo canes, other citizens
responded to calls for blood and other things.
	   Residents donated 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of blood in the
first few hours after the crash, Shaltout said.
	   ``Police asked me to buy 45 coffins and shrouds for the dead,''
said Ahmed Mohammed Abdallah, an inhabitant of Kafr el-Dawar.
	   Some people tore their clothes into bandages to staunch the
bleeding of the wounded, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency
reported.
	   But there were angry scenes outside the local hospital where
police armed with automatic rifles kept relatives at bay.
	   ``I just want to ask about my family,'' yelled one man at an
officer.
	   ``Don't drive me crazy. I have my orders not to let anyone in,''
the officer shouted back.
	   Taxi driver Saleh said residents were already running a rescue
operation when central government authorities arrived and told them
not to interfere.
	   ``They brought in central security forces to beat us up instead
of having them donate blood like the rest of us,'' Saleh said.
	   A senior railway official, Mahmoud Marei, said the driver was
speeding because free-riding passengers had tampered with the
brakes system between the cars, the news agency reported.
	   It is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on the roof and
between the carriages of such commuter trains.
	   Egyptian railways have suffered a series of accidents in the
past four years. The most serious was in December 1995 when one
train crashed into another in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people
and injuring 76.

	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ Prodded by U.S. mediation at the
highest levels, Middle East peace negotiations were extended until
Monday after they stalled over key elements of a land-for-peace
deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Eager to nail down a deal, President Bill Clinton and members of
his administration worked well into the evening for a second
consecutive day and extended the difficult talks for at least one
more day.
	   But a senior U.S. official, steering clear of any claims of
progress or optimism, said on condition of anonymity that he did
not think the extension necessarily enhanced prospects for
resolving some of the knotty issues.
	   Nonetheless, the administration appealed to the two sides to
find the ``political will'' to settle issues that have generated 19
months of stalemate and extended the talks past Sunday's projected
conclusion.
	   ``It is in the best interest of the peace process and the
discussions we have been having,'' State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said Sunday evening in announcing that the Israeli and
Palestinian delegations would remain overnight at the secluded
summit retreat and that there ``almost certainly'' would be talks
on Monday.
	   The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which
Israel would exchange territory for tougher action by the
Palestinian Authority to prevent terror strikes against Israelis.
Diplomatic sources said completing a final deal could take weeks or
longer.
	   Clinton met over lunch with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for an hour and 45 minutes, then strolled along the Wye
River.
	   In early evening, Clinton turned to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, meeting with him in the president's quarters for an hour.
	   The president took a one-hour dinner break with his staff then
was meeting with Arafat later in the evening and was expecting to
speak with Netanyahu by telephone or in person afterwards. But
Lockhart said there was no indication a three-way meeting of the
three leaders was in the works for Sunday night.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell sharply against the Japanese
yen Monday morning as worries about the American economy gained the
upper hand over those about Japan's. Tokyo stock prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 114.31 yen as of late morning, down 2.13 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its New York level of
115.25 yen late Friday.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 299.15
points, or 2.25 percent, to finish the morning session at 13,579.69
points. On Friday, the key index closed up 285.17 points, or 2.19
percent.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar fell on heightened
worries about the future of the American economy, dealers said.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve's surprise move last week to cut two
key short-term interest rates was an attempt to encourage spending
and consumer confidence, but it had the effect of renewing worries
about the domestic economy, they said.
	   In announcing the rate cuts on Thursday, the Fed said it was
worried about ``growing caution'' by lenders and unsettled
conditions in financial markets.
	   Pessimism about the U.S. economy and expectations that the
Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again helped weigh down the
dollar. Lower interest rates tend to push a nation's currency down.
	   ``Financial market confusion in the U.S. will likely continue
for some time,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign
exchange at ABN Amro Bank in Tokyo. ``As long as there is
instability, there will be dollar-selling pressure.''
	   Tokyo share prices started higher following the passage of bank
reform legislation last Friday, but analysts said the rise may be
limited because of worries that some banks might balk at accepting
public funds.
	   Requirements for restructuring and management accountability are
attached to the pool of money of up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 524.9
billion) under the package of bills.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 18.08 points, or 1.80 percent, to 1,024.76
points. The TOPIX closed up 26.57 points, or 2.71 percent, on
Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.880 percent from Friday's finish of 0.865 percent,
driving its price down to 108.19 yen from 108.33 yen.

African development conference opens in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economic problems will not interfere with
its efforts to spur development in Africa, Japan's prime minister
told a conference on reducing poverty Monday.
	   Premier Keizo Obuchi spoke at the Second Tokyo International
Conference on African Development, which will focus on education,
the role of women, agricultural development and private-sector
investment.
	   The gathering comes as Japan is grappling with its deepest
recession since the end of World War II. Unemployment and
bankruptcy debt are at record highs and the financial system is
hobbled by bad debt.
	   ``Japan is faced with a severe financial situation,'' Obuchi
said. ``But we will continue to take initiatives to aid Africa.''
	   The conference, which follows one held five years ago in Tokyo,
brought together representatives from 82 countries and 40
international organizations.
	   Obuchi said Japan will extend financial and technical support
for a plan to send 2,000 people from African countries for training
in Asia in the next five years, Kyodo News reported. Japan
currently accepts 1,000 people a year for technical training.
	   Japan will also work toward an Asia-Africa business forum to
spur private-sector investment in Africa, he said.
	   Japan also plans to support the ``self-help'' efforts of African
countries and urge other developed nations to help solve or prevent
regional conflicts in Africa, Obuchi said.
	   Participants in the conference include U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan and the leaders of Swaziland, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana,
Djibouti, Mozambique, Botswana, Benin, Malaysia and Japan.
	   The conference is expected to issue an ``Agenda for Action'' on
Wednesday aimed at halving the number of people living in absolute
poverty by 2015 through economic growth and sustainable
development.
	   The event is jointly hosted by the Japanese government, the
United Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa, an informal
forum for dialogue among developed and developing countries.

Chile dispatches envoy to Britain to press for Pinochet's release

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The Chilean government has dispatched a
prominent diplomat to London, hoping he can persuade British
authorities to release former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
custody.
	   The envoy, Santiago Benadava, will press Chile's claim that
Pinochet is protected from arrest by diplomatic immunity. Britain
has rejected the claim, saying Pinochet's diplomatic passport did
not shield him from questioning by a Spanish judge.
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the envoy would offer
Pinochet only diplomatic advice. Any courtroom counsel Pinochet may
eventually require must be arranged by the former leader's family,
he said.
	   The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at the request of a
Spanish magistrate who is investigating the deaths of unidentified
Spanish citizens during the former leader's often harsh 17-year
rule. He was recovering from back surgery at a London clinic at the
time of his arrest.
	   Pinochet's family issued a statement Sunday in Chile calling the
arrest ``an insult'' and thanking the government, rightist
politicians and the military for their support.
	   The former leader's son, Augusto, has said his family would hire
``the best legal team available in London'' to represent his
father, who has a lifetime seat in Chile's senate.
	   Several right-wing politicians, including some who held posts in
the Pinochet regime, also were flying to London to show their
support to their former boss.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei said the request by Spanish
magistrate Sebastian Garzon that triggered Pinochet's arrest was
tantamount to not recognizing Chile's institutions.
	   ``Spain also lived under an authoritarian for 40 years and many
of its present institutions are inherited from that regime,'' Frei
said in Porto, Portugal, where he was attending the Ibero-American
Summit. ``What would happen if we were to disrespect those Spanish
institutions?''
	   ``Would a Chilean court be allowed to start trial for abuses
that occurred under the Spanish authoritarian regime?'' of
Francisco Franco, which ended in 1975, Frei asked. ``It is only for
Chilean courts to try events that occurred in Chile.''
	   According to a government report issued after Pinochet left
office, 4,299 political opponents were killed or disappeared during
his rule.
	   At least 12 lawsuits have been filed in Chile against Pinochet
by relatives of victims. But his diplomatic immunity as a senator
and a 1978 amnesty law issued by his regime has so far enabled him
to skirt any response.
	   The Spanish government has 40 days from the time of Friday's
arrest to submit a formal extradition request. If Spain files the
request, then the final decision on extradition rests with Home
Secretary Jack Straw.
	   The Chilean capital was the scene of dueling demonstrations on
Sunday, reflecting the long-standing division of public opinion
over Pinochet.
	   A crowd of about 1,000 Pinochet supporters rallied for the
second straight day in front of the British and Spanish embassies.
	   The rallies were mostly peaceful, although riot police used tear
gas and water cannons on some protesters trying to break through
police lines into the British embassy on Sunday evening. No arrests
or injuries were reported.
	   Also Sunday, scores of demonstrators celebrating Pinochet's
detention joined a march to Santiago's central cemetery for a
ceremony in memory of the victims of Pinochet's government.

Ex-Japan bank officials escape prison terms in racketeer scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Six former officials at one of Japan's top banks
avoided prison terms Monday for their roles in a payoff scandal
that rocked the nation's financial world, media reported.
	   The six, among 11 former Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank executives
indicted for dealing with a self-confessed racketeer, received
prison terms of up to eight months. But the punishments were
suspended for up to three years provided they stay out of trouble.
	   A spokesman for the Tokyo District Court refused to confirm the
sentences.
	   Presiding judge Kiyoshi Kimura told the court that the six
conspired with other Dai-Ichi Kangyo officials to provide illegal
payments to racketeer Ryuichi Koike in exchange for making the
bank's shareholders' meetings go smoothly, Kyodo News service
reported.
	   Corporate racketeers, known as ``sokaiya'' in Japan, buy token
shares in companies and solicit cash payments by threatening to
disrupt shareholder meetings. Dealing with sokaiya is illegal.
	   The former executives were found guilty of involvement in
extending part of some 11.7 billion yen (dlrs 101 million) in
illegal loans to Koike through a Dai-Ichi Kangyo affiliate between
July 1994 and September 1996, Kyodo said.
	   The six included Kenji Tanaka, 60, a former senior managing
director and Hiroshima Inotsume, 56, a former managing director.
	   Monday's ruling was the first involving Dai-Kangyo Bank in the
scandal. Five other former bank executives, including former
chairman Tadashi Okuda, are still on trial.

Yankees 9, Padres 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wonder no more why these New York Yankees are so
special.
	   From the very first inning, El Duque and Co. demonstrated for
all _ particularly the Padres _ how they've won 123 games and
staked their claim as the greatest team in baseball history.
	   Orlando Hernandez dominated on the mound, Bernie Williams and
Jorge Posada homered to lead a relentless attack and Yankees
fielding sparkled Sunday night in a 9-3 romp over San Diego for a
2-0 lead in the World Series.
	   After winning Game 1 by playing home-run derby, the Yankees
showed off their whole potent package in Game 2. The Padres never
had a chance, with rookie Ricky Ledee's RBI single making it 7-0 in
the third and chasing ill starter Andy Ashby.
	   That was more than plenty for Hernandez, the Cuban defector who
floated to freedom less than 10 months ago and helped save New
York's season with a win in Game 4 of the AL championship series.
	   Exactly a year after his younger half-brother, Livan Hernandez,
pitched Florida past Cleveland in Game 1 on his way to becoming MVP
of the World Series, the quirky El Duque shut down San Diego on one
run in seven innings.
	   By the time Posada's two-run homer in the fifth made it 9-1, the
sellout crowd of 56,692 was going crazy while several Padres
players were standing with heads down and hands on hips.
	   The Padres face a tough task in trying to regroup for Game 3 on
Tuesday night at San Diego. David Cone will start for New York
against NLCS MVP Sterling Hitchcock, a former Yankees pitcher _ of
the previous 44 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the Series, 33 have won
the championship.
	   San Diego's best opportunity came in the first. Tony Gwynn got
his fourth hit of the series and Greg Vaughn walked, but right
fielder Paul O'Neill made a leaping catch as he crashed into the
wall on Wally Joyner's drive for the final out.
	   From then on, it was all Yankees. Williams hit his ninth career
postseason homer and Ledee, a rookie playing with exceptional
poise, enjoyed his second straight night of getting two hits and a
walk.
	   Actually, Ashby could have had a 1-2-3 bottom of the first with
any luck. But on a night when he had a sore throat and felt poorly,
he got no help.
	   Chuck Knoblauch's foul pop was dropped near the screen by
sliding catcher Greg Myers _ it was correctly ruled no play _ and
then the leadoff man exemplified the Yankees' patience at the
plate, drawing an eight-pitch walk.
	   One out later, O'Neill slapped a grounder at three-time Gold
Glove third baseman Ken Caminiti. Despite having plenty of time,
Caminiti rushed his throw and it was too high for Joyner, an error
that enabled Knoblauch to score.
	   Chili Davis and Scott Brosius added RBI singles and even though
all three runs were unearned, they counted. The Padres even looked
shaky getting the last out of the inning, when second baseman
Quilvio Veras dropped Posada's line drive and made a poor throw
barely in time.
	   Williams' two-run homer highlighted a three-run third. Tino
Martinez and Brosius, who each had three of the Yankees' 16 hits,
singled to set up Ledee's RBI single in the third.
	   That was all for Ashby, and it wasn't until reliever Brian
Boehringer pitched a scoreless fourth that Padres pitchers retired
even two batters in a row.
	   Hernandez, meanwhile, set down 10 straight batters in the middle
innings. With his navy blue socks pulled high, his unusual array of
motions and pitches tamed hitters who had never faced him.
	   The Padres shuffled their lineup, sending seven left-handed
hitters against the righty Hernandez. It did no good, as El Duque
struck out seven and gave up six hits.
	   Mike Stanton relieved to start the eighth and San Diego scored
twice. Pinch-hitter Ruben Rivera, cousin of Yankees closer Mariano
Rivera, hit an RBI double and scored on pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney's
single.

Man shot dead in latest incident of Macau violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ A man was found shot to death in his car in Macau,
apparently the latest in a string of slayings linked to casino
payoffs in the Portuguese enclave, police said Monday.
	   The victim, initially indentified only by the surname Wu, was
shot three times on Sunday night, police said. Wu, in his 30s, was
believed to work for a gang-controlled gambling ring.
	   Police said they had no immediate suspects in the killing.
	   Macau, a popular gambling and tourist spot at the tip of south
China, has been hit recently with gangland-style shootings, arson
and other attacks that this year have killed six people, including
three government officials.
	   Police have blamed the violence on Chinese gangs, called triads,
who are fighting over payoffs from casinos whose profits have been
shrinking because of Asia's economic downturn.
	   The violence prompted China to announce last month that it will
send an elite detachment of soldiers to try to halt the violence
after Macau reverts to Chinese rule next year.
	   Beijing said the troops will protect social order and maintain
economic development in the territory, located 40 miles (64
kilometers) west of Hong Kong.

Forty seven companies could be booted from Thai stock exchange
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Forty-seven troubled companies are in
danger of being delisted by the Stock Exchange of Thailand unless
they raise new capital by January, a local newspaper reported on
Monday.
	   In July, the exchange announced that companies with negative net
worth will be delisted starting in January unless they can find new
funds or investors to shore up their balance sheets, according to
the Bangkok Post.
	   Scores of Thai companies have watched their financial status
plummet along with the country's currency, the baht, since it was
floated in July 1997, triggering a regional economic crisis.
	   Many firms had taken out loans in foreign currencies to fund
expansion when the economy was booming. But as the baht fell, the
value of loans inflated, pushing many to the point of bankruptcy.
	   The Post reported that 20 of the 47 firms have rehabilitation
plans that are underway.
	   Some of the companies include: Alphatec, a computer chip maker
once regarded as one of the country's cutting-edge technology
firms; financial firms Union Bank, Laem Thong Bank, Siam City Bank
and International Finance Corporation of Thailand; Swedish Motors,
which manufactures Volvo cars, NTS Steel and Bumrungrad Hospital.

South African fruit canner Del Monte eyeing Thai companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South African fruit canner Del Monte
Royal Foods Ltd. is considering investing in four Thai pineapple
companies to form a production base in the country, news reports
said Monday.
	   Del Monte wants to invest in pineapple plants, with an eventual
expansion to pineapple plantations, The Nation newspaper said.
	   The company is targeting firms that have liquidity problems and
will go for full acquisition or joint-venture investment, according
to the Bangkok Post.
	   Del Monte controls 35 percent of world pineapple supplies,
according to both papers.
	   The Post quoted Del Monte Chairman Vivian Iverman as saying, ``I
want to make Thailand the same size as in the Philippines, where we
employ about 7,000 people. I would be disappointed if we were
unable to achieve that level of success.''
	   The reports said Iverman met with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
last week during a visit to Thailand to discuss the company's
requirements for investment, specifically control of the production
process.
	   In addition to Thailand, the company also has interest in
expanding to Malaysia and Indonesia, according to the reports.

	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ Prodded by U.S. mediation at the
highest levels, Middle East peace negotiations were extended until
Monday after they stalled over key elements of a land-for-peace
deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Eager to nail down a deal, President Bill Clinton and members of
his administration worked well into the evening for a second
consecutive day and extended the difficult talks for at least one
more day.
	   But a senior U.S. official, steering clear of any claims of
progress or optimism, said on condition of anonymity that he did
not think the extension necessarily enhanced prospects for
resolving some of the knotty issues.
	   Nonetheless, the administration appealed to the two sides to
find the ``political will'' to settle issues that have generated 19
months of stalemate and extended the talks past Sunday's projected
conclusion.
	   ``It is in the best interest of the peace process and the
discussions we have been having,'' State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said Sunday evening in announcing that the Israeli and
Palestinian delegations would remain overnight at the secluded
summit retreat and that there ``almost certainly'' would be talks
on Monday.
	   The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which
Israel would exchange territory for tougher action by the
Palestinian Authority to prevent terror strikes against Israelis.
Diplomatic sources said completing a final deal could take weeks or
longer.
	   Clinton met over lunch with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for an hour and 45 minutes, then strolled along the Wye
River.
	   In early evening, Clinton turned to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, meeting with him in the president's quarters for an hour.
	   The president took a one-hour dinner break with his staff, then
met with Arafat again for an hour and 20 minutes and telephoned a
report to Netanyahu. But White House spokesman Joe Lockart said
there was no indication a three-way meeting of the three leaders
was in the works for Sunday night.

Hyundai selected as successful bidder for bankrupt Kia Motors

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Outbidding Ford Motor Co. and domestic
competitors, Hyundai Motor Co. was tentatively selected Monday as
the winner in an auction to take over bankrupt Kia Motors Corp.
	   The selection of Hyundai, South Korea's No. 1 car maker,
however, is subject to approval by creditor banks, who have made no
secret of their hope that cash-rich Ford would win the auction.
	   Hyundai's bid beat offers by Ford Motor Co. of the United States
and two local companies, Daewoo Motors Co. and Samsung Motors Inc.,
Kia officials said.
	   Kia's collapse last year was widely believed to have triggered
South Korea's economic crisis, forcing the country to call in the
International Monetary Fund to bail out its economy.
	   The government had backed Ford in the hope it would pump much
needed hard currency into South Korea's faltering economy and boost
foreign investor confidence.
	   South Korean media widely reported even before Monday's
announcement that creditor banks would reject selection of a local
firm to take over Kia.
	   But Kia officials said Ford, the only foreign bidder, was
disqualified because it offered to buy the stock of Kia's
commercial vehicle arm, Asia Motors, at a price lower than their
face value of 5,000 won (dlrs 3.78).
	   ``After a comprehensive study of the bidding documents, Hyundai
has been selected as the primary successful bidder and Daewoo as
the alternative successful bidder,'' Kim Jong-dae, Kia's caretaker
manager, announced at a news conference.
	   Kim said the selection of Hyundai was made by two neutral,
outside firms _ Anderson Consulting Co. of the United States and
Banque Nationale de Paris of France.
	   Kia officials said Hyundai submitted the best combination of
requested debt reductions and stock price bids for Kia and Asia
Motors.
	   Without giving any reasons, Kia officials said they decided not
to disclose details of the auction, including debt write-offs. The
auction was the third since August
	   ``Now, it's up to creditor banks whether to award the bidding to
Hyundai or Ford,'' Lee Jong-dae, Kia's chief planning official,
said.
	   The national Yonhap news agency, quoting unidentified sources,
said creditor banks have reservations about the amount of debt
write-off demanded by Hyundai.
	   In two previous failed auctions, creditor banks offered to write
off dlrs 2.1 billion of Kia dlrs 8.4 billion debt. But the
potential buyers all demanded further debt reduction.
	   ``It's no secret that creditors want Ford to take over Kia,''
said Ji Seung-chul, an analyst at LG Securities Co. ``Creditors
want an early debt payment, which makes Ford the best contender.''

rescued after the sinking around midnight Sunday.
	   The area is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the capital,
